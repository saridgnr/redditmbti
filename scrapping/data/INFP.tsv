1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 04	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
7	My dudes. Noise canceling headphones are the best thing ever invented for INFP's. An absolute must if you live in a crowded city surrounded by noise all the time. It's glorious. I love them so much.
3	Will I ever feel satisfied with anything?
2	It's actually so incredibly hard for me to go from the acquaintance phase to friend/good friend phase, especially now in school. Like wtf? How do I do it? Never feels like people are interested.
491	This was me... Nah, it is still me.	
43	I understand this. I'd often just want to be by myself during recess.\n\nAt the same time learning to socialize is a good skill to have. So the teacher isn't wrong to push that either.
14	It's funny. I didn't see these pics depicting school recess. I saw my highly-extroverted mother dragging me outside to play with the neighborhood kids, most of whom were mean. My elementary school teachers let me stay inside at recess and cut out letters for the bulletin board. :)
5	Anybody know who the artist is?
6	When I was like six I got kicked out of the school library once because it was recess time... I still think about it sometimes.
3	I used to get yelled at for staying inside reading than playing with my cousins outside.
2	That was me in kindergarten with Legos.
2	This was me pretty much all through high school. I‚Äôd skip lunch everyday and go hangout in a teachers room and just read. 
2	I didn‚Äôt have many friends in primary school and when they were busy at lunchtime I‚Äôd sit by myself on the fields daydreaming. \n\nAdults would always come up to me and try and talk to me- I appreciated the gesture but when I told them I was ‚Äòjust thinking‚Äô it was the truth, and I was happy doing it. 
2	This is still accurate as an adult. 
1	Japan 1936 ?
1	My Mother says this was me at nursery. Never changed!
1	Me too üòä
61	Found this gem on a yt video	
8	[Full poem by Kara Douglas, "What Do I Want?"](http://dechar.tripod.com/p-what-want.html)
7	So perfect
3	This is why my brain is a mess 
2	Clouldn't agree more!
2	Wow that last line, right to the bone \*shivers\*
1	Yeah that. That's how I feel. Cut. Print. We're done.
5	It is the darkness that makes the light seem bright to our tired eyes	
1	I love that caption. Are you a writer?
14	Do you guys get bullied pretty easily?	Not really a serious post I'm just curious because in my circle of friends I'm always the one who gets teased or made fun of. I know they don't mean it, they're my close friends. They just really really like how I react when they tease me. I always get flustered and they like how I just completely ignore it. Do you guys feel like that they take advantage of your personality? Because I usually just shove off any conflicts and take it all to myself than letting it out.\n\nDon't get me wrong! I still love my friends despite all of these because it all leads to fun and bonding hehe I'm just overthinking stuff
3	Honestly if your friends are doing something that you don't like please tell them that you dislike this behaviour. Please place boundaries, I know it is difficult to do this, but you will be so much happier in the end and if they don't change. This may be difficult but it may be a sign that they're not worth your time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I can relate to this a lot ! My friends are also like this and my personality is also similar to yours I usually just ignore those comments and they don‚Äôt bother me because I know they‚Äôre not serious . Of course if a stranger would straight up tell me something like that I‚Äôd form a reaction lol . Either way I think it‚Äôs depending on the person if it doesn‚Äôt bother me then I feel no need in taking action then again i feel like if it ever goes too far I should take action and speak up for myself . 
2	Yes I was always usually the punching bag of the group. Or I become the one that people come to for favors (occasionally outrageous or unreasonable ones)\nI say ‚Äòwas‚Äô because my circle of friends is small now. It‚Äôs made me very distrustful and guarded around people. A few days ago I wrote about having an unapproachable resting bitch face and this is one of the reasons, to be honest.\n\nOf course, I am NOT encouraging other INFPs to become this way
1	Yes. My personality is such that I like to be zany and express myself as kind of dumb. I am, however, a member of MENSA so this is undoubtedly the wrong perception of me. So it goes.
1	In my current group of friends, I've actually noticed that I'm treated very gently when it comes to the bullying among friends, which kind of bothers me in itself. I was indirectly bullied by people who actually meant it quite a bit in middle and high school though.
1	Yeah I totally have this, any friendship group I end up a part of it's always me that gets the most picked on and teased, most the time I see it as more endearing, if I wasn't liked by people I don't think I'd get teased as much, but occasionally it does get pretty exhausting when you're the one constantly picked on.
1	No.  I'm assertive and won't take crap from people.  Among people I know, I'm just not fun to bully or tease because I don't take things personally.  Because I don't mind if they say things, there is little fun to be had by the others (because getting a reaction is the point of teasing).
1	I actually don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm one of the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù ones. Although I‚Äôm introverted and always skip parties xd\n\nBut people say that one can‚Äôt hate me cause I have a nice personality..  don‚Äôt know if I believe that tho! Haha
628	Shy buyer.	
38	And then if an employee asks me if I need help, I lie and say no.
24	I do this legit and then in the total end when I still haven‚Äôt found it cause I‚Äôm just a goofy ass then I mentally prepare myself for 20 more minutes to ask someone
19	It's honestly easier when you just push through and ask. It's such a tiny thing, the anxiety is mostly in your head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy issue is that I often ask for things when they happen to be within a 5 foot radius of where I was standing when I asked... there are so many damn things!
6	I like to stare at fancy yogurth glass cups.
2	Word. 
2	istp, same goes, except i hate asking for help in general
2	I do this when the thing could be expensive and I'm not prepared to get it at the shop. While one is not obliged to buy simply because one was assisted by a salesperson, it kinda feels like dashing the hopes of the salesperson, especially when there's a sales commission involved, or wasting their time. Of course I may be projecting, and it's their job to help you and to manage their own expectation.\n\n40 min is a bit too long to not ask for help and still keep searching though.
0	I'm sorry, I don't mean any offense by this but I find this a total waste of time and completely illogical.\nI'd be thinking of everything else I need to do and then just say to myself: "Well the sooner I ask the person over there who's job it is to know what I'm looking for *and tell us customers where things are* , the sooner I can go and get on with my day."

1	This was me before EMDR therapy.
20	Passion Crisis	I'm currently in school, next year most of my friends are off to Uni. I'm having a crisis because I have no passions. I have no plans, and when I look for options and hear people say 'What are you passionate about' I can't help but get totally stressed out about it.\nI have no passion. I'm not talented in any creative and am doing chemistry and biology. I'm now in the situation where I feel completly stuck. I don't know what i want to do. Is there any advice you have for me/ job ideas for an infp.
6	Hey don‚Äôt worry I had the same problem in high school, I ended up at a liberal arts university and basically just did loads of different classes and ended up somehow in a philosophy class fell in love from that day forward and basically can‚Äôt really imagine myself doing anything else really and it was only after the fact that I realize how much sense it made Caus I‚Äôve always loved history and big complicated ideas rather than details. So really don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm a 100% sure you will find something you love to do it just takes a lot of time. I recommend you look into something that is not corporate structure orientated, I find this kind of settings really alienating and unbearable, so maybe something like Teaching (university level, school level whatever you prefer), social worker for adopted children, basically anything where you can physically see some objectively moral good things happening around you, maybe even psychology but I definitely DO NOT recommend marketing or just business/economics diplomas in general, very dehumanizing and alienating subjects imo. 
5	Practice keeping a still mind. Perhaps adopt meditation if you don‚Äôt already. Don‚Äôt push the issue and back off it a bit in your mind. I find the answers I am seeking show up in that little space I give myself. Good luck, I‚Äôm cheering for you.ü§üüèº
4	So if I read you correctly, you are graduating this year and haven't planned what you're doing after you graduate? But you're not sure because you don't know what you're truly interested in? Just take a breath, it's okay not to be sure at this point. Many people fall into their career paths, others are more "fixed", we all approach it differently :)\n\nI would use the time you have this year to go and\n\n1. Do something on your own, feel the challenge and motivation of being truly independent, like travel, or do a personal project (the project you select, will probably be in an area you are naturally interested and good at). Ideal if you can make some money for your savings and use that to do some more things that are 100% independent and tap into you Ne, helping you to explore new things. Like travelling, volunteering etc.\n2. Let me keep it KISS for you around the "General" skill areas. You may have an idea of what 'generally' sounds interesting to you. They mostly all fit under very few categories and you can upskill and shift throughout your life so it's not 100% essential you just pick one speciality: **Business** (marketing, data/analytics, business operations, finance/accounting, customer service, logistics/inventory management, HR and compliance, accounting, production line/supply chain), **Creative** (graphic design, art, music, creative director, videographer, editor, architect), **Tech** (software engineering, product management, ops, user experience design, UI design, QA analyst or tester, hardware engineering, production manager), **Engineering** (civil, environmental, mechanical etc), **Science** (research, teaching, technician, engineering), **Maths** (statistician, data analyst, data scientist, data visualiser etc), **Community services** (social work, community worker, youth worker, age care worker, assessment officer, recovery worker, community engagement, grant developer etc), **Administration** (office manager, office assistant, secretary, reception etc), **Legal and crime** (lawyer, clerk, legal assistant, court support, correctional officer, police officer, detective, criminologist etc), **Health** (nurse, doctor, GP, surgeon, lab tech, psychologist, psychiatrist, nutritionist, physiotherapist, massage therapist, dietician, recovery worker, fitness coach etc), **Education** (teacher, researcher and lecturer, facilitator, trainer, public speaker, trainer, group trainer, coach), **Sales** (customer service, client relationship manager, business manager, customer journey manager, client services director), **Trades** (plumber, manual labour, gardener, handy man, construction, installer and maintenance, metal worker, wood worker etc)\n3. Start dappling and see what you enjoy. And remember to breathe! :)
2	I don't suppose you like to write? There's a good market for medical writers with degrees in the life sciences. Medical writing includes a wide range of projects, from penning healthcare advertising copy to writing clinical study reports and grant proposals. Some jobs in the field require advanced degrees, but others do not. 
1	If you are in primary school, just follow your interest in chemistry and biology.  You'll find work that matters to you later.  You can't be passionate about things you don't know about, so go out and explore different topics or activities.  Eventually something might catch your fancy.  So just *do*, whatever it is.  Some things will turn out to be duds, others will be interesting.  It's all part of finding your way.
3	I‚Äôm almost 21, still a virgin, and feel like the only way to fix it is to fundamentally change myself. What is so wrong with me?	I feel like I‚Äôm gonna sound like some bitter incel writing all this, but honestly I try my very best not to fall into that toxic mindset. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm owed a relationship from anyone, but it just feels so shitty watching people all around me find love (or at least sex) effortlessly, whereas the only advice I‚Äôm ever given is ‚Äòimprove yourself‚Äô. Most people I know haven‚Äôt had to jump through hoops just to get someone to care about them. Relationships are something that just kinda happen for most people, so what the fuck is so wrong with me that no matter how hard I try improve myself, nobody gives a fuck?\n\nHaving said that, I realise the world isn‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows and I do have to work at it. I get I‚Äôm not the most outwardly attractive dude. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, skinny (before anyone suggests the gym, I‚Äôve been there and done that, no amount of muscle mass cures the fact that people don‚Äôt really find me attractive and I have no self-confidence), and honestly just look like a little nerd. I still take pride in my appearance though, I‚Äôm not some unhygienic neckbeard expecting people to fall for me even though I put no effort in. I buy good clothes that fit me well, I have good hygiene, i even get my eyebrows done for God‚Äôs sake. I‚Äôd say I look a lot more attractive than a couple of years back. I try my best in class, I read in my spare time, I‚Äôm pretty outgoing and friendly with everyone I meet, and while there‚Äôs been a couple of flirtations here and there, it‚Äôs never anything that goes anywhere. \n\nMy real issue is my lack of self-confidence. I think people focus too much on confidence: I know it works, I know people who are not conventionally attractive in the slightest who hook up with people all the time because they‚Äôre pretty cocky. But I think as long as you‚Äôre attractive enough you can get away with not being outwardly confident; plenty of shy people get into relationships all the time. But a shy guy who‚Äôs not exactly killing it in the looks department like me? It‚Äôs basically a no go. I don‚Äôt want to fake myself into being some overly cocky dude who hits on anything with a pulse. Sure I might get laid a few times, but along the way I‚Äôm sure a few girls would be creeped the fuck out, and I don‚Äôt want that at all. Don‚Äôt get me wrong either, I‚Äôm not a socially awkward mess who can‚Äôt talk to the opposite sex: I have plenty of girl friends, most girls just tend to view me as like this non-sexual being though. I get along great with them, but I don‚Äôt have the confidence you need to sit and flirt with someone, push the boundaries here and there and build up that tension. It just feels awkward as fuck to me and like I‚Äôm acting out of character. I just end up coming off to people like a completely harmless little dude who is good fun to be around, but who the thought of having sex with makes them double up laughing. I‚Äôm still awkward and self-conscious enough though where, on the very rare occasion someone does seem to be flirting with me, I get fucking terrified and shut it down, or think it‚Äôs some big joke, or any other rationalisation as to why anyone would want to flirt with me of all people.\n\nEssentially if someone is giving me any kind of attention, I tend to read every little thing they do as potentially being flirty, which gets me stuck in my head too much. But the very second someone is flirting with me and there‚Äôs no other way of interpreting it? I freak the fuck out. I‚Äôve had girls way out of my league flirt with me and I‚Äôve found ways to stop it in its tracks, only to kick myself for it later on. Again, that‚Äôs an extreme rarity though, which makes it even worse when I don‚Äôt have the guts to do anything. My brain just genuinely cant comprehend someone being attracted to me, even though it‚Äôs what I think about most of the time. My friends all know I‚Äôm a virgin, and all relentlessly tease me since I‚Äôm the only one not in a relationship. It is so constant that even their girlfriends will join in. They all find the whole thing fucking hilarious, but I don‚Äôt think they realise how much it gets me down. My self-confidence is already basically non-existent, but that just drags it down further. And the thing is, by making my sex life into such a laughing stock, it basically means any girl we meet instantly knows going anywhere near me is just a complete joke. \n\nRecently I‚Äôve even tried Tinder and stuff, and got way more matches than I ever thought I would (about 50 or so maybe in a month), but I have no idea how the fuck to flirt with anyone on there, it feels weird as hell. Most people don‚Äôt reply to the first message anyway lmfao. A couple of times it‚Äôs led to sexting or whatever, but again that‚Äôs very rare. There was one girl who literally told me she wants to hook up with me, offered to pick me up some night and told me to make sure I buy protection, but I completely freaked out about it and didn‚Äôt go through with it. I started asking myself, what the fuck am I doing this for? Am I really gonna lose my virginity in some girl I‚Äôve never met‚Äôs car just to be able to tell people that I‚Äôve had sex? It feels fucking degrading and weird to me. I still have Tinder, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd even go through with hooking up with someone from it. It just doesn‚Äôt feel right losing my virginity in such a weird impersonal way, and I doubt anyone on there wants to be the one to take a guy‚Äôs virginity in some random hook up\n\nSo, rant aside, what the fuck is so wrong with me? Why is it that very few girls ever take an interest in me, and see me as some completely non-sexual entity, and the few that do try to flirt with me I block out? I feel like I‚Äôm my own worst problem, and that I need to shift people‚Äôs opinions of me and make people see me in a different light if I want to get anywhere, but I just have no idea how to do that without acting like someone I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm naturally just a good-natured, slightly awkward guy that has trouble with flirting with people; that‚Äôs what people usually find endearing about me, but it‚Äôs made my romantic life completely non-existent.
1	Wish I could help you man, but you basically described me too :D\n\nI've had one relationship though. It didn't last long, but I wasn't the problem, so I can't have anything useful to say it
1	i wish u all the luck . ive had a multitude of flings but never a long lasting anything . its gotdam depressing!! especially when u feel attached 2 someone to find out they were only using u for the sex . >.> \n\n\nyour friends sound lame as shit. atleast on the making fun of you side of things. i cant stand that shit . " roast " culture or whatever. fuck that. i only stay friends with supportive peeps. \n\nwish i had any advice other than just agreeing with ur post ... just know that i feel u... and that there is hope
3	What makes you feel happy and loved?	I want the guy I am dating to feel happy, loved and secure with me. I just want to make his life the best.
3	When someone else starts the conversation with me or allows me to share my opinion without being cut off. Too often I'll be talking and they'll switch the topic to something pertaining them before letting me finish. Granted we're not dating but as friends I still feel like we should still be able to have good convos
7	This is one of my favorite‚Äã poems, thought you guys might enjoy it	So you want to be a writer\n\n\- Charles Bukowski\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif it doesn't come bursting out of you  \nin spite of everything,  \ndon't do it.  \nunless it comes unasked out of your  \nheart and your mind and your mouth  \nand your gut,  \ndon't do it.  \nif you have to sit for hours  \nstaring at your computer screen  \nor hunched over your  \ntypewriter  \nsearching for words,  \ndon't do it.  \nif you're doing it for money or  \nfame,  \ndon't do it.  \nif you're doing it because you want  \nwomen in your bed,  \ndon't do it.  \nif you have to sit there and  \nrewrite it again and again,  \ndon't do it.  \nif it's hard work just thinking about doing it,  \ndon't do it.  \nif you're trying to write like somebody  \nelse,  \nforget about it.  \nif you have to wait for it to roar out of  \nyou,  \nthen wait patiently.  \nif it never does roar out of you,  \ndo something else.  \n\n\nif you first have to read it to your wife  \nor your girlfriend or your boyfriend  \nor your parents or to anybody at all,  \nyou're not ready.  \n\n\ndon't be like so many writers,  \ndon't be like so many thousands of  \npeople who call themselves writers,  \ndon't be dull and boring and  \npretentious, don't be consumed with self-  \nlove.  \nthe libraries of the world have  \nyawned themselves to  \nsleep  \nover your kind.  \ndon't add to that.  \ndon't do it.  \nunless it comes out of  \nyour soul like a rocket,  \nunless being still would  \ndrive you to madness or  \nsuicide or murder,  \ndon't do it.  \nunless the sun inside you is  \nburning your gut,  \ndon't do it.  \n\n\nwhen it is truly time,  \nand if you have been chosen,  \nit will do it by  \nitself and it will keep on doing it  \nuntil you die or it dies in you.  \n\n\nthere is no other way.  \n\n\nand there never was. 
1	I don't think this poem should be taken very seriously though. And I disagree with it, I simply love the passion and love that this poem exhibits. 
5	I'm sure it's been said before, but I feel like it's overlooked big time in the MBTI community in general: The best relationship you will ever have is with yourself.	Doesn't matter what type they are, none of your other relationships or partnerships will be healthy until you get to know you and start becoming friends with you. Then, you'll almost by magic find yourself attracting the right kind of people and making decent friends with any type.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I feel like INFPs, ENFPs, and possibly ISFPs need to hear this the most. You are super lovable people, so start treating yourself like you are. 
2	This is honestly the truest shit I've ever read. By looking into myself, I've discovered so many interesting and deep parts and it helped me so well in my development of confidence, finally found what is important in life, what my passions are and my pursuit of meaningful relationships is way more effective since I know exactly what I'm looking for (Now finding them is the complicated part lol).
2	Absolutely totally true in my experience! Do you have a story behind this advice?
2	I needed to read this! I‚Äôve been in a few exhausting relationships throughout my 20‚Äôs. Im single now and for the first time in my life I have zero interest in dating. I just booked a trip to Portugal by myself and am excited to relearn and love who I am. 
5	20yo male INFP, what is my purpose in life?	Hello,\n\nI'm a 20 year old INFP. I don't feel like I belong on this planet. The world doesn't make sense, I cannot stop questioning it everyday. Not to sound /r/iamverysmart but it's hard to trust anyone, because it feels like I can read their minds and often people have bad motives (especially when it comes to money and personal gain). I can almost feel other people, like I know what they're thinking and their motives. It feels like no one else ever questions their reality, but maybe they have the same thoughts about everyone else?\n\nWherever I go people look at me and treat me differently to others, e.g. if I walk into a local pub everyone will stare with suspicion. Teachers ignored me at school. I try to be friendly and open but it usually backfires.\n\nI find it impossible to be happy, everyday I wake up all I feel is misery.\n\nI've never met anyone like myself.\n\nI have friends, but I'm a virgin and no girl has ever shown interest in me. I don't feel like a person deserving of that, I'm not interesting, I don't know what I enjoy or who I am. Why would someone be interested in me? I think about suicide daily.\n\nAt the moment I just work and feel tired all the time. I don't like this capitalist and over-consumerist world, it's overwhelming, I feel like it's incompatible with our morality and natural needs. I've saved up enough money to live simply for a few months, I'm tempted to quit my job.\n\nAny help/advise would be much appreciated.
6	I have no idea man, similar position, but let me just tell you one thing: \n\na girlfriend will not solve this, unfortunately, if thats what you are longing for
5	It sounds like you need to seek out spirituality in life. There are a lot of religions that ask that question. Maybe spend some time working out your beliefs and you will come to the answer.\n\nFor me I liked Taoism and Buddhism especially for my spirituality and mental health. Quakerism appeals to me too.
2	> like I know what they're thinking and their motives...  ... if I walk into a local pub everyone will stare with suspicion.\n\nSuspicion is in your mind.  Not only do you suspect others of shady motives, you imagine they do the same to you.  You may be surprised that it is just your perception.  Yes, some people are up to shady doings and some might look at you suspiciously.  However, I'll bet you interpret their expressions to mean something about you, while in reality they don't even notice you.  I have a friend with a hint of paranoia.  She projects a lot of her mindset onto others.  Having been projected upon or known the people onto whom she projects her perspective, it became clear over time that it was just how her mind works.  So she sees it as 'normal' and has no frame of reference to know the different ways other people think.\n\nI'd suspect that all of that is why your friendly and open overtures backfire.  If you have a suspicious mindset, others will notice - just as you notice how they are acting or feeling - and react negatively because they sense suspicion or shady motives.  Can you see how we create our own experience?\n\nCarry it on to girls not being interested.  You say you are neither interesting nor deserving.  So guess what reality results from that belief?\n\nEven if you are an empath and can feel others' emotions, you don't know *why* they feel that way.  You can speculate, but not know.  All you have to go on is how *you* interpret things.  But because you are not them, you are probably wrong to some degree.\n\nI'd recommend keeping your job, or maybe a different one, simply because we get back what we put in to life.  I applaud living simply and disregarding consumerist culture, good for you if you can pull it off.  Less stuff means more attention and energy is available to spend on your spiritual growth, which it sounds like you would value.  If you question reality as a practice, you can learn a lot about yourself.  Do so to justify your beliefs and mindset, you'll just dig yourself into a deeper pit of misery.  Question the very ways you see the world, you may break out and find contentment even if the external parts of your experience hardly change.\n\n>I've never met anyone like myself.\n\nI've had this thought, too.  And I laugh that I'm glad because I'm aware of my bad habits, oddities, and such.  Why would I want to meet someone like me?  I work constantly to get that guy out of my life.
2	I just think you don't appreciate yourself nearly enough you should be. Grab a psychiatrist, get ready to spend lots of money and time with them and believe it will help. We've all been there (I'm not even 19, but I have managed to overcome this) and it's nothing completely new. I know they can help, you just have to find the right one, similarly to wives - nearly every one of them is pretty good, but not all of them are for you, so don't get discouraged. Anyway if you learn to love yourself, you'll solve almost everything. Been there done that, you can believe it, I give you my word. You just need a great teacher and the trust that you can do it. My teacher was fascinating, I'm writing a book to her. It's going to be the best book I've written so far. That's the least I can do to thank her for sharing her infinite knowledge and wisdom ‚ù§\nI wake up knowing life is beautiful. I live for my purpose I found with her - writing. I know I'm not a plumber, doctor, mason or software engineer. And that's okay. Not everyone is made for everything. You just have to do what you love and you'll be happy in life. And the first step to it is learning how to love yourself. 
107	But paradoxically when anyone does invite me to something I ghost them hard.	
9	Yep. Feels like a good idea at first, then you're actaully out and before you know it you're looking for an excuse to bail. 
4	The solution: introverts unite! from the comfort of our own homes!
3	OOF too real
3	Sometimes I go out because I feel like I should socialize, and then I come back home and realize I like my own solitude more.\n\nIt's like, when being by myself feels bad, I go out and socialize, only to remind myself how much I enjoy being by myself.
2	I hate going out with too many people. I hate party‚Äôs and discos. I don‚Äôt like to be outside for too long lol 
1	Recently saw an interesting video about [loneliness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA)
159	Thought you might enjoy my drawing	
10	I love your style! Such a pleasant vibe
3	The fade in the grass is perfect.
3	I love how the railing lines up with the center line of the window. That gets me good. (Also you just earned a follow!)
2	(Pls follow my insta @/iridisorbis if you want to see more!)
2	it's cuteüòäüíï
2	This is a fantastic drawing.
2	It's just so pleasant to look at... I dig, keep at it.
9	Keeping our sh*t together	Do you have personal strategies for dealing with the overwhelming feeling caused by the complex world we live in? If yes, what are they? If not, is it deliberate?\n\nI've come to the realization that since my teenage years, I have researched and developed various strategies for keeping my mind peacefully anchored in the present reality. My greatest tool in finding these strategies is my sensitivity, because I'm quick to notice whether something is good or bad for me. Below are the most important ones for me, in no particular order. As a disclaimer, I'm a male in my mid twenties, and what works for me may not work for you.\n\n* Exercise, namely weightlifting and dancing. As a teen, I did not have a productive outlet for a certain type of 'angst' that builds up over time during everyday life, which led to me being moody and occasionally dump my bad feelings on other people. Over time I've adapted a regular exercise routine, which includes weightlifting and dancing. The pure focus while being under 250 pounds of metal, and pristine flow state while dancing intensely to the music I love, is something for me that flushes my body and mind of a certain negative energy (cortisol?). Being physically tired while on endorphins after the routine is something that gives me great temporary bliss, which I have to keep up, because I start to notice the bad energy buildup if I skip exercise for more than 3 days.\n* Meditation. I've only done this for a year, but the awareness that I've gained into the workings of my own mind has already paid off hugely. I've realized that there is not one unified "me", but rather a collection of different mind processes, each with their own goals and motives. For me the most commons ones are the mind-wanderer, the planner, the dreamer, the worrier, the hedonist, the self-hater. I'm starting to be able to have a productive dialogue with the mind processes I've mentioned. Meditation is not about blocking the unpleasant parts of me, but rather accept them and work with them. For example, if I need to focus on something important right now and the worrier starts talking in my head, I can acknowledge it and make a deal with the worrier to have another discussion later. The self-hater part in me is a result of certain childhood trauma, and when it comes up telling me how no one will ever love me, I'll just tell it: "I appreciate your opinion, but here's some reasons why I disagree with you". The hedonist wants alcohol, fast food and porn, but I'll promptly let them know that that is not the kind of person I want to be. On the contrary, when the situation is right, I'll let the dreamer and planner out to do their work. Over time, the parts that I don't want in my life have gotten more silent, while the parts I like get stronger.\n* Avoiding "hyperstimulants". Our world is filled with natural aspects of life amplified to their extremes. We like sugar and fat, so refined sugar and deep-fried monstrosities lie everywhere. We like sex, which is why it's everywhere in media, advertisements and as porn on the internet. We like attention and social connections, which is why we get addicted to social media. We like information, which is why we are constantly bombarded with piece-meal news feeds we read and forget. What is common with all of these, is that they are essentially empty calories; they give temporary satisfaction and an illusion of nutrition, but ultimately leave me feeling unfulfilled. They also shift the baseline for normalcy, for which the following examples apply: The longer I keep eating refined sugar and saturated fats, the less tasty normal food feels like. The more I watch porn, the less interesting and beautiful regular women seem like. The more I spend time on social media, the less pleasure I get from genuine human interactions. The more I spend time reading shocking news around the world, the less time and energy I have for the information that is actually useful for me. It makes me sad that our world is filled to the brink with these "empty calories" on all aspects of life, but at least we can take proactive measures to greatly limit our exposure to it.\n* What to eat and when. This is highly personal, and what I do will probably not work for you, but I suggest some experimentation in this department. I eat all my food I need to eat during an 8-hour window, then fast for the next 16 hours until the next day (intermittent fasting). I prefer fat, protein, slow carbohydrates and vegetables over fast carbohydrates. The difference between the right and wrong rhythm and nutrition for me is huge; if I'm doing it wrong, I feel cloudy, moody and tired; doing it right, I feel clear and present.\n* Picking my poison. I used to be addicted to lots of things at the same time, namely alcohol, fast food, porn and nicotine (snus, which is a smokeless kind of tobacco). While ideally there would be none, an approach of slow, controlled decline works for me. Now I'm only down to nicotine, and will keep it for an indefinite amount of time, and that is OK. Perfectionism can be a harmful ideal, and it's always good to remember that "good enough is good enough". It's better to have zero addictions than one addiction, but it is definitely better to have only one addiction rather than four of them.\n\nNow it's your turn - let's share some information so that we can learn from each other and better navigate this messy world.
4	Thanks for sharing, its sad that longer posts always end up with few upvotes. 
3	I like to make sure I expose myself to things that are helpful, such as informative or motivating podcasts. I also try to steer away from negative, energy draining things if possible...like browsing political subs. So I guess this may build upon your last point by adding something positive to replace those negative addictions. 
2	Thank you for sharing this insightful post. I'm sure you also have the loving mind process, which is why you share this.
2	> what I do will probably not work for you\n\nSo glad to see this when you mention eating.  Too many people think there are one-size-fits-all dietary recommendations, which is simply not true.  Anyway...\n\nExercise - agreed!  I do yoga, bicycle, and walk.  Used to play footie and trained in karate, too.  We are all about movement of energy, transitioning from yesterday through today to tomorrow - and our physical bodies are part of that, too.  Movement is key.  Clean eating is essential.\n\nMeditation - I practice this sometimes.  I've had a hyperactive mind, so getting to the point of being able to meditate was good.  A helpful resource for me was www.calmdownmind.com in which a man blogged about his personal discovery and reflections on how that unfolded.  It helped me sort through my own patterns and habits and open a door to changing for the better.  Simply looking around while I walk abruptly stops the mind chatter, keeping me present here and now.\n\nEmotions - Not taking things personally has had the biggest impact.  When others are upset or happy or bothered are in any other state, it's about them.  I'm not responsible for them being happy or upset.  I might be responsible for whatever triggered it, and will work to change my habits and become a better human being - but their emotions are their business.  Likewise, my emotions are mine to clean up, not to dump on others.  So when I'm off kilter emotionally, I reflect and meditate to find what is going on and sort it out.\n\nNon-judgment - starting with self.  Extend that to others, as well.  If a thought pops up that *he shouldn't this* or *she should have that*, I remind myself that they have their own path to walk and I am in no position to know what is best for them.
2	I take a walk every day. Not only it's good for my body and gives me time to listen to music (I can't BREATHE without music üòÑ), but it's also THE most valuable and important me-time. You are all introverts, so you know what I'm talking about. In that time I (obviously) reanalyse my thoughts and emotions and I usually write something if a lot of things are on my mind. Writing (read: being productive) makes me motivated and motivation makes me write. I get stuck in that loop and it keeps me in the good mood. I am walking daily so it never stops.
3	What is your experience with psychedelics (LSD, shrooms, DMT)?	As lots of us here are hopeless dreamers and spend every waking second pondering what ifs, and feeling strongly abiut different things, I was just curious to hear anybodys experiences with these substances. \n\nMy experience: After 20 years of daily pondering about, well, all the stuff you guys probably understand, why are we here, whats the point, why is it so cruel, and longing for something more, I somehow gathered the courage to try magic mushrooms despite all the discouragement (mentally ill people should stay away is the general rule). I suffer from major depression, anxiety, OCD, Tourettes, and god knows what else, but those I mentioned are all diagnosed. I ate 3g dried magic mushrooms and had ALL of my mental turmoil disappear in the blink of an eye, and, well, it really was heaven as far as I'm concerned. I felt nothing but bliss and contentment (mind you I have NEVER felt anything even 10% this positively intense before, I've been depressed since I was a child) for about 3 hours. I have never imagined this can be possible with my brain, how could it? The negative thoughts never stopped for 25 years. But somehow this handful of fungi did it just like that. \n\nThe amount of tears of joy I cried that night.. Needless to say I have never cried tears of joy before or after that in my 25+years of life
2	Last time I took a heavy mushroom trip, I took a bath and had an overwhelming sensation that I was in a womb, then I felt like a baby cared for by the universe for a couple hours, it was very positive, it helped with depression for about a month.
2	I also have hella depression/anxiety/diagnosed OCD issues so here goes:\n\nShrooms: Very pleasant, healing, fun. "Spring cleaning of the mind" is my favorite way to describe it. Left me feeling an afterglow for a long time as well. All the weird circuitous habits and hangups dissolve and you enter a restorative state of new wonder that I found very nice. I took them outside on a sunny day.\n\nLSD: Much more head-trippy than shrooms. Rough come-up. Very dependent on environment and people around. Had a nice time listening to music, lots of insane feeling closed eye visuals/morphing going on. Very strange feeling of almost...precognition? A certain connection with the others around you. Lasts a loooong time and does not really share the pleasant afterglow of shroomies.\n\nSalvia: This shit is legal, for some reason. Ranges from giggle-fits to identity-shedding expeditions into other realms.\n\n
1	I was depressed for a couple of years and I tried to kill myself as well a few times. I was lonely, heartbroken and had no goal or direction in life. At that time I was experiencing with drugs and on Reddit I stumbled on multiply posts talking about the use of psychedelics to help with depression. So I told myself I would not kill myself before I gave LSD a chance to help me. The day came when I got some blotters with LSD, I called a friend to look over me while I took it. Afterwards I was left with a purpose, I finally had found meaning in my life. I understood why I had become depressed and how to fix it. It‚Äôs been 2 years now since my first trip and I am really glad I did it. \n\nIt did not cure me, that I have to do myself, but It really helped to get a new perspective on my life. I really hope  and believe psychedelics will be used in therapy in the future, it can help so many. \n\nAlso I am not saying this is for everyone, if you haven‚Äôt done it before and want to do so please educated yourself on the topic, some people have been damaged for life by trying psychedelics.
11	This was my jam back in 2015... One of the Fi-est songs I've ever heard üòÑüòÑ Drop your favourites down there and tell me what you think about this one (don't worry it isn't rickroll, I wouldn't do that to wonderful souls like you üòâ‚ù§)	
2	Love this song! 
2	Wow, this song is actually pretty good. I thought it was a radiohead song in the first part. I can see myself jamming to this. I love the lyrics.
2	this song is great! my favorite is the morning by the weeknd[The Morning - The Weeknd](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir4HfQL4XkQ) 
17	When INFPs *Alone* so hard they spontaneously enter into a relationship with themselves...	
2	I kiss myself in the morning too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: If anyone's interested, apparently this is a short film called Cipher from 1989 and it's on Youtube "Cipher the Video", 40 minutes long.
1	If anyone is curious, yes, the translation it accurate, lol. 
1	This fucking dub bahahhahaha.
3	DAE struggle with social gatherings, specifically family functions?	I strongly dislike attending family functions and have done all that I can to get out of them. I generally don't enjoy the small talk and feel as if much of my family is tolerating my presence and would be just fine without my attendance. I see them often enough and find the frequent functions excessive.\n\nThere's a fine line between social anxiety and introversion, but I don't feel guilty about missing unless someone calls me out. I've  explained my point of  view  and preferences  numerous  times,  but usually just get  called selfish.\n\nam I being unreasonable or is this something common amongst introverts?\n\n
21	INFP males, do you feel like you have to "hold back" when talking to your friend's girlfriends because it's so easy to connect with them?	And sometimes you feel like you might be connecting with them easier and on a deeper level than your friend can so therefore you have to be more avoidant and superficial with her? 
15	Just wish single girls were as eager to speak to me as my bros girls.
8	Yes.  I am naturally drawn to get to know people on a deep level.  Some of my friends simply aren't wired this way.  So yeah.  It happens all the time.  \n\nMy friends know this about me.  They also know I'm very respectful and would never do anything with their girl.  I just make it a point to read the room and back off when I notice my friend is feeling uncomfortable.   \n\nIt also helps to steer the conversation toward how good they are as a couple and positively reinforce their friendship.   
3	Most definitely. Sometimes it happens so naturally I notice that 30 minute sounds have gone by and my guy friends te talking in one room and I‚Äôm with the girls. It‚Äôs strange.
3	I will say that I have indeed always developed an unusually good relationship with my roommate‚Äôs numerous (sigh) girlfriends. I understand the boundaries and I never feel weird or like I should be dating them instead, but it does make me realize that I just have a knack for connecting with people when the setting is more intimate. Like if we aren‚Äôt all in public and playing these games of getting each other‚Äôs attention, I finally get my chance to do what I do best.
3	10000%. If I see them enough , I usually have to hold myself back. Some of my guy friends in the past don't appreciate it because I've been told that I'm filling an emotional void they just don't understand.
2	no my social interaction skills vanished somehow and i have no idea how to keep conversations going interesting for others...\nid love to bond with people, but i somehow cant anymore. too woke for all the normies hahaha\n\nmhh ._.
2	roomies and their girls gotten in fights over that ish before loool . thinkin they were cheating with me. \n\nhell no dawgg i got 2 much respect for that haha 
1	why don't INFPs just... talk to me about things?	the dreaded words you may or may not have expected: I'm an ESTP\n\nI love INFPs despite having few areas to actually connect with them, and honestly our main conflict is just usually that the INFP doesn't communicate their issues/problems\n\nI'm a very accommodating person and like to act as a peacemaker/mediator in my own way, so it's difficult when I want to adjust for someone and they're just... not talking about things\n\nthis isn't specific to any individual INFP, it just kind of relates to all of you, you are really poor at communicating with me, even if you're not with others\n\nI assume it's something about my personality, being that I am basically a cold and blunt weapon, capable of mass destruction without really meaning it\n\nbut man I really love people and I really love INFPs\n\nhow do I encourage the INFPs in my life to understand that communicating with me is okay? or, even better, how do I convince them that I say a lot of stupid things because I can't help not thinking before I speak and things they may perceive as offensive aren't really meant to be?\n\nyou're all beautiful amazing people and I'm not just saying that because I want to bed every single INFP, even though that is also true
3	Have you ever taken the enneagram test? If so, what did you get?	I got 6w5, but admittedly I was pretty depressed at the time so it might not be accurate. 
3	4w5 :)
3	4w5
2	Ive literally written an entire paper on my enneagram but I can't remember it right now
2	9w1.
2	I got 9w1, but I wish I was 7. :)
2	4w5 
5	INFP-T and INFP-A?	I am laid back most of the time but can get submissive and self conscious but also aggressive and assertive... have other infps ‚Äúgrown into‚Äù a mostly A type of mostly T type? I‚Äôm about to graduate high school and wonder if I‚Äôll end up leaning or fully go to a T or A type. Any older infps that are willing to share their growth from high school and their personality?
53	Any other INFP guys feel outcasted?	I feel like people just see me as the 'nice guy' but nothing more, anyone else relate? Like, I try to be helpful but people dont seem to see anything past that.
28	Yeah, same here. \n\nI feel outcasted because of my laid back demeanor, nothing really seems to bother me, and I kind of don't show any real emotions or reactions. I don't think people take me seriously, and no one ever listens to me whenever I talk, even though I end up being right most of the time. It's tough, but you've to learn to be comfortable with yourself. 
13	I do feel outcasted (ie I don‚Äôt really enjoy typical ‚Äúguy‚Äù stuff, I feel much more at ease around female friends, I make a lot more 1-on-1 platonic relationships than with ‚Äúthe boys‚Äù, etc.), but it does give me a sense of personal identity that I cherish deeply. I have my down periods where I feel estranged but other than that I‚Äôm totally content with how unique I am.
11	Not like you described, but yeah, I absolutely feel like an outcast. Between my personality and my incredibly short stature (I have a form of dwarfism) I genuinely feel like an alien living among a different species. 
8	My best friend of 20 years is INFP and he is nice but also charismatic and smart. During the earlier years of our friendship, he is friendly enough with people on the surface level but he hardly let anyone know about him on a deeper level.\n\nWe‚Äôve had rough patches every now and then and I don‚Äôt know why you guys do this but sometimes, in your times of deepest despair, you push your closest friends away. Like why you guys do that? I couldn‚Äôt understand it at first and I was like wtf? You guys (INFP) stopped communicating with your friends and won‚Äôt reply to emails. I and a few of his other close friends were angry and basically we were like mate, if you don‚Äôt want us, it hurts but okay we respect your decision. \n\nAfter a few months, i think I was at home scrolling through my news feed and it said one of his favourite authors was releasing a new book. I was thinking of reaching out to him but given that he ignored all of us and didn‚Äôt reply to any of our messages I was hesitant to do it. After all, who else would want to keep reaching out if your friend stopped giving a fuck about his friends. It took a week before I finally said wth and sent him a message. I told him hey, how you‚Äôve been. I saw author A had a new book. I told myself if he doesn‚Äôt reply I‚Äôm moving on with my life. \n\nHe replied a few hours later and then I called him. Didn‚Äôt get to talk much as I was busy but slowly our messages started becoming longer and longer. When I finally went back to our hometown about two months later, we had a chat. He told me the reason he didn‚Äôt reply to any of our messages was that he didn‚Äôt want us to see him while he‚Äôs at rock bottom. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just him or it‚Äôs what you INFP people usually do but isn‚Äôt the point of having friends are that so they can comfort you when you‚Äôre down? I don‚Äôt know if he was testing us or not to see who would still be there for him even after pushing everyone away but it did sorta work. All our other friends are still his friends but they stayed at that superficial level while we became best friends. 
6	Yup. Have a lot of friends but it feels like I'm the only one who is without a best friend. Eventually, everyone leaves and I'll be here, waiting for a best friend.
5	This is something I've struggled with my whole life. I've come to the resolve that I walk alone but will always have people fall in (or out) of my life. I love discussing this but I'll keep it short, you aren't alone. We will find our happiness, it'll just be a much more intricate path than others.
4	i did 4 a loongg time but just recently started (within th3 past year or so) making friends all over the place!! ive made a serious effort to push my comfort zone and forcing myself 2 get out of the house... i still feel like a total weirdo a lot of the times but... i have a few others 2 chill with :)))
4	I feel I am self outcasted? Since I should go out more. But yea. Once I get into a group I get accepted usually easy. As a weird sometimes quiet and a nice guy. But i think the issue is (for me anyway) there are things I take differently or talk about them differently than other ppl.\n\nLike I know few girls around me think i am not thinking about sex a lot, but its because sex is a natural part of a relationship so mentioning it 24/7 is kinda meh.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is, our view of things can make other ppl think we are different than we are before they get to know us for real. Which can take TIME. ^^
4	Most definitely, today especially. My family came over for dinner. I go to school for directing in theatre and i like makeup and fashion and such (im embarrassed of it, mostly because im a guy and feel as though i cant express it).\n\nBut anyway, my family came over and im the youngest and the only guy in my immediate family so im always the center of jokes. Not only that but i cant relate to them on any aspect of interest.\n\nBut hey, i guess that means i have a way of seeing the world in a way they dont, and i get to have that for myself and no one else.
3	Yeah I do a lot. I think im seen as a nice guy but not someone you'd ever invite to do anything with. I think my problem is I have a hard time opening up to people who aren't really close to me so I tend to not show as much personality as id like to
3	yup, even though I used to have a lot of great friendships in the end I always ended up alone. It's though but I am slowly learning how to be alone, at least I have a lot of time to be creative, work on my little projects that are making me happy. 
2	I dunno if you've watched the green book, but if you have: i feel like Don Shirley during that scene (if you've seen the movie you know which one I'm talking about) where he reveals how much of an outcast he feels. Never feel like I fully belong to a social group. Much easier for me to have one on one interactions/friendships
2	Definitely, I've felt this way for many years. I used to struggle a lot more because I would put others needs before my own and was a people pleaser. \n\nOne of the best skills I learned is how to say no and form boundaries. I used to be busy and stressed all the time, worrying about what others think, meeting social expectations, etc. Trying to be a "nice guy" like you said. However, I was miserable and often taken for granted. \n\nOnce I started saying no, prioritizing my own time and values, life became easier and people began to show more respect. If you create a want in others (for your time, attention, help, etc) then you will be viewed as more valuable. This sounds selfish, but that's how behavior works, motivation is derived from deprivation. \n\nStay strong and value your self worth! 
1	I only ever feel outcasted wheneve I'm near a bunch of other guys, especially if they're talling about stereotypical guy things like cars or sports. I'm usually able to befriend girls really easily though.
1	Yeah. I don't have the "nice" label, but I simply can't make a connection with people. 
46	Mood: infp	
1	How? Why?
2	Personal unimportant rant- I made a decision i regret therefore, i will pay for it tomorrow	I have a chronic Illness that made me drop out of school and I'm not being able to work these days. \n\nI'm going to meet a 13 y.o teen tomorrow for the first time in order to help him somehow- a volunteering organization told me he isn't at school. They asked me what can I help him-> I told them I can help him study-> they told me ok- all of that conversation was on SMS. That's it. No recommendations how to behave according to what situation is the teen in.  \n\nI thought ok sure let's try to make him have more motivation maybe he is depressed or have a chronic Illness. But then today it hit me. I haven't been much to other parts of my town and I have forgotten that there are sketchy buildings with complicated families. \n\nI called back to ask the volunteering organization what do they know about the teen and his family.\n\nThey told me that they are a pretty complicated family.\n\nI should've seen it coming earlier and try to volunteer in a different place. I'm not so social myself, other than walks every day and going to a counselor. I'm pretty much not a part of society like I used to be. So I must've been in a bubble without being connected to the environment. every chance I get to volunteer which is rare in my remote town, I almost don't think and apply because overthinking makes me not apply to any volunteering idea.\n\n So I'm anxious. I have no idea what am I supposed to do other than getting cussed  by a 13 y.o teen who had dealt with people much more harsh than me at school before he got kicked out. He will probably tell me that I'm just a small fry and that I wouldn't be able to motivate him to try to learn some subjects with my help. \n\nWhatever, I will just tell him: "ok, that's your choice. Bye" I hope that's going to be the thing I get out of my mouth. \n\nI'm not against poor people or people with mental Illness. My INFP personality is too empathetic, every bad word that people tell me, my heart absorbs it.\n\n My empathetic self tells me all the time to find volunteering programs all the time because I'm fed up of looking at commercials that have this gloomy music and heartbreaking pictures when my family watches the TV when we eat dinner. These commercials make me sad and unaccomplished in my life. \n\nIf you read all of this, thank you. Writing this post made myself feel more comfortable in myself and my decision, maybe it won't be as bad as I think.\n\nEdit: ok I pretty much found interesting tips and games on Google for easing the tension in the first meet-up. I think that will also help. Thanks for the helpful replies.
3	I once volunteered as a tutor for troubled children.  One kid, Larry, was especially problematic.  Listened to none of the grown-ups, couldn't read anything at age 8, didn't understand math.  I hung out with him and just asked questions about him.  Maybe he just needed someone to listen to him instead of always telling him.  Turns out he was just playing dumb because it gave him a way to not do what he was told (Read this.  Can't.  Let's add these numbers.  Don't know how).  After an hour, he read me a book appropriate for his age and did some basic addition in his head.  All it took was treating him like a human being.  He made me promise to keep his secret, so I did.  We were in an open classroom, so program staff could see without me saying anything.\n\nMy point in sharing this is that the 13yo's attitude and problems might be similarly based on how he's reacting to daily life.  Ask him why he got kicked out.  Listen to his side of the story and see if he just needs to be heard.  Even if it makes little difference to his schooling, it might make an impact on him in a more subtle way.
1	Hey :)\n\nI'm not sure exactly what it is you're supposed to do while volunteering, but don't put too much pressure on yourself. It's not your job to change him or force him to go back to school. Just be kind and gentle to him. Get to know his story, his family dynamics, friends - anything he may be struggling with. Talking about our issues is helpful because it allows us to process our emotions and thoughts better. But if he feels uncomfortable talking about these things, don't force it. If you feel comfortable, maybe you could share your own story, and why you were unable to finish school.\n\nI think it's rare for a 13 y/o to lash out at strangers, so I wouldn't think too much about that (but I understand how hard it can be to avoid thinking these things when we're anxious). But if he does, just remember that it has nothing to do with you and that it is not your fault - be gentle and kind with yourself as well\n\nGood luck, I hope the best for you :)
22	any female infps who have trouble hanging out with friends?	im in high school still but multiple times over many months/few years ive gotten the same results on the myers briggs test so i think my personality type is justified. but when im out with friends, if i get ignored once itll ruin the whole thing for me. if im not treated the exact same as one other person i end up shutting up and being stuck in my head the rest of the night. any tips on how to control this?
6	You just go to accept the fact that not everybody will think and act the same way as you and that the world doesn‚Äôt just evolve around us. Try to be more vocal because nobody knows what we‚Äôre really thinking unless we say it. If it bothers you, communicate. It‚Äôs good that while you are young that you practice being more assertive and at the same time open to anything that could strike you and giving healthy reactions. Don‚Äôt worry. What you feel is absolutely normal. You just gotta learn on how to deal with it positively without shutting yourself from the world. 
2	Yes, I'm pretty much the only introvert in my regular friend group and it makes it really hard for me to feel like I belong. Even if i'm having fun at the beginning of the night, by the end I just want to go home. Like my friends are really loud and crazy and i'm not like that at all. Sometimes I don't even think we should be friends because we're so different, but I don't want to be completely friendless so I still hang out with them. There used to be more people in our "group" but all the people I got along with the best don't hang out with us anymore. I do have other friends, but I don't drive and so I don't ever ask anyone to hang out cause I hate feeling like a burden or asking for favors so I wait until they ask me. 
2	First, this is so me it hurts üòÇ\n\nBut second, I always try to force myself to push it aside for the time being. Then, when I can be alone with my thoughts, I try to say those thoughts of "This person said this bc they secretly hate me" (or whatever crazy things I convince myself of) out loud. Many times, when I hear them out loud, they just sound illogical, so I can get over it pretty fast.
1	Maybe there is a reason the people you liked most don‚Äôt hang out anymore. Have you tried asking them? They may have the same issues you have with feeling left out. Regardless I would encourage you to keep looking for opportunities to find new people who you feel safe to be yourself around. It can be challenging to take a risk and step out of your comfort zone but it could be good for you.\nAlso I always tell people to find groups or clubs that meet weekly or monthly so you can get to know people more slowly and there isn‚Äôt so much pressure.
2	How to other personality types react to/perceive infps?	Does everyone else see us the same way we see ourselves? Or do they see us as forgettable and passed off easily because we seem to come and go in conversations and friendships from time to time
2	I don't know for sure, but the people that I have clashed with are usually xSTJs. Every little thing I say or do seems to irritate them
1	Why do you bottle up your feelings instead of trying to figure them out? Is it general INFP behaviour? Or immature INFP bahaviour?	This might come off as a weird post, since I'm INTP myself. I have had two friends that are both INFPs. One is still my friend. They're somehow alike. When it comes to strong emotions, they tend to hide what they feel. I know that according to the stereotypes, I am the one full of logic and can't comprehend emotion, but I don't think that's true. I don't easily call someone my friend; I need a lot of time to build a friendship. I call someone a friend if I feel that I can share everything with them and that doesn't happen really often. These two humans are notable exceptions... they're a bit weird, just like I am. They get my shitty jokes. They can talk about deeper things or feelings they feel, just as I do... but they seem to lose their grip at times. I tell them I'm by their side if they need my help, but they want more to keep the friendship floating than to express their needs. Or maybe I'm wrong, they don't actually need me...? Both seem(ed) to respect me and enjoy my company, even a bit more than I'm comfortable with. They seem capable to go put of their way to do things for me, which is hard to understand for me. But we're all different. Important to note: both these INFPs are male and 19. Do you express yourself better as an older INFP? Or is it basically the same? I'm 21 and female, if that matters.
1	Well, if I know my feelings will hurt the other person I tend not to say them. Or if I think they cannot handle my emotions. Or if I think they are not trustworthy to know what I am feeling and why.\n\nI am not afraid of facing my emotions and figuring them out though. In fact, I feel that is very healthy.
1	I generally don't tell my feelings to anyone, especially not to my two close INTP friends. I like to listen to theirs but don't tell them mine since I feel like I would be misunderstood by them anyway so I don't even bother making the effort. If I really have something to get off my chest I go to my ISFP friend (Fi things). Though that's also very rare. I think it was like 3 years ago since I last talked with someone about my feelings, I just prefer it that way. Fi is an internally analyzing function and I'm feeling more comfortable keeping it that way. If I feel something I want to figure it out by myself and need some time for that.\n\n>Why do you bottle up your feelings instead of trying to figure them out?\n\nNow that's quite surprising. Internal emotional order (a core part of Fi imo) is the most important thing to me and I can't exist properly if I'm feeling something and I don't know what and why that is.
1	I'll tell you my experience with this.\n\nExposing my emotions to people who I don't have a deep bond with feels scary. It's like an invasion of privacy. If I told them my emotions, I leave myself open to attack. I have to deeply trust someone before they will even get a glimpse of the strong emotions going on behind my mask. I feel much safer keeping up a facade and figuring out my emotions in my head, alone.\n\nI do have one friend who I talk to about my feelings fairly regularly. It took me absolutely ages to get to this point with someone. But, even then, I still feel the need to only share the surface level emotion and not the emotion in full depth. That's because it would be pretty exhausting for them to deal with, and it's probable that they won't understand how I'm feeling. Constantly doing this would just put a strain on our friendship. I just find it more safe to be introspective alone, than with other people. On very rare occasions, I won't be able to bottle up my emotions anymore, and they'll just come out like a bomb. But, I am starting to find ways of handling that by doing things, such as keeping a journal of my thoughts and feelings.\n\nI wouldn't say I don't figure out why I'm feeling how I'm feeling though. I'm constantly analysing (probably over-analysing) why I'm feeling how I am. It's just never in the form of a dialogue with someone. This is the thing I enjoy doing the most.\n\nSo, for me, it's kind of a mixture of wanting to protect myself and them.
11	Building a relationship.	Me, an ENFP, recently confessed my feelings for an INFP. She says she reciprocates, yet dosnt want to put a label on what we have. How would you guys suggest I build a relationship with her, without seeming pushy and making her uncomfortable. 
6	Just let things flow, be who you are and let her be herself. Don't force anything but rather make suggestions if need be. Also realize communication, maturity and understanding is key. Be deeply sincere and honest. We can be introverted so space is needed depending on the person. If you want us to open up then show that you can also open up and be vulnerable. \n\nAll in all, have fun, create memories. Blahdy blah. \n\nThat's how I'd be in the situation but INFPs can vary a lot. Maturity is an important thing when it comes to us. If we are immature then things will most likely get very messy which id say most INFPs are. If we are mature, we understand, accept and spread our happiness. 
2	They might be worried about getting hurt. Relationships can burn out and sometimes right at the point you think it‚Äôs solid for life. Gotta know if you wanna work at this till death my dude. Shit gets boring in relationships after a while n people always leave for some more exciting fling around then. Don‚Äôt be that guy when it comes down to it. 
2	This is exactly the same situation I was in a few years ago whenever my ENFP boyfriend confessed his feelings for me (an INFP). I didn't want to put a label on it too soon as I'd only known the guy for a couple of months. If I were to give any advice I would say just try and spend time together to get to know each other, even if it's going out on dates or just chilling in each others company. I find it easier to get into a relationship with someone I have a friendship with rather than someone I see as a stranger. Your love interest probably wants to get to know you better/feel more comfortable around you before they think about putting a label on anything. 
9	How to be a good friend to an infp? I'm an intj who has no understanding of emotional cues	I'm an intj who's friends (pen pals) with this infp for quite a long time. Naturally, we roast each other all the time, and there are no boundaries as such. No matter how severe the burn, we always have laughed it off and never been cross for too long. \n\nBut I'm dumb and sometimes feel I go too far. Especially when she's feeling down / not in the mood to be exchanging quips. I just want to make her laugh and not be sad.\n\nAnd not ruin our friendship in the process. \n\nWhat do infps want to hear when they are overwhelmed? 
6	If her feelings get hurt, she probably tempers that with the understanding that you are trying to maintain your rapport. It's very likely she gives you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nBe direct about your intentions/ wishes. Check in when you feel you *have* gone too far. Ask what's on her mind/ weighing on her. Try not to interrupt with solutions, but do ask if you can offer your perspective/ solutions after listening.\n\nIt means a great deal to me when people ask if I can open up to them, when they listen, and when they offer up perspectives I may not have considered
5	I dunno, I don't find intjs are clueless at all. Sometimes tactless, but there are people out there who have much worse ability to empathise, understand etc. And a lot are feelers! Give yourself some credit :-) \n\n1. I would use your intj gift of understanding, to try and see her point of view. As in, a feeling may not be "logical" but it makes sense from within the gamut of her personality, "I can see that she is effected negatively by x, because of y"  \n2. Show you understand, before you respond/react\n3. Ask questions and be curious if it doesn't make sense to you. Even if you need to be silent and "compute" \n4. Finally, articulate your perspective, that clearly shows you don't intend to cause harm, after (very important) you have done the above steps. You may also explain how you approach things upfront "hey i'm sometimes shit with feelings, but it's not personal" before any misunderstanding has occured. Infps will be interested in your individual perspectives, and will remember it. 
4	My sister is an intj so I understand your situation. I often notice she wants to cheer me up whenever I'm feeling down but fails to do so. She would straight away suggest solutions and tell me not to do this and that. I think it's not a bad thing as intjs are great at coming up with good plans. \n\nBut as an infp, I would really appreciate someone who don't judge my feelings first whenever I'm overwhelmed. I would open up and talk about them easily to someone who's more emphatic and genuinely trying to understand it. It's like going through a phase, acknowledging emotions first, then only accepting new perceptives and solutions. Good luck! 
3	Questions are nice. How are you feeling, how did that happen, is there anything I can do for you? \n\nWhen someone tries to cheer me up, it feels like they are not interested in what I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôll shut up then but I‚Äôll feel even lonelier and crappier, even tho I‚Äôll put on a brave face. It‚Äôs the nicest feeling when someone is just interested and let‚Äôs me process a bit with them. It passes quickly too then, I need that moment to experience and reflect. Once that‚Äôs done, I‚Äôll be upbeat and optimistic again in a heartbeat.\n\nTrying to cheer up doesn‚Äôt work in that sense, it just seems to invalidate my feelings, which are there and they need to be acknowledged by me. 
13	Any fellow metalheads here?	Our personality type is a seeming rarity wihtin the metal community.  I was just wondering if anyone else here is proud to throw up their horns and headbang like crazy when no one is around? Also, do you go to concerts, and if so, do you go alone or with some people you really trust? I mostly go alone and I really prefer it that way, but I've come to find that I am really comfortable at metal shows, and the people are super nice. It's controlled chaos, where you can be free to act like a maniac (in a civilized way, of course). \n\nSome bands that I'm really into: \n\nNightwish, \nArkona, \nBeyond Creation, \nSuffocation, \nBlind Guardian, \nHammerfall, \nNordheim,\nDying Fetus (eeeek, I know), \nEnsiferum, \nKorpiklanni, \nFinntroll, \nRevocation, and many many more. 
5	I love metal just as much as I love my acoustic songwriters and my jack white.  \n\nI do go to a few concerts, usually with a like minded friend.  
3	Oh yeah! I don't have the looks of a metalhead but for years this is the musical genre that makes me feel at home, although I listen to many other genres of music.\n\nFunny that you ask. I went to a concert last week and plan on going to another one next Thursday! The only thing I haven't managed is going to a concert alone though. I prefer to stand aside of the part of the audience that is moving the most, near the stage enough so I can take photos. The people I've met at concerts are generally nice.\n\nDevin Townsend and Turisas have written songs that helped me through dark times (I wish they knew!) so I suppose they are my favourite artist and band at the moment (I nearly cried when I saw Stand up and Fight played last week), and some of the things I like listening to include Haken, The Algorithm, Leprous, Ayreon, Dethklok, Pain of Salvation, Nightwish and many more.
2	Yeah man! Love metal. Part of a band myself - Far From Refuge. We just released our EP recently!\n\nI found playing on stage to be quite difficult until I found I could just enter my own world, enjoy the hell outta what i'm playing and stop caring about what the audience thinks. I love it.
2	If Hardcore/Beatdown counts...yes (brutal dancing included üëä)
1	no\nbut i love headbanging to some fire riddim dubstep ohya!
1	Hell yeah! I love metal. Also play in a metal band, Burn the Chapel. A lot of my metalhead friends would fit well in this group!
1	 I love metal, but i dislike going to shows. I've been jamming on Beyond Creation and Revocation lately too. Revocation's new album is fucking filthy. The universe is comprised of order and chaos, to me metal can be anywhere within that.   \n\n\nSome of my favorite bands,  BTBAM, Mastodon, Trivium, Metallica, Megadeth, LOG, Dethklok, The Faceless, Zenith Passage, Animals as Leaders, Opeth, powerglove.   Favorite non metal band is Paramore. \nThere are many bands/albums I like but I figured a short list would do.\n\n\nThe HAARP Machine and Native Construct have one album each but they are both excellent. Zenith Passage has just one also but an EP too, definitely albums to check out. 
32	Possibly controversial: you don‚Äôt need to wear extreme social awkwardness and oversensitivity as though they‚Äôre unavoidable	I was like that as a teenager but these things aren‚Äôt determined by your starsign or Myers-Briggs type. Being incapable of talking to others (as I see some posting) isn‚Äôt the price you pay for creativity, it‚Äôs a problem that you can address. I don‚Äôt mean to be harsh :)
12	Not harsh. I‚Äôm 31. In my teens and 20s I was plagued by social awkwardness and sensitivity. I was clingy with both my friends and significant others. \n\nThrow in a dash of being very judgmental based on my perception of the world and how things should be, I can understand why people stayed away. \n\nIt took a few wake up calls for me, but I‚Äôve practiced being mindful of my interactions and frames of thought, and aged like fine boxed wine. \n\nThe other day, a casual friend called me ‚Äúsocial‚Äù while we were playing a 1:1 board-game and his fianc√©e was fretting trying to find something. I stopped focusing on the game and almost got up to help until he called me out. I told him no one has ever called me social before. I told him I‚Äôm an introvert. He said I could be social and be an introvert. \n\nI considered that me leveling up as an adult. \n\nSorry for rant. Your post hit home with me because for a very long time I was content being what I was and saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just me‚Äù  it isn‚Äôt. \n\n
6	This is one of the things that annoys me most about MBTI.  People end up reading so much into it because sometimes the types fit so well, that they forget that they're their own person and just because they're x type and x types tend to do things a certain way that that's the only way they can function.  It can help explain some mannerisms but your type isn't who you are.
4	How can I comfort my INFP friend?	She sometimes gets very worried about her loved ones leaving her and she‚Äôll get stuck overthinking things and feeling awful. How can I support her and help her through it?
2	This happens to me a lot; I get stuck in a cycle of overthinking everything until I convimce myself I'll be abandoned by whoever. What I think I need during these times (personally, may apply to your friend may not) is someone to listen without judgement. Many times, after I've said these fears out loud to someone, I realize just how much I've blown things out of proportion. If your friend isn't in the mood to open up atm, try taking them out to do something so they're not alone with their thoughts. Hopefully one of those helps, best of luck! You're a great friend for trying your hardest to support them üíï
1	Try your absolute goshdarn hardest to get her to open up. This will a mountain of trust placed on you and you must where it well, but that will make her feel better and she will like you a lot more
1	Abandonment issues can have a deeper origin. It happened to me a lot because I felt abandoned by people who I thought were my friends but weren't in the end. I also had a lot to do with it, and self-isolated as a means to avoid getting hurt. Your friend needs to break the cycle of overthinking and that's never easy. The hard work is on her, but if you want to help, you can ask questions about what triggered the situation, help her walk through the cycle of emotions, or remind her that that voice in her head is lying again, and it must be reminded who's boss. Sometimes questions like "what's the worst that could happen, and why?" followed by "what's the best that can happen, and why?" and "what's most likely to happen?" usually help me get grounded and leave the spinning cycle of overthinking. 
4	ESTJs	Do we like them? Do we hate them? Recently, I found out my crush of many years is an ESTJ. It explains so much, I really don‚Äôt know how to feel. What‚Äôd you guys experiences with ESTJs?\n
5	They are....potentially admirable, reliable  subordinates. Tiresome as superiors. And as peers? Either they're on top or you are. \n\nYou can learn a lot from them. Don't expect much reciprocity though.
3	A friend of mine is an estj and we don't really agree on anything. I'm really just friends with him because I don't want to have to socialize. 
3	I recently saw this video with INFP‚Äôs and their relationship with ESTJ‚Äôs. Considering we‚Äôre opposites, it‚Äôs not always the best, and every encounter I‚Äôve had with one has been very interesting. But they‚Äôre good people, but personally not people I can relate to.
2	Yes, one of my male friends is an ESTJ. I also work with two female ESTJs. They are a bit annoying/frustrating sometimes but I admire their work ethic!
2	My cousin is an ESTJ. She's great and everything but we rarely have anything in common. 
166	A nice place.	
2	I don't particularly like tropical places, but I really like this! It feels peaceful and energetic at the same time somehow. 
1	Too crowded for me.
1	Umming and ahhhing about doing further study	Ahhhhh how do you know what you want to be when you grow up? \n\nI‚Äôm 36. I‚Äôm a qualified social worker but burnt out on the job, it wasn‚Äôt so much helping people as ticking government boxes in my mind.\n\nI‚Äôm thinking about doing some postgrad study to become a clinical psychologist. But I doubt myself about it and kind of feel stuck unsure whether to apply or not. \n\nHow are some people so sure about what they want out of life, it‚Äôs forever this big question mark for me!
3	How do you care for your introversion in your relationship/marriage?	I'm engaged to a wonderful, talented, handsome extravert. He's great. But the introvert that I am, I often need to recharge alone, or at least in silence. I want to read, do crosswords, work on design projects, maybe just browse my phone or the internet... Without talking. I have expressed this to him many times, and he has given me space. But I can't seem to communicate that it is a daily need. He's the kind of person that talks to himself when he's working on a project. He wants to show me every video he sees, read every meme out loud, tell me when an article was so boring that he stopped reading it....\n\nHow do you communicate your need for non-social downtime in your relationship (especially with an extravert) without coming across as cold or disinterested? \n\n
2	Perhaps, you can tell him a set time of when you need that "alone time," whether it be 2 hours a certain time everyday, etc. An ISTJ I know wakes up at 6am everyday (even weekends) to workout for 1 hour and then do her own thing for the rest of the time before her extroverted husband wakes up. They are both very happy.
2	I have no clue how this looks for other relationships. My enfj wife needs a lot of time to hang out and socialise like you are saying and I require alone time which hardly happens as much as I like. But me being by myself communicates to her that I dont want to value her love language of quality time. \nI've ended up staying up late (tried waking up earlier but failed at that because I'm a night owl). \nReally It ends up being "me time" when everyone sleeps or on my car rides to/from work and I cherish those times.\nBut yes I agree communication is key 
28	I got cognitive function laptop stickers because of my current obsession with learning about typology üòÇ	
2	Where did you get those chemistry ones?
2	Cute ! 
2	It looks great! Love the cuteness of it! Buuut... You have put your last two functions the wrong way around, INFP's are Fi-Ne-Si-Te,
1	It wouldn't surprise me if OP's mother tongue is Spanish.
1	Are you Venezuelan? Love from Bolivia!
1	Damn I really miss my macbook. I loved decorating it with stickers like this 
1	Damn i can relate to all your stickers (except poderosa cause I'm a dude but still üòç)
6	How do you get out of a ruminating mindset?	I've noticed that whenever I start thinking about something or someone, I can keep thinking about it and all these different types of potential scenarios, good or bad. It doesn't help that lately I've been feeling down about having to cut ties with an ENFP I was seeing but still really like. However, this mindset has been absolutely dreadful for my productivity. Yesterday morning, I woke up thinking about him and stayed in bed until the early evening, which ended up in me skipping breakfast and lunch and missing a homework deadline for a class. \n\nI feel like my laziness/ruminating has caused me so many problems like this in the past. So how do I stop myself from thinking so much? How do you all motivate yourselves to get out of bed and actually get stuff done?
2	Wish i knew. Right now ruminating about a girl i've seen today but know have no future with
1	Just have to decide to make a change, really any change, and put as much of your focus as you possibly can to making that happen.  I used to think I could sit and rationalize my problems away given enough time, but I've found that really just makes me more and more miserable when I do that because it's often an impossible task. So now, I've started focusing on what I can do in the present to try to put all that aside and do what I can to make my future better.  It sorta broke me out of a pretty negative thought loop I'd been in for several months.
1	This is one of the main reasons why I'm gonna see a therapist. Hope it helps. 
1	1. Recognise current thought\n2. Choose what to do (continue, persist, expand upon, work on it, or change topic)\n3. Do what you chose, and focus on it\n\nEasy to say, but not necessarily easy in practice, unless one practises it, like building a good habit or working out one's muscles.
6	Continuing a stolen thread chain: What personality traits attract the INFPs?	
25	I'll start:\n\nHealthy, non-phony confidence\n\na sense of humor\n\nAn obsession with weird nitch hobbies (mostly, because it implies they won't judge me for my own obsession with weird nitch hobbies). \n\nGenuine uniqueness, not uniqueness for the sake of uniqueness.
12	I really like being around people who are authentic and seem comfortable in their own skin. Open-minded and easygoing with a bit of a sly/absurd/goofy humor. Kind and doesn‚Äôt take themselves too seriously. Listens as much as they talk.
12	Personally, I'm attracted to:\n\n‚Ä¢Sweetness/Kindness\n‚Ä¢Humour \n‚Ä¢Gentleness\n‚Ä¢Compassion\n‚Ä¢Humbleness (one of my biggest pet pieves is people w/ big egoes)\n‚Ä¢Someone who's protective; you don't have to be physically tough, just willing to stand up for your beliefs, friends, family, etc
8	Sense of humor, the ability to talk about interesting topics, having your own opinion without being a jerk about it, being spontaneous, confidence, appreciation of literature and/or art, standing out in some way. 
6	I tend to like people who are nurturing and understanding.
5	Kindness, usually un-intimidating people who I can approach easily, or extraverts who take me under their wing. I love talkative people because I just like to sit back and listen. (: 
5	Sincerity. People don‚Äôt have to be authentic, as long as their intentions were sincere. For example, if a friend doesn‚Äôt care about your interests but pretends they do out of genuine desire to make you happy, I really appreciate that. 
3	Curiosity about the world, love of learning\n\nSense of wonder\n\nBroad range of interests\n\nDepth of thought\n\nOpenness to new experiences\n\nEmotional vulnerability \n\nEmotional unavailability \n\nAffectionate\n\nCreative\n\nSense of humor\n\n\nAny one of those traits will cause my attention to perk up
3	Personally, I'm attracted to loyalty. If you're loyal to your beliefs and your family and friends, I'm attracted. Aside from that, I'm attracted to weirdness as I am weird myself. Probably sharing the same interests?
2	Pro-active and curious people mainly.\n\n
2	Smartass-ness, being intrigued in some way, darkness, depth, complexity, kindness, leadership, provocative. 
2	im here to be a brilliant prophetess & poetess in lace and botanical perfume.
2	he should teach me to hear mermaids singing.
2	I love ENFPs like Russell Brand, Ricky Gervais, Alan Watts etc and ENTPs such as Stephen Fry and John Cleese. I really admire witty, fun-loving, outgoing and friendly (but not in-your-face) personalities. 
839	For those struggling	
34	Lol i should save this and look at it everytime i start overthinking
28	When I was a kid the song ‚Äúit‚Äôs the end of the world as we know it‚Äù (ok i can‚Äôt remember the song name, but that‚Äôs the chorus lol) came on and I said that that song was weirdly sad for how happy the music was. My mom replied by saying ‚Äúthe end of the world as we know it isn‚Äôt a sad thing, it just makes way for a New better world. Every time you learn something it‚Äôs the end of the world as you know it because you see the world in a new way, and every time it feels like the end of the world that‚Äôs just something to learn from. It‚Äôs always the end of the world as we know it, but that‚Äôs a good thing.‚Äù I try to remember that whenever I‚Äôm down.
15	Ughhhh.....\n\n...I think i should just print this out for myself.
7	This is very tru, so much shit can happen. Even go thru what you thought would be one of your worst nightmares n you still come out the other side n you‚Äôre still kickin ass. 
6	My meltdowns this week would try to say otherwise. But this is very true.
7	This is the only way for me to move on from things 
7	Thanks for this!
5	Ahh, procrastination, we meet again. 
5	Not easy to say with someone who has mental illnesses, but okay.
4	I had an awesome day but few words from someone are not letting me sleep. \nAhh I hate it
3	Truth don't forget.
3	A very accurate representation
3	Yup this is me. I‚Äôm acting like my world is a mess but it‚Äôs really not as bad as it seems. In facts it‚Äôs probably some normal shit most adults go through.
3	I needed to see this today! Thanks for sharing!
3	Needed this. Am currently recovering from my very first surgery and wow is this painful. Just seeing this helped me to feel a little better.
3	Oh man, I'm in a struggle atm... But can't lie, every single time I got over it, it was a lesson in disguise.
3	There‚Äôs a lot of wisdom in this
3	I should make a T-shirt out of this
3	I get the idea but if you really think everything you struggle with is the "end of the world" you need better coping mechanisms and possibly therapy.
3	Love this. Thanks üíó
3	I feel like the size of the "unpleasant" part seems kinda insulting imo. But overall I get what is being said, and I do generally agree with the idea.
3	Yoooooo I think every mistake equals death, 29 years later it never fails
1	More like another god dammned person that got in my way
5	Tips on Emotional Control	I think this is something a lot of INFPs may struggle with, but yeah I have this bad feeling that I'm soon to be fired from my current job after having been fired from my previous job already. The reason why I was fired from my previous job was due to an issue that I had had since I was about 6 years old and that is exhibiting self control and not taking out my issues on others. I've been rude to customers before in a passive aggressive way, or run off to the bathroom to cry and that is no good for the businesses or employers and I work in the service industry.\n\nI hate emotions though. I've always dreamed of simply not having them anymore because I think to be a type with dom Fi is honestly just awful. I can't escape from feeling or emotion. I try not to cry at times, but it's as if my body makes me anyhow. When I'm in a messed up emotional state the world feels surreal and broken, and I feel like everything inside is some kind of jumbled up ugly mess and I barely feel like I can coherently speak, even my blood pressure feels like it rises...yeah, it feels hard to balance like I've lost my feeling. At my worst, I completely lose my ability to care about others. INFPs may say they're nice and considerate of others and I've been described that way too, but people that truly know me that do not see me through rose-colored lenses have told me that I can be incredibly self-centered at times.\n\nI have no interest in talking to anyone about my issues, because I've done that for years, nor do I want to see any kind of therapist or psychologist because that has also already been done. I need to be the one to change myself and my attitude. I'm posting on this subreddit because I don't know other INFPs irl. I only know of ENFPs who try to excuse this type of behavior (because they behave in this way too) and push the blame to others like they'll say,  "They shouldn't blame you for being human." meanwhile other types (a lot of people I know are thinkers or Fe users) will say, "Make different choices when you're upset, try to control your emotions. We all have to do it." I think though that INFPs struggle a lot with this type of thing and so yeah, I wanted to ask people that have Fi as their first function constantly looming over them and stressing them out how they have come to control their emotions and function properly in society. Ie, not getting fired for being rude or an emotional wreck.\n\nEDIT: Actually I do know one other INFP irl but they're male (I'm female) and they also seem to hate their job, but idk they seem to cope by doing stuff like being a furry, playing video games, buying game and furry merchandise and idk that's just not really a path I wanna go down..that type of escapism. We're also getting too old for that kind of stuff I think. I also have an ISFP friend that copes with stuff like being really into K-pop or drinking and smoking almost 24/7. I also drink and smoke, but not at work.
2	I'm not sure how to respond because the only way that I TRULY learned how to get in control of my emotions was through techniques I learned in therapy, or techniques I learned in school while studying psychology/social work. So if you say that you don't want therapy, then all I can tell you is what has helped me, but I truly believe that it might be useful for you and that the RIGHT therapist/counselor might make a world of difference if you found them and gave them an honest shot.\n\nI relate a lot to what you said and I feel like I was a lot like you. It was always the joke that I cried all the time (at "everything). "Rainbowsandkitties is so emotional". When I worked customer service I spent too many times to count locked in a bathroom crying or raging after an encounter with a customer. Sometimes I couldn't hold the crying back and I did it in front of customers, which was slightly more acceptable than raging, which I didn't do in front of people. But I would be literally shaking from adrenaline/rage when talking to people and trying to keep a cool demeanor. \n\nFirst, it honestly took some years and a lot of practice to keep those emotions in check. To be able to <feel> that first rush of anger/sadness/fear/panic/etc., in my mind acknowledge it and name it: "Ok, hi rage. I see you. I understand why you're here. And I need to focus right now instead. So I'm going to take a couple breaths and continue on with this conversation with this idiot customer" and let it go. Once you get that power it is amazing, but it takes time and practice. \n\nI would meditate before shifts that I knew would probably be high stress. There's a meditation where you imagine yourself surrounded by protective light. And for me (because I'm a dork) it basically became my "buff" or my "protective spell" that was on me for that day. So if someone came at me with a high emotion (mostly anger) it meant that I didn't have to absorb it (as empathy normally do). It's just a way to kind of visualize the thought process of again, naming the emotion that they have, and recognizing your body's natural response, but consciously telling your body: "Nah, it's good! We're protected. We don't need to take on that."\n\nI never really had a problem with passive aggressive remarks. I guess my suggestion with that would be to first try to identify them before you say them as being passive aggressive. And once you've got that, then try to stop yourself from letting the words out. So say nothing instead of something bad. Often a passive aggressive remark is in response to an angry customer's question, yes? Well, sometimes questions don't need to be answered. Sometimes it is just best to remain silent. If they follow up with a: "WELL SAY SOMETHING!" Then you can rehearse a: "I'm very sorry, <segue into whatever needs to be done to complete transaction>". \n\n"YOU GUYS ARE THE WORST EVER! WHY DO YOU SUCK SO MUCH??"\n"<you bite your tongue - no response>"\n"WELL?!?"\n"I'm very sorry, did you say that you wanted cash for your return? I could also put it back on your debit card instead"\n\nLike I said, it comes with time. You can get there. But for me therapy and 12 years of customer service did it lol 
1	Do you know why you are feeling this way? And do you know what makes you feel better?\n\nFi in itself isn‚Äôt an issue, the way I see it. Being centered around the emotional ebb and flow can be tho if you take it seriously as if it is ‚Äòtruth‚Äô. By observing it you might gain some distance and understand better what creates these ebbs and flows. \n\nYour feelings seem to control you. And that is perfectly human up to a certain point but the question is I think, how do you take that control back? The you as a whole. Because even tho emotions move through us, so does logic and combined they are a great force. \n\nYou won‚Äôt lose your ability to feel, noone can without harming themselves I think :). So it‚Äôs healthier to embrace your emotional side like a loving parent and guide this part of you through it in an observant and nurturing way.
1	I also need to work on controlling my emotions, less so for the sake of a job or for others but for myself. But when I am in a situation where my emotions could get in the way of work or relationships with other people, it sort of helps me to think of how little I am really in other people's lives and in the large scheme of things and then further I think about how little the moment I'm in really matters in the scheme of my life. I guess I just put things in perspective, I think about how little bystanders care about my emotions and how little I should care about whatever is going on. Then I go listen to angsty music.\nBut hey I probably need as much help as you do

2	Wow, during college years I used to dream about being able to go on an extended sailing journey and learn how to sail, etc. Now I think I'm a bit too old for it.

4	INFPs, would you mind providing examples of how you think your humorous/comedic side is expressed or is perceived as?	
6	Nearly all of my jokes are based on the ridiculous. I usually make strange/random comparisons between things that create humor. E.g. I was playing a game with some friends where one said a word and we had to say another related word or sentence; so one said ‚ÄúIrrational Genocide‚Äù and I responded with ‚ÄúPeeing on an anthill‚Äù lol.

2	I'm usually perceived as the guy with the weird perspective on everything. 
1	Most of the time people roll their eyes. I've developed a reputation as having my own sense of humour that not many others share. I don't think they think less of me for that, but it's difficult for them to laugh along when it's something silly I find really funny yet can't actually explain it in a humourous way 
14	Say what you want about Fi, but it makes incredible music	So many influential and prolific musicians were probably INFPs or ISFPs. So there, Fi haters! 
9	I haven‚Äôt seen anything like this, so I edited a video that encapsulates how climate change makes me feel. Thought you guys could relate ‚ù§Ô∏è	
1	W E L P . . .
1	Yes. I can relate. I can‚Äôt express it in words. Your video does a good job though.
7	No idea which direction to choose.	First of all, I love this sub, it's one of my favorite places on the internet.\n\nSecond, I guess I'm a weird iNFP because I do have a lot of drive and motivation, just am terrible at making decisions and sticking to them. So my dream is to be in a creative career for my job, and in the last couple years I've been trying to get there. Creativity has always been my strength and I always rank in like top 80% for artistic. \n\nSo over the last year I'd been pretty sure I'd wanted to be a fine artist, a painter. I did some portrait classes and life drawing/oil painting. But I'm not making much progress and it gives me anxiety now, despite how much work I'd be putting in. I don't get the art world at all and it feels like everyone and their mother is a painter these days. I'd lost a ton of motivation because of how my stuff STILL looked like crap, so I just stopped and wondered what else I could do.\n\nWell I'm also an exceptionally good writer, but I don't really feel in my heart that i'm meant to be an author. I love fashion and fashion design, but it's super competitive and egotistical and I don't have the funding to start anyway. I like music but can't sing to save my life, and can only partially play the piano, and also everyone and their mom has a band. I like graphic design but I guess I want to show my work in galleries rather than design pamphlets. I also have taken fading interest in acting, directing, comics, and screenwriting.\n\nI don't know which direction to go in. I feel like I should be able to be better than I am but i can't pick one thing and stick to it, out of fear there's something else BETTER for me, or that it's not what I'm REALLY passionate about. Meanwhile I have a bunch of mediocre, half-started projects.\n\n**Tldr:** I just wish I had one passion that I was sure was right for me (like most other people) and I could just do that thing. Instead I have a bunch of things that I'm so-so about, with some talent for, but fleeting interest/passion. What I most wanted (to be an artist) I suck so badly at and it doesn't even excite me, the things I'm objectively best at (writing, fashion) or that do excite me (acting, design) aren't really where I see myself. \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore.
1	I absolutely know how you feel. It seems like we have the same interests and the same issue. I've always loved drawing/painting, but I would need a lot of practice, even schooling to make a career out of it and it's not what I really want anyway. I've always wanted a career in fashion but it's so hard to break into the industry and i'm scared that if I go to college for it I'll end up either quitting or not being able to find a job. Or the billion other variables that go along with picking a career path. I guess i'm just trying to say that you aren't alone. I feel so stuck where I am in life and sometimes I just want to give up even trying to do anything, but I know that if I do i'll be more and more unhappy every day :/.

15	Yes, more frequently than I would like. 
11	Not always... I guess we just feel the melancholy of life more than others naturally would.\n\nAs James Baldwin said, ‚ÄúLife is tragic because the sun rises, and the sun sets.‚Äù 
8	Yep, that child Si
6	All the time.
5	Outwardly I'm pretty sunshiny and positive. I'm gregarious and approachable and I think I'm well liked among my colleagues. That said, I have a generally pretty melancholy and pessimistic view of the world. I hold little hope for the future of humankind, I'm sentimental AF but you know what? I'm having a great time! lol  I can't quite explain it. I enjoy my life despite everything. 
3	The most nostalgic person I have ever met was an INTP. She just oozed nostalgia. She especially loved showing me old films. They made her truly happy I think. \n\nThe most melancholic person I have ever met was an INFJ. He cherished his melancholy and he felt emotions on a whole different level than me I feel.  But he was an empath so that probably makes a huge difference.
3	I'm an ENFP and I feel that a lot. It's somewhat self-induced. 
2	All the time and it sucks.
2	Who doesn't?
1	Don't everybody feel that tho, sometimes? \n\nw/ that said.. I can put myself into that sentiment sometimes via music/movies.. then there's those ones where it hurts to even think/remember  once you decide to further indulge im that *feel..\n\nanyways, it really lets one know how fast time is moving..

Nothing ever happened between us and we're not even friends anymore so I can't even ask him to find out ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø.
12	Feelings	Hello my dear INFPs \n\nI have something weird to say, every year I have a certain feeling that I create and sometimes I get nostalgic about it and I miss it. For instance: I have a certain feeling for 2014 that If I remembered i‚Äôll get very nostalgic and sometimes cry and this feeling could be triggered by a song or a smell.\n\nAny one like me ? (I‚Äôm a male INFP) 
4	I have this problem as well I remember back in Jr high when I use to play Team Fortress 2 for hours at a time with my friends and how much fun and simpler things were back then.\nA friend of mine at my college told me that we just look back on things as being better, that later in life I‚Äôll look back on the things I‚Äôm doing now the same way I look back on my childhood currently. \nThat outlook makes me believe that things don‚Äôt just get worse or harder, that everything is actually ok and I should focus on the things that matter and the things that make me happy.
4	I do this all the time, usually through a song I hear. It transports me back to the exact emotion... summer songs really get to me, I remember how free I used to feel. 
4	Yup, same.\n\nI'm especially vulnerable for this when I'm feeling down or not satisfied with my life. 
4	Yes 100%. I like to think of those feelings like smells where they are so strong and evoke such emotion yet are almost impossible to describe. \n\nI have a very specific feeling associated with the fall of 2013. And another completely different feeling yet one just as strong associated with a specific few years of my childhood.\n
5	I always get a strange feeling when the seasons change. Most notably spring. When I go out that first sunny day when the birds are chirping, even though I think it's nice as well, I get a pang of anxiety which I haven't yet completely figured out the source of. I think it's something to do with the signs of time passing? After the long nap of winter everything is coming back alive and moving on. \n\nTrying to say that I think I can relate. 
3	Smells, songs, even the sunlight reminds me of a certain time period in my life.
3	Yes, but those nostalgia trips are never to good moments.
2	Yes I have nostalgic feelings for every year . For example .. whenever I hear Drakes So Far Gone mixtape I think about college .. or me and my friend driving with the top down and the breeze flowing through our hair . 
2	Songs and smells, yes.\n\nI don't have feelings for certain years, but I remember feelings clearly and I understand creating a feeling so that I can relive it. I tried to explain to someone once how I'm kind of addicted to the sensations of certain feelings and how I like to recreate them and experience them over and over with minute changes so that I can explore the different possible nuances. Both positive and negative. They didn't get it and tried to tell me how I could learn to get past my feelings... As if it were a bad thing.\n\nI love to make up imaginary scenarios that make me cry.
2	Nostalgia is that phantom happiness, that upon passing through you, leaves with something you didn't know you lost. Such sweetness mixed with sharp pangs of bitterness- for such an insubstantial feeling one is left with a swelling, full heart.
2	Personally, I've never broke down to tears but have been there where you sense the 'feelz' comin, decide to indulge in the 'feelz' a little til you hit that point where it becomes hard to even reminisce & you start to really feel the feelz of being overwhelmed coming.. & I stop myself right there & snap out of it!.. lol\n\n..spending my childhood in East Asia, walking round the city my mom would often visit this cosmetic chain where they sprayed this perfume in all stores to the point you can literally smell it even if you're just a passer by in a distance..\n\nFast forward a decade, now living in London; One day I was just walkin inside a shopping mall & could smell that same fragrance which immediately brought on all the 'Feelz'.. I knew it was that exact smell & went over & checked it out..\n\nI told my mom about the smell giving her a vague description  e.g. "..this perfume that used to be sprayed in that shop you used to go to", she couldn't quite put her nail onto what shop it was so I made a point to have her check it out on our next visit.. so we did & immediately upon being close enough to sense it she quickly uttered "SaSa.." which was the name of the cosmetic store.. (it was so obvious  because it used to be everywhere which I'm sure added to the fee..)\n\n\nP.s. just wanted to add, it's funny how the nostalgia is extra potent or maybe it just somewhat wears off once you know where it came from.. maybe that's why accidental nostalgias are the strongest having caught you off guard.. it's like your minds scrambling through all this extra shit in the past that you aren't even aware of whilst trying to figure..\n

1	In english language word mindful is a westernized translation for sati, what it means is concentrated mind i.e. concentrated on the present moment. But concentration implies effort and control, what it should mean is the opposite, a mind that is unfocused, effortlessly present, a mind that is indiscriminate like a space in a room, mind-less rather than mind-full. But a lot of people are afraid of that word for its negative connotations, mindless means an idiot or a fool, easily taken advantage of, easily fooled. All this confusion and fear arises from a false notion that mind is inside rather than outside.

1	Caught between an INFJ rock and an INFP hard place: What do you think?	  Hi everyone. This had also been posted on the INFJ subreddit but I have yet to receive any replies.\n\nA little background: I have been following MBTI for a little less than a year now and I am still uncertain of my personality type. The first time I took the test, I got INTP but felt like this was inaccurate. I have taken several tests and get caught between INTJ and INFJ. I am aware that the tests are limited by the fact that J and P can be inaccurately attributed to the result of the user based on their ability to plan and organize. An investigation of the cognitive functions and an analysis of my overall behavior relative to other J and P users (in terms of language, socionics, the types of discussions on the INTP, INTJ, INFJ, INFP forums) has led me to believe I am either INFP or INFJ. For starters, i've noticed that INFP and INTP tend to be more specific in their method of communication (correct me if i'm wrong). They tend to use their past experiences and more concrete reasoning when describing their thinking/feeling positions. The reasoning does not have to be "logical", but it is usually more grounded in experience relative to the dominant Ni users. This makes sense given that Si is shared by dominant Ti and Fi users as a sort of background function. I think I do the same thing in an effort to organize my own thoughts and/or feelings, because they do not make sense when they sit in my head. Writing my thoughts/feelings down and trying to distract myself with music, work, exercise and food keeps the demons at bay so they don't pound their fist on the cerebral door. I know I am an introverted intuitive. But I don't know what my strong functions are. I usually get Ni and Si pretty consistently on the cognitive function tests (such as through keys2cognition and idrlabs), but that is a contradiction. Ti and Te are usually in balance on both. Fe is much higher on the idrlabs measure than the keys2cognition measure, but relatively balanced in keys2cognition.\n\nIn my head, there is a war going on and its name is the "inner critic". It takes in and processes so much information and it doesn't know what to do with any of it. It's like an inefficient machine that takes in events, conversations, information and spit out useless garbage that I take to truth. And I never feel like I have enough of this information to come to a conclusion. I sometimes feel like I'm living a lie because I create my own stories from this faulty machine and I have to tell myself that it makes sense and that I should live by these "truths" because it gives me a sense of direction. The machine throws around these thoughts/feelings without me knowing until I very rarely obtain something that has any meaning. In the event I DO get something that has potential, this intangible thought or feeling gets beaten up until it's meaningless and I have to go back find something else or think more to get closer to my answer. Going out in public, taking part in conversation and observing people only makes me think about this further. I'm also an HSP, so most of the situations I find myself thinking about don't manifest in positivity. More often than not, daily life only gives me more questions that I can't seem to answer. This process occurs until I find myself back at the original question of "Who am I?". And this loop (intentional word use) is causing a lot of mental exhaustion. I probably could have learned a new language or done something more meaningful with the time I've spent pondering this. I spend months on four letters while others improve humanity every day and try to keep the world from breaking apart at the seams.\n\n\*This sounds a lot like OCD now that I am reading it over\*\n\nOn a more personal note: I am currently in a transitionary period in my life and do not know who I am or what I would do with that information if I knew who I was. I am feeling increasingly depressed because I am losing a sense of direction by looking too much into myself. My inability to come to a conclusive decision is making me feel anxious and uncertain. If I do not know my "type" or how I act among myself and others, I feel aimless and do not have something to look to; like i'm walking blindfolded in a world full of people who have managed to take theirs off and pity the people who haven't removed theirs. I feel disconnected and avoid people, justifying this behavior by telling myself things like "It's because I know too much" or "All these people are going to hurt me emotionally", "They say one thing and do another", "You can't trust them". **I understand that such an answer is not required in my life or the life of others, but I feel this information is necessary for me to unlock my potential and produce some feeling of closure/rest**. The first step (concluding my "type"), however, has served as a roadblock to being "me" (despite not knowing what that is). I feel like I could move forward without four letters or stupid enneagram numbers, but my need to know has been an itch that i'm trying to scratch.\n\nIn conclusion: I would really appreciate it if anyone with some MBTI magic can dissect this post and produce some sort of answer (whether it be INTJ, INTP, INFJ or INFP). Feel free to ask questions if you think they will yield an answer. You are all very insightful people and I am always surprised by how much you all know about typology.
4	Infp/infj look very similar on the surface, but are very different in the way things are processed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister is infj. She says that she is more aware of other people's feelings than her own, that if people with strong emotion are around her, she gets confused about whether she is feeling her own emotions or the other person's. I don't understand that at all.\n\nFor me, as Fi dom, I am acutely aware of my own feelings and use that along with my imagination to understand what other people are likely feeling. I often recognize in someone's expression a feeling that I have felt before and my own experience comes flooding back to me and I feel it all over again, so I empathize with them by understanding them through my own experience. And it doesn't have to be the exact same circumstances for me to empathize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other big difference is Ne vs Ni.\n\nMy sister described Ni sort of like a bunch of connected nodes and if one is removed, the network re-forms in a new configuration. I'm not sure if this is also incorporating some of her tertiary ti, but even so, this is how she describes intuition in infj. Ni takes many things and works them down into a single conclusion.\n\nNe works in the other direction. It takes one thing and then combines it with other things, maybe even unrelated things to come up with possibilities, then grabs onto a possibility and creates more. It takes one thing and expands upon it. To me it feels kind of electric, exciting and branching, or going higher and higher with an idea. Maybe like pathways with many forks and choices. I don't know if I'm describing it well...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, mbti is not necessary for unlocking your potential. I think it may even hinder you. If you learn your type, might you then limit yourself to what you believe your type should be like? I am definitely infp, but in many situations, especially in a forum where I'm not so worried about personal relationships, and feel that honesty is beneficial for people, I tend to be blunt. People often think I'm a T type because of that.\n\nI often see people thinking that infp means they are supposed to be cute and warm and artsy. Maybe some are. But how do you know you don't have mathematical talent? If you think you are infp and decide you'd better try to be an artist or write songs, maybe you'll never discover other talents that broader experience would have revealed. That would be sad. Try lots of different things. See what you enjoy and what you are good at. Pursue that, and don't worry about whether it matches your type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I understand wanting to know. It would make me crazy too if I couldn't figure it out. there are lots of articles online about the differences between infp and infj. Some are better than others. Maybe that would help. Also, I paste this link all over the place, because I love this description of the different functions depending on where they are in your stack. Let me know if it helps. [https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I have 2 INFJ friends and they are a lot alike. They are both extremely sensitive to other people. They are both very aware of interpersonal relations. They overthink things constantly. They ask a ton of questions. Non stop. They ask questions because they are dying to know the answer to satiate their curiosity and also they want to understand and also because they want to do a good job at work. They are both artistic and they both paint abstract art. The similarities are uncanny. They are both sensitive men, which is rare for guys I think. They are sensitive to their partners needs. But being over analytical can probably be problematic. Also they both feel extremely different from everyone around them. One feels like an alien and he says that frequently.  They both are addicted to making eye contact. They are both sarcastic and they both are surprisingly friendly with strangers, cracking jokes to lighten a mood. On the surface you would think they were extraverts, but deep down they get drained from people. They have both struggled with perfectionism.\n\nFrom a media standpoint, Jennifer Lawrence's character in Mother reminds me of an INFJ so much! She cares about her personal space. She is so cautious of people in her environment. But also so full of love and care for her partner. Also, Dylan from Bates Motel reminds me of an INFJ in ways too. He has a natural instinct that feels very INFJ. Just this common sense about people and how they work. This natural intuition of who people are.\n\nAs for INFP, that is me. I love books. I love learning. I will ask questions but not a mile a minute like my INFJ friends. I prefer not making eye contact while talking and instead I have to remind myself to. I am more reserved around strangers. I care deeply about people. I believe in morals and doing the right thing. I am afraid of conflict. It can be difficult for me to make a decision, leaning one way then leaning another. I am the mediator seeing multiple perspectives. I hate telling people what they should do because ultimately I feel like they should know what is best for themselves. I am open minded. I try to see the best in people, whereas I feel like an INFJ can be more critical.\n\nAs for INFPs in the media I feel a lot like Andrew Garfield in interviews. There is a video on YouTube that compares Andrew Garfield (INFP) and Carey Mulligan (INFJ). It is a grest video. I think Steve Grand is also an INFP. He is a gay country singer. As for fictional characters, I am almost positive Ned from Pushing Daisies is an INFP. Quiet, reserved, but filled with lots of love, and strong morals.\n\nAlso INFP and INFJs have different eyes and different smiles. The INFP eyes open wider and look more innocent looking. The INFJ eyes open more narrow and look mysterious. As for the smile the INFP smile goes up and pushes up the cheeks. Whereas the INFJ smile goes to the sides and makes these lines on the side.\n\nE.g. Benedict Cumberbatch smiling in this photo: http://larkable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/benedict-smile.png. See how it spreads wide and there is a vertical indent an inch to the left and right of the corners of his smile. That is a very INFJ thing. \n\nAnd here is a photo of Andrew Garfield smiling: http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Andrew%2BGarfield%2BJustin%2BTimberlake%2BAttends%2B6Opgz7dhnOql.jpg. See how his smile spreads up and it makes a V shape on the sides where it meets his cheeks. That is very INFP.\n\nI hope that helps! But maybe I just made you more confused!
37	I sometimes worry I give off unintentional creepy vibes	I feel I can't help it sometimes. I'm extremely quiet and I know that unsettles some people. I brood and stare into space often because I'm always thinking about something. I'll throw in random comments/questions or switch subjects with little notice (though I'm working on stopping that). Depending on who you ask, I have a 'resting bitch face' (is there a male version of that? lol) or a resting sad face. My taste in music is what many people would call 'depressing' (but it's not depressing to me). \n\nSometimes I get dirty looks or deadpan stares when I make eye contact (but the same people have no trouble talking to others). I feel that people just really don't like me for some reason. It's easy to say "who cares?", and I don't, honestly --- but I've never done any harm to anyone.  \n\nThe only explanation is that I creep people out somehow.
10	Sometimes people hate the intensity of our emotions, ya know? I feel like this so much. I think it's because I'm always in a bad mood. 
7	I can relate perfectly to what you wrote. Also male and resting bitch face. I understand that I don't make the most inviting impression on people but the *dirty looks or deadpan stares when I make eye contact* are really a nuisance to me. Like, I don't think I intimidate them in any way and I don't intend to.\n\nI feel like people often see me as a creep or a complete weirdo just from my facial expression and unemotional voice.\n\nOn the other hand, at least we still got the ENFPs, some of them seemingly love this shit.
6	Yeah I go through this on a daily basis and I hate that I'm quiet and have an extremely dry sense of humor that most people dont seem to get, but my family and friends say that stuff and everything else I am is why they love me so much! Also I was at this party last night and a whole bunch of people kept coming up to me and telling me that I was really funny and they liked how different I was from everyone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was really just a long, very conceited (sorry) way of saying that you're probably just getting inside your head too much and people probably are trying to figure out what youre thinking/waiting for you to approach/smile first etc, just keep doin you and fuck what anyone thinks!
2	You are not a mind reader. It is not worth wondering about or assuming. If someone says "dude you are being creepy" or you ask a trusted friend or family member "Is this creepy?" and show them what you are doing maybe you can work on it. But if you are just doing your thing and decide that others actions mean you have a problem all that you are doing is torturing yourself over your own projections. \n\nThat being said, creepiness does sometimes happen. But it is a communication problem not a personal problem. What would you like to communicate? How do people who successfully communicate it do so? 
1	Urgh this is me 100%. I‚Äôm really not a liked person and I very rarely have been. I don‚Äôt open up to many people but those I do, love me. So I know it‚Äôs not because of who I am. It‚Äôs because of the vibes I give off. I‚Äôm also incredibly anxious socially. Sometimes I hate who I am.
1	I'm the same and also have a somewhat dry or even dark sense of humor. \n\nMade a dry joke to an exchange student a while ago and she said "a lot of people here joke about bad things, but you're different because you actually mean it". \n\nI tried to convince her that that's not true but she wouldn't have it. Oh well. 
1	I used to get that because I was so reserved and withdrawn. \n\nMaybe you hate the suggestion, but you could try smiling more. Just a relaxed smile. Once I learnt to do that, things got easier haha. And side effect is you‚Äôll feel more cheerful, smiling has an uplifting effect within. \n\nAnd people may smile back. Instant happiness!
1	I relate! Sometimes we are not aware about how we are perceived by others. Even though I‚Äôm a sensitive, kind person at first I may seem cold and unfriendly. \nI‚Äôm trying to learn to come off in a more approachable way. You can try too, it takes practice. From everything to being aware of the tone of your voice, to smiling, to making eye contact, to your body language. I‚Äôve learned that what you don‚Äôt say can be just as important as what you do say.\nCommunication is key‚Äî both verbal and non-verbal... something I‚Äôm trying immensely to learn, something I think INFP‚Äôs, who are naturally secretive and shy, may struggle with.
1	You are a fucking strange creep.\n\nBut that's exactly why I would have a few beers with you and talk the esoteric philosophical talk with you.\n\nüòé üçª
1	Happened to me many many times before. What I discovered? It was the RBF thing (resting b\*tch face syndrome). I was basically in fight or flight mode and sensors could really sense it off me. Once I smiled more walking in public (took much practice) then extrovert sensors started opening up to me and saying hi more. 
0	Pics, or you scaring off other people never happened.
9	Suggestions for well-paying careers that INFPs will be good at?	So I'm at a loss for what I want to do with my life.\n\nI'm going to college to become a teacher, but I'm not sure if I want to do this because of problems I hear about with school administration, but more importantly I'm not sure if I can move the field forward in a positive and progressive way. I have had similar thoughts of becoming a web developer and then a copywriter, but I'm not sure what I want to do anymore.\n\nI want to make decent money in my career but I also want it to keep in line with my morals as an INFP. \n\nWhat is your career? What are some careers INFPs will excel at, that won't leave people hurting for money? Thanks in advance!
6	I currently do Medicaid enrollment at a hospital, I see people from all walks of life. They are confused and I am able to speak in a language that they understand. But I am losing that job and going to a dual opioid treatment center (Suboxone üòØ and cbt group therapy) I am terrified. Keep your options open, find a way to run your career on your own terms. Learn to say no at times or you will suffer from Compassion Fatigue. INFPs are little burst of sunshine from what people have told me about myself. Help others it will be something you are naturally good at but avoid the overhead hovering at all cost\n
2	If youre into technology you could try UXD (user experience design)
2	I'm in operations at my current job. Allows me to investigate how people work, understand how they can be better, and implement those changes to put my team and company on a better track to success.\n\nThe downside is that I am constantly approached for my opinion on anything that goes on in the office. When people saw that I tried my best to quickly resolve issues- my insight became more sought after. It's draining and I'm doing my best to set boundaries.
1	I'm a translator. It's a decent job, I do work a lot but I love it. 
1	Indie comic book writer, non-superhero comic books.
1	This might not be what you want to hear, but every job has its irritations and some element of administration. Even if you choose entrepreneurship or the arts you‚Äôll have to deal with this. So if that‚Äôs the only reason you don‚Äôt want to pursue teaching, it might be worth reconsidering. Otherwise, take advantage of your college or university‚Äôs career resources. They‚Äôre used to this kind of dilemma and can help\n\nEdit: if you want to improve education, maybe consider academia, research, or politics/public policy 
1	So anyone knows how to develop Te and will it be healthy when developing for purpose?	Bonus question: to those who developed Te, how does it feel like?
1	I try to invoke my hyper-competitive spirit and pretend my life is a rpg game that I want to win. 
3	alone again	hey yeah it's me, if you saw my earlier post on being alone in school, good but if you didn't, here's a summary: I don't have friends in class at the moment and I feel so out of place.\n\nThe bonding camp happened, I went but I called sick halfway through. I couldn't do it. I just absolutely dislike bonding with a bunch of people who aren't my kind of people, and now they're bonded.\n\nI met someone else who's more worth it though, so it's fine I guess? She's introverted like me, too. I really like her, but she's 28.\n\nThat's right. Bonded. Really bonded. They're family now and I'm a stranger.\n\nI feel so bad and left out, they never talked to me since day 1 and it's pissing me off. You see someone alone? Go talk to them.\n\nWell the good thing is, I'm not alone. One of my friends is alone in school too. But bad thing is, she's in a different school. I guess I have to deal with being alone for the next two years now, any tips?
1	Hey. I understand how you feel... high-school was absolutely brutal for me in the regard that I never found a clique or a set of friends to call my own. Take it one day at a time. \nI know that feeling alone may make you think that something is wrong with you, that you are damaged in some way. You‚Äôre not... you‚Äôre just more unique than anybody else, and there‚Äôs power in that.\nI will tell you that it does get better. I‚Äôm in college now and I don‚Äôt feel pressure to find a clique. In life what truly matters are the things that affect your life. All the kids who I couldn‚Äôt bond with in high-school don‚Äôt affect me now. I don‚Äôt depend on them, I have myself and I‚Äôm doing good for myself. Just know that In the end the people who come into your life and stay will be the things that are truly valuable. If you have fake friends like I did in HS and if they leave and forget about you then good riddance! There‚Äôs a story that can better illustrate this:\nA boy was sad because the girl he loved left him. A man asked him, ‚ÄúWhy are you sad? She should be the one that is sad. She lost somebody who loved her, while you lost somebody who didn‚Äôt love you.‚Äù\nAnyway just stay strong, ‚ÄúThis too shall pass‚Äù. I hope this makes sense lol.
5	Any other INFP metalheads here?	Enigmatically to my wife and all my family, I‚Äôve been a huge fan of metal music since high school. It started out with hearing All That Remains on Guitar Hero II and expanded from there. To this day, I have no tattoos or piercings and only where the occasional black tee, so no one automatically assumes I‚Äôm into screamo and most are surprised upon the discovery. Though, I‚Äôve always been prone to acquired tastes (e.g. coffee and dark beer). \n\nI prefer melodic metalcore. The relationship between the rough and clean vocals is like a winter storm to the warm hearth waiting inside. It‚Äôs the perfect marriage of raw emotion and swift intellect; rage against it all and reason through the issue. \n\nMy favorites are Demon Hunter, Wage War, August Burns Red, and Wolves at the Gate. My recent metal playlists have had Born of Osiris, Veil of Maya, In Hearts Wake, Sleeping Giant, I Am Noah, Phinehas, For All Eternity, Fit For A King, The Healing, I The Breather, Erra, Bring Me The Horizon, and blessthefall. 
2	Demon Hunter is my favorite metal band of all time! Their new album is awesome. Been a metalhead sense middle school myself.
2	Me! Everyone is always extremely surprised if they find out. I certainly don‚Äôt listen exclusively to heavy stuff, but I am a big fan. \nSilent Planet and The Ongoing Concept are my top two, but I greatly appreciate Phinehas, Gideon, La Dispute, and Northlane too.
2	I ended up with a full black closet and a couple of tattoos. Giving it some variety now that i have a need to stop dressing like a teen. People actually get surprised when they see my singing some country or pop stuff. \n\nWhat you said about the vocal dynamics, one non-screamo band i often see this happening is mastodon. The band has a big variety of styles across ot's albums, if i had to pick a favourite album it would be the hunter.\n\nAs for melodies that just flood my heart into emotional nirvana, i am stuck into stoner metal. I go for hour long-trips with samsara blues experiment, somali yatch club or mars red sky.\n\n
2	Hell yeah! ü§ò I'm really into hardcore. The more chaos the better. Check out Jesus Piece, Vein, Sanction, Sectioned, Vatican... absolutely love all of those bands. 
1	I find I'm sorta all over the MBTI spectrum, I used to always type as an INTP, now it's consistently INFP but the N has been drifting towards S and is like 52/48 N right now, so I wouldn't be surprised if it places me as ISFP at some point in the future.  But yes.  I'm into it at all levels.  My favorite band currently is Gojira, but I can pretty much get into almost anything,  heavier the better.  Really enjoy the work of the dudes behind both Infant Annihilator and Black Tongue.  Complete opposites style wise, other than both fall on the extreme end of heavy.
1	Bmth, but the "older" stuff (yes I am one of those fans) 
195	I'm proud of all of you.	
7	Depression is exhausting but I cant stop discovering, and wandering, making me feel grateful for my existence.
2	Thanks, I sure did need this!
1	I‚Äôm not sure if this still applies since I tend to write about some of my worst and best moments and publicizing change. Sure, I‚Äôm not open about many things, but I‚Äôm still open.\n\nI‚Äôm into being held accountable by the public/strangers. Is that not a good idea?

2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 03	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	Developed a very inappropriate crush on a coworker who invited me to hang out at her house. It's inappropriate because she's in a happy relationship and clearly has no reciprocal feelings. But she's the first person in a long time who is of the opposite sex and (seemingly) enjoys hanging out with me solo. Just gotta ride it out I guess. I hope this doesn't make work awkward.
3	Any INFP wanting to see a soul being literally crushed should watch the Peter O'Toole classic "Lawrence of Arabia."\n\nWarning: Your soul might be crushed as well.\n
3	Hey. You guys genuinely make me happy. You keep a lot of wisdom inside you, and from an Ni Fe perspective, I truly respect the complexity of your feelings. Your form of creativity is probably my favorite. It's sincere, genuine, and real. I know how society can make life difficult to navigate for you at times, but do know that another small group of people deeply appreciate who you are and how you's be. Stay comfy.\n\nLove, \n-an INFJ
1	I am best!\n\n&#x200B;
1	Just discovered one of my best friends at university was an abuser in high school from a mutual friend who is no longer friends with her. Absolutely devastated and confused about how to move forward with her and our friendship ....:( \nI still want to see the best in her and think she‚Äôs changed ‚Äî classic infp
3	Weird fears	So i have this weird fear that gravity will reverse and ill float into space. I got pretty scared one night while walking home and couldnt enjoy the starry night because i could feel my mind and body drifting a little. Its called casadastraphobia. \n\nObviously it wont happen but i always scare myself thinking about that "what if?" Lol.\n\nDo you have any weird fears?
1	That the floor will fall out, and I usually feel it to an extent. 
1	I have a severe phobia of worms that makes getting around during the rainy season more difficult than it should be. 
76	Upon seeing this I kinda assumed it was posted here in r/infp. Surprised it wasn‚Äôt. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø	
6	That is why I limit reddit usage. It's not all that great and *usually* a waste of time. Still good posts every now and then but most of them- you already got that covered. But to be fair if you weren't feeling so great it can be helpful? Just don't want to encourage it.
6	Thank you stranger.	So I was invited by a coworker to a banquet to celebrate her husband being cancer free. It's in a vfw and I walked in gave her a big hug and him also along with a firm handshake while maintaining eye contact and congratulating him. There is food for everyone and I got a plate and picked a table on the other side of the bar with all the regulars.\n\nI only know her and her husband even though I've met her daughter's in passing. But they are all sitting with their families. Feel like I'm intruding so I sat over here.\n\nA sweet bartender saw me sitting alone and asked if I needed anything I politely said a coke and she gave me one no charge.. very nice of her. A person from the party happened to wander towards my end of the bar and before I could answer the bartender from earlier said he is being polite and sitting over here. That made my heart soar seeing that someone who I met it passing got me.\n\nSorry this was long and maybe too descriptive I just needed to write this.
3	Favourite INFP actors/actresses?	I know we must have this thread all the time. Anyways, mine is probably Hugh Laurie, not least because of House as well as his stuff with Stephen Fry etc. but also I think that Andrew Garfield is the cutest boy alive.

12	Are your workspaces usually disorganized?	I just came back home from college for this weekend to study for my exams next week. Before I moved into college, my sister (INFP) and I (INTJ) shared a workspace.\n\nNow that I‚Äôve come back, my entire work area has been colonized by her books and study materials. I asked her to move her stuff while I temporarily worked in the living room. She said she would but when I went and checked again, everything was the same. Last time this happened, I cleaned the area myself and she got upset, saying that ‚Äúeverything was in a specific place‚Äù and now she doesn‚Äôt know where her stuff is. Sigh.\n\nI was wondering if most of you guys are similar, and how I can compromise with her on this.\n\n\nTLDR: My INFP sister makes our study space very disorganized but when I (INTJ) try to clean everything she gets upset that I put her stuff in the ‚Äúwrong place.‚Äù Is this relatable for you guys?
8	The time thing is a point to focus on, you might have expected her to do it within the next 30 minutes, whereas she might've filed it away as something to try to remember to do tomorrow afternoon. If she's like me any sense of urgency you're feeling will very possibly be completely ignored unless you explain why (and make it compelling). As for my workspace? It often looks... overburdened and underorganized, but yes I know where everything is and it would take hours if not a full day to recover if someone moved it. If someone did, without a need and without a right to do it, it would be an act of violence. Here, you certainly might have a right, just maybe see what she thinks about that before you do anything.
3	My everything is disorganized.
2	I've been disorganized my whole life, but I have an amazing episodic memory so I very rarely lose things. In fact, the only time I ever lose objects is when I clean up and mess up my "system", and my episodic memory becomes useless when I don't remember a specific, meaningful timeline of events leading up to the placement of that object. It's very strange, but it works for me. About compromise; I'm really not sure. Growing up, my brother was the exact opposite of me, but we had separate rooms so we could live in our own worlds. Maybe try and make a separate study place for her where she can make her perfect mess and you're not upset by the disorderliness. 
2	*Looks at his workplace* Uuh yeah same...
2	I think a lot of INFPs are like this, but not all of them.\n\nMy room/desk reflect my mental/emotional state, so when I have my own room it's spotless and extremely organized (which is my current situation), but when I have to share a space I can never seem to keep my side organized :P\n\nI think sharing a workspace with your sister would be nearly impossible if the mess gets in your way....
220	Where the INFPs at?	
25	Hey, I do not appreciate being attacked like this 
18	Uhhhh...wishing that you would take interest in me, all while hoping that you don't actually strike up a conversation because there is a chance that you could talk about some shit that I'm not into. That way, I don't have to pretend to care about what you say, just so that I don't feel like an ass wasting my time and yours investing energy into something that I know will result in nothing, just because I don't want to hurt your feelings. In truth, I'd much rather be at home reading a book, playing games, listening to music, writing, or watching a series on Netflix. \n\nWhere are you? :P

11	What were your experiences with teachers and university professors?	In grade school, teachers got on my case for daydreaming, not paying attention, not doing the assignments exactly how they wanted (even if it was right), and not participating (I'm not condoning daydreaming in class, if that's what you're thinking, I'm just saying it like it is). Teachers even complained to my parents that I was 'too quiet'.\n\nIn college, professors thought I didn't care and gave me a hard time for not participating enough and not asking questions (this was in the second and third year advanced but smaller classes, where participation and discussion was a larger part of the grade). In fact, when I approached a professor in his office to volunteer in his lab, and he almost fell off his chair. I never asked why he reacted that way, but I'm sure it was because I always gave off a bored, apathetic vibe. I rarely participated in class discussions because of my social anxiety. I have this idea that every single word I say is going to be taken apart and mocked. I feel I have to rehearse everything I say.
3	I was generally quiet as well and had to force myself to speak up in class. Twice a class was my goal. That felt like a lot to me. Even in small classes.\n\nThings were better in grad school. Profs take more initiative to have one on ones with students imo. Helpful for me.
2	any sensor teacher i disliked, especially sj types\n\nive liked all of my intuitive teachers except for intj and enfj\n\nalso doesnt help that even the advanced classes have around 40 students packed into the room\n\ni daydream, doodle, compose music, and generally remain not in the present during classes, although you can be damn sure i already know the material. most teachers just do not recognize that it is possible for a smart person to not be engaged.\n\ni rehearse everything i say for the same reason, but also to make sure that (rather than getting across, it also has a cutting edge to it that asserts my dominance over those who provoke me enough to even say anything in the first place).\n\ni also hate it that whenever i do something smart, the whole class just starts clapping. like fuck off, im just smarter than you, if you really cared, you would learn on your own time too.\n\ni usually only speak up if anything stupid/illogical/immoral happens, in which case i dont stop until it stops (leading one specific estj math teacher to almost give me a multitude of detentions, but my intellect saved me from those as well, as i had learned by that time to play with others' emotions and sides of an argument, although i rarely use it because it is a very dangerous and unforgiving tool).
1	I didn‚Äôt try to the pay attention to most of my classes, i‚Äôm more of the type who likes to read the notes and put them in practice.\n\nThat being said, professors for me really didn‚Äôt have a shit as long as you didn‚Äôt disturbed their classes. So since I‚Äôm the quiet type, i spend all my semester almost invisible to them, although some rare starting to recognizes due to my good grades 
1	I had good relationships with most of my elementary, middle, and high school teachers because I did well academically with that kind of structure to keep me motivated and they tend to like and automatically know the students that perform well. Now that I‚Äôm in university among thousands of students, I have a nonexistent relationship with most of my professors. I don‚Äôt talk with them unless I have a reason for it, so I‚Äôm not the type to introduce myself or ask questions. If I need help I‚Äôll consult the internet, friends, maybe just maybe the TA, before the professor. I haven‚Äôt ever gotten that far yet. Although a few professors know me from classes I did well in, its on their initiative, not mine 
17	Im a deeply damaged infp, I dont relate to most of you, atleast not yet	I was violently raped at age 5 and repressed that shit untill I was 19, im 21 now, im a guy and I still dont truley know myself. I fight numbness and I still struggle with feeling emotions, I got some dark shit inside of me that im too afraid to face. My introspection mixed with my trauma has shown me the darkness of the human soul, I have evil inside of me. Currently I cant love, I can only hate, I want to love, I want to care but loving and caring means I have to make myself whole again and to make myself whole would be to face the pain and I cant do that yet. I hope to use this truama to make some cool dark art, I work on my art 6-8 hours a day and hope to be a dark artist, I feel as an infp who has seen the depths of hell it would be meaningful for me to turn my darkness into art so others can see hell
4	You more than likely suffer from complex post-traumatic stress, among other things and it can be incredibly hard to change those patterns, it can take some time. You can go hang by r/c-ptsd if you haven't already and find some resources and support, it can be a start in learning more about your condition, and deconstructing it. I don't know if we ever truly heal completely from such things because we never got to experience normal development and unfoldment that is suppose to happen, but you can be transformed into something transformative, a force of healing. Please share your art with us.  <3
2	Therapy is a good idea. Making your art is healthy too, but therapy can teach you other healthy ways to cope with your issues. I am very sorry for what happened to you. It's not right, it's not fair, but it happened all the same. It's forever a part of your story, and you have to make the choice to either let it destroy you or use it to help others. I do think you need to get some help for yourself before you can fully help others, but you can get there :) 
2	There's a therapeutic treatment called EMDR that is very useful for processing trauma. When you can afford it, it may be a useful treatment for you. I want only the best for you. Be well.
2	Awareness is the first step and you‚Äôre aware. Now, take the steps needed to love yourself, commit to it, be it therapy, going on me-dates, meditation, exercising etc. That‚Äôs your priority. Everything else is bonus point. I wish you all the love in the world bud.
1	Sounds like you‚Äôre in a deep Fi Si loop

2	Enneagram Test Results	I was bored looking through some post on this forum and saw the enneagram test so i decided to take it. My test score is a 9 but it said taking into account i am a 9w8. I just wanted to know if anyone got similar or any different. btw 9 is a peacemaker and I think it fits me!
1	Which test did you take? Do you still have the link? 
1	I just took that test and it said it didn't know whether I'm a 6 or a 9, but I'm probably a 6w5...where do you go to learn about the wings? I could never quite figure it out...
0	Wait, what?!	im watching some curriculum health videos for 9th grade phys ed and the person reading the script says that there is a stereotype for guys to like sports and girls to be more emotionally sensitive.\n\nim wondering where the stereotype that guys were more Se strong and girls more Fi strong came from and what your opinions on this stereotype are, because it seems like a big load of bs to me
2	it is BS. it‚Äôs just a product of traditional gender norms that men should be stoic and aggressive and women should be timid submissive. 
1	Probably comes from more men being T and more women being F .
4	INFP+ADHD+Depression	My whole childhood long i had ADHD. But since i am 16 Depression hit me too. And I feel like I hate myself in random spurts where I think of myself as useless. Sometimes I just want to talk to nobody.\nIs there someone else here who also is hit by this trinity of F**k
4	most of us probably
2	for me its social anxiety and ocd...\n\nnot the best for making friends if you have none
2	 = Me, you and other people who can help.\nI've lived my life this way. A lot of it (the depression) may be exacerbated by mistreatment and neglect when I was younger. But I can't break the constant loops, being overtaken by counterproductive thoughts, not being able to focus on healthy thoughts, feeling hopeless and like nothing I do matters. You're not alone.
2	not adhd, but every form of sadness and anxiety
5	I'm participating in a danceathon for CMN today!	This is happening today. I'm dancing at the WVU rec center. Please donate to help the kids.\nhttps://events.dancemarathon.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=569272&referrer=boundlessfundraising\n
1	Dance your pants off!! 
1	Wish I had some spare cash to support. I‚Äôm going into work in a few days, I‚Äôll donate then if it‚Äôs still possible.
8	Combatting Loneliness	I've been lonely for almost as long as I can remember but these past few months I've been brutally lonely. Every few days I seem to have another mental breakdown or a sudden burst of extreme sadness. It just feels like I'm not getting enough from my friendships and that they don't actually care about me or they just accept me only because I tried to talk to them. Is there anyway to fight this? You guys might be the few who understand what I'm talking about, I'm really struggling and need help. Thanks 
3	What is weird about loneliness is it can happen even while surrounded by friends. There are some great videos on The School of Life, which you can find on YouTube, that talks about loneliness. They also tackle other emotions too. I recommend those videos for everyone because we participate in schools to learn about science and history and language, etc., but not for life.\n\nAlso what helps me is grounding, meditation, and visualization (which is a type of meditation). Visualization comes naturally to me, I am not sure if it is because I am an INFP. But I picture a fire inside my chest. And that fire is what feeds me the energy and strength and courage to do what I must do and stand up for what is right.\n\nGood luck!
1	Hey i am going through this too. I mean i have my family around me and a few (3) guy friends i talk to online sometimes so yeah my meeting friends up for an outing life is pretty non existent. \n\nBut tbh i cant relate to feeling lonely at all. My life and the way it has turned out rn is pretty intentional and i am fine with it because i know it‚Äôs a phase and i know it will pass soon. Until then i am just really doing things i enjoy by myself. Reading, watching nature documentaries, playing video games and just being fun and light hearted around my family. \n\nI think once you realise that this is a phase that will pass you will make the most of it as long as you are also actively trying to also get out of your comfort zone. May i ask you, what is your age? And are you studying or working or both?
1	When I make a friend on the internet that I can talk almost everyday I just stop wanting to have other friends, because it feels  too much of a burden to me.\n\nI know that this is bad because I'm relying on one person and if something happens I will be alone again for who knows how much long(I really don't like meeting people to even on the internet and i'm picky about those things) but I don't want to try to have more than one of these close friendships at the same time.
1	INTP here. Sorry to butt in. I have a grown INFP daughter. We have the best time together when she is feeling up to it. TBH, I'm shit with friendships, but I'm thinking deeply about what you said. "Not getting enough from the friendships" \n\nI think you've got something there. \n\nI recently discovered I was not getting enough from my alone time. My gf got me a subscription to Games World of Puzzles, and it's helped me be happier. I get a lot of enjoyment out of the puzzles, and my alone time is very refreshing now.\n\nSo maybe ya, your friendships aren't  cutting it somehow. I think it's a solid theory. \n\nHave you tried the enneagram? It helped me loads. I am less lonely now. Took work. Still needs work, but doing better. I understand my needs better. \n\nhttps://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test
1	Yeah. Try to learn how enjoy your own company, doing things alone, be aware of the enjoyable time that you've spend in a company of people that you've connected with, be grateful for it.
1	i felt the same way towards my friends, and when i tried to talk to them, a bunch of stuff happened, and they basically told me to fuck off. lost my two closest friends and now i'm lonely as fuck.
1	Why Is Game Of Thrones Called A "Song?" (A Song of Ice and Fire is the book series name of GoT)	
2	Now Game of Thrones can be enjoyed by anyone, but I think this 5 minute video is a great "ode" to INFPs your desires and your struggles, your dreams and your idealism.\n\nSo I posted this video here.  A short 5 minute video that makes its point and then has no more to say.  I shared for I hope this video makes you wonderful INFPs smile, or feel something in your hearts.\n\n(Oh yeah George RR Martin is an INFP)
3	Just found out i've been mistyped INFP, and actually an INFJ.	Similarities all across the board between the two personality types led me to settle and half heartedly convince myself that I was an INFP since that's what the MBTI test results said, although I couldn't differentiate their functions and clearly see which I one I was using. Te and Se inferior seemed all too similar in terms of what their insecure to.After watching a really well made video that explored the dichotomy between the two types I can say for certain that i'm an INFJ. Throughout the video I could relate to every differentiation on both the personality types that were supposedly said to be exclusive to one of the types, but when the video said that INFJs hold people in their lives as totems for memories I knew I was an INFJ. Many times i've abandoned relationships, and avoided people due to the fact that they held memories of a time in my life that was unpleasant. My association with them buried the dissatisfactory memories that were created during that time. Oh well, I guess i'm an INFJ.
3	INFJs and INFPs appear similar on the surface but are wildly different, if you research cognitive functions it's easy to discern between the two, also most ISFJs mistype themselves as INFJs too 
1	Can you link the video?

22	Curious. Do we agree INFPs are intensely creative, artistic or visual in one form or another?	Not in a boastful way, in a general way of viewing the world and what you like to do or think about. I would add that this is regardless of if you are ‚Äúgood‚Äù at creating or not.\n\nI have not met an INFP outside of the ‚Äúcreative type.‚Äù Just curious.
8	I think so. I have heard (source forgotten) that many YouTube celebrities fall under this type. They seem extroverted and happy when they‚Äôre allowed to express themselves in their videos but quiet and more withdrawn in person.
2	Not all INFPs create art. But, I think it's common because Fi encourages the kind of internal contact that provides inspiration, and Si gives the ability to match present things with past experiences: ex, to draw an imaginary face based on multiple real-life faces that I've seen in the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I can see Ne and Te helping too, but Fi and Si would be the big ones.)
1	In one way or another yes. I‚Äôm trash at drawing, but I was the best improvisation player in my jazz band. I think when we find a way to express ourselves, we just naturally become good at it. I also really appreciate watching other people do just that, I love watching people draw or graffiti or  write poems or music. 
24	Some space/cover and light/dark balance for you.	
2	Do cloudless skies freak anyone else out? 
161	Why is everone here so god damn good at drawing?	Seriously I see so many talented artists putting their work on here like it's nothing. "I was bored so I drew this" and it's like... one of the most amazing things I've ever seen?\n\nAlso fuck you guys for being good at drawing. I want to be good too but I can't maintain the habit of actually doing it for longer than two days lol. (Take no offense, I think it's great that you're great and I'm happy for you (but also jealous as all hell)).
76	Uh, lots of us suck at drawing, which is why we don't post our drawings. Only people that don't suck at it post.
11	I'm sure there are things that you're suowr good at too though! \n\nI suck total ass at drawing, but I would like to think that I'm an okay writer, and an okay photographer too. Everyone has art in them, wd just express it in different ways. 
5	I post my shitty art anyways üòÇ. I‚Äôm not good at all, but hey I‚Äôm proud that I at least try.
7	Probably not all are good artists, but creativity in one form or another is a common INFP trait. 
4	[Here's my art I hope you like it](https://imgur.com/a/b5TItfm) 
3	THANK YOU! It's a rant that has been lurking at the bottom of my soul.\n\nAlthough this would be much better if it was a comic coming from blobby stick figures.
3	Art isn't subject to just drawing, art and beauty comes in many forms. It takes deep understanding of emotion to produce amazing art, and us INFP are both great at seeing and understanding beauty and also creating it from our introverted feeling. 
2	Not everyone. I do abstract stuff cause I can't draw at all. 
2	I‚Äôm not LOL I‚Äôm one of the most un-artistic people I know! 
2	There is an old book (which the author bases on their one-week workshop) that claims it can teach people how to draw more of what they see (as opposed to drawing based on impressions, cartoons, symbols, representations, etc) within a week or so. It shows before/after self-portraits from participants on the actual workshop, and it's completely mind-blowing how much improvement there is. I only did the first exercise many years ago, doing the self-portrait, and I thought mine was actually pretty good while in general I can't draw at all in general beyond a stick figure type level. The main reason I didn't proceed with the book was because it meant I had to buy these weird art supplies I had never heard of and I wasn't sure I could buy them here (very few art stores). I was a kid back then with no money but the same excuse isn't really valid anymore ü§î.
2	It's all practice, you dont even have to draw something every day, or even every week. If you create something even just once a month you will gradually improve. As an infp you might find it comes quite naturally to you :) 
1	It's where you spend your time, being the day dreamer sometimes I will just spend all my time thinking about drawing, how to make something work out.. practice practice practice
1	I heard once it takes about a week to form a habit. I kept a habit of drawing everyday for 2 years, but I could have been more productive with it. Anyway, the simple answer is practice. A more complex answer is drawing similar things over and over again until you get it. I can draw decently most of the time, but I pretty much have never practiced with colors so I'm terrible at doing most things beyond than line work. Jealousy and discouragement is bound to exist, so just choose to move past it. 
1	I know! I‚Äôm not good at drawing but i do cool makeup does that count for something haha 
1	My problem, for fucking *years*, is that I can't decide on my artistic medium.  Everytime I sit down to draw I'm like "this could be a waste of time if I never draw again" same with a bunch of other stuff.  I want to get into painting, my artistic lack of skills be damned, but the inks are fricken expensive.  I am infp and I am very artistic and creative - in my head - it's just that I've been unable to express it for my entire life out of frustration of not being able to express it.  It's a fucking catch 22.  
1	I'm bad at drawing but I can be really good at some other things
1	I suggest you purchase the book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt will teach you how to draw. 
1	Lol I can‚Äôt draw for shit. I write music instead
1	Just let it go and do what your heart desires. You can do it üíô
1	Check marco bucci on youtube. Its really just workabd commitment
1	I started drawing from a very early age, I stopped drawing a few years ago but I want to come back. I dont' know how bad would be if I tried now though lol
1	I'm sure you're creative in other ways.  I don't post drawing either.  That's not my thing.  I dance.  What's your jam?  We all have one?  Drawing is something more postable, that's just why it's seen here more.  
1	They practice. I am lazy so I dont, but I love a good painting. 
0	Practice. 
7	I get so fucking carried away	We're just friends üíî
8	Well, you have friends, so that‚Äôs nice. I‚Äôd love a friend.
7	What in your opinion are the strengths on an INFP?	Just curious. Do you guys know thyself from the inside out because of strong Fi? What other stereotypical strengths are true or just true to a certain extent?
8	Compassion. Morality. Creativity. Independence.
5	Creativity, understanding, sensitivity, compassion.
6	Perspective.
2	Sincerity, integrity, and individuality.
1	Empathy, self understanding, wisdom 
1	I‚Äôve been told by many people that they appreciate my authenticity as a person. 
88	Wisteria geisha. I‚Äôve been doing a series of paintings on a whole bunch of flowers. Nature brings me life and peace in a crazy world.	
3	I‚Äôm sick of y‚Äôall lol 
2	Wwoowwwweeee
2	This is...extraordinary. 
1	Wow how did you do it,bravo.
1	Beautiful! Keep uploading please.
1	This is just gorgeous. I love her expression and the hair. The warmth of the colors is breathtaking
2	Any Volunteers for an Obscure Memory Post	Thinking of the Pixar movie INSIDE OUT...\n\nI'm going to compose a blog post about memories. Memories that are obscure, but they have made an impact on you in some way over the course of your lifetime. They make you wonder why or how because it's a memory that plays in your head randomly from time to time. \n\nI wanted to have some volunteers ( no names will be used only your quotes) to share a memory and what they may have learned about themself from said memory.  Once written, I will share the post on here for everyone to read.\n\nTo give an example: (true story) in grade school we had to color in cornucopia for thanksgiving. Every one colored theirs natural colors, I colored mine blue green. I was the only one. Over the years, it showed my nonconformity to certain rules. \n\n\n\n
2	I have a memory of being in the forest around age 5 or 6. I was there with my mother. I remember just standing there looking at the trees, with this intensely happy feeling as if all that beauty outside spoke to me and rested within me. As if all the trees whispered to me and I could hear them. As if the grass and moss and the sky resonated in my being. \n\nIt‚Äôs a very silent feeling when I think of it, but also very powerful. No seperation, one with what I saw. I still have this feeling regularly but that specific memory is filled with this enormous sense of wonder. It‚Äôs magical to me.
13	Older INFPs, what are you up to now and has life gotten easier?	I feel that life is too hard as an INFP and I always have an existential crisis about why I must be here...
12	I'm way too old to be on reddit, sorry! It's just so interesting seeing what you guys are up to- our generation was incredibly boring.\n\nHaving said that and twice the age of most posters, it does indeed get easier. Look, I had no clue why I was so different but kept it to myself. it took awhile to figure out no one else has a clue either, they just have different ways of expressing themselves, coping and interacting with the world. Most are doing the best they can, same as you.\n\nYes, it got tons  better. It's not a bad idea, just dealing with what you can and handing the rest over to something bigger. I'm not familiar with the Mormon faith but have a feeling the same entity has different ways of reaching us- if that's what found you, much Peace to you.
7	34, successful functioning adult here. With all of lifes experiences and lessons, life gets easier. 
3	I will be 30 at the end of the summer, which will be 2 months after I get married, which is 1 month after I graduate from college.\n\nMy life has not been anything I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret it, becuase I have definitely learned a lot. And alot about myself. And understanding my ish as an INFP has been a big part of that.\n\nThings I've learned....  The Existential crisis will never stop completely. But I have learned to recognize the spinning feeling, and slow it down. And to not over compensate for my dispair at imperfection. (oh FYI, I'm also OCD, so sometimes I'm not sure where my actual personality stops and my disorder takes over, but I'm actively working on understanding that, too.)\n\nI almost always feel like the odd one out, in any room (except when my moms around; I thought it was just bc she's my mom, but turns out she's an INFP too...) For so long I fought against that outsider feeling, trying to get in. I questioned why I saw things so differently, felt things so deeply, why others couldn't understand my point of view. But now I accept that quality as a strength. Especially as a (budding) graphic designer, I have found that in collaborative work, I always bring something valuable and unique to the table. Unfortunately, I am still managing my intense frustration that always mounts everytime I work in groups.\n\nI've been in college, to some extent (full-time, part-time, online, etc) for 12 years. And I'm finally almost done. I think my struggle was always that I gave 110% to everything, because my passion would take over. I burnt out hard, over and over again. I kept exceptionally good grades, but would drop out of school because I couldn't maintain that energy, or manage the emotions that come with fully investing in EVERYTHING.\n\nBut, here I am. Finishing college, with an amazing fianc√© who appreciated my eccentricities and is patient when I don't want to leave the house for days, or just the same when I suddenly think of some huge project that we must start now! Luckily he's an ENFJ who actually finished the things he starts and can make decisions when I'm woefully indecisive.\n\nBest of luck to you, and just keep checking in with yourself. Nurture the introvert with resetting and alone time, schedule social interactions to maintain relationships. Know that most people don't understand how you're feeling, and have patience with those that take things for face value!
3	I don't know if 22 is considered "older" but I'm more comfortable with who I am now and social situations no longer freak me out. I also have a longing for new experiences. There is the occasional existential crisis, but only when I'm going through rough times.\n\nI wouldn't say life is overall easier, but that's just due to personal situations.
4	Hey I don‚Äôt know how old you are, I‚Äôm 22 so there is still a lot left for me to learn! I have struggled with this same crisis off and on but I found that for me the thing that helped the most was religion and getting out there and having as many experiences as possible. \n\nGetting out there is soooo hard, but it‚Äôs worth it because its giving me confidence, I learn, I grown I develop new talents and I meet people who I love. The more I have different experiences the better my life becomes. I highly success researching about a vision board and making one of your own. Having those goals, and seeing them come true is very motivational and you don‚Äôt even care about the other crap because you realize you can make your life what you want it to be! \n\nBut my number one foundation for having hope is through God. It does not matter what religion, but this foundational belief will hold you through give home and peace. My religion has given me a foundation for who I am, I am a child if God. He knows me. He loves me, and he has a plan for me. If he is watching over me and protecting me then I know everything is going to be ok. That has given me hope and in those moments where I feel unloved, alone, worthless etc that has been my foundation and I can look forward knowing there will be a brighter tomorrow. If you are looking for a good place to build your relationship with God I suggest The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints \n\nI hope this helps! Life is hard. It has ups and downs, but know it comes back again and you will look back and be amazed with all the good in your life. I promise :) \n\n
1	Well I don't do manual labor for work anymore and come home in pain most nights, and am not in a relationship I constantly feel weird and non committal about. 
1	27 here, yes. I was just thinking recently how in my teens I thought there was no way I could be a functioning adult and I‚Äôd surely end up living in a mental hospital. I have a career, a relationship with a partner that understands me., And i focus less on my existential dread by feeling like I am benefiting society in some way. Things always have the potential to improve. I found things that I was very passionate about (helping children, understanding the world, striving towards curing disease) and worked to find a way I could do those things that my personality matched (for example I could never be a nurse I get overwhelmed interacting with people and I hate sticking to others schedules) so I became a research scientist and volunteer in my free time to visit children with the disease I research (working directly over volunteering also felt too social for me/committing to quiet time in a lab is easy for me) \nOnce I found a field I enjoyed I started meeting more people I related to and I made good friends. \nThis was all post college for me honestly up to about 22 I never thought things in my life would be ok so if anyone feels that way I hope you are able to change things \nSometimes I‚Äôm still like what‚Äôs the point one day I‚Äôll die but I also see a therapist for when those thoughts are too much

6	I was in an M/M INFP/INFP relationship. We got along great! We were really comfortable around each other. We enjoyed our time spent together and we enjoyed our apart time too. He was also really open minded sexually which was nice. He was funny, charming, easy going. Sometimes he would be stubborn or be frustrated over seemingly little things, but I probably was the same way. The only thing that ended it though was he was not ambitious enough for me. I wanted to move to California and he did too, but he did not want to make the leap. I hated where we lived so I had to end it... :(
1	Each of your ideals may be different and you both may not want to take a leap so... nothing happens until one makes a decision and makes an action happen :) from another guy infp dating another guy infp...
14	Anyone else feel the opposite of meticulous?	Even if I don't 100% care about something, I do still give it my all. Still, things slip past me. Most of the time I do try for my best but things don't always turn out pristine. \n\nEx)\n\n1. I cannot cut straight lines with scissors. Even if a straight line is marked and I'm fully concentrating. Nope.\n\n2. When working with data, I usually miscalculate a few numbers. I almost expect that now.\n\n3. Wrinkled clothes bother me, but I'll try to fix them by tucking things in and heading out anyway. Not always successful. \n\n4. Terrible at folding laundry, arranging shopping carts most effectively, etc.\n\n5. Tries for a good product. Sees a mess up I've done. Tries to fix it. Can't. "Oh well" attitudes ensues over the obvious flaw. Feels terrible only after others point said flaw out and/or gets annoyed at self for the 5th flaw of the day. \n
2	I do all of those things lol. I expect to get better over time, but supposedly it will always take a bit of work. (Te as inferior function)
1	Sometimes I have to force myself to be meticulous, and it completely drains me. And yeah, I can relate to what you're saying; I'm basically incapable of tracing/drawing a straight line or cutting on the dotted line lol.

3	What are some of your favorite hopeful quotes?	Because I feel like I've lost hope
3	Everything will be ok in the end - if it‚Äôs not ok, it‚Äôs not the end. \n\n(Sometimes attributed to John Lennon)
3	\n‚ÄúLife will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.‚Äù -Louise Erdrich

1	lol INFP don't make very good therapists tho, I can see them empathising/sympathising with something/someone else other than their patients in half the situations that leads them to react in ways irrelevant or unhelpful to the wellbeing of the patient. 
1	But, how about that feeling when someone turns things around and gifts you with the same deep listening and genuine care you attempt to give to others? \n\nWhowhathowwhyhuh??????
1	I mean it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve actually helped multiple people work through their problems online or anything, noooooooo ^/s
1	Yeah usually I'm the one my friends go to in order to dump all of their emotional baggage on, but if it were to be the reverse situation I don't think that they would extend the same courtesy, either that or they might get thrown off by everything and sort of distance themselves from me. Which is why I frequent Reddit and other online forums lol

0	Enfp looking for advice on how to love my INFP	Hi you guys!\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to start off by saying thanks for being some of my favorite people on the planet. I find so so much peace in your presence(s).  I've come here to seek general advice on the following scenario:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've fallen very deeply in love with an INFP male. We're both in our 20's, but he's 4 years my junior. We met at a live music event a few months ago and immediately had a very intense spark of chemistry. We've had a few face to face visits since then, and we text or talk on the phone daily. We live about a three hour drive away from each other. Last week he seemed to get overwhelmed (triggered by what, I dunno) and decided he doesn't want to commit to a long distance relationship. That things have gotten pretty serious (he admits he had a definite part in that) and that he's not sure he can commit to being together and being hours apart. We both have some pretty big life changes ahead of us, and although at first I kinda lost my mind, I came to terms.\n\nWell, sort of.\n\nI know that if we are meant to be, that this is the best course of action. Digging in and trying to make it work will undoubtedly make it fail.  We've seen each other for music stuff since the original convo and he's assured me that his feelings haven't changed but that he thinks it's best to go forward this way. I believe him. I believe the feelings are mutual. We had a mutually teary and lingering goodbye.\n\nI don't know how to behave now. I've always been the one to initiate conversation, but should i? Do I still get to tell him he's handsome or do I pretend to be platonic? I have a heart that's covered in scars and I've learned a few things about love. I know that he's the best match for me, that I've met, up until this point in my life. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to honor that, even if it means stepping back and giving space. It hurts my heart, you guys. Send help.
2	That's tough. I'm a male INFP and recently pursued a female ENFP who lived far away, however we didn't spark like you did so this might not be helpful.\n\nPersonally, if a woman says she wants to stay friends, I believe her and usually want the same. Of course this comes with talking. Someone to share ideas and vent.\n\nI'd suggest taking a step back and letting him initiate a conversation. This will better let you know how to love him as you put it.\n\nBest of luck!
1	Boy I don't know. Maybe girl INFP's are different so it's not fair of me to comment. I'm sure it's been wonderful and everything you feel it to be but if he's withdrawn, we can make avoidance an art form. That's a shame, if you have a great connection. Having been tough enough to have that difficult conversation, it's a little terrifying to consider doing it all over again, if we think it'll hurt someone yet again. Hence avoid the whole thing with increasing determination.\n\nMaybe behave platonically? That's doesn't feel like a burden and sure leaves the door open if he's reconsidering things. By platonic- maybe a text a week although personally I'd still feel crowded- yes, it can be that unbelievable. Guessing he'll be very grateful to you for being so cool about it.
1	I also suggest the friend route (for now). I can be a very stubborn Infp and if I make up my mind about something I stick with it. If you stay his friend you respect his wishes to not push the relationship and get to know him better- try to find out what triggered his freak out or understand his thought processes. Make yourself a safe space for him 
4	Blowing off steam. A LOT of it.	First off, I'm not looking for any solutions for my path. I pretty much know what I need to do, but I'm tired of carrying this bottle I've should've emptied a long time ago.\n\nTruth be told, I've been broken for a very long part of my life. Looking back, I've never seen reciprocated love between my parents. They divorced pretty early in my life, and until recently, i haven't really understood the depths of pain and torture around that whole scenario. there were two guys who were looking like very good step fathers, but when it came to it, they betrayed my family, betrayed my mom. they leaving hurt sooo much more than i thought it would.\n\nI've been to 9 different schools before graduation, and moved 13 times. For most of my elementary years, i was bullied at almost every school. In second grade, I not only moved states, but the school I went to had a white minority in students. it was easy to see why. Everyone there was racist against white kids (the majority of students were hispanic and black), and almost from day 1, I was bullied. The teachers didn't see it, and before I could tell them, they knew who my sister was , and threatened to beat the shit out of my sister if I told the teachers or fought them. I thought it worked until I found out they were bullying her and we switched schools.\n\nthe following year, I started to break down. I had begun to become more isolated, but I had made friends who stepped in and stopped the bullies. at least for that year. the following year, during halloween, I found out that they were just using me because I would give part of my lunch out to them, and helped them out for stopping the bullies.\n\nDuring the summer before 5th grade, we moved out last major move. we moved to take of my great grandfather. he died right when school started. I became a horrible person too. I was hanging out with the outcasts (they were the only ones who accepted me, nobody else liked me, and I pretty much became like them) until I found out that one of my "friends" was bullying my sister. I fell apart even more, became even worse after that (I started to become really good at stealing and lying). I had begun to trust less and less with every passing year.\n\n8th grade was the hardest year of my life. I wasn't bullied or anything, but no one spoke to me. I sat by myself at lunch everyday. I was a great student, so I went to high school during the afternoon. I sat by myself most of that year on the bus, except when we were full. I... contemplated suicide that year, too. And I nearly did it. I found two pieces of steel cable. \n\nI.... was one step away from doing it. The thought of my mother and sister, who went through all of this with me, crying at my funeral was the only reason i stopped myself.\n\nthen life got a little better. I was beginning to build a small friend circle, and begun to believe in God and Christianity. In the summer after my sophomore year, I went out on a date from a girl that I had known from church for 4 years, been friends with for 2. That was honestly the best part of my life, feeling that romantic love. or so I thought.\n\nthe following day, I found out that she went on the EXACT same date with her ACTUAL boyfriend (she told me she was single). Then I found out that our friendship was fake, everything we did was fake, and that our date was a trial run for her for her boyfriend. I... I'm still recovering from that one.\n\nIt didn't get much better. the last school i went to, i didn't have any friends. everyone I knew that went to that high school from before had changed, and none of them really knew me. I didn't want to go to my graduation. at least I had begun to have a better understanding of christianity and Jesus, and I had stopped stealing (my lying went way down too).\n\nNow I'm here. I failed the army, I'm at a job that pays the bills, and I'm slowly becoming part of a church that I truly enjoy being in. but my fear of opening up is soo strong, it feels like i'm choking when I confront them.\n\nI'm also talking with a girl there who's absolutely stunning. I mean, she's gorgeous, she's smart, and she's on fire for God. I've just become friends with her and her family, and I'm getting situated quite nicely in the circle of mutual friends. I've even led the young adults group a couple times (I write a lot of posts on my facebook using imagery to talk about my experiences to help out others who are hurting).\n\nBut I'm soo scared to actually open up to any of them. Every time I opened up my heart in the past, they (not current group; my past relations) took the shards of my heart and stabbed me, and left me to bleed. I'm soo broken hearted, but I've had a really good life relatively (my mother has always loved me, and so has my sister. I've never been homeless, never really starved, I'm better off than so many other). \n\nBut a part of me wants to feel understood. i want others to know where my laughs comes from, where my tears comes from, where my love comes from.\n\nBut I gotta work on me, ya know? I spent so much of my time hating on myself, blaming myself, that, until recently, I had no self value, no self worth.\n\nBut I'm getting better, and that's a start. even if I cry on my way to or from church, or while I'm in bed trying to fall asleep. I need to confront my fears soon, or I will possibly miss out on the best thing that might happen to me (i'm going on a coffee date soon with that beautiful girl so I can build up a relationship with her. even if it's just a friendship starting out). I need to build an actual relationship with God and Jesus though, cause if we end up dating, i want to make sure that God is with us all the way.\n\nI'm just tired of being nomadic, of being a lone wolf. This church, this group of friends, and even this girl is the best thing to happen to me. I need to open up again, and show them who I really am. I need to conquer my fears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you guys are this far, thank you for reading. I know it's a lot, and that it should've been dealt with a long time ago, but I'm at least starting to deal with it now. 
3	Hang in there my friend. I hope everything works out for you, God bless :) 
2	I‚Äôve read it all and have come to a conclusion: you‚Äôre a survivor, a fighter and you‚Äôve been through some of your hardest battles! It‚Äôs time for you to embrace your scars and face your final boss, who is, that voice in your head. To me, you‚Äôre a fighter and a brave one. You got it! 
104	Took this pic yesterday hope you guys like it!

3	What kind of drunk are you?	I'm currently drunk, so why the hell not? \n\nI'm a happy drunk, so what about the rest of you?
3	From Social to laugthy joking uncle, quiet listener with death stare, to locked in my own mind only responding.
2	Hope you had a good drink (although as this is 8 hrs later maybe you're recovering now?) anyways:\n\nI don't think I am one type of drunk, I can be happy, shallow, philosophical, externally emotional (particularly negative emotions), very blunt and cold towards people, vulnerable, stubborn or unpredictably hazardous, in any combination possible. It's a lottery that is only partially affected by what I'm drinking that night\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good example is that I once started a night happy (but generally shallow), became unpredictable and smashed a laminated window with my head, stubbornly proceeded to go out to the local nightclubs, despite some of my friends' advice and a possible concussion, and then later became silent and philosophical, only snapping out of spacing out to join in on deep conversations happening around me as everyone else was coming down on the floor of the house we ended the night in.

4	Romance?	Im a 17 yr old INFP in high school and im kinda confused right now. I got my heart broken by someone half a year ago in the summer, and since then i havent been the same when it comes to romance. I like a lot of people, but dont really love any. I dont want to try things or ask any of them out because im too afraid ill just get led on and abandoned like i did in summer. Its a combonation of being scared to actually express myself and not being able to get the bitter taste of feeling used out of my mouth. Ive begun to feel like im just not worth any effort. If anyone has advice id greatly appreciate it
4	Approach them without any expectations. Ask them out without any expectations.\nWhy? You have to be patient because The One really exists, so that might be one of your fellas or someone u will meet in the future. But you will discover who is by interacting with the people you like. 
2	Just live your life and learn new things. Too young to be messing with people. Trust me young people's main downfall is thinking they got control over the 'situation' or whatever. That arrogance will come with costs. I have a sister-in-law who is a moron that believes they will never be happy if they don't have someone. Don't be her. Don't cripple yourself with your delusions. You're young and vulnerable. Fact. Find more meaningful things (like volunteering) to do this spring and summer through places/sites such as volunteermatch. And if you happen to be in Indy, I can connect you to people. Just.. understand that your priorities are in the wrong place. You aren't a bad person. You're learning but you're vulnerable and susceptible to being fooled by yourself and others- as well as ideas. You don't need love right now, and that's okay.... I wish someone could have broken that down for me when I was your age.. You don't need it right now and it's fine.
2	As someone who is 22 and still going through the exhausting life of dating, I hope I‚Äôm able to give some helpful advice, so I‚Äôm going to give you the advice I would have given my 17 year old self. First of all, don‚Äôt settle, let yourself heal still from your heartbreak, and know and be okay with the fact you will experience more. I have had a lot of adventures so far in the world of dating and one of those lead me to an extremely toxic and devastating heartbreak. But this experience taught me something- it taught me its ok to love people whole heartedly over and over again because yes there is a good chance we will get crushed, but we never die from it. \n\nAs far as dating people you‚Äôre not crazy about, please try your hardest to avoid it. I‚Äôve dated so many people that I wasn‚Äôt crazy about, let them into my bubble and it just feels more lonely than ever. Even if it takes years to find someone else you‚Äôre crazy about, wait for that person to start putting an effort in. \n\nMy last little piece of advice is as hard as it may be, focus your energy on all other places except love. As INFPs are biggest goal in life is to find our soulmate, however it‚Äôs consuming, and it‚Äôs energy I wish I would have put into figure out myself and my life instead of boys who ended up not mattering. Plus when you find someone you‚Äôre willing to open up with again, you want to be able to offer them an amazing and successful person. Hopefully this all makes sense and best luck to you!

16	Can't stop going out of my way to help others to the point that it is making me resentful and messing with my life.	I love helping people! Whether it's something small or big I will usually do what I can. My problem is I don't have the balls to say no to people when it is warranted. I get myself into bad, compromising and even life threatening situations sometimes because of my inability to tell people to fuck off. People walk all over me. My friends have the mindset of what's mine is theirs. I don't mind sharing and in fact I love it and also go out of my way to do that. There just comes a point when you can tell people don't appreciate it anymore and now just expect it. When I do hold my ground I am the asshole. I have let a friend who has already fucked me over in a similar situation live with me when he has no job and is an alcoholic. Instead of trying to get on his feet, he got comfy. I have worked consistent 40-60 hr weeks at jobs that were part time bc I couldn't say no. Today I literally cancelled a Dr appt 45 mins away bc I was about to leave work and got asked to stay. I told my boss about the appointment and she asked me to reschedule and stay. Sometimes I can say no at first but if someone pushes even a little I fold. I know it's my fault and I have the capability of saying no. I'm tired of being taken advantage of.
7	This is a feature of codependence. It's rooted in low self worth.\n\nYour needs matter too. You matter. When you say 'No' to things that feel wrong, you are showing yourself the same love and respect you generally show others.\n\nPractice your 'No' (refusing to do things or make commitments you secretly don't want to) on people who will respect it and not push back. When this becomes second nature is when you'll be able to stand your ground in fights or debates. \n\nAs far as your alcoholic friend goes, you are inadvertently enabling his addiction by saving him from the consequences of his own choices. Do what you can to get him out of your house (legally!) and soon. Get law enforcement involved if necessary. This is NOT being an asshole; it is allowing the necessary consequences of his addictive behavior to come to bear as a means to protect yourself from its (financial and psychological) influence, and motivating the addict to see and consequently deal with the true and destructive nature of their disease, earnestly and honestly. \n\nOf course, your addicted friend might just go off and find someone else to sponge off of; but just know that you're protecting yourself and helping him by kicking him out of your place.
2	Have you read about the concept of ‚Äùthe shadow‚Äù in jungian an freudian psychology?\nIt can surely help you stop being a pushover, especially if you value being kind to people. The shadow is all of those aspects of yourself that you shun bevause you do not value them. In your case your ability to be ‚Äùnecessarily selfish‚Äù. \nI link one of Jordan Petersons (like him or not) videos on the concept of the shadow. Brilliant stuff. https://youtu.be/iDQ8DiP_Y_A \n\nThe reason I came to think about it is because you mentioned the word ‚Äùresentful‚Äù. And resent is an agressive emotion, even though it‚Äôs not as expressive as anger. Sort of sn latent form. Point is that this emotion tells you something. And if you don‚Äôt listen to it you will become more bitter. Maybe you‚Äôll even hurt people close to you without consciously wanting to do so (I‚Äôve experienced this first hand, even done it myself) And that‚Äôs the total opposite of what a people loving person would actually want. So i‚Äôd suggest looking into it. Interesting in the very least. Also useful.
15	Anyone want to just hide from the world?	21 year old Infp with OCD here, really hating life if I'm honest. Spend my days at the office with nothing to do, just staring at the clock. Thinking about my ideal life, I honestly think I'd rather spend my days in some tiny apartment, working from home, working from 9 till 3, buying the bare minimum of food I need to survive, play videogames, browse the internet and just do that until I die.\n\nNo disrespect to any girls or women on here but if it wasn't for my sexual desires I honestly don't think I'd want a gf. I'm a loner, I've always been a loner and I've been a loner quite happily, most of the time at least. \n\nEvery time I try and act like a "normal" person I usually just get anxious and exhausted. Social gatherings, learning to drive feel like such an ordeal. I know this lifestyle isn't considered the traditionally happy or healthy one but maybe I'm just a bit different.\n\nCan anyone relate?
2	Are you really an INFP? 
2	Have you thought about writing? Not like in writing on reddit, but getting your thoughts on on paper.\nI feel it can be very cathartic. It also gets you this sense of having a story. Like ‚Äùeven though my life is messy, I am still here, which means I can still change it‚Äù. \nI know what you feel bro. I have also isolated myself to a degree. But anything that lets my ‚Äùnegative‚Äù thoughts be processed, instead of shunning them, seems to help me. Which is why I love writing.
2	You should start doing things to improve your life, or you will continue to live in misery.
1	Anafranil is an old school med that's pretty useful for OCD.
1	Im inexperienced, i cant do much to help but i can duggest you maybe start acting on impulses. Instead of just thinking "man i really need to clean my room" or "i should work out" actually do it. Take things a step at a time, and take time throughout the day to stop and simply look and listen to your surroundings and appreciate the simple beauties there
19	How to answer douchebags who ask you "Why are you so quiet?" or "Why don't you talk?"	Here are some ideas:\n\n"It wouldn't be interesting for you to talk, if there was no one who listens, right?"\n\n"Well, if you were a fish, would you climb trees?"\n\n"Every time you talk, I learn something new about you, but you only repeat what you already know. That's why."\n\nWhat's your awesome response?
17	 Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.  \n‚Äî ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 
14	I always just drop the line: "talking is silver, listening is golden"
9	I have been working on the art of not responding. Either just looking back silently, Or just ignoring completely. People usually make a nervous laugh after. 
9	Because I don‚Äôt find you interesting enough to waste my energy .
7	"Because I don't feel like talking"\n\nBelieve me I would love to make a witty comeback to douchebags. But I also don't want to start shit if I don't have to. Unless they keep provoking me, I don't want to say anything that would lead to more talking. 
9	I always say "what should I say?" because i'm not opposed to having a genuine conversation but I'm not gonna talk to fill silence, that is pointless.
4	Because I dont have a thing to say, period. I love being cunt and honest.
5	"The more I listen, the more others speak. The more they speak, the more they reveal their weaknesses. I use the information to plot their downfall and take over the world."
2	I like observing and being behind the scene

6	How to be on time	I struggle to be on time everyday. I don't understand why? Even if I am ready for my Job/appointment  I still will be late. \nI hate this habbit and want to change.\nWhat do you think can be a cause of this behavior? How can I change?\n\n Anyone else have or had this problem? 
4	Same here, even my boss doesn't bother nagging at me anymore, everyone around me has gotten used to it but it's still embarasing every time.\nI think for me the problem is 'give me a sec, I'll do one last thing before I go' mentality and always underestimating the time it takes plus heavy procrastination and just lack of focus... 
3	I used to have this problem but now I plan to leave 5 minutes before you would normally leave.
2	I've found that I usually wake up plenty early, but then I do other things or just take too long getting out of bed. Or even if I'm ready I'll wind up browsing the internet or watch a YouTube video or something. If I don't allow myself to indulge in distractions then I leave on time. \n\nAlso I'm bad at paying attention to things like road conditions/weather for potential slow downs. There's apps like wayze that will help you leave early enough when you input your destination time. \n\nDunno if those apply to you, but hopefully they're helpful in some way. 
1	Giving medicine I don't take enough myself, but you need to set an alarm to start getting ready and one for when you have to get out within 5 minutes. You will also have to accept arriving early to whatever place. You don't want to be trying to keep your arrival always 5 minutes prior because it doesn't put into account traffic and other unexpected events, but at the same time don't be that weird guy who is an hour early either.. This is what I intend to do for myself as well. I think we 'know' what we need to do but we procrastinate to make that necessary change/criticism on ourselves while we keep kicking our own asses asking why we still do this to ourselves. It's like a very pervasive form of laziness. Also cutting out how often you make excuses to yourself would benefit this route of change.

788	Anybody else like this?	
169	Yes, and I always feel profoundly uncomfortable after talking too much. I tend to back off for a while after. 
30	I can turn into some stereotypical genki ENFP and talk about topics I often force into the conversation but generally only around people I'm comfortable with and when I'm physically comfortable (if I once sit on a comfy couch I'm sure going to stay there) +being drunk and some energy drink also helps. Though, actually I'm one of the most introverted beings I know.
24	Only when I‚Äôm tired. \nThat thing about INFPs becoming ENFPs when they‚Äôre sleepy? Oh it‚Äôs true...
22	This! And than i get shit for being silent.
9	I tend to talk more in messages or text and ramble and babble like a mad man. Or if I'm comfortable with someone and I have something to say I can get excited and talk like I'm crazy too. Otherwise in person at the very least I don't talk much because I never know what to say or do. But you start texting me about something I'll text you all fucking day to the point I force myself to stop because I feel like I'm being an annoying shithead.
6	yeah but there is totally an inbetween
5	Yes, absolutely. It's become more pronounced as I've gotten older, too. It used to be that I'd only babble like a lunatic to people I knew, but now I've started to unleash the insanity on total strangers. Like most of you, I find it exhausting, and sometimes I'm physically ill for a couple of days afterward.
4	Yes, but eventually someone says something I do not appreciate and my mood drops.
5	What I end up doing is I don‚Äôt talk and slowly after making small comments to a person and they look like they aren‚Äôt annoyed I talk more and more until they finally hate me.
5	I have worked at a call center and was a cab driver where I was known for telling bizarre stories to my fares so I can talk to anyone about anything at any time\n\nOn the other hand I also have gone into what I call my hermit mode where my current record is four months without speaking a single word\n\nRight now I'm over three months in hermit mode but once a month I take someone shopping because they don't have car other than that day I do not talk\n\nI can talk but if I do it's nonstop BSing or no talking at all...I too have no middle ground
3	Yeah I'm wondering if I'm turning into an extrovert recently...
3	Some what of a similar energy here being a 5 Enneagram INFJ. But it‚Äôs more often than not if I think someone actually gets me. Or is interested in a subject that I‚Äôve been thinking about and keeping to myself. When I‚Äôm really in my element. Then yes the Buddhist monk absolutely. My INFP best friend does this too but it‚Äôs not necessarily the absent minded professor aura that I give off. He‚Äôll go on rants like me and it‚Äôll be something knowledgeable but his is more entertaining and autonomous lol.
3	Ambivert!
3	Im actually Enfp/Infp so I go from moods where I want to be alone to where I NEED to be with someone
4	I can only be this extroverted with a handful of people, mostly girlfriends and my best friends, and even then I can revert back to being an introvert in the same encounter. As others have said, I feel uncomfortable talking (about myself) too much.
2	Meeeee. A few Lukewarm days in between but yea. I'm either ready to party or quietly resenting your mother for your existence. 
2	Definitely. I am like this with deep conversations especially. I think I ramble to prevent any awkwardness since I want everyone to be comfortable. 
1	This is so true.
1	Shit, thought I‚Äôm the only one 
1	I'm the former at work (which got me in trouble because tone 9f voice issues) and the latter everywhere else unless my dad's around.
1	Damn hell yes.
1	YES BAHAHAHAHA
1	Yes and no becouse I am hyper communicative with my close friends&family but not with others. And yes I feel very tired afterwards. 
1	It's so awesome knowing I'm not the only one who does this! It's freeing!
1	i will say yeah but ive come to read  the comments 
1	Why is this me? 
1	i'm a proud ambivert 
1	Yaaas
1	 ‚úã ANFP 
1	It bothers me when people say extroverted introvert. That isn't a thing. Introverts can be outgoing, talkative, and social and still not be placed into a category they aren't. Introverts just don't roll on and on and on without a break. \nIt makes it seem like being introvert isn't as desirable as being an extrovert. No personality type is better or worse than another. 
1	That was me especially hype chatting on and on for hours or will u just leave me alone
1	Hahaha yes. I have moments where I talk a lot and go off on tangents, or my quiet contemplative moments, which are indistinguishable from my social anxiety moments on the outside, apparently.
1	I believe its called an Ambivert....
1	Yes haha no in between üòÅ‚úå
1	Hahaha yes! I love this subreddit and I love all you INFP‚Äôs. A place I can call home! 
1	Damn straight. 
1	 I can also relate to this verry much
1	Yeah I think you have Borderline personality Disorder...

3	In love with an INFP	(Sorry for my English) Well I‚Äôm an ENTP girl, and felt  strongly in love with a INFP boy. He is older than me and we don‚Äôt live in the same country, so it‚Äôs a bit complicated, but it‚Äôs not the biggest problem. We are really different,  I‚Äôm super extravert but with him it‚Äôs different, I don‚Äôt even know how to share my feelings...he is really shy but extremely nice. Honestly, I never met someone like him. I‚Äôm naturally cheeky, and maybe a bit naughty too. So my biggest fear is to see him being tired of me, because I like to argue, and I‚Äôm sarcastic, and turn mad easily....he never told me about his feelings, idk it‚Äôs because he only feels friendship or if he doesn‚Äôt dare...hard for me to know because I‚Äôm not really good at analyse other people‚Äôs feelings. Well, I also like to annoy him a bit because it‚Äôs my nature to do that, and sometimes i‚Äôm even a bit mean to him. But weirdly, he always forgives me... I know that INFP is just an online test and every INFP are different, but I thought that maybe you can help me to know what INFP do to express their  feelings, and what kind of girls INFP like, and what I should do...maybe you can ask me question to help determine if he likes me or not
2	My fiance and i are the exact opposite of you im infp (f) hes entp (m) i am not good with expressing myself and get flustered easily so i avoid talking about it all but i can say it took some work to getting to this point of communication. It will feel like a friendship at first but dont treat it like that because *in my opinion* its easier for infps to keep things "light and airy" but still want commitment. If that makes sence 
2	For me personally as an INFP I have no idea how to express my feelings and I tend to act out my affection in very vague ways and only once I've gotten over the barrier that someone understands that I'm attracted to them I tend to basically come off as being friendly. In my experience, I have to be asked or be with someone who is good at reading my emotions or I'm not going to be able to portray my feelings towards someone.
2	Dont let personality types stop you, but as an INFP i hate arguing and conflict, and he may also. Maybe be transparent and ask if he likes arguments
1	As an INFP, the best thing  people do to me is to understand and accept me. Because most of us struggle with living due to our personality that others don‚Äôt understand and is not supposed to show in society. We really want someone who understands us. So if you try to understand and accept him, it could cost you time doing that but he will be the one who loves you.
27	Why does this hurt so much?	
1	We love you, INTP poster! 
1	Wait which one is nf
231	Why? I can't even fight back in this condition	
20	I don't think I've ever seen something so relatable in my entire life.
17	From childhood I learned that anger was a bad emotion, so i repressed it for a long time. I thought I couldn‚Äôt feel anger or much of any emotion. One night I was drinking with an INTP friend at his place, only the two of us. When my friend drinks he can get really angry, not towards me, but to life and such. I was drunk myself, but when listening to him and trying to understand his stories from childhood I felt all my muscles getting warm and tense like I was ready to punch the next guy coming in, it felt like I got transferred his anger, but only a couple of seconds later I was crying because of the anger I had just felt. Then my friend cried too. It feels good to cry and even better when crying with a friend
7	i don't get angry often. i usually get sad when i should be angry, because it makes me sad that i was treated the way i was. not angry
7	It gets really annoying if you're trying to make a compelling argument.
4	Just to break the stereotype here, I rarely ever cry. :P
3	hahaa sometimes true, what about #'s 1-4?
3	I'd rather shout than cry. Takes me a while, I keep it all inside until it all builds up then watch out!!! I explode like a kettle boiling... and it just keeps coming out till I'm done. Then quiet. And guilt for doing that to the person. 
3	Lately I've needed to cry but I just get mad or really sad. I think I'd feel better but I just can't seem to cry üòê I just get that really really empty quiet sad instead, dang it. 
3	This must explain why I couldn't retaliate against the bullies back in elementary/middle school. I took their words a little too personally. I couldn't defend myself against them because before I can think of a good comeback I constantly get overrun by my emotions and keep looking like I'm about to cry afterwards, which serves as a catalyst for them to make fun of me even more. Hell, I still take some hurtful things that people say to heart to this day.
5	I love to punch walls and smash shit like Bj√∂rk's hyperballad. Its so good. 
2	Punching seems more socially acceptable these days.. God forbid someone shows a tear??  It's like a crime to cry, Ive always dine both, cry and punch... Just let all that shift go wild.  Lol. 
2	It's so true I hate it!!
2	Is Ben Barnes INFP?!!! A girl could only hopeüòçüòçüòç	
2	Could be.... :) I have a crush on him and I'm an INFP. My last celeb crush was Stephen Colbert, and he is an INFP (which surprised me completely). The way he talked in his recent interview on Carson Daily about imagining himself stranded on a train, that's a total INFP move. He's also very private yet gregarious. 
6	Relationships don't last?	So I fail to understand what I do wrong and how it even happens. I'm always all-in in every relationship of mine and every time... Every single time they breakup after a couple of months or so... Not sure how and why this happens. My recent girl broke up with me for not going out with her to a courier office since I had work. and That's stupid and pretty sure that is not the real reason behind it. but they never tell what it really is. Funny thing after all the heartbreak and shit I have been through I really don't feel bad about it at all. I mean, I'm happy and all but I do feel bad about how it could have been nice and maybe lasted longer for a change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry about the rant. I just didn't know who else to talk to this about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
38	Huh, sounds a lot like you guys	
9	I can say with absolute certainty that Google maps was made to keep us alive.
6	Nature IS our home. It's where we come from isn't it? 
7	Trick question, there is no home.
4	All that is gold does not glitter,\nNot all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither,\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost.\nFrom the ashes, a fire shall be woken,\nA light from the shadows shall spring;\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken,\nThe crownless again shall be king. - J. R. R. Tolkien
2	Lmao!  Is this an INFP thing?  Yes I‚Äôm so directionally challenged  
1	Burial - Where Is Home?
1	I'm a runner, and often I try to run in parks/ other areas I haven't before to explore nature. Can confirm that is indeed me. Thank the universe for Google maps üòÖ
1	mmmmmmm........no
7	How do I help a grieving INFP?	Okay, so my friend (INFP in question) had the worst day of his life the other day, the cliff notes are he had a bunch of terrible stuff happen, and all of it was his fault.\n\nMy instinct is to get him a small gift and then to leave him alone (because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd want), but then it occurred to me that maybe he‚Äôd rather I offer to talk or do something with him? Thanks for your help. \n\nEdit: what about a new art medium? He‚Äôs super creative and bouncing around from medium to medium, so maybe having an outlet would be nice. 
8	Well, I can‚Äôt speak for all INFPs‚Äî but personally‚Äî I think it would be most meaningful to spend time with people I cared about. Many INFPs believe that their purpose in this world is to do good, so naturally when they feel they‚Äôve done wrong, they‚Äôll go into a state of grief. I think the important thing for an infp to learn and remember is the fact that UNCONDITIONAL love exists, and just as they give it to others, they can be the recipients of it. \nPersonally, I found the message of grace when Im in the wrong to be much more impactful than downplaying the wrong I‚Äôve done; because, an INFP will rarely downplay a wrong they‚Äôve committed in their hearts, even if it seems they do.\nSo, I‚Äôd say spend time with him, listen to his heart, don‚Äôt try to rationalize his behavior or his mistakes with him, but instead, have an honest conversation about his decisions and the impact they‚Äôve had‚Äî and above all, the message that he should come away with at the end of it all, is that he is still loved and that nothing he can do will change the love you have for him.
6	When in grieving, I think INFPs are likely to set a wall around them for awhile. And because of the Fi function is dominant, talking while in deep pain won‚Äôt help at all. But usually, if they‚Äôre healthy enough, they contemplate on it for awhile and will then reflect as to why such things happened and that embracing the event is the eureka to that epiphany. It‚Äôs a normal process, we‚Äôve also tackled this in nursing. The 5 stages of grieving DABDA. (Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance) \nAssuring to your INFP friend that you will be there once they‚Äôre on the right track again will definitely help them because you gotta use strong words that has to do with trust and certainty to get their attention
6	Offering to talk is nice since INFPs often feel like perpetual listeners haha; even if he doesn‚Äôt take you up on it, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll appreciate it.\n\nThanks for being a great friend.
3	Just offer up that you're here to talk if he needs it. If he doesn't take you up on it right away it's because he is in solitude trying to sort it all out.
3	I personally find it difficult to accept gifts. Usually a good idea is if you have the knack for cooking, whip something up and then maybe put on some sort of movie. That's what would cheer me up.
2	Offer to listen; make it clear that it's not a burden to you. For me, it really helps to just talk about things that are bothering me, but I often tell myself that it's a burden to others. \n\nIf he doesn't take you up on it, offer to go out and do something fun or stay in & try to get him to laugh / think of other things. \n\nAbove all, just know that even being there for him & making the effort will help more than you know!\n\n
26	üòç	
1	wow. i never thought airplane farts could actually look cool
10	Angry	I know that we‚Äôre one of the nicest and kindest people, but I get so angry when people try and put other people down, or when people feel entitled and I can be the nastiest person about it. Really mad in a group that feels entitled rn. I know I won‚Äôt be as mad in a little while, but it makes me so mad that people don‚Äôt understand they hurt others.
3	I‚Äôve always found it so interesting that when people are unkind to me, I‚Äôm just sort of baffled and go quiet to contemplate whether I deserved it. I‚Äôm better with that these days but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm very adept at fighting back, never have been.\n\nBut when people do it to others, whether I know them or not, I go into this protective stance where I‚Äôll defend them for all I‚Äôm worth if I can. And I‚Äôve done some crazy things that way like stopping a guy from stabbing someone else with a knife. I look back upon it extremely confused, because it‚Äôs so not ‚Äòthe normal me‚Äô.\n\nIt‚Äôs bizarre. Doesn‚Äôt seem to add up.
3	Not wanting to make friends in a new city	I just moved cross country to Denver, CO for a job after college about a month ago. I'm really enjoying the city so far and the area has a ton of stuff to see and explore. That being said I am still getting used to full-time work in a bit of a high stress position so when I get back from work and on the weekends I have just been relaxing or taking walks around the city by myself. \n\nI know at this point I should try to go out and socialize, but honestly right now I've just been content with my own company or chatting with family and friends back home. I worry that this is the INFP in me not wanting to interact with new people.\n\nIs it healthy for me right now to just enjoy my alone time or should I press myself to socialize?\n\nEdit: I should clarify that I for sure want to make friends in Denver just struggling to find the motivation to at the moment
1	In situations like these I try to give it a chance before. I often find myself thinking "nah, I'd rather stay at home and chill than go to that party", and then I force myself to go anyways because I think I should. And then I end up really enjoying myself. On the off-chance that I don't, then I know that maybe I should just lay back and be on my own for a while. I don't believe in the "it's too late to make friends now". Make friends whenever you want. 
1	Mm, there's nothing inherently wrong about enjoying alone time. I will say that the older you get, the more your world tends to shrink. Comfort and the seeking of it speeds that up.\n\nDepending on your level of introversion, I'd say being receptive to new friendships is the way to go.\n\nHave fun on your adventures in your new home!
1	New city new you
1	That all sounds normal and healthy to me. I do the same. The difference for me though is, if I have an off day in a new city I sometimes start to second guess myself and criticize myself for not having more friends, forgetting that it was a conscious choice to begin with.\nIt‚Äôs hard if difficult stuff comes up and I suddenly need more support and there‚Äôs no one to reach out to or to help to distract me. It‚Äôs rough when that happens, on the other hand I‚Äôve had several years of my life where I spent most of my time alone and was totally okay with it.\nI‚Äôld say it‚Äôs a coin toss which is the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù way to go.\nIt definitely takes a lot of energy and time for me to make new friends either way, which is why I probably procrastinate. I‚Äôve found recurring social events or groups are the way to go. There‚Äôs less pressure to get to know people as you know you will probably see them again plus you have more time to suss them out in a group setting before getting involved and finding it‚Äôs not a good match.

3	Can any of you relate to the things i feel and think?	I just felt like i should share some of the things inside my mind and my life, and im curious if any of you fellow INFP's can relate. Im INFP-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate intimidating people. Asking me how i am is fine, but meeting yourself with my friends/family without asking me first will just make me distance myself even more. And in general if someone "sticks" to me will make me toxic and distant. Call me stupid, but im still distant from one of my friends just because he "monopolized" one of my best friends a few years ago. He just lost my trust for like... forever... i'll never tell him something personal about myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really really hate small talks and dumb questions, or when im trying to explain something to someone, and instead of telling me that he is not interested, he have to stop me when im trying my best to explain something to him, just to tell me something irrelevant to the topic we're talking about. I can get extremely angry and mad. And in the end we always end up arguing about something dumb and stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate when someone is arguing with me without defending his claims with proof. If im arguing with someone, i always say why im right, including facts and proof. If you have different opinion, you better defend it because i wont tolerate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow about the phone calls part you all probably know about, i can partially agree. I really hate phone calls. I usually hang up and text the person. I prefer texting. On other hand im really attached and interested in technology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone tells me that i walk, speak and read very fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have different kind of friends, and i cannot meet them together because they are all different (some of them even hate each other) and somehow i just fit with everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm a good listener, but if i have something on my mind, i will stop you just to say it as fast as possible, because if i dont i will forget it a few seconds later. The words just match up perfectly in my head and i just gotta say whats on my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can never be myself with any of my friends. I can be a small part of me when im out with one friend, and im another part of myself when im out with another friend. Im just... never myself...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes i reach for my phone to check the time, then i forget what i was going to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf someone tells me that person x is bad and i shouldn't talk to that person, that wont stop me to do so. I'm very individual, and i wont believe you unless i assure myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI listen almost everything, as long as it sounds good. Rock, Hip Hop, Pop, Rap, Metal, R&B, Classical... whatever is on your mind is fine, as long as it sounds good/there's meaning behind the lyrics. Thats another reason why i find common ground with music genres when i meet new people. You may listen just... lets say... Disturb of Columbia... and even if i dont, i probably know similar songs that the person probably knows as well in that genre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mind is always busy thinking weird stuff. For example, i imagined multiple times someone teleporting next to me, and if someone teleports to me right now, i wont be surprised at all... My motto is "expect the unexpected", and thats what i actually do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love sharing personal stuff, but mostly with random people online, because they dont know any of my real life friends, and they have no idea about my past and how people around me see me. So i can be actually myself, and i can introduce myself the way i want to, without having to worry if he knows my best friend, and what he may have told him about me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm always 2 steps ahead. If someone asks me to do something/is about to do something, im always thinking why is he doing that/asking me that, and what is going to happen if he does it/i answer him. I feel extremely vulnerable if someone knows something bad about me or any of my weak points. If they know nothing bad about me, they cant judge me or take advantage of my weaknesses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really value my past, and everything that happened. I have a hard time selling my stuff (like my old phone for example, ive been using it for 2 years, i cant just let him go, he means a lot to me, i know all of his marks and scars).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm ether this, either this. There is no inbetween. Im either completely independent, or im completely dependent. There is just no inbetween\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to mention that i've been having these things on my mind way before i knew what INFP was (i exclude the phone calls part, that was the only thing i mentioned and i realized after i explored INFP)\n\nI cant say no. And people abuse my kindness.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for my bad englano, im sure there are more things on my mind, but i just cant think of any at the moment. Looking for your comments, and im really curious if any of you feels the same as i do.\n\nPlease guys, excuse my englano, after re-reading what i wrote i really want to kms. Sorry.
1	I feel pretty similar on all those topics. Only really thing different is that I've gotten really used to small talk. I'd never initiate it but I could answer happily enough. Other than that yeah.\n\nAnd it's sooo awkward explaining to people that I never call anyone
2	Wondering if there are any Beat Makers or Crate diggers in the INFP sub	I love to dig for records (meaning looking for vinyl records) but it's been a while since I've produced any music from it, probably more than a decade. If you're reading this you might be a crate digger and if you are not then no worries, skip to the next post.\n\nI've made short attempts a few years ago making beats again, using an Akai MPC, participating in small challenges on reddit and provided some piece of it on a short deadline. Having a deadline was really helpful or else I wouldn't produce anything :)\n\nI'd love to find out if there are other beat makers, crate diggers in the INFP world. \nLet me know how your expierience for you was so far.\n\nIf you can relate, tell me what's your experience and what's your thing.\n(if you want to send me your soundcloud link I'm up for it)\n\nLet me know I'm not the only one\n\nPeace\n\n\n
2	I honestly love sampling old records. Because I make music so I can put it om streaming services, I don't do it anymore and I really miss it. I have so many beats I'll never use and they're all my favourites. Idk if you've heard of him but 9th Wonder is one of my favourite producers of all time. His sample chops are insane.
1	Yo fellow record collector!\nI make music too but it's weird synthesizer experiments. I'd love to hear the stuff you make!
1	Yeah I've gotten into making beats recently, haven't sampled records really I've just been using random clips I find online or apply a lot of filters to make my original stuff sound grungy
1	Some Rant about Myself	For some reason I feel good about myself when relating to people, so I felt obligated to write basically a brief life story. I think I'm INFP, but there is always the possibility for mistype, so sorry if so. Though it seems the closest I've seen so far.\n\nI have autism and school was really hard for. Socially that is, not academically. I always wanted to interact and be included, but never knew just exactly how one did it. I mostly ended up gravitating to groups or people and staying nearby, but participating was just as difficult - what does one say in a social situation. So in the end, my primary school years were made up of little actually talking to people. The time without them was then composed of staring at nice patterns in the fence, reading and 'making my own fun' by enacting scenarios from a game I played etc.\n\nWhen it came to secondary, I was just as socially unprepared. I proceeded to basically get into a situation where everyone liked me (or was nice to me at least), but still I had no real friends to speak of. So I tried sticking to a group. I sat with them but could never find a way to contribute to discussion. I was never invited to any out of school stuff. Eventually they started to hint I should leave, but they were my only semblance of having friends, which seemed really important to me for some reason. Then my crush asked me to stop, and I did. I basically always had some crush, but usually actually doing anything about it was beyond my confidence. All I could do is send subtle signals so obfuscated they could only be interpreted as annoying.\n\nThen I went to simply not having any friends, which actually wasn't as bad as I expected, but still with the feeling I should have some. It was especially depressing with all the kids TV shows that say 'Friendship Conquers All!' Then came 6th form - I think the first point I was able to interact in a normal way somewhat. But the trend didn't change, and I either sat at a group table (who didn't want me gone this time) on my phone, or alone working on random Maths/Physics ideas, a story, past papers etc... It was difficult to say no to anyone, but also true friendship didn't happen as I couldn't ever say anything beyond talking about the A-Levels.\n\nWhen I then came to uni, everything changed. I'd been imagining uni to get rid of all my problems and it actually did to my surprise. Meeting people seemed easier, and before long I got one really good friend (And a bunch more that only continued as far as the other person kept contacting me). He's an INTJ and somehow we get along really well. My personality of being really quiet had a strange thing of switching to the opposite and being really energetic with my family or by myself. This finally extended beyond that here as he seems to be somebody who doesn't seem to mind me saying everything that comes into my head. It was a surprising change I was happy to embrace. It was very odd then during the Christmas holidays to then automatically revert to my quiet self when meeting any old friends from school. He's the only one I actually actively want/need contact from now, but if anybody talks to me I will happily respond to be polite. And I can't bear the thought of them hating me. And that's something I often exaggerate - I get to know somebody, but suddenly they stop acknowledging my existence - it must be because I was awkward at that social gathering (Turns out it wasn't).\n\nI was surprised so much INFP stuff seemed to fit me, though the more I write the more scared I am I got it wrong (mostly because I want to belong to something and my brain keeps saying each faction is too good for me).\n\nA weird thing that happened once was I was dumped, but didn't actually feel anything. I was really confused because I didn't feel sad and couldn't figure out why, so any insight to that would be invaluable. On the other hand, when I get really emotional (usually over really stupid stuff), I keep it in for ages until it eventually bursts like a flood gate and I'm sad and crying for a day, often then going off on my own and thinking about it for a long time. I want people to acknowledge my sadness, until they offer to help and I suddenly feel it'd be selfish to accept it. The emotional breakdown is normally over by the next morning.\n\nI usually try and use logic to structure any arguments I have, only accepting evidence as a deciding factor. But then I get a choice between something nice and something healthy and always choose the nice one.\n\nOne of my favorite things is fantasy worlds - eg. Star Wars, Star Trek, Inheritance, Harry Potter. But only if they fulfill two criteria - 1) They have a detailed expansive universe I can imagine and is consistent and explored, and 2) Aren't literally our current world in the present or past. When they are done right however, eg. the Dominion War, it's the most exciting thing ever and I cannot stop watching no matter what.\n\nI'm not sure if this is worth reading, but thanks if you did. I wondered if anyone could relate to anything here, or I guess provide explanation or feedback on my life? It almost seems my personality is everything at the same time - Introverted when with normal people, but really alive with some select people. Using logic to decide, except when emotions decide something else is more important. Being an emotional rollercoaster when my parents say 'This is common sense' and I don't get it, but emotionless in a breakup. Being actually quite smart in most things, but acting dumb, using bad puns and using sarcasm a lot in actual speech. Being told I'm a good person, but knowing I only do a fraction of the things I would be doing if I actually was 'good'. Accepting basically any argument or instruction unless there's a really good reason not to.\n\nI feel this'll probably keep going forever if I continue, so I'll just stop now and let you find the conclusion in the last few paragraphs.
54	Did a bit of trailblazing to reach this peak and befriended a cactus at the top

9	The mood of this sub	The last couple weeks have felt so negative.  I'm not talking about the typical "in my feelings" posts, but the ones tearing down those people. \n\nSure, we are all individuals who should be so much more than a self deprecating hive mind contributing to a uniform depression.  However, I feel like all the posts attacking one another are toxic, uncalled for, and childish.  \n\nLet me get this straight.  MBTI should not define any person.  We should not reduce ourselves to our "type," ever.  But we as a community should be better than how we have been acting.  \n\nWe are all individuals at different stages of self discovery and developmental maturity.  I remember when I first discovered personality typing.  I was excited that someone else had been able to define the way I was wired with words that had escaped me my entire life.  I was relieved that who I am was something normal and that I wasn't a broken person.  Finding structure and words and definitions to my "personality type" gave me confidence in my own unique personality.  Defining myself as an INFP allowed me to free myself from all the things I am not and acted as a catalyst fueling my individuality.   But it took time.  \n\nAs I look back on the years slowly inscribing words on the pages of the book of my life, I see so many phases.  If I came here now when I was just beginning to learn who I was, I would have been crippled and stunted in my journey of self discovery.   We need to be accepting people especially if they're depressed or searching for labels.  We need to recognize that they're growing and that time, not harsh words, will allow them to transverse the boxes we inevitably close ourselves within.  \n\nMBTI is a great tool that is easily misused.   Most people fall victim to typing and labeling themselves.  It is important to remember that most people grow out of that stage.  It is important to meet people with love, especially when we disagree.  We are all searching, striving, and growing.  Sometimes it is totally necessary to label and define ourselves to give us a skeleton upon which we build our individuality.  \n\nPlease, I'm begging you.  Stop tearing people down.  You're better than that.  The world does that enough on its own without your help.  Support and love one another.  Remember that people are in different stages of development.  Remember that some of us were hardened by difficult life experiences and others weren't.   Remember that there are countless factors that shape and inspire us into the people we are.  \n\nIf you want to educate people in this community that they are so much more than four letters, I applaud you.  Just remember to do it lovingly.  If you want to tell people their relationship with someone of some specific MBTI will probably be unique, do it lovingly.  If you want to remind people that their career isn't tied to some personality type, do it lovingly.   \n\nIf you think my take on all this is bullshit, then let's discuss it.  I'm also always looking to grow.  I just think that there's been too much anger and frustration in this community recently, and I know we are better than that.  
2	I agree. This sub reminds me of the /bpd sub. If you‚Äôre not self aware of your own identity and strengths , you can get sucked into the mess. Like a crab in a barrel \n\nThat‚Äôs why I usually hang out in the other mbti subs . The /intp one is pretty cool 
2	I totally agree! I think we should respect people enough to give them the space to have their own process, without criticizing their path. Is there a way to include tolerance and acceptance into the description of the sub? I think we need better boundaries around this. \n\nWe have to have faith that whatever people share on here it‚Äôs ALL a part of the process, judging people for being honest and authentic about their emotions is counterproductive and anyway there is NO right or wrong way to take a path of self exploration regardless.\n\nI can‚Äôt stand it when people tell me I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo‚Äù sensitive. I‚Äôm NOT. And who is anyone to tell me I am anyway? I‚Äôm comfortable accepting both the light and the shadow in my life and feeling intense sadness or joy. If people want to put me down for that, I have enough self love to know it says more about them that they aren‚Äôt truly comfortable with themselves than it does about me, but people come here when they are searching and vulnerable and in need of loving kindness and acceptance and this type of criticism will only drive the more vulnerable among us away. Which is really unfair and totally lame, not at all what being an INFP is about, in my opinion.\n\nFinally, I think if people are being unkind and insensitive it‚Äôs our duty as a community to tell people their behavior is not wanted here, in a kind but firm way, to stand up for our fellow sensitives, otherwise good people will leave and only the really thick skinned and reactive people will be left. I think we all need to work on better boundaries so people can feel safe and comfortable sharing openly here.
1	I don‚Äôt agree with the MBTI test. I think it‚Äôs great that you can relate to something and that way it comforts you and you feel good.\n\n
0	It‚Äôs mostly just young people being young, but yeah, it does also piss me off.\n\nBest you can do is just not give weight to those people/their posts because they‚Äôll figure it out for themselves, not by fishing for compliments or sympathy on this subreddit. There are a lot of walking stereotypes and at the same time what they talk about doesn‚Äôt really amount to anything.\n\nI just peacefully wait for the real and good posts to come about.\n\n
30	Took this this morning. thought you guys might like it	
1	Ahh that is a noble pinecone :) Also it looks like you got some chickweed growing there! It makes a nice salad green if your up for learning about foraging around your area. 
8	I despise society so much to the point of no return(Sensitive topic)	I was born a happy childhood and family I still remember I had many friends and I got along with many outside school. I used to be very optimistic and believe in good for everyone and crave for true equality for everything including animals (that's why I was very sensitive when seeing pet stores). Things start to go down when I enter my 3rd grade. I am Japanese and am born and raised in Hong Kong so I attend local school there. In my 3rd grade I started being bullied due to my race but I guess it also because the class seems to be a bit more wild compare to the people outside school that seems to be more friendly. In school, they would beat me, bother me in class and make fun of me even though I didn't do anything wrong. They always call me "fkin jap" and make fun of my country even though I am half. This is where I begin to hate all Chinese and be a pro-Japanese. I still remember I hate Chinese and China so much even now I can't let that hate go aside. But the hate didn't stop from just hating a race. I couldn't tolerate them so I change to a Canadian international school. Things were slightly better with no beatings anymore but I get make fun of due to my weird personality. I learned that I have bad social skills so I try my best to impress others so I can make friends since I was a total loner but I ended up being called annoying. So I gave up after many attempts and decided to walk the path of a lonewolf. Soon I begin to be exposed by gender inequality I felt. Tbh, I was bullied by girls as well in the past but teachers never blame women for some reason and I myself couldn't understand and sort my feelings anymore. In my Canadian school, many teachers were feminists. I still remember my English teacher being so irrational to me but were good to girls even though I did nothing wrong. I feel like she just hate on me due to her instinct but I am used to it. I also had an issue with the group project and another teacher always side with the girl and never at least listen to what I have to say. I always have the feeling many people don't like me on the first impression and even if they do, we will ended up being enemies. I was exposed to both discrimination through race and gender that's where I begin to hate humanity and society completely. I also couldn't tolerate the misandry in media and many shows. Now I feel so much hate, anxiety and stress on this world, on society, feminism, almost everything. I also fkin hate the gender norms, social norms where they force you to be someone. My god.... I just want to be myself. When I refuse to do something that I feel irrational and unfair people would also tell me "man up!" "And you call yourself a man?" WELL FK U! I am a woman then! Fk this world I hate it so much that I wish it burns down. Sorry I just have too much hate in me and I have been locking it so long but I just couldn't.. I joined MGTOW when I couldn't hold it any longer but that doesn't mean I am making friends there. I never expect to get along with people there and I don't think I desire to make any friend now compare to the past since my personal time is more valuable than ever. But I join mgtow because I felt more liberated from society and social norms and realize that I am not alone. But again I have fallen so much now. I just hate everything. I am writing this to be prepared to be criticized and banned. Honestly, this world sucks for INFP and for me specifically. Sigh.. I want to get rid of my emotion so I can truly live peacefully but social norms, gender norms, society's restriction and discrimination will probably get that emotion back from me. Sigh... Sorry. 
5	Reading it, it made me feel your anger originates from not feeling accepted. And that can feel very unsafe. It‚Äôs hard to love a world that makes you feel unsafe. It‚Äôs easy to fall into unhealthy patterns where you either try too hard to fit in while sacrificing yourself, or getting trapped in bitterness and your defensive walls.\n\nI understand it in my own way, I was raised with much abuse and neglect, and then later on got bullied for years. I felt unsafe everywhere, it‚Äôs a horrible feeling. \n\nStill, it is not a ‚Äòtruth‚Äô. It is subjective, a result of all your experiences. That doesn‚Äôt make it less true for you :). But it means that by changing your perspective, you can change your experience. \n\nOne of the key insights for me personally, was: stop waiting for what you need to come to you from others, and start giving it to the world. Indiscriminately. Regardless of how people treat you. Be what you need in your life, whether that is attention, love, compassion, joy... whatever. Embrace it, figure out what it means to you and *be* it. \n\nFor me this worked miracles and freed me from many defensive mechanisms. The funny thing about being what you need in your life is that a: you‚Äôll experience it anyway because you‚Äôre embodying it, b: you‚Äôre not depending on others for it which releases you from a victim mindset and c: people will respond to it positively. Not always, not everywhere, it‚Äôs not like a magical social fix... but people respond so differently to me these days than they used to when I was still so hurt and reserved.\n\nYou can feel better. And you can feel like you belong. Anger, even tho it can be very useful at times, won‚Äôt get you there. 
5	You gotta lotta venom outta you my dude, hope you at least feel better now it's out. Idk why but reading this made me think of vrchat, have you tried that? It's free and kind of a different way to socialize, you may like it! At least worth a try, but that's up to you! 
2	Going through those feelings after feeling let down or betrayed is totally normal. I love the Krishnamurti quote ‚ÄúIt is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.‚Äù\n\nYou are not alone. A lot of us feel disillusioned with the world right now. I may not agree with your politics but I can identify with your feelings of alienation.\nThings were supposed to get better with technology and progress, that was the promise right?\nInstead it looks like people treat each other with more contempt and alienation everyday.\n\nMy solution has been to put my faith in Mother Nature and the spirit world instead. To pray for guidance and wisdom from the ancestors, and stop expecting the modern world to fulfill me.\n\nIt has also helped me to write F#@k you letters, that I never send, of course. This allows me to get out my rage and work through my feelings without fear of being judged or accidentally making the problem worse. \n\nA really good supportive counselor has helped me tremendously as well.\nIt takes work, but I believe eventually you will find healing, if you keep searching and try to have faith.\n
1	Everything originates from yourself, find inner peace. Change how you perceive the world instead of blaming the world for what you perceive it to be. 
3	What would be your perfect place to live?	
2	Norway fjords or Denmark forests 
1	Anywhere warm and sunny. Probably on a tropical island next to a beach. Or on top of a building that overlooks a city.
1	Somewhere close to the mountains and the beach, the countryside and the city, very little rain, and legal marijuana. 
3	Wanted to start a thread that's a variation of a common theme here. Instead of single songs or artists, albums that you love.	We've done song threads before, but I think it would be fun to have one of entire albums as well. Something about really well made albums is special, and I tend to get attached to them.\n\nI'll throw in one I got for Christmas when I was 13 that changed how I thought about music from there on out. Kid A - Radiohead. I know Radiohead is very popular and not exactly a lesser-known gem, but this album holds such a special place in my life.\n\nHere's a link to two songs from it: Optimistic and In Limbo - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUFDJneteU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUFDJneteU)\n\nAs a sidenote: Thom Yorke is a rumored INFP.\n\nAdding another: I've loved all of the albums I've heard by them, but Vackatimest by Grizzly Bear is something special - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5WdKqmK9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5WdKqmK9s)
3	I love this, I basically only listen to entire albums instead of just songs üòÖ.\nMy favorites:\n\nBj√∂rk's Vespertine.\n\nNew Order's Power Corruption and Lies.\n\nAphex Twin's Richard D. James Album.\n\nBeach Fossils' Clash the Truth.\n\nBlack Marble's A Different Arrangement \n\nAnd many more lmao
3	Queen II is easily my favorite album right now. It's a masterpiece from start to end. Though I love (almost) all of Queens works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough out of other ones I've liked:\n\n* American Idiot\n* Wasting Light\n* To The Moon OST\n* Chuck\n* Station to Station
2	(for the moment)\n\nTransformer by Lou Reed\n\nASAP Rocky - Testing\n\nRequiem For An Almost Lady - Lee Hazlewood\n\n
2	Disturbed - Indestructible
2	Palace - So Long Forever
2	Mindless Self Indulgence - Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy
2	Big fan of Jessica Pratt‚Äôs new album Quiet Signs.\n\nOne of my all time faves has got to be Max Graef- Rivers of the Red Planet. bought it on vinyl even though I‚Äôve no record player and no intention of getting one. Tbf its a really slick album cover.\n\nAnd an oldie I‚Äôll always go back to is Stereophonics- you gotta go there to come back. Great album but for me it‚Äôs the nostalgia factor more than anything else.\n\nAlso pretty much anything by Charles Mingus.
59	I know this is an unpopular opinion here but PLEASE : stop equating being weak/frail/inept/etc with being an INFP.	Those are not defining aspects of a personality. Those may be common among individuals with this specific type, but it is in no way a trait. 
25	I hate this stereotype too. It holds people back from becoming their best selves. 
25	I know five other INFPs and none of them fit this stereotype. They‚Äôre all rather determined, individualistic, creative and well-spoken. They may be nice and sometimes quiet but they don‚Äôt let people push them around, either. They may not make a fuss of it but they stay true to themselves regardless of outside influence. That‚Äôs what being an INFP means to me!
12	I am a warrior Queen, √° la Boudicca, Joan of Arc, etc. Fuck with me and you're fucked. I never understood the trope of weakness.
7	Yes! I'm a sensitive person and that is a strength not a weakness. I hate this world for being such a callous and lifeless place so I fight back by not giving a fuck and being myself.
5	I saw a lot of it in a fb page i was in.  All these people assuming that because I'm infp that i must be on the verge of committing suicide or self harm... \nI cry at beautiful moments in life because i appreciate that there is beauty in the world not because I'm weak.  We INFPs are strength personified because we are so aware of everything and everyone. Our intuition exists so we can help ourselves and others.  Our empathy allows us to give support and a sympathetic ear... \nEverywhere i look, there is need for us to exist... so how does that make us weak? 
3	It‚Äôs not an unpopular opinion here I think. That assumption frustrates me. 
3	I've always been somewhat baffled/entertained by this assumption of weakness. In December at my sister's wedding, my grandpa drunk-cried to me about how I better be careful who I marry. "Sarah (my sister) is strong - she can handle a broken heart. You just be careful." Usually it doesn't bother me that people see me as fragile. I know myself well, and have handled things like rejection, abandonment, betrayal, grief, etc.. Do people not realize I've been through some sh*t and come out the other side just fine? Being underestimated has its perks, but it was a little disconcerting coming from someone so close to me. 
2	I see. Maybe it's that unhealthy variants of such tend to visibly express these traits. I do, and still to an extent, identify with these traits, but then again, I'm probably not on the "healthy" side of the spectrum, but, the polar opposite of these mentioned traits here repel me more than the mentioned traits.  But idk.... I think there's a part of me that likes the idea of being seen as weak or frail, yet surprising people, and showing to be quite the opposite when under duress, but that this "strength" of sorts, is not one of insecure aggression, but more of the qualities of being a solid rock, if that makes sense. 
2	I don't see how that'd be an unpopular opinion
2	completely agree! 
2	Every two months or so I see a post like yours and I always wonder where are these posts you‚Äôre talking about. Admittedly I sort by ‚Äòhot‚Äô so I‚Äôm not that well versed in this sub but if I would see them, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get upset like you do. It‚Äôs a phase we need to mature from and I have mostly empathy to the ones who are stuck in it. I may try to correct them but I would do it gently as I know how sensitive we are. \n\nSpeaking from personal experience here. I‚Äôm a male INFP who fought his ‚ÄúINFPness‚Äù in the past. I wanted to be masculine, somewhat, cynical, lighthearted and always strong. Like my ESFJ father more or less. I wanted to stand for myself like a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù.\nThe result- neuroticisms, depression, anxiety and feeling of self betrayal.\n\nSince then I‚Äôve learned how to be strong in my own quiet and kind way. \n\nYour post sounds to me like an ESTJ telling me to man up. 
1	I sometimes feel like this sub has been hijacked by people who post like they know what an infp is. On some posts I can relate, on most of these posts I just don't get the warm and cuddly stuff.
29	Me, how bout you?	
4	yup sounds about right

2	Sameeee
2	Yup i'm messy and make weird noises.

5	DAE have looow energy often? How do you manage this?	Hellooo comrades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I live in London which, although not as climatically crappy as believed, has a mad unpredictable weather god. This past week we have been blessed with some awesome sunshine, super-charging me with a breezy buoyancy and lust for life! Anyway, the lack of sun has really put into perspective for me how much energy affects my ability to be active and productive, and how low a supply I generally have... can anyone share tips or approaches they have to managing time and tasks when they're feeling particularly inert and low? Thanks in advance x\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Lack of sun has highlighted how different I feel when low on energy, how can I get around this?
2	I'd actually suggest getting a blood test. You could be missing some vitamins, maybe vitamin D if sunshine has an impact. It could also be low blood pressure, anemia, anxiety... I don't mean overwhelm you with this, but finding out the causes of my low energy has helped me greatly.\n\nAs for solutions, there's nothing like exercise and healthy eating to boost your energy levels. A boring answer, I know, but it does work. Sometimes just drinking water or having a healthy snack helps. Also, hobbies. Do what you enjoy! 
1	Use your Ne. Do some active . Whether outside or inside .

1	I don't know how I feel about that interpretation of my type.. but I do or did like to imagine I'm flying or driving a different more important vehicle or something when I'm in my car.. but I don't think I am as air heady as she seems... Oh god.. I can't justify this. 
1	Followed some links, didn't know who the INFP was, but she is Aurora and an amazing artist...wow. \n\nTwo videos. VERY INFP...\n\n[https://youtu.be/FqTpi7x-2fg](https://youtu.be/FqTpi7x-2fg)\n\n[https://youtu.be/wNLGztDp5DM](https://youtu.be/wNLGztDp5DM)
14	Regretting what you said or didn't say is the point of having a conversation	I often replay recent conversations about topics that are important to me and of course I often come up with more accurate and better responses to challenging questions or counter-arguments. This often causes some feeling of regret.\n\nI just realized that this is actually quite valuable. You may not have expressed yourself in the best way possible but after all, the conversation sparked some new insight and clarified your worldview.
2	Should I force myself to socialize?	Tl;dr version on the bottom.\n\nA short background: I just moved into a new country. I look obviously foreign here, but everyone seems really kind and is very helpful to me. I am taking language course to help myself to adapt more and to be able to talk to locals. Even so, I really like my own time inside home, doing art freelancing and write some short stories to myself, or perhaps publish it one day. I live with my husband at the moment and he is the main breadwinner, but I still feel like adding both of our join-saving so I have been freelancing small stuff online.\n\nSo, a kind but very extroverted friend invited- with the way of forcing me to join a community of spiritual improvement. Me, being unable to refuse, decided to give it a try, convincing myself it is good to meet new people. It was a nice experience, the people there were very kind. I had nothing bad to say about the community, it was very calming and peaceful.\n\nBut honestly, the idea of having to meet this group every week tires me. The people are nice, to the point that I cannot make any good reason to stop going there. But I realise, my problem is: every week, I dreaded the day of having that group meeting. The thing I dread the most is having to go out of home to do the meeting: to socialise and spiritual sharing. Sometimes I said I am tired (not physically though.. I guess, mentally) so I can avoid to attend the meeting. But I know it is a weak reason for the community, and I am ashamed of it.\n\nMy extroverted friend said that this meeting can untire her (and me) from our exhaustion, but this meeting for me, it is exhausting. Do I sound like I am making excuses here? I once met a member of the community in public and she is 'looking forward to me coming back'. She is very kind and gentle, and I somewhat had the feeling of wanting to go again. But when the day came near, I dreaded to go again and I felt unhappy instead.\n\nWhy am I like this? I had no reason to dislike the group, but I dread socialising a lot even when I know I need to. I am fully content and happy socialising with my husband, and many of my hometown friends (through Skype call and such) and for me it is enough socialising. But my kind, extroverted friend think I am not socialising enough and insisting me to go.\n\nTo add on the top of that: it is a paid meeting. I make random earning with my freelancing and if I am to come to the meeting, I would spend most of my freelance earning that month for the meeting, which my friend told me it is "very important" for me. This adds to my misery (if I can say that) as I really want to save up for my husband and me, even when I don't earn a lot.\n\nI am sorry if I explain it in a messy way, but it is everything connected one with another. I want to hear fellow INFPs' thought in this. Am I being too much? Am I making excuses? Should I actually force myself to socialise? Am I being weird here? If I end up deciding to go for the sake of 'pleasing others' and 'it is important to go out', I would still have the misery feeling every week and my freelancing money will go away for that as well. Is it fine if I refuse to go because I know I cannot possibly live my life, dreading the meeting every week? \n\nIs it bad to stay at home a lot and not socialising as much? Honestly?\n\nTl;dr, my extroverted friend force me to go to a weekly meeting which I have to pay to go to, because this friend told me it is 'very important for me' and 'I have to socialize'. It is a good meeting, but I always have the misery feeling every week before I go. I love to stay at home a lot. The community is very nice so I have no bad excuse not to go, the only excuse is I don't like to socialise, which I think is not appropriate to say.. Should I force myself and keep going?\n\nThank you for the input. I really appreciate it.
4	Why don‚Äôt you cut back on it? Maybe once a month?\n\nOr socialize in a way that feels meaningful and doesn‚Äôt cost you money?\n\nI also think how you feel before isn‚Äôt the best thing to judge; you really should think about how you feel after as the best indicator of how good something is.
2	Your time and money is valuable, and you should try to invest it in things that are valuable to you. This meeting has a high cost but a moderate value, so I'd suggest investing less time (since you probably can't change the price) if you feel like it's worth it.\n\nThis friend sounds a lot like my sister, who is an ESFJ. She will probably be upset or disappointed if you say you won't go and try to change your mind, so be prepared to be firm! It's ok to not want to do things you enjoy sometimes, even if it seems strange to feel that way.
1	You don‚Äôt have to if you don‚Äôt want to. I see no reason to put yourself through it unless you feel a sense of relief after because it was actually fun and it was just your anxiety talking beforehand. That‚Äôs how I tend to socialize, I check afterwards if the whole situation nets positively. If it doesn‚Äôt, I won‚Äôt do it again unless it‚Äôs things I have to do obviously.\n\nShe may tell you you need to socialize but she‚Äôs talking from her perspective. For her it‚Äôs good. For you maybe not. There‚Äôs no wrong or right there, everyone should listen to themselves in these things.\n\nPersonally I‚Äôd see if you can maybe find some people you enjoy having a cup of tea or coffee with when you and they feel like it. Seems much more healthy to me, and it would cut down on the monetary stress. You are perfectly allowed to consider the money, you should invest it in what you want. \n\nDon‚Äôt let others dictate how you should feel. Listen to how you actually feel and see if the outcome is positive for you. If not, it‚Äôs not a good option for you and that‚Äôs fine :).
40	If only reddit could save me	
3	There's no easy way out and no way to make sense of things quickly. But maybe that's the beauty of things, after all. \nDo any of you guys know what to do when you know something, but don't realise it? Because I have that. Like, all the time have that. I wonder if any INFP's have that as well
1	You ok? Need to chat? Send me a message if so.

10	I've got an addiction real bad...	God I love to play my guitar. I've been playing for about a year and a half now. This past month I've hit a huge increase in skill level and I've been blasting grateful dead concerts while jamming along and I just can't stop. I don't know where I'd be without my good old guitar!
1	Tell me about it! I play for 9 years and it's probably my main thing hahahaha
1	me with piano
15	Alright... what‚Äôs with all the idiotic 13 year old girl tumblr post every 2 mins.....	i really don‚Äôt relate to any of them and find myself cringing at it. I‚Äôve taken multiple personality test and i always get infp, maybe cuz i‚Äôm on anti depressants. 
3	Having the following traits as the dominant ones in your decisions: introvert, intuitive, feeling, perceiving - doesn't necessarily mean anything more than that even if you took the test. You don't have to love nature or be an activist or an empathetic altruist or whatever. You are you. No personality test can tell you who you are. \n\nThe MBTI can only accurately guage 5 traits (if we include T and A). The rest can be seen as far fetched pseudoscience. Because it makes assumptions about the combination of what you checked. There's the theory of functions, but well, it's a theory. \n\nPersonally, some things were pretty accurate. And many people that are in this subreddit seem to be like-minded. \n\nAbout the 13 year old Tumblr girls, you know that's what they do. You reach early puberty and you start taking BuzzFeed quizzes and personality tests nowadays. The 16personalities site takes you with open arms no matter which one it is. The sensitive youth, especially intuitive feelers tend to be rather fragile.\n\nWhen most people take the test they feel like God has descended upon them and they're accepted now. The 13 year olds do feel very strangled and unaccepted by their surroundings. They search for communities online. And reposting something that another 13 year old made that they relate to... It makes sense. You don't have to relate. You can cringe. \n\nUnderstand that this personality test is not the personality/intellectual breakthrough that you may be looking for in your life. This is just a bonus to take with a grain of salt.\n
2	Its ok not to get it all. I don't get a lot of stuff on here, and admittedly some things are a little too much for my taste (and I agree with you, can be a bit cringe), but I can empathize with perhaps a time I might have felt that way or an age. Some people who are in a bad place just need to get that out somewhere, or if they feel something odd they just need to say it. If I don't get it, I just move along to something I do get.
2	I think too many people subscribe too strictly to everything which may be present in the box that they choose to align with, and it turns into being offended.. this is why categorizing or boxing yourself is bad, and people don't want to be boxed.. but also for some reason people want to be boxed.. it's rather frustrating and I see a lot of posts in this sub where people want to speak up about it, but it's.. rather pointless.\n\nI hope someone followed that..
2	Maybe because we're all different people. And just because we're INFPs doesn't mean we all are the same gender, age, or take anti depressants. \n\nPersonally i'm okay with posts like that because it makes me happy to know i'm my own breed of INFP.

9	Is it okay if I keep uploading my drawings here? I would love to know what you guys think.\n\nIt's a drawing inspired by Hermann Hesse's novel Steppenwolf. I could relate to him and his process so much, I thought maybe you guys could as well.\n
2	I love how clean everything looks. Also I relate with drawing cuuurves and a lot of hair.
2	I love the ink work! So happy to see someone using pen and ink :) 
7	Feeling more like a loner nowadays	As of recent, I've been feeling more and more like I just don't want to socialize. I do stuff with friends and people I genuinely have come to like, but find that I like doing stuff by myself more. I'm so much more comfortable in my thoughts than directing my energy outwards. It's not even that I'm socially anxious as a person, I just like being by myself whether I'm out in the world or inside. Anyone else feel the same? If so what's a defining  experience where you realized you're perfectly content not being around people?
3	I feel the same. I hung out with friends the other day, and couldn‚Äôt help but wish I was alone. I‚Äôm alone so often, that I‚Äôve become so comfortable in it, and it‚Äôs safe to me.
2	I had depression in my teens years for like 5 years and now that I can look it from outside I am more comfortable with myself. What I have learnt is love for myself, taking my time and just remember it will go away on some point. \nDoing things I like bring me back to be happy not all of sudden but i have noticed that every year I get faster to shift my mood and learning psychology behind and having compassion towards myself. \nIn the starting it would take me weeks or months to get out  off it now in a day I feel better.\n\nExercise, eat healthy, nature time, having rituals helps a lot. 
2	If I could I‚Äôd stay in my room forever. Since I can‚Äôt, I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can I grow to be a giver to others without compromising myself. Cant say I‚Äôm there yet but I guess it‚Äôs part of the journey.
2	Yes, I know that most people hate being unfollowed or unfriended on social media, but do you take it especially to heart a little too much?	Because I do. I ponder for weeks, even months, why the person did that. Sometimes years
3	deleted my social media it was bad for my health, but yeah i dont get sad/offended but i think what i did wrong
2	It‚Äôs a form of social rejection, so it makes sense it could be taken very personally. The Black Mirror episode White Christmas demonstrates it well. I am sorry that happened though. As upsetting as it can be, try not to let it bother you too much. People have all kinds of reasons for doing the things they do, and we will never figure them all out. 
2	I usually just unfollow the person so i don't hurt theirs feelings, even when they screw me
1	INFP to INFJ	 \n\nI was in a conversation with a friend the other day about MBTI and the types. We were exchanging our types and ideas on them. My friend looked at me with a puzzled looked and told me he found me to be more of an INFJ than INFP. I wanted to prove to him that FP is where I have sat pretty for quite some time now so I decided to take the test again.. To my surprise the results were INFJ. My eyes were wide when I read this and of course my ENFP friend over here laughed and sipped his coffee, pleased with my results and himself.\n\nDo you guys think its common for people of these types to bounce back and forth so to say when it come to that last function?
2	The J/P scale is always kinda hard because it is often the least correlated with the cognitive functions. To be clear, the J/P are not functions per se, it only tells if the the extraverted function of your first two is a judging or perceiving one.\n\nINFP:\n\ndominant function is *introverted Feeling* (judging)*;* auxiliary function is *extraverted intuition* (perceiving)\n\nINFJ:\n\ndominant function is *introverted intuition* (perceiving); auxiliary function is *extraverted feeling* (judging)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[EII-INFj = MBTI INFP](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EII_Profile_by_Gulenko)\n\n[IEI-INFp = MBTI INFJ](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=IEI_Profile_by_Gulenko)\n\nThese descriptions are from socionics, a slightly different path from Jungs psychological types. Differing function definitions and function stacks but all in all it has more similarities than differences to MBTI.\n\nI also had the problem that I could identify with both MBTI INFJ and INFP descriptions but the cognitive functions made it clear for me. Though you could also try the socionics descriptions for that matter. The EII-INFj fit much better than the EIE one.\n\n&#x200B;
4	Is it just me?	Is it just me? If someone is late I'll go through a lot of different scenarios of why they would be late, then I'll start thinking they may be doing it on purpose, and start getting mad at the person, who then shows up, and it was something normal. But I'm still kinda mad.
3	I am late myself so often so it doesn't bother me with others that much but I do go trough tons of different scenarios about everything so I guess it is not only you that overanalyse why someone is late :D 
2	My tummy gets upset when I have to wait on too long for someone or something. Like the anxiety of waiting for something doesn‚Äôt go through my head but gets manifested physically. Like I either want to vomit or go to the bathroom, it‚Äôs just weird and bothersome 
2	Yeah, but I don't get mad, I just start to panic and imagine a bunch of horrible things that may have happened. My "worst case scenario" muscles are real swole.
1	yes. my best friend always comes late and i‚Äôm always so mad at him but after 3 minutes i‚Äôm just insanely happy that he is even there xd
1	I keep getting error sending man haha 
1	 I'll either think they're doing it on purpose, or become worried something happened to them. Regardless, when they inevitably show up late for a normal reason, I'm just relieved

7	Unfollowed her on Instagram.	A long-term on and off crush followed me on Instagram when I made a new account a couple months ago. I'm someone who obsesses over things, and overanalyzes things where I don't need to. And I felt like having her on social media meant that I was clinging on, even if I may have convinced myself that I was doing otherwise. I'm sure I'll still think about her for a little while, but if there's one thing I've learned in love and war, it's that the things you want most in life will come to you when you least expect them. \n\nIsn't it funny how that works out? Being desperate for love only makes you more likely to not get it. But if you focus on yourself and treat yourself like you're the prize, like you don't need other people to fill that emotional, lonely void in you, you'll be the right guy/girl, and stumble into the right person.\n\nI'm a believer in fate. While I don't believe in soul mates, I do believe anyone who's meant for you will come to you eventually. And I think that in society, we idealize or over embellish love. Could it be that as I mentioned before - we love that feeling of being in love, because it helps fill that void of unhappiness in us? I'm not saying that it's not natural to want love, but it just seems like we over romanticize it.\n\nAnyway, before I ramble on further, I just wanna say that as melodramatic as it seemed - I did cry when I did it. I guess because it seemed like I was "killing her off in my head". There's just something about letting go that's so difficult. And even if it's just a minor gesture - unfollowing her - it still felt huge. No resentment or disrespect on my end, and I feel like she'll always have a soft spot in my heart, but there's no point in dwelling or being pressed for her, in the hopes that maybe one day she'll feel the same way. \n\nThat only happens in fiction. We live in the real world.
4	There‚Äôs always difficulty in letting people go. It‚Äôs okay. You must do what‚Äôs necessary for yourself. 
2	I felt nothing when I recently deleted my Facebook account of 12 years. Then I realised that I won't be able to see my crush (photo) anymore and finally shed some tears. She's the reason I created a Facebook account in the first place.
1	why didn't you talk to her and see if she liked you?
1	You inspired me to unfollow my old crush. It's way past time...
0	Eh hundreds of children die in Jemen everyday. You will be fine, try to not obsess over these things. 
2	What do you regard as pretentious? We can all agree that the compulsive need to sound poetic at all times can come off as pretentious, but can art in itself be pretentious? I'm curious to what you all think. The way I see it, as long as its honest; is it really pretentious?	
2	Art is in no way in and of itself pretentious. I see pretentiousness as valuing yourself as being much better than others around you and it shows through choices of language and demeanor around others. Occasionally I will do or say something that‚Äôs very pretentious like explain meanings of song lyrics in ways that don‚Äôt really make a lot of sense but sound fluffy and people will call me out. Sometimes I‚Äôm regarded as pretentious because i‚Äôm that one guy not talking to people when i‚Äôm in a large group. It‚Äôs just the personality. 
1	I guess it depends on humans. I often speak loudly on topics that people don't talk that often.  They fear because it could be taboo or "embarassing" or they just don't have much experience on that field. To these people I sound pretentious or condescending to them. I even felt guilty sometimes but it changed. What can I do that I perceive and see the world I see? I only learned to phrase my toughts and ideas better. \nHowever there are pretentious people. I think what it means that you do things only just because it will induce specific reactions. Like I will say that religion sucks just because I know it will bring attention to me or something like that.
2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - March 01	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
8	I had the most beautiful dream last night. I had a girlfriend, but not just any girlfriend, she was gorgeous and silly. We joked around and danced together at random places. Even in my dreams I thought this was too good to be true and I kept trying to pinch myself or do things to test if it was a dream. \n\nNow that i'm awake i'm sad, but also happy. Happy that maybe one day I will meet her, the girl I danced with in the middle of the street.\n\nEdit: Yeah sorry if that was random, I just thought you all would understand this bittersweet moment I just had. Now back to reality :/ 
3	This doesn't really pertain to anything in my life in particular, but I'm curious. Is it okay to keep secrets in a relationship (family, friends, SO)? Like are there general levels as to when it's okay or not?
1	Anyone 30+ in this sub?\n\nOr am I seriously all alone....
1	I feel like Bohemian Rhapsody was good but not as good as people said it was. I kinda wanted more of a personal story focused on Freddie, but it felt kinda slapdash in a lot of ways.

3	Ayyy Wales! I moved to Manchester from Wales recently for uni and goddamn I miss all the nature and beauty. 
2	What kind of clubs have you all joined?	I ask because I joined an anime club, because of course. :P
2	While I have personally never joined a proper club, I found myself LOVING working on the scenery of a school play last year. My school didn't really have that many clubs, but debating and MUN were fun, even if I barely participated.\n\nNow that Im on college I hope to find some more stuff to do, but Im just trying not to fail and learn how to manage my time atm.
2	i don't even know what a club is. As far as i know we don't have that in Spain at places such as college or school
2	Chinese studies
2	Book club baby.
2	My favorite thing close to a club was being a DJ at my college radio station.  Got to listen to, discover, and share a lot of music with other people and made a bunch of friends with similar interests.
6	Sorry?	I was thinking today, and I know it runs in our circle to struggle with mental health, I feel like someone needs to say sorry for our countries letting us down, we don‚Äôt get the attention or funding yet millions of people choose to end their own lives, so yeh sorry I guess. If you have been let down or had to wait weeks for counselling you needed that second or didn‚Äôt have the money to get help it couldn‚Äôt afford the medication they peddle us, they aren‚Äôt going to apologise so I might as well do it. 
4	It's OK, someday having mental health problems will be treated as any other health issue ü§ûour societies are just learning, its up to everyone who's been let down to speak up and change all the prejudices, one person at a time. 
10	i've been following this subreddit for a week now because my boyfriend is an INFP. it's nice that i get an insight into his mind, and i feel a lot of memes here is how he feels irl	there was a post about the best ways to show love to an INFP is to basically do stuff they care deeply about with them, even if you're not into it. oh and being very physically affectionate. both of which he absolutely loves and i'm being more aware to do these things. i'll occasionally send him screenshots of posts/memes here and he'll completely agree with it\n\ni'm an ESFJ and i wish our subreddit was as active as this one :(\n\nbut thanks all, i'll continue watching from afar

3	Just keep on moving forward.  Know the sun rises and sets, but it's always there.  Structure helps.  Exercise help.  Music help.  Hobbies help.  Get passionate about something, but don't pour the entire essence of your being into one thing.  Embrace the peaks and valleys.  Soreness is a sign of growth and only time can heal it.  Be thankful that you feel deeply.  Be your own person.  Don't dwell longer than you need to.  Work toward attainable goals.   The same wind blows the sail and brings the storm.  Set your sights due north and keep moving forward.  
3	I was actually going to bring it up at my next doctor‚Äôs appointment as it‚Äôs starting to really bother me. At my lowest, I can go days without making my bed or doing dishes, I hide from the world and don‚Äôt talk to anyone,  I don‚Äôt care about my appearance much anymore and I get overly stressed out and irritable at work. It‚Äôs ruining my social life, I struggle to keep in touch with people I care about and I even get toxic thoughts blaming those people for my lack of energy when I know in my heart that it‚Äôs not true and that the world is not after me.\n\nSo yeah, I think it‚Äôs worth discussing it with your doctor or therapist, there could be a health issue causing this..

5	Did I get played?	So recently I crashed my car. I was driving too far on the side of the road while turning, skidded out and annihilated the front. Bent the chassis, the front light and the bumper came off. The car was given to me as a present by my father, something I wasn't expecting as I'd been saving up to buy my own and this was a beautiful gift. So it had a lot of sentimental value. When I crashed I wasn't worried that I could've died, I was immediately disappointed that I'd ruined something my dad gave me.\n\nA mechanic who drinks at the pub I work at immediately went to go see it, told me I could get it repaired but it'd probably be as much as paying for a new car. Now I really like this mechanic; when I thought my engine fumes were leaking into my car, he was there first thing in the morning to check it out. When he heard I crashed he went down there immediately to take a look and picked it up. \n\nHe said he'd get it scrapped but he'll need the log book - at this point I'm borrowing a friend's car which I had to borrow ¬£1000 to get insured and taxed - I give him the log book, then a couple of days later he says that just as he was about to take the car to the scrap, his mechanic friends say they could probably bend the chassis back. So he did, it worked and that now he'll replace the bumper, the lights, sell his cars and use mine until he's saved enough to buy his own.\n\nNow he's coming to the pub in my car. Parking it there and I can't help but feel so angry about it but also I'm not sure if it's wrong. He told me he was going to do it like it's not a big deal, so I feel like I'm missing something... Is it because Ive got my own car now? That I wouldn't have been able to repair it without him anyway? My INFP-ness can't get around that he doesn't feel like he's a bad guy for it, so I can't think he's a bad guy..I'm pretty sure he's nice. I've seen him as a nice person for a while with the odd dickishness.\n\nPeople think I should call the police or demand my keys back but I don't know... 
3	I would say something and be very angry. He probably thinks because you are young you will not do anything.
1	You can sit down with him and have him explain what his plan/intention with the car is, maybe there is something that is being miscommunicated. I don't know much about cars either but it does sound fishy. And maybe your dad who bought you the car can give you insight too so if you do need to be a bit more confronting with your mechanic friend you can be confident that there's another person who agrees with you.
1	He took the car? Do you not still legally own it then? 
1	What kind of car was it?
778	I feel personally attacked	
57	I like to smell nice for me, not for other people 
23	I laughed a little because it is so true. I go out so rarely that sometimes i just pretend that I am so i can do all the preps like shaving etc which i wouldnt do but it feels nice sometimes.
35	Still important to practice self care, take care of yourself for you and no one else regardless if you‚Äôre going out or not!
15	Ah don't be it is true :) Just shower and read :) It's better than people anyways. 
13	I like to smell good for me!
9	Haha joke's on them- my sense of smell is very sensitive so I go unscented as much as possible anyway, being perfumed bothers me.
11	[deleted]
5	I love this! XD great sense of humor 
5	Haha. I like those shades of blue though. üíô
6	Might i get the link? Scientific purposes..
3	That can't be true, it smells like brown and blue.
2	Really gave me a good laugh! I think I need this soap around just to make me laugh üòÅ.
2	Wait a minute, I recognize that brand wrapping. Is it from a store in Ann Arbor? 
2	It's probably great for people with skin sensitivities 
2	oof
1	That made me giggle. Thank you for sharing!
1	The soap knows what's up 
1	That's hilarious 
1	Pfffft because we don't stink as much as ppl who go outside. \n\nIt's better to use unscented soap anyway. 
1	Well.. okay. If you insist I will stay at home. 
7	Does my Instagram make me seem like I‚Äôm an INFP?	This is just for fun haha. I saw another girl do this and hers gave off infp vibes if you know what I mean. I don‚Äôt think mine really does honestly. But, just curious! https://www.instagram.com/florangelkay/
11	If you're an INFP, I'd guess you're assertive, because the only INFPs I know are turbulent and have like 3 photos on their insta and theyre not actually in any of them! I'd sooner guess ISFP maybe? You've got a bit of an INFP vibe but you seem pretty grounded in reality
4	idk does mine?\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lance3015/\n:p\n\n‚Äî\n\ni dont think it is like people will look through your photos and be like ‚Äûwoah what is that feeling i am getting of these. its so unique. its so ... oh its so infp‚Äú :D\n\nor is it?\n\nto be honest you do not look as basic as most girls , more like someone who is a whole wonderful world to discover, who is worth the time to get to know, you look naturally pure and cheerful, and as if you understand/feel the world in its true form.\n\nor maybe its just because i know you are an infp haha\n\nno srsly INFPs are the best <3
2	M√°s como una ISFP, pero luego vi tu sonrisa sincera y como tocabas el piano (y guitarra) y ya no tengo tantas dudas, parece que te inclinabas m√°s al lado intuitivo. \nQuiz√° porque sabes tomar muy MUY buenas fotos y sales muy bien me vinieron dichas dudas. \n\n(Vi que eras de Venezuela, as√≠ que este ENTJ peruano decidi√≥ escribir en espa√±ol)\n
2	Yeah definitely got infp vibes from your insta. Musically gifted‚úîÔ∏è soft smiles ‚úîÔ∏è extremely modest yet sophisticated ‚úîÔ∏è  
2	This is fun! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nISFP and/or ESFP vibes (you seem to be with a lot of different people, making the I vs E difficult to place). Lots of Se shown through experience and physicality. You seem stylish, which is also often associated with Se in the top four slots. The page seems more Ni than Ne as well because none of the pictures seem random and/or out of place. It looks like a well thoughtout arrangement. You also seem happy and spontaneous in most of the pics and/or look like you're having fun, which throws huge SP vibes generally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would second whoever said INFPs would likely be more hidden on Instagram. FaceBook would be different though because you have the ability to monitor who (mostly friends and family) sees what more so than on Instagram. 
2	Hmmmm...you have some INFP vibes but overall your page seems more ESFP
2	I'm sorry but to me you look fake.. like something is off. Perhaps you arent as happy as your IG shows?
2	I was going to say no, but the pictures where you're sipping a drink and chilling up in nature definitely triggered my INFP feelies.
1	You seem more S, no eerie blurred stuff lol, so many confident looking pictures of you... *with other people x\_x...* :3
2	Anyone has any experience about relationships/friendship with an ESFP as a INFP?	I'm curious about other people experiences and see if it's common to have specific problems between you and the other person. 
2	My mom. It's a lot of me (INFP) playing therapist/idea wall. On good days lol we both dig food tho
2	I am typed as an INFP and I have a close ESFP friend. We both don‚Äôt like the mbti typing thing because some people dwells too much into it that they reject some people just because they see that they‚Äôre incompatible types to be together. But I do love my ESFP friend, we call ourselves dudes hahah and what I like about it is that we both respect each other despite of us being introvert and the other extrovert.\n\nThe thing that I don‚Äôt like though is that how YOLO her motto in life is that sometimes I find it stupid and just reckless and that despite of giving advices sometimes, she still goes on her way and then I‚Äôll be like, ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt listened to me dude. Ugh‚Äù we‚Äôre also honest to the point we insult each other sometimes but it doesn‚Äôt break our friendship, it just strengthens it because we don‚Äôt like the fake stuff. It‚Äôs a fun friendship btw. 
2	as for friends, it takes months of mutual emotional understanding and trust in order to become well established friends. at that point, they sort of tone things down and the friendship becomes a lot more casual (although the mutual understanding is almost a guarantee that the friendship will not end easily)
1	I often hang out with an ESFP girl, then we often do things using hands or body like sports which she likes and I don‚Äôt like. But also we often talk about what and how we feel and think things. She says talking about those things is very hard and she doesn‚Äôt wanna do that because she is not good at it, but also she says she can do it and have fun when she is being with me because I can help it. So in our friendship, we both try to let each other does what each other wants to do so we both can have fun while hanging out. Also I always tell her things what I feel about her honestly and try to solve problem together, she also does that to me. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt have any problems but actually our style is totally different so if ESFP or INFP stops caring about counterpart, probably friendship gets worse. Because ESFP likes sharing the time or experience while having fun but INFP likes things interesting and meaningful which ESFPs are not interested in so much.I‚Äôm not native English speaker so this could be difficult to understand but I hope you understand what I mean.
81	Just did this with my wall. I figured you guys may appreciate it.	
2	A bit too crowded for my taste. I would put it on the interior back side of a cupboard while still able to open it, and do so when in need of some good, but personally inquired inspiration.
2	Amazing !!
2	I DO appreciate that OP! Great job!
2	my INFP boyfriend‚Äôs wall :)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/8CrOqdK](https://imgur.com/a/8CrOqdK) 
2	I work on my craft 6-8 hours a day but I never feel like im doing enough	I struggle with perfectionism so this might be the cause of it. I draw 6-8 hours a day, on an average day its 4 hours study drawing (boxes, anatomy, gesture, construction), and 2-4 hours a day working on personal drawings which mostly consists of me rendering because I like longer drawings. Ive kept up this pace for the last few months since I decided I wana pursue art, ive only been drawing 7 months prior to taking it seriously so Im behind most others my age pursing the field (im 21). I am progressing fast but I feel like I should be doing more, I never feel like im doing enough, I feel this impending doom before every life drawing class, for example I have an uninstructed life drawing thing on friday and I feel this impending doom of failure that can only be resolved if I study anatomy for 8 more hours and even then it wont feel like enough.\n\nI do like the work I do and I am proud of it, and I think I work hard, its just I wana be great, not just good. So I never feel at peace, I dont know if this anxiety is the price I have to pay for the drive to be great or If I can have my cake and eat it too?
2	Well you‚Äôre probably good enough now that a lot of people would tell you that you‚Äôre a very talented and excellent artist.  Obviously those people can‚Äôt see the potential you see in yourself.  You gotta chill out and start practicing enjoying your craft.  If your focus is set on improving you will miss the learning journey you‚Äôre on - this is usually the period where many artists create their most fine and original works.  You aren‚Äôt some magician and you don‚Äôt have magical powers - you‚Äôre gonna learn at a steady and slow rate like everybody else.  You‚Äôll never be good enough for yourself, and you‚Äôll spend your life improving and improving and improving - and if you don‚Äôt chill out and enjoy your craft more you will miss out on the most meaningful aspect of your art.\n\nAlso, you want to be great not just good?  Those terms are so stupidly arbitrary.  I know you in your mind know where that line is, but it‚Äôs just nonsense.  You‚Äôll improve steadily as you practice, and even if you paint the next Mona Lisa I doubt you‚Äôll feel like a great artist because as your fans crowd around your masterpiece you will scoff and tell them about all the weaknesses in it that only you know about.\n\nEnjoy your craft.  Pursue your craft.  Don‚Äôt worry about how quickly you‚Äôre progressing, make art that you want to make.  Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others and their progress, and for the love of God don‚Äôt expect perfection from yourself - you wont find it and you‚Äôll be disappointed.  You practice like a madman, your improvement will come and it will come quickly.  Be patient with yourself, and don‚Äôt let anything spoil the unending joy you should feel from pursuing what you love.  I wish you the best.  :)\n\nOne more thing.  I reread your post.  You‚Äôre still in school right?  Why the hell should you expect perfection, you haven‚Äôt even finished your instruction yet.  Fuck perfection, fuck it in the face, it‚Äôs bonkers for you to both want to learn such a complex craft and also be afraid of messing up.  YOU NEED TO FAIL!  People learn far more from their mistakes than from their successes.  Also, its pretty stupid for a person who maybe has only studied art for a grand total of a year to be obsessed with perfection.  You are supposed to be learning, and yet you seem frustrated that you just can‚Äôt be great.  Chill out dear friend.  Learn.  Learning is not performing.  Learning is not being the best.  Learning is not excelling past your classmates.  Learning is about knowing your limitations and working to overcome them and it takes a long time and a lot of work to make progress.  You‚Äôve probably made a ton of progress, and you‚Äôll learn more as time goes by.  Be proud of what you know now, do the best work you can, but you‚Äôre not a wizard, you‚Äôre not gonna be a pro if you haven‚Äôt put in the time.  And I don‚Äôt mean per/day time, I mean it just takes a lot of years to get any good at this stuff.  I bet you make some pretty damn impressive art right now, I wish the best dear friend.  :)\n\nEdit: holy shit I read your posts and apparently you are a magician.  That‚Äôs so badass.
7	Discussion thread: Thoughts on dating as it relates to being INFP and MBTI?	I'd like to hear about any of your experiences, whether you've dated a lot or a little.\n\nI've had a lot of dates/relationships over the years (for context, I'm in my 30s), and I do notice certain patterns, but as I've gotten older I haven't dated much at all. I find the dating scene to be thoroughly unenjoyable since there's no longer a novelty to it for me. I think the "newness" of it all was what kept me interested in my teens and 20s. I now feel like I'm almost too picky, in a sense, because my level of tolerance for behavior I don't like is so low.\n\nI do find very weird patterns in the people I date. Ones that I really can't quite explain. I've dated a lot of actors, for example. I've dated musicians, but they were ALL metal enthusiasts. The most bizarre recurring theme has to be the body builders. I'm not particularly athletic, but I've ended up with a lot of people who were into competitive weight lifting or things like that. Got me really into watching strong man competitions for a while.\n\nMy longest relationship, I realize now, was with someone who was a friend but there was no real sexual attraction there. I was only 18 when we started dating and didn't really understand how relationship dynamics work yet. We were together for three years and I broke it off for three reasons: 1) We never did anything new. It was like clockwork and it got very dull. 2) My ex's friends had very strong conservative ideals about gender and country. They were starting to get really into the idea of "a woman's place" and my ex slowly started gravitated that way too. It didn't sit well with me, as I was starting to realize that I felt strongly about gender culture not being so black and white. 3) My ex was turning into a bit of what would now be called a "neckbeard" stereotype. He once made me feel bad for weighing 125 pounds at 5 foot 3 because, when he met me, I was more around 118. He talked a lot about how college girls were and how I needed to be careful before I turned into a college girl stereotype. He was also mean to my friends, and my friends told me they didn't like how he seemed so condescending to me and them. Have no clue what he would have tested for MBTI.\n\nTo balance out with a positive story: My favorite more recent relationship was very short but very nice. It ended with no hard feelings and I think having someone there to care at the time was what we both needed for a little. Interestingly enough, this was before I did MBTI and this guy mentioned that he tested ENFP. He was having a hard time getting over his ex for sure, but we had a lot of fun hiking and going to farmers markets in the meantime. We enjoyed each other's company for sure.\n\nAdding one more story: My biggest fish that got away told me he was an ENTP. This was right about the time I took my first MBTI test in a class so I kinda knew what that meant but not really. We never ran out of things to talk about which was awesome, but I was too scared to ask him out. He was really smart, if a bit too blunt sometimes. I don't know why with him I would have felt so bad about being rejected. It just would have been utterly disappointing. He also seemed flirty with everyone, so things that seemed like flirting might not really have been. He also seemed charming enough to have no trouble with dating so I figured the competition was too much if that makes sense.\n\nJust my ramblings to add to the convo. I'd love to hear more from y'all to see if there are any similarities or differences.
6	I dated an ENFP on and off for two years and it's been the hardest to get over. I felt so incredibly understood, so loved (he was VERY verbal and physical in his affection towards me), we communicated on the same wavelength and always made each other laugh. Ultimately though I think because we were so similar it broke us (and we both had some emotional issues, I would say me moreso). But I never met anyone more dedicated and wholesome, yet still had a good backbone. He was incredibly immature when it came to life, but very emotionally mature when it came to dealing with me. A lovely fucking guy. I think about him daily.\n\nDated someone else who I think was probably an INFJ (which was usually nice although he suffered from severe depressive episodes), and a slew of INTPs (which I just cannot. They're robots and we never mesh).\n\nSTILL WAITING FOR MY ENFJ.\n\nI get what you mean about the pickiness. I feel like it's really hurt my relationships and dating in general is hard because we're such intense idealists. IT'S GOTTA BE PERFECT OR IT'S NOT GONNA FLY.
5	My first ex, and the longest relationship is with an ENFP. We are still friends. I feel like she really knows me. Whenever I get upset I talk to her, because she got a way to calm med down. Always, I'm really grateful for that. She can feel with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy most recent ex is an ENTP.  And yeah, she got a really flirty personality. Almost every guy in school thought she was flirting with them. Most of them even tried to date her but no one suceeded.  After one year of friendship I fell in love with her. She had the same feelings for me. Crazy amount of confidence and selfrespect in that girl, really strong boundaries. I've never felt so great and insecure at the same time by dating someone.  Still healing from the breakup. I really miss my bestfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut seriously, how do we date? I feel like through friendship is optimal. The thing is I don't have any available  or potential friends that could lead to something. I don't go to school right now. Tinder? I can only focus all of my energy into on person if it gonna be genuine. And I kind of want it to be genuine .\_.
5	I dated a lot in my 20s.  Like you found, some patterns appeared.  Some patterns were superficial (left-handed blondes), others were actually worth self-reflection and deeper understanding (controlling or short-tempered).  Until I figured out why I was drawn to women like that, the pattern would repeat.  Grew past it, then I no longer found myself attracted to them.  I've seen enough of that to now question any attraction I feel.  What is it about her that draws my attention?  If it seems benign, then ok.  If instead it seems to be because of some imbalance within myself, I work on that instead.\n\nRelationships are good for discovering what about ourselves is problematic - yet we often see conflict as a reason to point a finger at the other person.  Even if we learn not to blame and to take full responsibility, it makes a big difference *how* the other person works with us to get past the problems.  So it turns out compatibility is more important than attraction.\n\nThe pickiness you describe could probably also be stated as self-respect.  You won't date someone you know is __ because you've done that before and know better now.  So what if he has good qualities or is good looking?  You know it won't work out, so you don't waste your time.  That is just self-respect.
4	Yeah I've definitely noticed a thread of similarities. \n\nMen I dated casually almost always ended up being ENTJ. It's because the confidence pulled me in, but we clashed too much to last.\n\nMen I fell in love with came from both ends of the spectrum, so its shown me that love is not about type, it's a choice. \n\nLongest unrequited love was ENFJ, longest relationship was ISTJ, and my current relationship that feels like a dream right now is ENFP.\n\nI like confident extroverts who are sweet sweet sweet. I adore sweetness. 
3	I am a 24y/o INFP female and my longest relationship was with an INTJ male of the same age which started when I was 17. This was also the first time i heard about the MBTI. In that relationship of close to 5 years, I felt like we understood each other well and I was his first love but things didn't work out due to eventual personality clashes of sorts and family drama unfortunately. I was sure that he and I would get married because of how long and invested we were into the relationship.. :/\n\nAfter that, when I was 22 I had dated an ENFP guy over long distance for a little under a year. He was older than me by 12 years and in the beginning it felt like we had everything in common. Unfortunately he lacked maturity and responsibility somehow and so i disliked that quite a bit. I think he was also suffering from bipolar disorder which was very difficult for me to adapt to and eventually he treated me very badly so the relationship had to end.\n\nMy most recent relationship was with an INFP male who was one year younger than me and this lasted for a little under a year as well. In the beginning i thought we had the most amazing connection and i felt like I was understood. I was also ridiculously physically attracted to him which is not something I think much about in relationships as I normally just value personalities in general. In the beginning of this relationship, I felt like it was finally the end of my search, but then family drama occurred and he was gracious in offering to let me live with him to reduce my suffering. It ended on relatively bad terms because of incompatibility for living together and daily lifestyle and because it was my first experience with living with a significant other, im personally the most discouraged by the failure of this relationship and think that I personally will need a lot of time to heal or I may just forget about relationships in general due to personal trauma :(\n\nDating is hard and despite the fact that I value relationships more than anything in this whole entire world, sometimes I guess we just have to cope with ourselves and hope that we never have to settle for less than our ideals, even if our ideals are perfection.
2	Yes, the amount of actors with hyper high sexual energy that I attract is incredible. But since Im a musician I had very boring dates with other musicians since they were so close minded about this art. Also for some particular reason I atract the yuppie logical extrovert for some reason and they usually get really offended by my chill-stoner 0 drama vibes.\n\nI just ended a relationship with an ENTP who drained my patience with his controlling behavior. It s so painful to fall in love with someone who loves you but speaks almost a different language. Thats the only relationship I had in my 27 years. Anyway, my english is broken so Im gonna take a 2hrs break.
2	Put me in the dating a little category. Very little. Ok none at all. Everyone makes it seem so easy.
2	I was with my ex husband for 7 years (married for 2) and it literally killed a piece of my soul. I dont know his MBTI type, but he was very cold and emotionally distant. I would ask him often, ‚Äúdo you even feel emotions?‚Äù He also never wanted to be intimate and affection is so incredibly important to me. Towards the end I felt so hollow and desensitized. I will never be with someone who is that emotionally unavailable again.\n\nMy next boyfriend was suuuuper affectionate and it was fantastic. Unfortunately he had a lot of growing up to do so I just recently ended it.\n\nRight now I‚Äôm not interested in dating. I have noticed that all my serious relationships have been with people I‚Äôve known for a long time that blossom into relationships. I‚Äôm definitely not opposed to Bumble. Never tried Tinder. \n\nI‚Äôve also never dated two guys at the same time. Even if I was just casually dating them I would feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong. Or maybe I just simply don‚Äôt have the energy to keep up with dating multiple guys at the same time. \n
2	I'm in the end stages of a relationship with an ISTJ I love dearly but we know we are not "the one" for each other. We've both been putting off the breakup because we are so emotionally dependent on each other but when I move away for a new job we know it will happen. We've been dating since we were both 17 and now 23 year olds and have never gone through something like this. My relationship sounds eerily similar to the one you describe in your second paragraph. \n\nWho do you talk to when you are single? He is my best friend and the first person I tell everything to. The typical INFP in me doesn't want to bother my friends and family with the types of conversations I have with my SO. I can't remember what I did when I was single, share more with friends? Or just not share as much at all.
21	Self Discovery and introduction	 Hi guys,  \n\n\nI'm a guy, 38, french, software developer and recently took some personality tests.  \nI discovered that I'm INFP.  \n\n\nAfter reading some things about this personality category, I almost totally recognize myself in it.  \n\n\nEasily emotional, tears in the eyes while listening to intense music or movies.  \nI'm working in a 4 developers open-office.  \nOne year ago, we had a new colleague in the team. Sympathetic, but extremely noisy and a really heavy, crappy sense of repetitive humor.   \nTalking to himself loud. Whistling. Singing.  \nAlways commenting conversations, even if not asked to.  \n\n\nI asked him a few times if he coud stop talking loud and it worked for a few weeks, but he can't help.\n\nAnd I don't want to be seen as the man who always feels disturbed.  \n\n\nWell, after 12 years in this small company, I decided to leave. Not only because of him, he's not the root cause ; but part of it anyway.  \n\n\nTwo months before I leave, time is long when you're waiting for something :)  \n\n\nAnyway, I feel better now because I know that I'm certainly not alone to feel that way.  \n\n\nHi to you all guys !  \n\n\nNico 
16	Hello. For your next job you can introduce yourself as an INFP. If it doesn't go well you can explain "INFP means I'm the New French Programmer".
3	Sweet! You go!
3	Best of luck in your new ventures! :) my husband is also an INFP developer, and he feels alone sometimes. Glad to see others are out there! :D I think your creativity has to help in development, and the idealism is always good, in my opinion! 
2	Hey mah man ! Turns out i'm not the only INFP French dev around these parts :D\n\nBest of luck to you ! Here's to hoping your next job will go extra smooth :)
2	Greetings from a 41 y/o INFP guy.  I'm also in software engineering (except i'm a tester that wishes he had the coding skills to be a developer).   I work from home, which was great the first few years, but I think it's slowly driving me insane.   Your loud talking and whistling colleague sounds annoying, but there's a part of me that yearns to be in an office with someone like that.   The only person to annoy me is myself and that's not good haha.  I do have a team, as my company practices scrum, but it's just not the same when you never see any of them face to face.  Are you going to pursue another software engineer job or are you thinking of trying a different career path?
2	26 y/o infp girl. \n\n*says "hello" in silence*
4	Hi fellow INFPeople, what music genre, type, or song, just "does" it for you?	I am enjoying a song callled clocks by Niklas Aman it always gives the brain power a boost.  I have found I can only enjoy music that has little to no speaking so instrumentals are my fav.  Any music with layers and fusion of sounds and tones always gets my mind and spirit so busy. Like vaporwave, ambient, and anything from metal to hip hop.  Each type is for a different mood.  But almost all are non vocal How bout you folks?
5	Most of the time it's the more melodic electronic music (Illenium, MitiS etc.) to keep my spirits up. Recently also a alot more of the more weird and creative type of electronic (ZES, Taska Black, Lorn). Also Ambient and Chillstep if I was around many different people for too long to recharge (Jacoo - Withering   is one of my favourites). I also like some K-Pop bands.
2	I like opera for focusing on the quality of the voice. Probably the quality of sound is the best general statement I can make. Sometimes I need the energy of a form (Queen, etc etc), or the playfulness within musical and lyrical elements (Stephen Sondheim), pure genius (Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Satie), or an iconic spell (Dark Side of the Moon), creativity (Herbie Hancock), my playlist is the most eclectic I know of. I'm suggestible. Suggest something :) 
2	Aaaah, There's too many to count. It ranges from Vocaloid to Owl City, to K-pop and J-pop, to complextro, big room, electro-ish music in general, then There's anime and game music, Vexento, Icona pop, T.A.T.U, the Pet Shop Boys.\n\nAnd a whole lot more so I'm not going to bore you with even more.üòπ
2	Really depends on the mood. That's why I have around 50 playlists with different themes and genres on my spotify ha ha (I actually began doing that with 8tracks.com, those playlists were badass).
2	I‚Äôm really into alternative r&b now .. Solange Daniel Caesar Sabrina Claudio .. HER.. \n\nSummer walker - girls need love too . \n\n
2	This song is all I have mostly listened to for the past 6 months. Its the best song I've ever heard, and it did something to my soul. Paul Brady is a master musician, and I hope his interpretation of this song touches you the way it did mine:      \n\nhttps://youtu.be/cBGkhPx529g
2	same. i love a lot of electronic genres most people that is ask about never heard of.\nfor me music is about music and freedom of imagination and feelings it gives to you, and not about someone singing about something.\nfor every mood there is a perfect fitting genre :)\n\nand yess the last months im hard into vaporwave <3 \n\n‚Äî\n\nwhat brings me the most placidity is probably\nambient intelligent jungle (like the label Omni Music UK)\n\ni got to love breakcore last year. some years ago i couldnt have imagined to ever enjoy such chaotic  styles, but here i am. (venetian snares, the flashbulb, ruby my dear, squarepusher, enduser, ...)\n\nfrom the music that can be labeled as a genre my last few years favorites were:\nDrumfunk,\nHalftime,\nLoFi House,\nUnderground Dubstep,\nBassline Garage,\nLiquid Funk,\nVaporwave,\nBass House,\nChillhop,\nRaggaDub,\nBreakcore,\nPsy Trance,\nHard Techno,\nDrum&Bass,\nCrossbreed,\nIntelligent/Ambient Jungle,\nNew Retro Wave,\nNeuro Hop,\nRiddim,\nSpeed Garage,\nUK Garage,\nCyberwave,\nNuDisco,\nFuture Bass,\nJump Up,\nHybrid Trap,\n...\n\ni also really appreciate music that is very experimental and that i cant even categorize. when its pure noise, ambience, glitches...\ni just call it ‚Äûmusical colors‚Äú :D\n\n

1	This city is killing me- dusty brown\nDlz- tv on the radio\nJane doe- converge\n\nThese are usually my go to songs if Im feeling super emotional. I listen to just about anything except country. I‚Äôd say my favorite music is super chill ambient electronic music. 
1	*Ludovico Einaudi* anyone? 
1	Soundtracks from movies and games. In music I get more caught up with the melody than the lyrics.
1	Lounge and melodic progressive house. Mmmmmm.....
1	I really like Twenty One Pilots.

2	A bit gloomy, but great stuff, homie! \nLove the part about wishing death on the birds lol
5	Being an INFP and working as a theater actress...feel like Jekyll and Hyde...	Seriously, no one would guess that this is what I do as a first impression. What the hell happens when I am on stage? Also, auditioning is a torture, unless they happen on my scarce loud caffeinic crazy days. 
2	I super love theater. Maybe because I don't like the limelight on my personal life, but give me a mask and baby watch me shine! \n\nSo awesome! How long have you been in this field??
2	Well... Oh, I remember once  \nwhen we were in the city...  \n...we tried doing an improvisation...you know,  \nthe kind that I used to do in New York.  \nUh, everybody was supposed to be  \non an airplane...  \n...and they've all learned from the pilot  \nthere's something wrong with the motor.  \nBut what was unusual  \nabout this improvisation...  \n...was that two people who  \nparticipated in it... Fell in love.  \nThey've, in fact, married.  \nAnd when we were...  \nYeah, out of fear...  \n...of being on this plane,  \nthey fell in love...  \n...thinking they were going to die  \nat any moment.  \nAnd when we went to the forest,  \nthese two disappeared...  \n...because they understood  \nthe... The experiment so well...  \n...that they realized that to go off together  \nin the forest was much more important...  \n...than any kind of experiment  \nthe group could do as a whole.  \nSo, uh, about halfway  \nthrough the week...  \n...we stumbled into  \na clearing in the forest...  \n...and the two of them  \nwere fast asleep in each other's arms.  \nIt was around dawn,  \nand we put flowers on them...  \n...to let them know we'd been there,  \nand then we crept away.  \nAnd then on the last day of our stay  \nin the forest, these two showed up...  \n...and they shook me by my hands,  \nand they thanked me very much...  \n...for the wonderful work  \nthey'd been able to do, you see.  \nThey understood what it was about.  \nI mean, that, of course, poses  \nthe question of what was it about.  \nBut it has...has something  \nto do with living.  
2	Ugh YES! This is why I inevitably had to not pursue theatre. I couldn't push past my audition fears. But being on stage is so fulfilling. Taking over a role and becoming the character is some therapeutic shit.
1	Why, because you are in front of a crowd?  It seems that wearing the mask of a character would ease the anxiety.  Far more stressful to be *yourself* in front of that crowd.  Or is this not so?
2	Not able to stand for something	I think this may be related to fear or a kind of distaste of becoming rooted in some fashion, and to start with, there are issues of being able to stand up for oneself. With ideas, my default is not to tear down, but to think how something may or could be, while at the same time, not being very invested within them. It's like a detached, "seems cool" kind of sentiment here that more often than not, doesn't get applied to anything. \n\nThere's also the idea that if something sticks out, it could be struck back down, so a fear here of that "striking down", or the consequences that follow from it may exist. But there's something about "rooting" or being "set", or making a firm decision that I just don't like or relate to. It just seems to cancel out other possibilities, and perhaps that's why I find it to be frustrating. I'm not exactly sure why either; Could be related to the Ne. I understand the other point of view; someone could view me as very wishy washy, "not all together", passive, and overall, a lame, milquetoast "sheep" or something along those lines. I'm not sure I'll do anything to change their mind about that either. It all just seems to be tiring, but I could see a situation where standing for something may be preferred. 
332	So I wasn't the only one who did this	
63	that insane amount of relief after figuring out the text would end before it ever got to your turn
19	I still do this now in high school.
10	Or trying to predict when you will be called on for a stand up presentation. god i can almost taste the fear and dread of watching the clock and calculating whethere there would be enought time for you to go that day. i could probably get fired from my job and evicted from my apartment today and it would be less stressful than then
9	I did this if I wasn't spacing out that day, in which case I'd be totally lost and get in trouble.
9	This was actually the only time I was confident participating in class because the words were already right there for me haha
7	I did this during college Latin class. I'd count the people in front of me and find the sentence I would need to translate and do it before the professor called on me. \n\nOnly I miscalculated one day and completely fudged the translation. The professor shook his head at me and said, "You can do better." üôà
5	I continued doing this in college.
3	In elementary school I was the one who corrected everyone at the hard words cuz I‚Äôd be reading ahead. My 4th grade teacher thought I was an egotistical asshole, at the time I had just wanted to help, not hurt
2	THIS.
2	Just did that today at Latin class aswell üòÇ
2	Actually no but I would start laughing so loudly in the middle of the reading because the anxiety was realllll
2	Yes but then saying it wrong anyway because the pressure is on ! 
1	I had a really hard time learning to read as a child, and would be so embarrassed to stumble over the words that I would just make up my own none sense story when it came to my turn and get in trouble. I also had really bad hand writing and would fill in essay questions with spice girls lyrics. Always thought this was an awful way to get children to read. Teachers had no sense of humor and would just publicly shame you, rather then be encouraging and help you through your mistakes. I guess it helps introduce you to the real world where everyone will judge you, but man dose it leave trauma scars. 
2	Inexperienced (20M) INFP seeking advice	This is my first post here and I'm very excited to hear (read) what you have to say. I've been in only one relationship, which got off the rails pretty quickly and it's been quite a while since. My question is: how do you get over the feeling that keeps you from talking to someone you like? It's been hell for me for as long as I can remember.\n\nThe relationship I had was started by my now ex girlfriend (obvious hints, holding hands etc.) and I kinda went with the flow. I can't even remember what happened, it just did xD\n\nAny advise or stories will be highly appreciated. Thank you for your time! 
8	Dude. Just do what I did and don't initiate anything. Then regret every single missed opportunities 10 years later.\nJust do it! Do it the way you feel like, be honest but do it!
2	Eye contact, smiles, being nice, being supportive, opening up about yourself, trust them. I feel like that is most of it.
2	I think it's really good to practice keeping them human. If you put them into a category of this special person you really want to not mess things up with, you'll never be able to relax and just be in the moment. So try to remember they're just another human like yourself, looking for a meaningful human connection :)
2	Simple, Make it so that u take action before ur brain has time to intervene, if u cant do it in 5 seconds it aint happenin
2	You just have to really know your worth and if they‚Äôre worthy. If they stopped talking to you or they wanted you out from their connection, then do the same. Kick them out of your picture too. They don‚Äôt deserve you. Sometimes, you just gotta acknowledge that your sanity matters more. We can‚Äôt be martyrs. But if you see a window of interest or perhaps flicker of hope from the other side, then perhaps it just needs a little push and efforts to win a girl‚Äôs heart. Take it easy too kiddo. Sad but these days, people are way into temporary things, know what you‚Äôre investing yourself into. Although scarce, there are still gems out there who will stick for a long time and be willing to have you. 
1	I usually take a deep breath, roll my shoulders back, remind myself that "people ain't shit," and that most people who have gotten to know me think I'm cool. I usually ask basic questions that you ask a new friend when you're trying to learn more about them. e.g., birthplace, music, hobbies, family, etc. I like asking about music and making playlists for people if we have similar tastes. 
1	Write her a poem . Or draw . Or invite her to a concert ..casual . ‚ÄúOh I have two tickets to .. ‚Äú
543	I love this kind of eerie pictures.	
11	Oh wow that's nice.  Not exactly eerie to me.  But maybe.  (Of course I'm INFP so I can't decide.)  Pretty anyway.  Thank you for sharing!
3	Why are all the signals on? Someone is going to crash

2	You'd enjoy [@patamuswarmer](http://www.instagram.com/patamuswarmer) on instagram. Scroll down a bit for pics like this one.
2	Oh wow!  Neat photo, quite evocative. \n\nAway from the city where you can actually see the stars.
2	Hey,  that's my Gboard background!
2	Have you checked out Gregory Crewdson? He's got some uncomfortable eerie art. It's kind of suburban/middle class noir.
2	This was my desktop background at work for a long time. I love this pic.
2	Beautiful! 
2	I'm right there with you, so beautiful.
2	That's beautiful :) 
1	I love this kind of photography too!! Seriously check out this account on Instagram, the energy in her photos are beautiful and eerie too https://instagram.com/s.ilver?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=1b4jxxfendmma
1	Beautiful!!
1	Outgoing One Sometimes....	So I have always been super outgoing when no one else was. Like, I will dance and be silly randomly in front of people, but I hate dancing at clubs or when other people are dancing. Idk?
2	Honestly, I feel this. Like in group projects at school with people I didn‚Äôt know, no one would talk and just stare at each other, but I would take the initiative. Even today, I was at an orientation and all the girls I sat with were quiet until I broke the ice. In any other situations with others who are outgoing, I‚Äôm quiet or nervous as hell. 
3	Should I feel guilty about not wanting to go out and do anything today?	I‚Äôm trying to push myself to wake up relatively early, go out and experience the world on my days off. Yesterday I succeeded at the waking up, cleaning my room and cooking breakfast, but then I just couldn‚Äôt find any desire to do more: it‚Äôs cloudy and rainy, and there‚Äôs nothing specific I can think of doing. No movies I want to see that I haven‚Äôt already. I work weekends, so Tuesday is my Friday. As such, there aren‚Äôt too many activities in my city during the week because most are at work. I‚Äôve thought about just tracking down local comic, and music stores and just spending time there in my downtime, but I don‚Äôt know. When I can think of anything to do, or when it‚Äôs gloomy outside (which has been just about everyday since October where I am) I just prefer to stay in. But I always get guilty when I do this because I feel like I should be out enjoying my day.\n\nShould I feel guilty for not going out even when I truly can‚Äôt think of anything to do?\n\nAre there any simple activities I could do that any of you guys do regularly that I could try to break out of my comfort zone? I like writing, gaming, movies (I will be seeing Captain Marvel next week so there‚Äôs that), comics, stand-up and open mics, and concerts (I‚Äôm seeing one of my favorite bands in March). 
2	I don't think you should feel guilty, everyone deserves a day "off". Just to turn yourself off and enjoy living, this world is already pushing everyone to be busy every moment of every day.\n\nIf it makes you happy to be busy, then by all means, do so. But if you're feeling like doing nothing for a day, well, who is to say that isn‚Äôt fine too.üò∏
2	Why should you feel guilty? Enjoy the beauty of the world around you. 
1	Just a random idea. Maybe if you live in a cool place you could try and get into photography. Just exploring and getting to know different parts of where you live and also taking fun photos 
5	Tips for talking?	Does anyone have any tips for just spitting out your words? I am not sure if this goes for everyone- but I feel as though I have a good grasp on what goes on in my head. When it comes to saying it out loud though, I either don‚Äôt articulate what I‚Äôm thinking in the right way or I just blank hard. Any advice? Sometimes I feel like my journal is the only thing in the world who truly knows what I‚Äôm thinking and how I‚Äôm feeling. 
4	i feel this... in my head it makes sense but expressing it is impossible 
3	Sorry I don't have any change on me right now
3	Honestly, I rehearse a lot beforehand ha ha! \n"What you understand well, you enunciate clearly".\n\nBut yeah, we're better at writing for sure. 
2	I wish I had some great tips but I can only offer some understanding lol. I too can never seem to express what I want with spoken word. If there is *any* pressure for me to say something I will go completely blank in the head. Sometimes words sound very beautiful and philosophical and wonderful in my head but come out so flat and lame once I let them out *or* I just can't find them anymore when I need to. I also often "think in English" and have trouble translating thoughts back into my native language without them turning ugly but I guess that's a different thing completely. :D\n\nWriting is the only time I can let my words out the way I intended to. And sometimes when I'm talking to myself too. 
2	Confidence for one, might sound strange, but it's true. Nervousness breeds awkwardness. Then there's experience, the more practicr you have the more you have to draw from when communicating. Just try to externalize as much as possible with you shoulders back and your feet planted.\n\nPs. Maybe don't listen to me. I'm an awkward piece of shit irl.
2	Did I write this and forget?? Lol things always sound so much better in my head, but when I open my mouth it‚Äôs a train wreck. I‚Äôve gotten a lot better the older I get. The more you speak the better it‚Äôll get. Try reading things out loud when you‚Äôre by yourself. Also, speaking in front of a mirror might be helpful.
1	This is a little extreme but I started to take the drug propanolol for public speaking and found that on those days when I took it I was more well-spoken in general, even when not in front of a crowd. It lowers your blood pressure so I was relaxed and didn't feel the extra anxiety of "oh my words aren't coming out right, I'm sounding like a fool" while simultaneously forming my sentences. I can practice speaking and observing how it feels so that when I don't take the drug I can find that mindset again. It's my miracle drug for sure!
4	What do you think about ISTP's?	
8	So why you're really asking is that you like an infp and wondering if they could have interest too? 
5	I am married to an ISTP. \n\nOf course I love him-for many different reasons. \n\nThe most frustrating thing can be how much I like to elaborate on what I am feeling, and upon the feelings of others. Oftentimes my husband seems to do things in a systematic way. Not saying he can‚Äôt be tender and show emotions in what he does. But as an INFP, it feels like I have a built in system evaluating my emotions and the emotions of others. I am sensitive to emotional things, and when conflict has to be addressed, it takes a great deal of effort to confront it-if I do at all. Meanwhile if my husband knows a conflict needs to be addressed, generally he will just go and take care of it.\n\nWe both enjoy quiet time, and while other people fill our ‚Äúsocial cups‚Äù we don‚Äôt seem to fill each other‚Äôs. \n\nI appreciate many aspects of him. But I do wish he would be more open about some of his feelings, since that‚Äôs so big for INFPs. We INFPs care about the little details ISTPs may disregard. \n\nHe‚Äôs 28 if that makes a difference.
4	I can only speak of my own experience with the only ISTP in my life: my father. \n\nFirst of all, he's a very hands-on kind of person while I'm the very opposite of that. We don't have too much in common and even if we do, we enjoy different parts of the same thing. F.ex. he is fascinated by musical instruments while I find wonder in the stories and meanings behind lyrics and melodies. He focuses on the world surrounding him and I focus on the world inside my head. Sometimes I can't keep up with what he's going on about and sometimes he'll get overwhelmed by my talk of theory. But he is in no way dumb or shallow though. We have had a few great talks about politics and world's injustices. Our point of views are just very different. He is more of a realist while I am an idealist.\n\nI admire about him his general lack of corcern for other people's opinions. He doesn't really care about what's fashionable or popular but is instead driven by his own intrinsic motivations. My mom (ISFJ) is the worst overthinker ever and I know he finds her hassling and worrying to be a complete waste of time. He is in no way a people pleaser. He doesn't make sacrifices for others unless it's for someone he really cares about and unless they truly appreciate his effort. He shows his love with things that he does, not with words. That makes it sometimes hard for me to talk to him because I really **like** to know about what's going on beneath the surface while he probably prefers to keep all that stuff hidden away in some deep dark cave in his subconscious. \n\n***Overall*** an INFP and an ISTP will generally be very different but I don't see why we could not still get along and care for one another. Personally I find there's this aura of quiet confidence and perhaps a little taste of danger in the way ISTPs unapologetically present themselves and I find it very attractive. But maybe in long term I might start to find them a bit underwhelming and vice versa. Idk lol. I hope this wasn't a completely useless word vomit. 
3	My absolute best friends both tested ISTP when they took the test. One from high school, one was an old roommate.\n\nWe were (are) so, so different at yet at some weird level we still understood each other. One of my best memories is having chinese food on Thanksgiving with my old roommate because our family's lived in other states. We watched some random videos on youtube and had a great time.\n\nSo far, anyways, all around cool cats. 10/10, would friend again.
1	ew. wild pseudo-intellectuals (my brother's an istp, so i know from experience)
1	Intelligent, hilarious, and very desirable in a way (his Se was sexy, his Ti admirable, his Ni intriguing), but forever hard to really know or feel emotionally intimate with was my experience with one ISTP. We clashed when it came to his Fe and my Fi. He was more social than I was while at the same time, clueless as to how to deal with people.
56	Saw every one sharing their art / photography. Here's something I took during the summer	
2	Beautiful, where is this
2	Trees hold a lot of symbolism. I like how the branches sort of stick out like knives to protect it's trunk and stands tall like even though it's lost it's youth it shows that it's strong as ever.
2	This song is so INFP (About the struggles of depression)	Watch the video and read the lyrics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZkI3ASz8Lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZkI3ASz8Lg)
2	Not responding to friends or family who want to connect with you is sooo relatable. I don't ignore my mom's calls, but I get extremely anxious when I see a call from her coming in. When I'm talking to her, I can't wait for the conversation to end and when I don't talk to her for a while I start to miss her but it feels like we never have much to talk about. 
31	The worst thing you can say to an INFP?	I'll start:\n\n"Nobody cares about your experiences or whatever creative product is representative of them."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
45	Don't be so emotional.
21	Relax \n\nIt‚Äôs not that serious 
22	I hate when people aren‚Äôt paying attention to what I say or feign interest in what I say. I‚Äôd much rather have them straight up tell me they don‚Äôt care or would rather speak about something else (even if it would be hurtful to me).
18	Idk about INFP in general, but I got hit with one that most likely affects INFP males due to stereotypes:\n\n"You wouldn't know, you've never really been under emotional stress"\n\nI mean yeah I have but my coping mechanism is to deal with it internally thanks, you just don't know because I had to get good at hiding it.
11	That's a bad idea. Makes me quiet when my coworkers say it.\n\nI live in fantasy where every idea works out. 
9	How unoriginal 
12	Anything while I‚Äôm already speaking because I will instantly shut up
9	Anything that attacks my character. I try so hard to be kind above all else, so an insult to my character is the worst thing I can hear.\n\nEdit: That, or insulting my intelligence and meaning it, but that might just be me.
22	Any variant of "nobody cares" is up there. As is insulting me for my core values or aspects of my identity. I've heard both of those my fair share of times, being fundamentally an idealist, as well as a non-neurotypical LGBTQ person.
8	stop overthinking, it's no big deal, stop taking things so seriously, you're wasting your time, you're too emotional, etc
8	How's the weather? What do you do for a living? What do you drive? \nAll meaningless.. imo
6	Gaslighting and invalidation. I don't care about randoms, but those I really like and respect (note: there's not many of those people). 
6	"You're impractical and you can't survive in the real world."\n\nThis one hurts so, so much.
6	- Why are you so serious?   \n\n- well because that's the ducking way I am, you peace of shtttt (that's what I would think while burning all that's precious to him/she in my mind) 
5	in my case, any kind of condescending tone hurts me right in the guts and makes me angry, but I don't know if it's a infp thing at all\n\n&#x200B;
8	‚ÄúOkaaaay. So?‚Äù üôÑüôÑ\n\nLike, for real? I‚Äôll give you ‚Äúso what‚Äù, you friggin‚Äô jerk! Arrrrgh!!!! I freaking hate that expression/face they give you with those words. At least freaking act like you give a damn!
4	"There is only one way to do this" or "that's just how we do things".\n\n In situations where these are obviously not your only choices, why limit yourself? 
3	When you put effort into something and someone comments about your work even when they didnt do anything.
5	Part action, part saying. "You're too good for me" *removes themselves from your life despite your best attempts to help them*
4	That's not how the world works
5	‚ÄúGet out of your head‚Äù
4	Defending/protecting myself for the first time in my life and then the other person calling me selfish and/or toxic.
3	Just do it, everybody else is.
3	"You need to toughen up. You're too sensitive and its childish. Learn to act like an adult and not be so weird!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso: \*Shows someone something I'm working on or that matters to me\*\n\n"Yeah, sure whatever. Anyways..."
3	One I really don't like is when people try to joke and poke fun at my being quiet by saying, "God, you talk so much, I can't get a word in edgewise!" Cause even if I would have had anything to say, I'm sure af not going to now. 
3	"You only do useless things."
3	Ah, reading this thread made me feel like I accidentally stepped into ESTJ/ENTJ/ESTP territory. It's bringing up all the insensitive stuff my friends of those types said so shamelessly and sternly to me. "You're such a kid." "Must I babysit you again?" "You're always sensitive!" "You just have to be the whiniest bitch!" "Drama queen!" "She doesn't get it." Agreeing with each other (AKA ganging up on me) in their condescending "adult" petty tone because they can't comprehend how I think. Clearly I'm triggered and now I must take my leave to cool off. 
2	I would simplify yours to simply ‚ÄúNobody cares about you‚Äù. Which, yes, I have been told.
2	Stop overreacting. Don't act in the heat of the moment
2	Lmao!!! Good one
2	‚ÄòThat‚Äôs lame‚Äô\n\nNot really a phrase but when people are really patronizing when I‚Äôm expressing my hurt. Sometimes I rather people just listen to me instead of tell me what I‚Äôm doing wrong.\n\nWhen they say nothing at all or make a face like I‚Äôm an alien.
1	I said "we should go just for the free food" to an INFP I had just met, she reacted quite seriously :/
1	Smile
105	A calming sky/travel aesthetic	
7	Very Vaporwave
4	Where is this?  I know in San Diego the strip is really short and they get really close to the ground like that but it doesn't really look like San Diego?
3	Reminds me of Vice City. I love those trees
2	Hello fellow LA infp
2	Love it
2	There's nothing calming about this. Cars, traffic lights, advertising, power lines, an aeroplane... man's destruction of nature.
2	"QUIET" Susan Cain	Have you read this book? What do you think?
2	Yes, and I thought she did a fantastic job of describing an introvert‚Äôs place in the world. I appreciate that she doesn‚Äôt try to say that introverts are really any better or worse than anyone else, that basically they just have their strengths and weaknesses. It‚Äôs a great book for introverts who don‚Äôt feel accepted for who they are. Though, honestly, I wish every extrovert, or at least anyone who thinks that an introvert just needs to ‚Äúbreak out of his shell‚Äù, would read this!!
1	Loved it. She said on Twitter that she's an INFP...unsure if this is true to her functions or not or what she based this assertion on
1	I don't think there's any other book on being myself that I've felt so relaxed by. 
52	Picture i took a few months ago	
3	Beautiful. I miss snow. None happening where I‚Äôm from. :) it‚Äôs sure cozy to look at though.x
2	Nicee‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è
1	What a nice place 
1	This is gorgeous. Is it a park? 
1	It reminds me of the graveyard in that Phantom Of The Opera film for some reason. Very beautiful.
6	Anyone else really not like overly aggressive/purposefully annoying characters in sitcoms?	A problem I always find in binge able shows is there's episodes where they introduce an unlikable character who's main purpose is to just be annoying and to force conflict. I guess irredeemable characters come off as lazy and it just irritates me that they're the focus of the episodes, I usually end up skipping the episodes anyways
3	unstereotypical infp characters?	I‚Äôm just asking bcus the only one I know of is Anne from Anne with an E imo. 
3	Fox Mulder from X-Files, I think. Love that dude. 
3	Yuri Lowell from Tales of Vesperia
3	Pain/Nagato, Spider-Man, and Frodo
2	Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes imo.

3	‚ÄúHey man!‚Äù Ughh	Dunno about the rest of you, but I hate calling any other member of the male species ‚Äúman‚Äù. It feels like this word is a substitute for an actual, meaningful connection...it‚Äôs meant to show that you know a person a bit better than the average, uh, man, but apparently not well enough to actually say their name or greet them in a way befitting your relationship. Like personally I am somehow decently well put-together and try to look like I know what I‚Äôm doing (lol), yet I always like to greet my friends and coworkers in as immature a way as possible. I just hate convention so much and these social rules.\n\nIt‚Äôs not unlike my emails with my friends where we work out plans for the weekend (I‚Äôm 34 so yeah, I have to email my friends to talk to them :/ ). And it‚Äôs always generic ‚Äúwhen are you free?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am free at X o‚Äôclock!‚Äù ‚ÄúThen we shall meet at X o‚Äôclock at Y PM!‚Äù Ugh IM SO BORED. I can‚Äôt ever just write a normal response to these things, like if I didn‚Äôt make my font size 100 for no reason or something similar then I wouldn‚Äôt bother.\n\nCan anyone relate to any of this?
1	It‚Äôs just my default thing to say when it‚Äôs a guy whose name I‚Äôve used too much in the conversation already, or whose name I forgot. I have no real feelings toward it.\n\nI see it as a tool, it doesn‚Äôt have to mean any specific levels of connection. A lot of that depends on tone too.
1	Well, I detest "lol" but it's so prevalent that I can't really do anything about it.
1	Spice it up. Use dude. Bro. Guy. Bud. Buddy. Fella. G√ºey. Compa. Put a "my" in front. Use emojis as a substitute (ugh ). \n\nBe creative in your self-expression. What's the worst that can happen?
1	I call my friends "man" all the time. Its not that different from saying "dude" or "bro" its just another way to get someone's attention. People don't say "man" because they are forced to, but its just very casual and universal. Not every interaction has to be emotionally motivated.
1	my default greeting is usually along the lines of "Yeet uwu whats up?" lol
14	02272019 - Mixed Media: Acrylic/Digital. Just something I‚Äôve been working on...	
1	This is super cool! I love the contrasting color. I've always been a fan of mixed media, especially a classic like acrylic paired with modern digital.
14	Anyone else find themselves emulating and thinking like characters in fiction?	I‚Äôve noticed that when I get invested in characters, I can often really think and feel the way they do, even if they act and think in ways that are contradictory to who I am. \n\nIf a character I‚Äôm invested in is an apathetic anti-hero, I‚Äôll think in a very detached way and not think much of killing or people dying. If they‚Äôre an empathetic hero who has a strong aversion to killing. I‚Äôll feel very empathetic for everyone and feel that everyone can be redeemed or rehabilitated. If they‚Äôre a character with a strong sense of Justice, I‚Äôll feel that sense of justice too and feel a need to do things justly and righteously. If they‚Äôre a chaotic character that doesn‚Äôt play by the rules and rebels against authority, I‚Äôll feel free and rebellious, like I just need to do things my way, like I just need to forget about the rules and like I can stand up to any authority. \n\nFor example, I had recently watched a few episodes of ‚ÄúDexter‚Äù, and I began thinking in a very detached way, then I thought about all the evil people in the world and how this world would be better off without them, and I felt like I could kill without remorse and that I‚Äôd be doing a good thing. Another example is after I played as Jimmy Hopkins in ‚ÄúBully‚Äù I felt a need to stand up for everyone who needs it. I felt I could take on anyone and felt a strong aversion to authority. I felt very cynical. I felt like a tough rebel that could beat up anyone who asked for it.\n\nDoes anyone else here get like this?
4	It‚Äôs been this way for me for as long as I can remember. Not just films but books, paintings, and most of all music. \n\nI think this is why it‚Äôs especially important for people like us to be particular about what we ‚Äúconsume‚Äù in our everyday lives. \n\nYou are the sum of what you think about.
2	I‚Äôve been going hard on scott pilgrim recently
1	No, generally I don't immerse myself in the character that I don't feel kinship with. 
1	Sometimes yes we can get 'stuck' in the mindset if a character.  I like tobthibk that people INFP or not have the natural ability to create characters for stories or do actingüòé

8	Water is my favourite element 
3	Ah...peaceful. There's nothing better than a day at the lake. Thanks for sharing!
2	Amazing. Like there's a bunch of shining gems on the bottom. 
3	INFP dating an ESFP	Last year I met an ESFP girl (has ADHD) and we fell for eachother. We dated a couple of months and we had a lot of fun, but then she ghosted me. Fast forward a couple of months later she calls me and we reconnect, but after a short time she ignores me again. Then the same thing happens again. Just a month ago, she calls asking how I‚Äôm doing and such and tells me that I can call her anytime I want to. So I did, but again she ghosted me.\n\nI might have put her too high on a pedestal, I just found everything about her amazing. But I was the one being reserved, she was the one making the moves earlier on. It was not until she told me she could see a future with me and talking about maybe moving in together I let my guard down and I thought she was the one. And I know she is going through some shit, but I am not sure if I should put my foot down or wait for her longer\n\nHave anyone here experienced something similar with an ESFP?
7	I have no experience with dating ESFP girls :D. But my idea is that someone should treat you and your feelings with respect, and it doesn‚Äôt sound like she has.\n\nWhether her life is too tumultuous atm to stick around, whether she‚Äôs fickle, whether she needs to experience clear boundaries in order to respect you, in all cases I can imagine, you‚Äôre better off being clear and putting your foot down. This uncertainty is probably doing you no good and just waiting for her to change won‚Äôt send the message that she needs to respect you too. \n\nJust my interpretation of course. Anyway, goodluck figuring it out :).
3	I have a parent ESFP, so the dynamics are probably completely different, but mine sort of comes and goes whenever he pleases too (my parents are divorced) and is generally very difficult to reason with. I think it could be their Fi if underdeveloped that can make them selfish. At this point I've already given up.
1	She would want to have a guy that will challenge her and dominate her. They easily get bored and the idea of romance may interest them but it‚Äôs gotta be exciting and not all cheesy and head over heels. 
1	Well based on my one experience with an ESFP who also pursued me first and came on pretty strong... ESFPs will dangle themselves in front of INFPs and then claim they just want a less committed arrangement that suits their needs. INFPs will give too much of themselves to the ESFP. So it's not worth it.
13	Although I love all your beautiful sunsets, I've been feeling pretty gloomy lately..	
1	Wow I love this shot. Well done OP!
9	Why do you think INFPs are good at playing villains in movies, video games etc?	Do you think it‚Äôs because they tend to be more creative and are able to put themselves into a role far more than anyone else? I looked up to see that Clancy Brown is an INFP and he has portrayed 2 of my favorite villains, The Kurgan in Highlander and Lex Luthor in Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League Unlimited.
9	I think we are good at being the Anti-Hero because we can see injustice from either side. Villains can sometimes have good intention, and we can sometimes sympathize with that. Also feeling like we are being controlled can lead to some going rogue, especially when we don't think the "good guys" are right or have bad intentions. I think INFPs are good at being neutral, and sometimes that might mean taking the side of the "bad guys". Just because we oppose the hero doesn't make us the villain. \n\nEdit: For example Killmonger from Black Panther, yes he was the villain in the movie. But his father was killed by the King of Wakanda and he was rejected by an advanced civilization that just wanted to hide in isolation. Leading him to fend for himself growing up. So he just wanted to give other people of color a fighting chance. Yes his methods were excessive, but I sympathize for him and i'd probably do the same if I were him.
4	Being a theatrical and voice actor who gets type cast as villains, this is the rare question I seem to be entirely equipped to answer. At least with regards to providing my own perspective.\n\nI think /u/sum1rand0m is onto something, at least when it comes to a certain kind of villain. The villain with good intentions can definitely be fun to play, especially when their goals are reflective of my own were I to be a far less ethical and empathetic person. Playing those characters is a sort of wish fulfillment, allowing me to engage with my desire to be a dangerous social revolutionary without having to, you know, hurt anyone in the process. Sometimes I do want to burn the world down and install a better one in its place. Villains who have an agreeable purpose are interesting, sometimes even sympathetic.\n\nThe Preacher, the primary antagonist of my own novel is this, at least at first. His goal of granting immortality to humanity is downright respectable. His method of killing enough people en masse to force the goddess of Death to manifest in front of him so that he can devour her soul and steal her power is... well, it‚Äôs utilitarianism at its absolute worst (and mind you, I‚Äôm leery of utilitarianism at its best).\n\nBut not all villains are social revolutionaries with utopian aspirations, and I‚Äôve enjoyed playing other kinds just as much in my time, for other reasons.\n\nFor instance, there‚Äôs a character I would refer to as the dystopian revolutionary. This is a person who wants to burn the world down, and create one in its stead that everyone else would think is objectively worse. Make no mistake, this person has ethics and values; in fact, they dedicate themselves entirely to the pursuit of them. It‚Äôs just that their values are alien and monstrous. This is where you get your Jokers.\n\nTiberius, the villain I‚Äôve most consistently played (in four pieces at this point), is definitely this. Where I would look at the world and see systems that enforce suffering and competition and conclude that these systems need to be removed so that we can be free to be our authentic selves, Tiberius sees an entirely different problem. He believes that the nature of humans is cruelty, sadism, and ruthless competition, and sees society as it is currently ordered as placing an undue restriction on that. His is an ethics of evil, similar to the bastard lovechild of Thomas Hobbes and Marquis De Sade, but it is an ethics nonetheless. He believes in something, and he would die for it; even if that thing is something any non-psychopathic human would categorically reject. He would die in the name of a sadism that he calls freedom. Tiberius is Fi at its absolute worst and most narcissistic, and janky as he might be, he still sort of works as a character. After all, if we accept that someone can be monstrous, then behaving like Tiberius does might actually be necessary. People need to do something to justify their own existence and actions to themselves, after all; ascribing your own monstrosity to the whole of humanity and then masking your cruelty as an attempt to ‚Äúliberate‚Äù people could well do it. It‚Äôs entirely possible that he‚Äôs such a narcissist that he doesn‚Äôt even realize that other people with different perspectives really exist, or at least thinks their opinions are wrong and misguided. I actually see dystopian revolutionaries popping up a lot of the time when people attempt to create utopian revolutionaries, which is interesting.\n\nThen, when your heroes are revolutionaries (and I do love a good revolutionary hero), you get villains who enforce the status quo. They could be doing this for any number of reasons; perhaps they are in a place of privilege and benefit from crushing all opposition. Perhaps they legitimately believe that the status quo is the best way to run things, no matter how broken we might think it is. Perhaps it‚Äôs simply that they have a place at all within it. Often, some combination is true. People who legitimately believe that something unsalvageable is worth saving have the potential to be terrifying. Here is where we get the Inspector Javerts, though this can easily be made more evil than him. These people range from ‚Äújust following orders‚Äù to ‚ÄúI believe in tyranny‚Äù.\n\nOnce again citing my work, Death in my novel is essentially this. She is responsible for living beings aging and dying, and she has built an entire society around the glorification of horic but ultimately pointless sacrifice. Why does she do this? It‚Äôs a similar thing to Tiberius, actually, but with a Fe twist; this system, which she herself creates and enforces, is the only one which needs her, and she can‚Äôt accept the idea that she wouldn‚Äôt be needed. She has to be instrumental, she has to have people want her and say that she‚Äôs necessary, even good. For this, she is willing to literally condemn an entire universe of beings to (eventual) death. She enforces social rules and values with an iron fist, because she knows that any crack in the glass can lead to the entire facade shattering, and she wants to believe it. She can‚Äôt stand it when people don‚Äôt *need* her, when she‚Äôs not *helping* them by killing them. Narcissistic Fe is just as dangerous as narcissistic Fi. Without empathy, both of the feeling functions become dangerous. The former can manifest as a desire for status and stability, and a belief you know what‚Äôs best for others without actually caring about them. The latter is usually represented by a deep knowledge of your own desires without any concern for how they affect people beyond yourself; self-actualization at every cost.\n\nThen there are villains that are ultimately just broken, pathetic people. I‚Äôve played a few of these as well. They tend to be sad reflections of ordinary or even brilliant individuals, with some crippling flaw or suite of flaws that holds them back from truly reaching that point. These people can be any of the above, or neither. A lot of petty criminals, for instance, work when portrayed this way. It‚Äôs not a grand kind of evil, or even necessarily evil at all, so much as just an... empty person. They‚Äôre miserable, they‚Äôre pathetic, and we see just enough of a glimpse of someone real in there that we want them to fix themselves, yet at the same time, they‚Äôre the kind of person who could probably hide a body under the floorboards and lie about it to their families without actual remorse. They might feel vaguely bad about it, but they don‚Äôt really know what remorse is. I‚Äôve met a few people who remind me of this in my real life, actually. Some of my own family members included. These people are painful to watch, painful to write and painful to play, but there‚Äôs a reality to their situation. People who have been left behind, and beaten to the point that they‚Äôre just empty shells, with very little of substance left to save.\n\nAnd some characters are just moustache-twirlingly evil. They‚Äôre boring to think about, but sometimes amusing to play. Orcus Tenebrous Thanatos, Demon Prince of Undeath, took this role in my D&D campaign, and the players loved how much of a total nonsensical dick he was.\n\nOf course, these ideas just reflect my own experiences with villainy in fiction. So take them with a grain of salt.
2	They get salty easily
2	Clancy Brown is an INFP?! YOU'RE KIDDING! He was really intimidating in Highlander, he was great in shawshank redemption and I've recognised him whenever I see or hear him in anything else since. Now I just want to hug the guy!\nIn answer to your question, INFPs can make good actors because we see other points of view quite easily. We can change our perspectives on things quite easily and we can emotionally resonate with characters, even if they're not real people. A lot of what we are like day to day can also be put on for the sake of others (to make them feel comfortable or something), we're all actors really. 
2	Because they aren't playing? World will turn too good people into villains often enough.
2	A lot of great actors are INFP‚Äôs, and yes I believe it‚Äôs because INFP‚Äôs have a lot of empathy. They‚Äôre excellent at putting their minds into the shoes of others.

3	INFPs and Mental Health?	I was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and I struggle w/ addiction. \n\nI was curious to know if this personality type is more prone to certain mental disorders, etc.\n\nAny thoughts?
8	Definitely. We see the world way different and cause we mostly get out of it (cause of introverted and dreamy) it makes us forget a bit where we actually are. I believe we are definitely more prone to health issues cause there is just so much to think about and what goes wrong in this world and you want to do something but you can‚Äôt in some cases. 
5	DaveSuperPowers talks about in his videos how each type has their own demons. I am no expert so this is the gist of what I recall.\n\nIPs have the most issue with self-identity vs the tribe. In other words IPs know who they are and struggle when the tribe does not accept them.\n\nEJs also struggle with self-identity, but it is more that they try so hard for the tribe to accept them that they don't know who they are. They have these moments when they are alone where they ask themselves, "Who am I?"\n\nThese are not always the case, of course, but they are just common patterns in the typology world.\n\nIJs have trouble with order vs chaos. And they have a very difficult time if things are not in their control.\n\nI think EPs are also order too, but it is like they shun order. "Don't box me in, bro!"\n\nHis videos go more in depth of the different types if you are interested. Davesuperpowers on YouTube.
4	I'm so sorry to hear you were diagnosed such and I hope you do get well. I believe even BPD can be healed and I wish you'll find the way. I know it's a struggle.\n\nINFP's nature is fragile, the most fragile of all the types. \nWe need almost perfect conditions to emerge to adulthood intact. INFPs who were subject to abuse or neglect as children are prone to develop bpd.\nSource- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ZH0SjK9cE
2	Yes . I have that too and if it matters I‚Äôm also a Pisces .\n\n\nI schedule my crying now . 
4	Any dancers on this sub?	I'm 20, almost 21, and I wanted to dance as a kid. I have always been in love with the art, but my family wasn't financially stable enough for me to afford lessons. I still want to learn, but most places I look cater to kids and I feel like I missed the boat.\n\nIs it (realistically-speaking) too late for me to learn how to dance? And if not, where the heck do I look? I've been trying desperately to find a studio that focuses on adults (especially beginners, as I have literally no experience), but with no luck. My want to learn contemporary and tap is still very much alive. \n\nAny help/encouragement would go a long way. I also have mild social anxiety that makes the idea of being terrible in front of people who know what they're doing absolutely awful. Feeling pretty stuck, ha.
2	I have the worst dance moves, quirky, silly to say the least... but if the musics fine, I just don't give a fck, I truly dance like nobody's watching, even being a shifty dancer I'm proud of my moves, they got me some pretty nice hookups back in the old days hahah\nEven if you're 83 and have arthritis, if you're into dancing, don't give a darn about anyone else!  you should try some classes, just enjoy yourselfüòÅ
1	Its never too late to learn anything! I just recently started to learn dance and I'm 21. This might not help much, but I don't take lesson bc I too coukdn't find any places that teach older ppl...or at least kids not in middle school lol. Theres plenty of ways to learn to dance online - yt even! if you really want it then finding ways to do stuff you want to do, even if you're alone, is always an option. follow that passion and hold on to it. ik you can do anything you set your heart to. <3
1	I took ballet when I was little for a few years, but didn't keep up with it. If I improvise on my own though, it tends to take on that quality. I always wanted to take Highland dance, but never had the opportunity. Later, I was introduced to a community group that did Jewish folk dance. That was a lot of fun, but it requires more people for a circle or line, so I don't get to do it often anymore. 
1	Yes! Dancing helped me when I was growing up to come out of my painfully shy shell. I've also been hoping to continue as an adult but have the same problem in finding a place. \n\nHonestly, there may not be a place to necessarily "teach" you at that age but so much of dance lessons is just trying to mimic what the teacher does in front of you. You can learn so much from Youtube videos and I still do that sometimes when there's a fun Kpop dance or a choreographed piece to a song I really like. Do it in front of a mirror if you can or record yourself so you can see what you're doing wrong/right. You could start there and then once you have more confidence go to dance workshops that you can find online. I just search "dance workshop [my city]" and some popped up.
5	Hey INFPs, I've got a question	So, as an INTJ I think the truth should come before someone's feelings, what's your opinion?\n\nAre feelings more important than logic or is it the other way around?\n\nWhy?
16	I think it can depend sometimes, but I generally agree as long as you‚Äôre not a dick about it. There‚Äôs telling the truth and then there‚Äôs ‚Äútelling the truth‚Äù.
9	The fact is the truth. The hurt feelings of a fact receipent is also the truth. To be as honest as possible whilst minimising harm.
7	As long as saying the truth brings more good than harm. I find that there are truths that some people don't want/need/are ready to listen, so what's the point to speak em if it'll all make it worse? ü§∑
4	Ultimately, it comes down to my *feeling* of what is more important in a given situation. Truth is nothing without its context. Is delivering the truth going to produce the outcome I desire, or is there a better way? Sometimes people need to hear what hurts so they can reflect and improve, but sometimes it backfires. Or is this thing I'm convinced is true truly true at all?
2	IMO one isn‚Äôt more important than the other. If truth needs to be shared it should balance with consideration of the feelings of others without either being diminished. 
2	It‚Äôs hard to state a black and white answer, as sometimes truth matters more for me, and sometimes feelings. But I‚Äôve been with an ENTP for quite a while now and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm usually much more avoidant of speaking the truth as I see it if I feel it‚Äôll hurt someone else‚Äôs feelings compared to him. I need a very solid reason to pick truth over being considerate. He‚Äôs just baffled by that. Being with him has made me slightly more confrontational (in a friendly way haha) as I can see I‚Äôm overly concerned about hurting others. \n\nAnd truth is a bit tricky anyway. Who decides what is true? A lot of it is still subjective perception. That feeling makes it more difficult too for me to state things very assertively.
2	I would rather hurt you with the truth than comfort you with a lie. \n\nI value honesty highly. 
1	Life is nothing but what‚Äôs going on in your head. Different feelings cause us to think differently, but then that kind of thinking makes me want to do something only when I‚Äôm feeling suitable for the task.
1	I‚Äôm inclined towards the *feeling* that feelings are more important. ;) Of course logic/facts/science are to be embraced in that technological progression and stability in a society depend upon them, but I believe without feelings, we may as well be hollow automatons. I think so much of technological advancement has occurred *because* of a passion for discovery and innovation, and I would quantify passion as an emotion/feeling.\n\nAdditionally, humans are complex and sensitive creatures and need care, compassion, and understanding foremost. A baby may come into the world and be saved by some technological advancement, but without nurturing and love, the technology certainly doesn‚Äôt guarantee its well being.
1	Truth and logic are separate things. And what does either one have to do with holocaust/Vietnam jokes?
1	Truth is the basis of logic, and the determined handling of the truth can only be achieved when your mindful set of life rules (morale) steer the decision, which is made after learning the truth, in a favorable direction.\n\nHow you feel influences the choices you make in life. Knowing this, I'd say emotion is more important.
1	I think it's important to have a healthy respect for the Truth, and for Experiences--both my own, and other people's.
1	It depends on our values. But naturally as an INFP I will not usually tell someone how I feel about them if it is negative. Now if they asked me what I thought of them, I would find a polite way to say how I feel.\n\nSo say for example, someone did something that really bothered me. I would bite my tongue. But I would keep it in the back of my head for next time. Eventually there may be a "final straw" and then I will show anger.\n\nI hope that helps. Oh and I should also add, as an INFP I can feel uncomfortable speaking my mind if I feel they will become upset. I don't like conflict. But it is something I have worked on.\n\nAlso, I am not a fan of white lies. If someone asks me a question I will try to find a tactful way of saying it, but I am not going to lie to you to make you feel better.
69	Can I sit and think here forever please

2	Awesome
2	Wanna trade lives? Before you say no, I have *pretty* *sweet* aging toyota rav4. Take your time thinking, get back to me.

1	Hey! I think I have those exact same pants. Do you also have the brunotti jacket?
6	Advice on this behaviour	Ive noticed based on my past relationships im normally at the ready and waiting should my other need me. Even putting things a side just in case, to go and be the best partner I can. However it seems like its really hurting me in the grand order of things. \n\nHonestly im just trying to be there for them as much as possible and I don't wanna let them down, but i dont understand how to balance this.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?
4	I inevitably put my partner‚Äôs needs, goals, basic wants before my own, too. \n\nWhen single, I‚Äôm confident, independent, and a people magnet. Guys and girls want to be with me. They want me to turn my focus toward them and let them in. But when I get into a relationship, my habits of putting them before me take over and gone is my former self. Gone.\n\nI don‚Äôt know where you are in life, but living alone in my own house has helped me balance this trait of giving my everything over to my partner. By not spending every free moment together and allowing time apart (without texting), I‚Äôm able to develop and maintain what they were attracted to in the first place. I‚Äôve been with my current guy for 4 yrs now in separate houses. When we see each other it‚Äôs fireworks because I‚Äôve allocated space and time to be me. \n\n\n
3	Ask yourself: are you doing this to be the best partner you can be, or are you doing this because you have an innate need to *feel needed*?\n\nWe‚Äôre inherently caring creatures, us INFPs, creatures who want nothing more than to make the ones we love feel comfortable and cared for... but sometimes we neglect to care for ourselves in the process because we‚Äôre tirelessly investing the entirety of our being into others so that we can have some semblance of importance in someone else‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs highly romantic for them, but highly toxic for us, and it ultimately creates an unhealthy co-dependency that leaves us open to being emotionally manipulated.\n\nI think in order to combat this kind of behavior ‚Äî behavior which I am entirely guilty of and have been told multiple times that I get taken advantage of because of it ‚Äî we need to look at why we choose to set aside ourselves for others. Do we seek external validation in the form of help because we don‚Äôt feel validated enough in our relationship? Are we insecure about how the other person feels about us, scared they may leave us if the slightest inkling of independence exposed itself? Is our partner unhealthily dependent on us? Do they have issues they need to resolve internally as well? Instead of putting your life away for the sake of your partner‚Äôs potential needs, invest more energy into self-validation and take the time to build up your confidence so that you won‚Äôt need to feel needed as much.\n\nINFPs also have the tendency to idolize their partners, so it‚Äôs easy to fall into the habit of being too available in the initial phases of a relationship because we‚Äôre so deeply in love with our partner that we fail to see the flaws in our own actions toward them. Take a moment to see the human in your partner so that you won‚Äôt feel as obligated to be the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù partner for someone who isn‚Äôt perfect themselves ‚Äî you‚Äôre both human, and it‚Äôs okay to sometimes have conflicting desires. If you want to do something that your partner doesn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt let your rose-colored glasses forgo your time for theirs! Relationships are a two-way street, and just as you compromise yourself for your partner, they should also learn to compromise parts of themselves for you, too.\n\nIt‚Äôs not to say that you should neglect your partner, nitpick their flaws, fight pointless battles over what to have for dinner, and focus wholly on yourself, but make sure to remember that it‚Äôs okay for you to be you and do things for your own happiness, even if it doesn‚Äôt leave you as available as you were before ‚Äî if who you‚Äôre with truly loves you, they‚Äôll understand. You should keep to your hobbies when you‚Äôre in a relationship, be steadfast to events, people, and values that are important to you (unless they bring your partner pain, then you two can discuss it), and stand your ground when you feel you aren‚Äôt being treated fairly. Personal space and a little independence are two key components to any healthy relationship!\n\nI‚Äôm sorry if this wasn‚Äôt too helpful ‚Äî I‚Äôm in the same boat, so your question challenged me to understand why I behave the way I do. I‚Äôm interested to know what kind of advice others will provide! :)\n\nTL;DR: dedicate some time for yourself, develop more confidence in yourself, and know that having personal space/independence in a relationship is essential to its survival!
1	Oh I can relate to that. It is a constant balancing act. Love should mean you are willing to sacrifice your time for someone else, but you also should be free to achieve your dreams. I think this is a millennial problem though. I feel like the previous generations knew it was okay to give up your dreams. Now it is like expected to give up your relationship to pursue your dreams.
1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 28	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
1	I haven‚Äôt been here in a while. I will not provide a recap or an explanation, but my mood has been fluctuating recently. \nThat is all. 
1	Life is sad. People are unaccepting. How can I get rid of the past if I don't run away and cut off all possibility of reattempting to connect? Stop submitting to parent worship and help a living breathing independent human into a better life. Home, clothes, and food, only do so much to one who chooses their mind over their body. Who cares if it's not the "adult" solution?

1	why are we broken? like why is it that all of the ppl around the world are broken..? I've been asking myself that question for some time now.. and three years ago I asked that question and others around me either mocked me or joked about it or completely denied it.. it is so weird but true.. but why are we broken? why are you broken? is it a basic instinct that make us needy and to stay with others? or to be creative and make things to occupy?, what do you think? 
3	My best friend(since 7th grade)is an ESFP.	I'm the peanut butter and he's my jelly-muse. We communicate harmoniously. I can only really open up to this one person and when others hear me talk to him, on the phone mostly, they often get mad. I'm not as open with most people as I am with my bestie and they start to think I'm hiding things from them. Which I am, Duh. Who's your Jelly?
2	Sounds amazing.\n\nI don't have jelly, only more peanut butter. Because when two INFP's hang out it gets wild, it's like we can speak our minds for once.

15	Rest in peace Egg dude.	Today I went to my local park to feed the duck, but honestly I like feeding pigeons more. They seem a lot more grateful than the ducks who have already gorged themselves on bread (dw I know you're not meant to feed ducks bread but that's what other people feed them, I brought seeds)\n\n I started at the bridge and circled back to the bridge. But upon the second visit about 2ish hours later there was a pigeon egg on the ledge. Naturally I picked it up wrapped it in tissue paper. I know that you can technically use the warmth from your hand to incubate the egg. I was aware i couldn't do that for several month but whatever. On a side note it really stank which I figured was just the poop on it. I kept the egg in my pocket and used one hand for warmth. I also successfully held a pigeon dude.\n\nI then needed to go the shop to get food and stuff. As a pigeon dad is was my duty to look after that egg. I couldn't  just leave it in the car, so I went to the shop probably smelling like the worst fart imaginable. When I got hope I had a panic when i felt the egg in my pocket. It may have just been the tissue insulating the egg but it didn't feel as secure. I unravelled the tissue to my worst fear the stop of the egg was caved in and some egg juice was leaking (which to reiterate smelt so bad that i can still smell it now). \n\nEgg dude has no chance in this condition. With a heavy heart i rolled the egg into the garden. I planned our lives together, as we grew old. I wanted to call you Archimedes. I was going to use my heated blanket blanket to maintain the temperature while you where in your egg. I was going to teach you cool tricks. I will meet you again in that great omelette in the sky. Rest in peace my smelly friend.\n\nTLDR: Found a pigeon egg, took it home and it cracked in my pocket.\n\n&#x200B;
4	Rip egg dude, you will be missed üò¢üíî
2	You were a great egg daddy.‚ù§Ô∏è
3	Bless your heart, sending all my love to you and the late Egg Dude üíô
15	Do you often feel that nobody likes you?	
16	You dont need to be an INFP to feel that way, and yes often i do
5	I often feel that no one likes me back romantically, everything else yes tho
3	Hmmm, not really. I mean, I am under no false pretenses that everyone loves me, but I know I am likable and a good human. I used to feel that way, though. I think what helped me most has been that I have learned to share happy times as well as side times with my friends and SO. I try not to overshare the bad times‚Äîonly when I really need help, because I try to be mindful that my emotions can effect other people, so I only bring troubles to others when I haven‚Äôt been able to get through them on my own. My friends have begun to do the same, and since we haven‚Äôt been overburdening each other with our problems, and yet we also have not been hiding them, and since we have become more comfortable with sharing our successes, (even when they are super tiny, like learning a new crochet stitch) none of us have really quite experienced that symptom of depression. 
3	Yeah, most of the time. I'm constantly paranoid that people are going to turn on me if I say the wrong thing. It's something I'm working on, for sure.
3	someone in high school told me "nobody likes you" in front of the class, so since then, i've always been paranoid that no one likes me.
1	I don‚Äôt care as much anymore. In 7th grade I wore this really cool black jacket, and some kid I barely knew called me a poser. I was so upset and for a while tried to look like what my ‚Äúgroup‚Äù looked like. \n\nSilly me.\n\nPeople are so much more than stereotypes and labels. \n\nI am myself now, dressing in what makes me happy, and those who stick around are worth it.‚ù§Ô∏è
1	I'm more afraid of being unable to love others well...\nI've received quite a lot of love from different people but I don't know how to reciprocate and that's very heartbreaking.
1	The opposite . I feel like people are obsessed with my energy and suck the life out of me \n\n\nI don‚Äôt like ppl 
1	For me it‚Äôs more they just don‚Äôt care 
1	I always feel like nobody likes me. I don't have any close friends or family I can talk to. Most people avoid me and I avoid most people despite my need to be somewhat extroverted. \n\nIn my experience: most people only "like" me when I put on a fake persona that I think others will like. And those same people dislike me when they learn that the persona is fake and see the real me. Even when I'm fake, there are plenty of people who would like to see me buried alive. \n\nThe takeaway: people are always going to dislike you whether you're fake or not. It's up to you to decide who you want to be in this confusing world. Do what YOU want to do and be who YOU want to be if you know what that is. And when you finally find that true "YOU", hold on to it and never let go. The only people who will matter in the end are those who stuck with you because they loved "YOU". In the meantime, us INFPs need to look out for each other and keep watch for our land of milk and honey.\n\n*Edit: "like"
5	Do you guys ever envy ENFP?	I envy ENTP(as an INTP). Seems like a more social and creative person than me. Our strengths are Fi and Ti, aka a holistic system of some "thing" but it seems like anybody could achieve that with enough time. We just happen to stick with it a bit longer and be the first to actually reach the whole model. But ENTP responds faster to situations without the whole model, but is sometimes wrong. So when we get the whole model before they do there is a brief period where we work effectively quicker until they get understand it all too.\n\nBecause of this it makes me think...or believe for the sake of my own mental health...that there must be some advantage to being a dominant internal judger beyond just learning...otherwise it's just like they are us...only can actually talk to people...\n\nIt feels like they do everything better except one thing...sticking to developing the whole system. But if they sat down and actually tried they would have our "secret"(that we willingly share) and again be better than us. Idk...just how I feel. I know I shouldn't type envy but it's hard to overcome the feeling.
6	Eh. I work at being the person I want to be, embody my personal values with as much integrity as I can, remaining congruent with them as I grow, change, mature.\n\nThere'll ever only be one you, and the world would be dimmer if you didn't express that truest self. You don't have to become another type to get better at doing certain things.\n\n
5	Nope. They have their problems.
4	Honestly, I'm not particularly jealous of my ENFP brethren. I've envied INTPs and ENTPs for their rationality before, but when it comes down to it, I care too much about myself to want to change.\n\nThere are certainly things that would be nice about being an ENFP, and a faster processing speed might be one of them. Speed isn't everything, though, and I care more about depth. Having a stronger Te would also be nice, but I wouldn't give up my Si for it; I'd rather have a massive backlog of information and experience to evaluate my ideas against and refine my values with than the ability to structure and organize things in an "objective" way (whatever that's supposed to mean coming from a human). My Te is decent anyway, except for in times of crisis, as is a common enough thing for those INFPs who forced themselves through the education system.\n\nAs for sticking to developing the whole system, based on the ENXPs I've met, it's actually a lot harder for them than you would think. As in, they basically can't, no matter how hard they try. They aren't even necessarily aware it's incomplete, because it's functional, and because they'd rather move on to the next thing. Which isn't bad necessarily, but it is worth noting. We all assume the things we do best are easy, because they are easy for us, but that's rarely actually true for other people. That thing you're better at? It's not the tiny, trivial thing you make it out to be. It's wonderful and needed, just as much as theirs. Theirs might be flashier, but since when does flash matter?\n\nYou mention talking to people as well. I imagine that ENTPs might have an easier time talking to people than INTPs, given the presence of a higher Fe, and ENFPs might do better than INFPs as a result of higher Te. Ne and general extroversion probably don't hurt either.\n\nThat being said, it should still be entirely possible for you to talk to people and develop meaningful relationships. The trick is identifying people who want to talk to you, who are interested in the same subjects you are, and more importantly, who possess reasoning and communication styles which are compatible with your own. It can be difficult at first, especially if you come from a "conventional" environment. But you know what? If you can't be comfortable in a conventional environment, that's perfectly alright. Buck the convention. Find your own counterculture. If it doesn't exist, make it. It's not always easy, but it can be done; I've done it, after all, and if I of all people can figure it out, I'm sure you can.\n\nSo, no. I'm not jealous of ENFPs. I think a lot of them are great people, and I'm glad they exist, but I'd rather be the best person I can while remaining fundamentally myself than become someone else who honestly, would have their own insecurities and problems anyway.
2	I sometimes wonder if I am an ENFP. How it works for me is if I am with someone 1 on 1 I can be talkative, especially if they have a positive demeanor, this includes strangers. If it is a 1 on 1 and they have a negative/nasty demeanor then I wont talk to them at all unless absolutely necessary. If it is a group setting and I do not know them then I will hang out in the back and observe, only talking if spoken to directly. If it is a group situation with friends I am usually asking questions non stop. I feel like I am in between introverts and extraverts. 
2	No. Never has crossed my mind. 
2	I envy the energy they get from being with people.  \n\nAs an INFP I feel like I am more sedate and deliberate.  
2	No. x100000000000000000000000000000000000000
1	No. 
1	Not jealous, but they are my favorite types to be around by far. Have three amazing ENFPs in my life and they are just amazing. 
6	The problem.	The problem with us, fragile and out-of-this-world, is that we have to contradict ourselfes so often that it is hard to understand who we are and why. You have to be strong to be fragile. You have to be sad to be happy. You have to live grey life to dream. You have to be empty to be full.  It is just logical, but only we are crossing the line so often. Society, the people, we don't belong to them. Noone wants diffrent worlds, noone wants to see world as it is, as we see it.  If you dare to dream you dare to say this world is not enough. You see and feel more. And people don't like it. The good and old ostracism. These days we are the outsiders. We have to fight this modern machine everyday because it is ment to be sensless, to be empty and we are not. People just don't know we can be both. We can create and we can destroy. I loved this world but no more. I will care for it, as always, but these day I just feel like empty reversed hitman. I just fix things, give some empathy and go next. Nothing there for me. I am on a mission.  Nothing much. \n\nTo sum up this sudden attack of toughts that i will post despite having thousands of pictures, drawings, poems and novels that i never posted because yet I have to be strong to show that indeed i am fragile and I am making art. One day. My last contradiction is that i live this life, i feel so much yet i believe it is all meaningless because it all just ends. Why would someone make me feel and see so much yet make mebelive that it is pointless? Yeah we are here and now and we should embrace it but why? Noone will remember, noone will know.
3	You‚Äôre a great writer. We need more people like you in this world, to shake things up.\n\nI fucking love outsiders, but I realise that no matter how much I preach to people about The Velvet Underground they are always going to be overlooked, or in the corner of the public eye. The reason being they did not put themselves here to be appreciated by the masses. They - (my favourites) Burroughs, Kerouac, Thoreau, Emily Dickinson.. will forever be outsiders because their intention was and is to represent us.\n\nYou are not alone and as sure as I remember, you remember. And others - no matter how rare - will remember. \n\nIt‚Äôs like over the weekend I was in Mallorca, and this old dude who owned this bookshop was moaning to me about ‚Äúhow nobody reads anymore‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all on their phones‚Äù and in my head I was like ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm here.. I‚Äôm talking to you! I read books, my soul is from the fucking 70s!‚Äù\n\n\n\nAttack of thoughts... Yes, your attack of thoughts triggered the same in me.\n
4	"If you dare to dream you dare to say this world is not enough. You see and feel more. And people don't like it."  Very well said!  You are a phenomenal writer!
3	By being out-of-this-world we are more in touch with reality than all of the people focused on the practical - a popular illusion, the popularity of which disguises its illusory nature. We are taught, trained, molded in such a way as to disregard and let atrophy the imagination unless it can prove itself to be of economic use, yet isn't it the ultimate act of make-believe to believe and act as if the world really is the drab, lifeless world of survival? If the truth is that nothing matters, we all die, there's no master plan, well, what are we doing wasting our lives following empty dreams that are not our own, working jobs we don't care about, devoting our lives to a social game that leaves us unfulfilled while simultaneously reinforcing the hegemony of this *realistic* worldview eclipses all others, which kills even the possibility for beautiful, rich, infinitely deep experiences - the attempt to try to scrape some meaning out of our time here - and just so happens to be doing a remarkable job killing the planet too? This is the difference between active and passive nihilism.
2	Great writing. It‚Äôs so true. I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot. I contradict myself a lot, but it makes total sense to me in my head. It‚Äôs hard that other people don‚Äôt understand, but I guess I would never really want to change that about myself. I‚Äôm learning to be okay being an outsider. ‚ÄúOn the outskirts. On the fringes. On the edge and off the avenue.‚Äù \n(I wonder if Suzanne Vega is INFP).
5	Fellow INFPs, what are you majoring in? How'd you come to declare your major?	I'm planning on majoring in Communication with a concentration in Technical Writing or Media Arts and I wanted to hear some of your stories. \n\nI was originally on track to be a CS major because most of my peers were all about that STEM life and it seemed like it could lead to a profitable career. In the end, I learned that I suck at coding and I don't enjoy STEM courses all that much. \n\nNow here I am, about to major in Communication at a Tech school of all places. 
6	Formally, I'm majoring in the Liberal Arts and Sciences, but because my school is weird, I'll have to pick a focus area next year, which defines what I'm actually studying most intensely.\n\nIn high school, I wanted to major in Physics, because I thought that was what intelligent people did. Looking back, while I could've handled the material just fine, that would be a deeply unsatisfying life for me. I kind of drifted around for a while, and I currently have many things I could see myself majoring in; journalism, political science, literature, drama, history, sociology, women's studies (I know, it's a cliche, but I do like the courses I've taken in it), creative writing...\n\nWhen I really think about it, though, it looks like my choice is going to be philosophy. Of all fields I've looked at, it's the one that manages to keep my interest the longest, and I love the way in which it allows me to look at everything and draw connections between them. Specifically, I love to go deep into moral philosophy and investigate the countless different ethics and values across the centuries, all in the name of creating a better set of beliefs for the future.\n\nSo, yeah. Liberal Arts and Sciences slash Philosophy. Why? Because it works where nothing else really does, and that's a good enough reason as any right now.
5	I went to an art school for 3d modeling and animation, cuz I always loved art and wanted to work in the games industry.\n\nNow I work as an automation engineer at a big bank. I'm not even that great at coding and wish I got a cs degree to learn more. I'm scared that it'll be hard to find another job with my art degree. Thankfully my current job is pretty chill and it pays well enough so I can constantly go out with friends, freely travel, and buy anything I want.\n\nI look at the game industry and I'm glad I didn't join that with all the stories of layoffs, shutdowns, and slave labor. \n\nI don't wanna discourage you in any way from what you want to do, but that is my story.
4	Literature. I‚Äôve wanted to teach high school English since sophomore year ish of high school. 
3	Probably English with Creative Writing concentration. I don‚Äôt really know where it‚Äôll lead to tbh. Good luck!
3	International business because I loved learning languages and dreamed of moving all over the world. Now after graduating I've learned my career will be a lot more "business" than "international" which isn't very fulfilling, but we'll see where it takes me. If I could do it over again I'd be a liberal arts kid for sure. 
3	Education, I first majored in Political science but o struggled if you are looking for a good major busniess is always solid.
3	I'm currently majoring in applied mathematics. I came to the decision sometime in high school - I saw the beautiful structure that mathematics follows, as well as how the logic flows.\n\nYeah, I know it's not a typical "INFP" thing to be interested in, but I found the level of abstraction to have its own merits. Plus, it's not like you get married or attached to any of the ideas you study in mathematics, and there's no real "morally wrong" aspect of it, so it's nice. Nobody can really do something that's truly "wrong" because it's 100% logic-based.
2	I'm still a junior in high school, but I plan to major in Equine Management at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls. \n\nI've always loved animals, but I couldn't be a vet bc I would hate to see them sick / in pain. Or, even worse, bare the responsibility of having to put any down. \n\nI absolutely adore horses, although my favorite animal is wolves. I thought about studying wolves in the wild as a career, but most of that job is writing papers, etc. I've considered wildlife photography, but it's incredibly difficult to make money as an amateur just starting out. \n\nMy plan is to work for others for a brief time out of college, saving enough money to acquire land and horses of my own. From there, I'll give lessons, lead trail rides, etc to earn money. I'll be my own boss, be surrounded by horses, and enjoy every second of my career. I may not make much money, but I'd rather be truly happy & passionate about what I do than rich and miserable. Follow your dreams, work hard for them, surround yourself with people you love, and I believe you'll be happy in life!\n\n
2	Oh, I nearly had the same path. I took programming classes in high school, but after a while I got bored of it due to being poorly taught. So I then applied to college as an advertising major. As I got closer to school starting, I started having doubts about a career in advertising due to my standards of advertising being way higher than most sloppy ads thrown on the television. I may want to learn copywriting later on. That sounds like an extremely fun job.\n\nAlso, I'm fine working in groups, but I am terrible at networking. I don't know how I would survive such a competitive market.\n\n I looked back on what I knew, and I chose Information Technology. It seemed to line up perfectly with my previous classes. I am not much of a math person, but I can code decently. Coding isn't hard, but it can be pretty annoying if you don't understand it. Anyway, I'm not going into IT to be a programmer. There's already plenty of that. I heard from one software engineer that 90% of IT is working with clients to determine what they are looking for, and the last 10% is in the actual coding work. Also, technical writing is interesting, but it's strange. It's like taking the writer out of the writing and leaving it with soulless text. \n\nI am still trying to find what I'll do with the major, but I don't think I'll regret my choice.
1	How interesting... I majored in Communication and minored in Publishing. I am now a graphic designer / marketing manager. I started school thinking I would major in Psychology or English but ended up switching to Communication as I thought it would get me a job easier. Plus it's more interesting and focused. I tried to do CS and did one or two courses and failed miserably as I, too, suck at coding. \n\nIf I could do it again, I would go to a tech school and get more practical skills in marketing/design instead of university.
4	Hello I‚Äôm new to this sub!	So I‚Äôm basically going through a re-evaluation of what type I am since my social anxiety makes it hard for me to know whether I‚Äôm an introvert or extrovert (up until today I was sure I was an enfp) but I think, at least for now, I‚Äôm an infp. And btw, this sub is so lovely all the posts are sweet.
2	I too am not sure if I‚Äôm enforcing or infp, but I think I fit in well with this community, and I‚Äôm sure you will too! :)
44	Anyone else enjoys looking at the sky? Something about the sky just makes me relaxed and maybe because... majority of the time I‚Äôm off day dreaming h a h >>	
7	All day . I love the skies
5	A blue sky is heavenly to me, makes me so happy. I live in the UK and we get a lot of pale grey skies üòè
5	Yes. Looking at the sky makes me think that there's more out there than whatever I'm dealing with on the ground.
4	I love looking at the moon. My friends have basically made it a meme because I always point out how big and beautiful the moon looks lol
3	Yes. It‚Äôs the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2	Ayeee.. Though I connect more with the night sky. Cliche. But I live on a island quite a bit away from major towns. So very little light pollution. So when the skies are clear. It's breath taking.\nJust makes you think what's up there in the beyond.\n\nPs.\n\nIts 4am. I'm doing it right now. I wanna stay like this forever. 
3	INFPs are more likely to be abstract artists while ISFPs are more likely to be good at realism	just an idea. any thoughts?
3	I‚Äôm an infp who does both, my realism is probably my strongest work because I‚Äôm so analytical and a huge perfectionist but I do enjoy abstract I just struggle to be sure in what I‚Äôm producing when I do it 
3	Can confirm. I very much enjoy painting abstract art. There is something deeply satisfying about creating meaning and beauty out of chaos. 
3	I think the connotations of "intuitive" and "sensor" can lead one to make these sorts of connections. You'll no doubt find plenty of evidence to back it up, but also plenty to prove it wrong.\n\nHere's my anecdotal 2 cents: I have come across plenty of [probable] isfps in fine and performing arts, and music. Plenty of [probable] infps in creative writing, philosophy, and humanities. Hella overlap as well. 
3	i mostly do abstract art and doodling as i find it calming and carefree, but i'll occasionally do some realism (though i'm not the best at it)
15	Honor yourself.	Life is meaningless... most people know this. Nonetheless, what‚Äôs even more meaningless is dwelling on the fact that life is meaningless. Even if life did have meaning, what would that even look like? Can you even begin to think of anything that‚Äôs more meaningful than life itself? If life has lost lost its luster, this means you have woken up. That right there is the real gift of life... to know that you will die one day, and to realize the extreme importance of your own romantic convictions. Your life is yours, and the only one holding you back is yourself.
10	"Life has no meaning. Each of us has meaning and we bring it to life. It is a waste to be asking the question when you are the answer." -Joseph Campbell
3	The meaning of life is to handle knowledge in the utmost preserved care and the ability to pass it on to the next generations of life. \n\nThe above in the most broad sense comprehensible.
2	There is no meaning of life, but there can be meaning to life. \n\nSave your post for posterity, OP. 
10	I could hug you people	So freakin adorable.
8	That sounds pleasant and uncomfortable in equal measure. So instead I offer an awkward high five.
6	Really?
6	i'll hug you!
5	u cute
7	Forced myself to go talk to a cute girl that works at the library today; want to get to know her, but not sure how best to approach it	For context, I‚Äôm a 20 year old guy at college, and I‚Äôm one of those people who just can‚Äôt study in their own home, I‚Äôll inevitably turn my Xbox on or sit on Netflix for hours instead. Recently I‚Äôve started going to my local library to force myself to do some fucking work. Today I managed to drag myself down there, and while I was studying one of the girls who works there walked by me.  And holy shit. It‚Äôs been a looooong time since I‚Äôve done a double take like that after laying eyes on someone for the first time. Like obviously I notice when a girl is attractive and might even be a bit intimidated by them being good looking, but this was just insane. I‚Äôve been spending like a year slowly getting over my best friend (whole other story). She was probably the first person I‚Äôve properly ‚Äòfallen in love‚Äô with, and we‚Äôre still really great friends, but it‚Äôs been a massive struggle accepting it‚Äôs probably just not meant to be like that between us. I‚Äôve had little flirtations with other people since I met her, but nobody else has really caught me eye.\n\nThat is until today. I felt like I was in fucking high school again trying to sneak little glances at some girl I was crushing on in my class. I honestly couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes off her. I sat there trying to study, but I really just couldn‚Äôt concentrate. Eventually I done something that is completely out of character for me; I forced myself to go talk to her. I basically never find an excuse to talk to a girl no matter how attracted I am to them, even on drunken nights out the only times I‚Äôve really got anywhere with anyone they‚Äôve approached me first. I just don‚Äôt have the confidence, even when blind drunk, to go up to some random girl and say hi. It fucking terrifies me. I can never do it.\n\nBut today something just kinda came over me. I just felt like I had to go at least try something, and it was just stupid not to. I stood up in the middle of writing an essay, started pretending to look through the books on the shelves, and picked one to loan out just so I had an excuse to go talk to her (it‚Äôs the first Dark Tower book which I‚Äôve already read before lmfao, I was literally just looking for any excuse to go say hi). \n\nI‚Äôm not gonna sit and pretend I went up and asked her out or anything crazy like that; I feel like asking a girl out while she‚Äôs working is an insanely awkward situation for them, and either way I‚Äôd never have the balls to try that. We just done the usual ‚Äòcan I see your library card, you have like a month to bring it back, etc.‚Äô polite talk, nothing special, I was so fucking nervous that I couldn‚Äôt think of literally anything else to say to her. I‚Äôve not been like that around a girl in years.\n\nHonestly though, I‚Äôm proud of myself for pushing myself to go talk to her, even if it was such a simple conversation and I left like no impression on her. I‚Äôm there all the time to study so I‚Äôm sure I can come up with some other excuse to try break the ice. What would be the best way to approach this and try get to know her without seeming like a complete creep? I know when people are working the last thing they want is some random guy trying to hit on them, but at the same time I do really want to see if I can find a way to get to know her.
3	I'd start by asking her name. Then whenever she passes by start saying hi to her and/or how she is doing. Do that for a few days so she is familiar with you. And then when you do go up to her ask her things like what's her major, where is she from, favorite book, etc. At least that way you're less of a stranger to her. Then when she is more comfortable with you, ask her out. At least that's how i'd do it so I don't look like a creep coming out of nowhere asking her out. Oh and don't forget to smile or look friendly so you don't look intimidating, and look her in the eyes when you can. Exude confidence.
2	I am in the same situation with a library cute guy. Except we talked a bit more and he is nice all the time but I am just so nervous that I can‚Äôt have a long conversation XD
1	I don‚Äôt understand why guys are shy,I think I was a Don Juan in a past life,life is incredibly short I would just walk up to her and say have you met your soulmate yet? Would get an interesting discussion going.
1	I'm twenty too I know the way it feels.
1	Maybe comment on one of her displayed interests. A book, a laptop sticker, or a pin on her bag. As long as it's not disingenuous, it should get a conversation going. 
1	I suggest to ask her for book recommendations! A great way to get to know someone is through the literature they read
0	Asking this in a INFP sub isn‚Äôt really your best bet i guess haha \n\nBut the story you told us is for me really relatable, was a nice read :)\n\nFor advice I would go to another sub where people know more about this stuff tho üòÅ
204	Life through art	
5	Omg that looks amazing!
3	Wonderful art, nice imagery 
3	This is so cool!!
2	If you ever make a painting like this, let me know lol. Awesome art. 
2	i sometimes wish my physical form would dissolve into something i can shape
2	that is like really good bro
1	This is so sick\n\n&#x200B;
2	The ramblings of a fanboy. I dont know where else to go, someone here may appreciate this...	(I don't really know where else to go to share this and everyone here is cool so fuck it) I just found out that Dan Auerbach from the Black Keys worked with the growlers to produce my 2 favorite growlers albums... I just think it's insane that I've been in love with both The Black keys and the growlers forever and I'm just finding this out now. Thanks in advance for tolerating my rambling.
2	Thickfreakness was on heavy rotation for the longest time. I loved Brothers, and their El Camino was pretty top notch as well! I also adored Auerbach's solo project: When the Night Comes gives me all the feels!

8	Does anyone else find the ENFP girls the most attractive of all?	they are nice and mentally stimulating, also warm and talkative without loosing their individuality. they're the only extroverts with  whom i can watch a lot of series during a lot of time, even fights are fun and entertained. rainbows flow everywhere.
4	I do! ENFPs get me out of my shell without being pushy about it!
3	How to breathe when your crush is talking to you	Guys seriously omg. We start talking and it‚Äôs fine and he is gorgeous and I melt when he smiles but my heart is all messed up and I can‚Äôt breathe properly XD\nIt‚Äôs very ridiculous and I hope it goes away as I get used to him talking to me and I laugh at myself so much as soon as he goes away, but it really seems I can‚Äôt help it. \nI am not used to having crushes so this is so new and funny but frustrating at the same time.  I am always so nervous omggg \nJust wanted to share.\nThought you guys might relate and laugh with me. Also I stuttered and wanted to die XD
5	I never got used to it. Probably the reason why it didn‚Äôt work out. So if you want it to work, perhaps don‚Äôt put him on a pedestal. He‚Äôs only human and definitely has flaws, even if you choose to ignore them at first. Don‚Äôt give him too much undeserved credit. He may get too comfortable and start taking you for granted. 
3	If you don't get used to that it's love...;) Have fun and hang in there it will be good.
3	This is so cute üòÅ \n
3	This is nice to hear that even girls get nervous when talking to their crushes.
3	Lol in front of my crushes I always forget how to walk or even keep my fucking head in alignment

444	Does anybody else ever upvote things before even looking at what they are just because you want people to feel supported and validated?	Its a weird thing I do, and sometimes I don't even notice I'm doing it. I'll go back and actually read them after I've upvoted them, and if I really like them I'll leave a positive comment. If its something awful or mean, I'll take away the upvote. 
59	I do this. Consider yourself a nice person because of this comment. :) 
28	I normaly put a lot of thought into what i give upvotes, I give upvotes to nice/ well meaning posts though.
21	I just tend to not down vote. I up vote if like the content. I don't if I don't like it. The only down votes I give are rare and only for posts or comments that are truly malicious in nature. 
12	What was this post about?
12	I do this for any art or creative (game dev) posts. Because I want to support them. Perhaps because I know what it's like to not have confidence in the things you do. 
7	Sometimes if I see a comment is at 0 but is a reasonable thing/within the sub context I‚Äôll rescue it and give the poster back their one karma. I can‚Äôt remember when I started doing that but now it‚Äôs a private habit while on Reddit. 
7	I especially do it in this subreddit, I've always been very self conscious about what I post online to the point where I almost never post anything anymore, it's nice to know that there's a lot of people in this subreddit who feel the same and want to make others know we're on on each other's side 
6	Have an upvote on a post about giving upvotes! Haha! Here ya go. And yes I do this too. (Enfp)
7	Get. Out. Of. My. Head.
4	I made a post about this about a month ago, haha! :)
4	yes lol
3	Sometimes i do this where I will sort by new, and look for posts people clearly put a little bit of time into but dont have many upvotes. I like to upvote and maybe comment to try and get their post movin :)
4	I used to upvote literally every post I came across for this reason. Kind stoped though... idk why
5	Fuck..  yup... you got my number... I just want people to know they are heard..
3	Yes
3	Have an upvote, don't know what you said, didn't finish it but I hope you feel supported!
3	> If its something awful or mean, I'll take away the upvote\n\nOkay, it makes much more sense this way.\n\nAt first I was like, "That's just chaotic neutral!"  :P
3	I did that to this post. I'm just now coming back a few minutes later to comment, and I still haven't read the post description.
3	i really should upvote more\n\nim too lazy to click the upvote button
2	Yeah I upvote nearly everything unless it‚Äôs downright offensive and wrong. In that case I tend to just leave it alone.
2	Oh my god, Yes I do it, specially with the ones that get 0 in the votes. I only downvote 3 people since I use reddit, i remember that I downvoted a guy that was insulting every man in the world because they are "disgusting" and "perverts", etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwith the 99.5% I upvote just to support the person. I can get mad when someone is saying something really unfair, but I usually understand people even when they are unfair.
2	Not exactly, but I do a similar thing that probably stems from INFP-ish traits: I'm mostly passive on Reddit in terms of voting, but when I upvote it's pretty much always to take comments from 0 to 1.
2	I only upvote content that is good to me. The way upvotes work popularizes good content which in turn spreads the most joy. Improving many lives over the one. \n\n(Btw FWIW I'm not an INFP)
2	Nope not at all haha. I swear I‚Äôm getting dangerously close to INTP territory...
2	No but I upvote rude jerky comments and downvote people calling them petty jerks.
5	I failed chem in the first semester at the Uni. Not sure how to deal with the feeling of being singled out.	All my friends who live with me passed (barely) but I failed. I acted as if I didn't care much but when I saw people calling home telling their families that they got good marks and stuff, I felt so terrible. I too wanted to call home like yes, I passed but now all I'm doing is trying to hide my sadness under the a fake smile that I don't care. Now I have to appear for the retest in December this year and prepare everything on my own. I don't know why I'm envious of everyone who's calling home and their friends saying how they passed. My GPA is super low and I'm afraid if I'll  be able to get into a better graduate program or will I be able to get an internship abroad. Above all I don't know how to deal the feeling of being the only one left behind. What do I do?\n\nFor contest, I'm Asian and studies matter a lot here.
2	Hey, one of my best friends is also studying chemistry and just failed one her exams. She also always doubts her abilities and such, and the only thing I'm telling her is to wait; it's only the first semester. You will get better over time and as you can see, you're definitely not alone, so don't put yourself down that much, it's not a big deal. I'm sure you'll do better the second time, after all you have the experience of the first :) \n\nJust don't procrastinate too much :D
50	This sub is toxic	Before you get mad let me explain. I have been following this sub for a while now and I‚Äôve become deeply saddened by it. I got into MBTI a few years back during a huge depressive low point in my life.(like many others on this sub) When I first found out I was an INFP and found this subreddit it gave me meaning and an outlet like little else had before. I very quickly labeled myself as an INFP, I fit into every description of the type. I was the ‚Äúspecial snowflake‚Äù, ‚Äúthe creative,‚Äù and  ‚Äúthe deeply introspective.‚Äù If someone were to ask me who I was, I‚Äôd say an INFP. I followed this thinking for a little over a year.\n\nDuring that year, I as a person did not progress, if anything I degressed. I became obsessed with my INFPness. I blamed everything I thought and did on being an INFP. I was no longer a complex multidimensional person, I was just an INFP. \nLuckily through good relationships outside of the sub I realized above all... people are people. As soon as you label yourself or someone as something other than a person you/they become closer to objects than people with infinite potential. This sub feeds heavily into dehumanizing people into types. YOU ARE NOT AN INFP. YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE YOUR‚ÄôE TYPE. YOU ARE NOT MORE SPECIAL THAN ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE YOUR TYPE, you are a complex amazing human being. This sub has a lot of outstanding qualities and it‚Äôs helped me a lot, I‚Äôve met great people and have received great support but I implore you to learn from my mistakes, fix this sub, and realize you are not an infp, you‚Äôre something infinitely better(:\n\nWith much love,\nModernAbacuz\n
52	So let‚Äôs sound the horn again on MBTI:\n\nIf you use MBTI to base your identity in, **you‚Äôre doing it wrong.**\n\nMBTI is just a tool to help understand yourself better, not as a means of defining yourself with, inflating your ego with, or whatever.
47	Nah this sub is fine. Just because you romanticized this sub/being INFP, doesn't mean everyone else does too. 
20	Classic infp projecting their values onto other people lol.
13	yeah no, haven't seen anything "toxic" about this sub yet. Just because you based your entire identity around being an infp doesn't mean this sub is encouraging that. it's literally just a sub to share things which you think other people who *might* be like you will understand & relate too. \n\nIt's most definitely important to see yourself & others as people & to have important relationships with all kinds of ppl no matter their type. And i think most people on this sub understand that. \n\nIf nothing else, this sub provides a safe space for infps to share thoughts, art, opinions etc coz i think infps are naturally inclined to feel more safe amongst a smaller group who might be like minded. \n\nHaven't seen any elitism on this sub yet. 
27	You're right. However the mbti system just categorizes personality types, as long as we realize that that's all these labels are and don't try to personify them to the extent of losing ourselves, they can be quite useful as tools to find like-minded people. After all it's quite useful to be able to just say that I fit the INFP type pretty well than to have to explain every detail of my personality to someone in conversation. That's the purpose of labels after all; a general description that makes it easier to describe yourself to others. \n\nIt's the same with gender and sexuality; I describe myself as gay for instance, but in truth my attraction is much more complex than just being attracted to people of the same sex. I don't let the labels I choose to define my identity, define who I am and whom I wish to become. But that does not mean that they aren't useful to have. They also help us to sort out the mess that identity can be in our minds.\n\nSo to conclude; labels, like the mbti personality types, are useful when used correctly. They should not define our identity, they should be used to describe our identity to others. At least this is the conclusion I've come to after much introspective thought about it.
9	tl;dr - this sub is like Vegemite and should be enjoyed in small dabs, lest the saltiness overwhelm you\n\nAs many of the commenters here have already mentioned: if you're basing your entire existence on being an INFP, you're likely to be doing it wrong. The reason is because it's merely an *indicator,* a mark of what things you *prefer.* By all rights I should be a writer or artist or photographer yet I'm training to be in the hard sciences because I like doing that too. I actually did the (properly administered) test and this was the gist of my conversation with the person who administered it.\n\nThe MBTI is supposed to show you which things you're naturally attracted to, or which things you may be a bit uncomfortable with. It (psychological validity is another question entirely) tells you for example, how you're likely to behave in social situations, but that's not at all the same as how you *will* behave. Only you can determine that.\n\nNow you comment that the INFP sub has a lot of INFP-ness to it, which is a bit confusing to me because at face value that seems to be the entire *purpose* of the sub. For me, I see it as a place to examine those parts of your personality (and the results, i.e. poetry, prose, art!) that the MBTI throws up. But like pretty much like anything else taken to excess, if you stay around in here for too long, you focus on those aspects more - whether that's a good thing or not depends on context. In your case, I would argue that just because you find those aspects overwhelming is no reason to say the sub is toxic - simply that moderation in looking at those aspects of your personality is probably best.\n\nYou get a bit of a choice in what labels do and don't define you. If you find that the INFP label doesn't adequately define you - fantastic! It means you have room to grow and reach out, and explore, and try to get comfortable with different situations in life. Just because the mirror reflects (foggily) you at the moment is no reason to break the mirror, more a reason to think, 'is this who I really am?' And if not, why does it say that, in what situations do I need to improve, and in which areas do I need to be less harsh on my self? I find that personally seeing it as a tool for self-improvement is the best use of the MBTI and actually jibes with your interpretation somewhat.\n\nStay positive :)
14	Oh. It's that time of year again. Another post complaining about the sub. These kind of posts are so much more annoying than any other post on this sub.  \nPeople want their space to vent and chill. Just let it be what it is, stop trying to force your own agenda. 
6	It's a description of people, not a definition. I see people mixing the two up with every thing--astrological signs, sexuality, gender, mental conditions, MBTI, skin color, country of orgin, the list goes on. The trick is not to identify, but to use it as a tool to learn about your self, and describe your self if need be. But don't define your self with this. 
18	Count the I's in your text and then go shame yourself somewhere for trying to project your thoughts and feelings onto other people and let them think they are the same as you are.
5	Actually yes, I agree to an extent at least. I think the problem is much more widespread though. Just like any system that tries to categorize and label people, there is also always the danger of boxing people in and making that label become your identity. Whether it be the Enneagram, MBTI types, or any other kind of personality system its just that - a system. Sometimes it can feel really good to feel like you belong to something and to be able to make sense of yourself and the world through a certain lens but I like the metaphor of colors. I once heard the MBTI types described as colors: red, orange, yellow, green, etc. Obviously, there are only so many colors just as there are types but there is an infinite amount of shades and hues. Each person is unique and is there own mix within that color, if that makes sense. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't take a subreddit to be toxic, but rather our own interpretations and what we do with the information. Don't mistake this as me blaming you or something like that but I see the problem everywhere, including within myself. I'm glad you were able to overcome it though! I don't think it has to be dehumanizing but certainly if you're feeling like that, it's important to take a step back and figure out why, as you did. Indeed we are all equal and also special in our own ways all at once and I suppose that's the beauty of it all. 
5	This is the danger with any group formed around a shared interest, unfortunately. I remember a similar dynamic becoming a problem with groups I was in in college and with Buddhist groups I used to be a part of.\n\nWhile I agree with your caution to people here not to become too invested to the point where they're closed-minded and see people only as letters, I don't think this specific group poses that risk any more than any other I've seen. 
3	Life is complex, labels allow you reduce complexity and make the ride less confusing.\n\nI don‚Äôt think many here believe being superior to other types. See the intj/infj for that :)\n\n\n
3	I understand what you mean and I agree MBTI definitely *can* be toxic depending on how one applies it.\n\nI think it's best to use MBTI to explain and understand people and **not** as an excuse for poor behavior. My INTP friend is generally intelligent, but she is very into MBTI and constantly uses her type as an excuse for her negative traits and outright selfish behavior. It's as if it would be impossible for her to improve herself because she is an INTP and that's 'how they are.'\n\nIt's important to remember that while certain types might be more prone to a certain behavior or way of thinking, both total jerks and wonderful people alike exist of every type and you should still strive to improve yourself. I think it's possible to use MBTI to better understand others, recognize where you yourself are lacking, and actually work on improving yourself. However, there are some people who use it to stunt their growth as a person and assume that any shortcoming that someone sees in them is exclusively *their problem* ***because that's just how \[x\] MBTI type is***. It's a really awful and easy mindset to fall into. You will push away those close to you who are confronting you because they care about you (and possibly your relationship with them) enough to do so.\n\nI've definitely been guilty of this myself in the past, but I'd like to think I've become a lot more self aware in the past couple of years. I know it sounds cliche and silly, but if you treat life as a journey in which you try to become the best you that you can be, it will not only benefit yourself, but those around you as well. That's what I've come to believe, anyway. And I'm far from perfect myself, so I don't mean to sound preachy. It's just something I've been trying to work towards and it feels relevant to this topic.\n\nIn any case, while I agree with your points, I wouldn't go as far as to call this subreddit toxic. As you've stated, many of the people in it are very well-meaning. Can someone use MBTI to excuse their own toxic behavior and develop a toxic mindset because of it? Yes. Anyone can. They could probably use other labels to do the same thing too, such as mental illnesses, sexuality, race, gender, etc. That being said, I don't really think you should single out INFPs, as other types (and their subs) are just as guilty as giving people that kind of mindset.\n\nI enjoyed reading your perspective and I do think this is an important issue to keep in mind. Thank you for sharing! Most of all, I'm really glad you managed to pull out of that hole you described -- it is not an easy realization to make!
3	I remember the first time I did the test and I read the description of the INFP. And I remember bawling my eyes out, because so much of it was so extremely recognisable. I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äòweird‚Äô, or ‚Äòodd‚Äô, or ‚Äòwrong‚Äô like I‚Äôve so often felt when I was younger because of other people‚Äôs comments. I felt like I did make some sense apparently! :D\n\nAnd the thought struck me that there are others who think and feel similarly. Not the same, but somewhere on the same frequency. That blew my mind. \n\nSo personally, I feel a place like this is amazing, as people can share some of that inner turmoil, creativity, crazy joy and random philosophical questioning, and open up on a lot of the things that are not always touched upon in daily life.\n\nI get your point, but I think it all boils down to the individual and their choice whether it confirms for them they can stay where they are or whether they can find empowerment and insight to grow. There‚Äôs a time and place for both. And this place offers encouragement either way. People figure out what it is they need exactly in their own pace :).
2	Oh. I just subscribed. Should I stick to the mbti forums? I was kinda hoping this was a little like infpgc from ye olden days. Ah well.
2	yup I agree, it's important to realise that all of us are very unique and special personalities so it's almost never 100% correct when it comes to "labeling"... \n\nFor me I would say I am about 70/80% INFP and that's okay, why is this quite useful for me is to realise what are my strengths and weaknesses and quite often to find out how other personalities my perceive my behaviour. \n\nI believe that extremes are the worst in basically everything, and unfortunately on reddit it quite often happens. I am a fan of Keto diet so I was on their sub, and basically posted my progress with a title like "thank you, it's time to quite.." where I basically was really grateful and thanked everyone for the support etc.... and basically they acted like butthurt babies bashing me and blaming me how terrible I am and Keto is the best and I will regret leaving... etc... it was literally like a religious cult or sect haha, and they did not even read the article, they just say words "I quite" in my "favourite subreddit" so automatically I am an asshole and I am angry and butthurt.... people are the worst sometimes and that sux because I really never want to be rude or not nice to anyone but I am just way to often labeled as an asshole. \n\nBut anyway I get your point stay strong and do whatever makes you happy, good luck have a great day!
2	It shouldn't be used to justify behavior. It should be used to understand yourself and help you work around your limitations.
3	That's because the one thing we all have in common is we are INFPs. If you want something else to relate to go to a different sub. And most INFPs use this sub to vent/rant about things in their lives, that's why you see more sad posts than happy posts. Also it's your fault for seeing yourself as an object not us, I have never seen myself as just an INFP, so that's your bad.
1	I used to be an infp and now Im an infj, but I still relate to some of the stuff that is posted here, just like I do in the infj sub and in a lot of other personality types in general. It's not like you HAVE to box yourself into this category, there are plenty of subs for dealing with depression and mental health that people can seek out if they want to. As long as someone doesn't take it too far, like you did, this sub is not toxic at all. It's a fun place to relate to others who MAY or MAY NOT have similar life experiences and values. Even though most people in this group ARE infp's, they're all still individuals and wildly different in many ways. I think it's healthy to try to understand yourself better by learning about your brain, and I think if there's a superiority complex there like you described, then that's an unrelated problem that needs solving. 
1	I'm an INTP cusp so I know I'm a lil insensitive, but how does your self-concept make this sub toxic? Get a grip..
1	Ty for posting this OP
1	This INFP begs to differ:\nhttps://reddit.app.link/vYimnraeKU\n\nIt's really a matter of perspective. Real talk: I tend to do the same thing you do (with romanitcizing the seemingly intangible) because I don't yet know who I am. And because I don't know where to start my journey and fear failure, I let four letters run my life and expect it to make me feel better when I do mess up. \n\nLearn from me and don't do this. It will save you from an unnecessary struggle. Put that struggle where it matters; relationships, self-improvement, being your best self/actualization, etc.
1	If you don't like it here, go find another sub. Don't waste your time, do what you like and love
1	Personally I‚Äôve been dealing with depression and this sub helps me embrace my weirdness when some people have labeled me as the crazy one  for sharing a dream I had or being less interested into concrete works etc... It made me more humble too when I discovered that I was not this girl with an unique way of thinking because I was not alone... Maybe you really relied on it in an unhealthy way ? I hope you‚Äôll get better either way :)
9	Dating advice for a clueless 28 year old infp‚Äî yes this is where I get most of my dating advice (back off!)	Hey guys,\n\nAs you might see from my posting history, I like to ask dating advice from other infps. Mainly cause y‚Äôall are squishy and respectful and also because I don‚Äôt have a gaggle of girlfriends to tell me what to do (which is why my life will never be a romantic comedy).\n\nSo broke up with an entj after six months because he turned kind of possessive, pushy, and generally low key scary. Guy had a traumatic childhood, and it was hard to leave, but a single mom can‚Äôt be introducing possessive men to her kid‚Äî no matter how all those paperback bodice rippers portray Jack the FBI agent. \n\nSo a month goes by, and I started seeing a guy (either infp or infj, but definitely a type four with a five wing on the enneagram). He‚Äôs punk in an agreeably grown up way, and he plays bass, but he also had a job. Anyway‚Äî he was really excited to meet me and warm initially. Then after we met, we had a pleasant date and he said he was definitely going to ‚Äúdate me‚Äù (I assume that was meant to ease my mind after we had sex, but I don‚Äôt know ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and we started seeing each other pretty regularly. \n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing‚Äî his demeanor sort of changed. Still texted me often and in a timely fashion. Lots of gifs and funny stories. But he stopped flirting really. It felt more like a bromance. Also I started having to initiate times to hang out. Also those times started to turn into very casual hang outs‚Äî which is fine, but also sort of a bad sign if you‚Äôre wanting to actually build a relationship around more than diners, Netflix, and sex. \n\nSo I just straight up asked him if he was interested in a potential relationship or if we were just killing time. His response: \n\n‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôm not entirely sure. And that‚Äôs awkward to say. Cause I like hanging out and you‚Äôre not boring at all and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with you, but at the same time my brain is...dumb. That‚Äôs kinda the only way I can put it. I have a tendency to do this. Where I like someone and their company and everything else involved, but I‚Äôm simultaneously distant. Does that make sense at all? Cause I really feel like a dick about it cause you‚Äôre super sweet and...I‚Äôm this. Haha.\n\nAs far as I can tell, I think the last relationship burned out a lot of receptors on me. And/or I take after my dad who legitimately doesn‚Äôt have or want friends and he just spends his time alone. Kinda always has, especially after the parents split. Or I‚Äôm just using it as an excuse.\n\nBut...I don‚Äôt want you to think there isn‚Äôt chemistry or a spark or anything. Cause I don‚Äôt want that to come off like you‚Äôre not ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù or anything like that. I can‚Äôt think of anything I don‚Äôt like about you. I‚Äôm just not entirely sure what I want out of anything with anyone, I guess.\n\nBut if you‚Äôd like to step back from the ‚Äúromantic‚Äù portions of this, I‚Äôll support that decision. Or if you wanna keep hanging out and do the same things, that‚Äôs fine too. I‚Äôm the worst.\n\nBut right before we met I was having a REAL bad depressive episode that took like 3 weeks to pass, but I figured it was about time I tried something. \n\nBut like I said, I can‚Äôt think of anything I don‚Äôt like about you. Or why I WOULDNT date you in a more serious way. You‚Äôre sweet, incredibly wholesome, nice to be around, and you put up with my dumb jokes on a consistent basis. But there‚Äôs just some block in me mentally that I can‚Äôt explain. Regardless, I‚Äôm gonna feel like a dick over it cause...there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you or us. But I‚Äôd LOVE to see you happy and steady and everything. Sincerely. Cause I really think you deserve that.\n\nAt some point in the very near future I‚Äôll regret sabotaging myself like this, but I don‚Äôt want to hold up you being happier. We can be best friends, though. And still hang out and get foods. And...you‚Äôre crazy if you think these terrible jokes will change. And...I made myself sad already. Haha.‚Äù\n\nEnd texts.\n\nSo I had myself a little cry. And retained my dignity. And told him we could still be friends (just friends), but only if he made us friendship bracelets. Mine must say, ‚Äúbaddest bitch‚Äù and his, just ‚Äúbitch‚Äù\n\nAnyway, so he is now sooo flirty and warm and constantly texting me and stuff. And his demeanor has completely changed again! \nThis is the part where I behave like a grown up and leave it be, right?? I have a feeling he might be on his way to taking back his earlier confusion, but I /don‚Äôt/ trust that, riiiight???\n\nHelp. \n
10	Yeah it sounds like he doesn't know what he wants. Which ends up with him playing games with your emotions. That is a red flag. Him having depression and possibly co-dependent issues is also a red flag. Also there is the possibility he is not over his ex? What do you think? Do you want to stay friends? It is okay to say goodbye too because you could start to see someone who does want to be with you. There are other fish in the sea.
7	Run for the hills. This guy likes to play games. 
5	In his replied text he acknowledges your love, but that he himself is not ready. Your question was plain and simple, and his reply with "we can still be friends" marks the end of your and his advances toward a serious, healthy and stable relationship. I would end it here and now, even let the "friendship bracelet idea" take a hike.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that he's texting you with more nonsense only describes what he mentioned earlier. He acknowledges his own behavior. I fear that if you would let him continue in this manner, and you falling for it, you in the end would be a victim of his suffering. \n\nI hope you're able to make the right choice for yourself. 
3	The dude wants sex, and isn't wanting to man up. Ugh I know these dudes üòëüòëüòëüòëüòë\n\nYou deserve a man who's like "DATE YOU??? FUCK YEAH I'LL DATE YOU!!! YOU'RE THE BEST!!" A man who loves your humor and quietness and zaniness and lovely heart and the way you smile. A man who NEEDS to know you more and more, who cant get enough.\n\nI'm serious. They're out there, and they will find you one day.\n\nLife is too short to waste on the ones who dont say "FUCK YEAH!" to the awesomeness and beauty that is YOU. \n\nIt sucks, when we really like them. But I promise you, the ones who are worth the heart, know you're worth it too. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
3	I would steer clear of this guy. You're an infp. You know he'll destroy you. 
3	Were you dating my ex? Seriously üòê 
40	Life‚Äôs been a little rough. Tried to draw how I feel.	
3	Damn this hits home in every way. Great job!
3	Oh, honey. (((hug)))
83	There‚Äôs a part of me that is so angry it feels numb, this is really different from my normal art, but was trying to show contempt and the heat of sadness and the chill of bitter anger, and how it all feels washed out because it‚Äôs so deeply buried in me now.	
2	Thank you for showing us a glimpse of how you feel, i know when we try to express ourselves the emotions are so multidimensional that we cant always put them together in a single image for others to see. The blank cavas around the images also speaks volumes about how much you wanted to put out but still couldn't...

5	Can you relate?	I recently found this community and am thoroughly enjoying it!\n\nI was curious to see if anyone on here as an INFP can relate to these or if it is just me:\n\nI have very vivid day dreams, sleep dreams and fantasies. I often don‚Äôt know if I dreamt something or if it really happened. I find myself imagining scenarios happening in my life, both good and bad. For example what would happen if I got into a car accident and was in the hospital or died. I‚Äôd come up with specific detail about how my husband would have conversations with my boss and family. I‚Äôd then ‚Äúwake up‚Äù from my day dream and realize I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the last 30 mins of driving.\n\nI procrastinate everything. Everything! From waking up in the morning, to going to the bathroom, to waiting until very last minute before an appointment so I arrive RIGHT on time, to even going to sleep at night. I‚Äôll literally lay there at night exhausted wth one eye open trying to finish going down a ‚Äúrecommended for you‚Äù YouTube rabbit hole of nothingness.\n\nI enjoy trying new ways to be creative and regularly draw, paint, cook, do pottery, make shirts, etc. but I feel like I am mediocre at all of it. I don‚Äôt have the drive to get really good at any of it and I tend to get bored of it quickly.\n\nI like having a lot of work projects on the go and would rather jump from project to project instead of finishing one thing before starting something new.\n\nI have a 9-5 type job as a graphic designer / marketing manager. I love my job as I get to be creative and enjoy the challenge of having goals/targets I need to meet. but I hate being bound to a traditional 9-5 job. The idea of climbing a corporate ladder doesn‚Äôt interest me and I hate the feeling of working away my life and spending so much wasted time doing nothing of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù.\n\nI am very even tempered, quiet, reserved, inactive, soft spoken 90% of the time but I really enjoy doing high adrenaline adventures / activities like bungy jumping, sky diving, rappelling down buildings, cliff jumping, and I think it‚Äôs to balance out? I think I also like drinking alcohol because it gets me out of my shell and the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling.\n\n\nSo curious if anyone can relate to these and which ones!
5	99% of the people on this subreddit will relate to everything you wrote
3	I can relate to all of it. 
3	Besides the job, I feel like I could have written that word for word. I work in a bakery and I hate it because  the pay and hours are terrible and it's not like everyone thinks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, I agree with you 100% on everything else. It's kind of creepy how accurate it is.
3	>  I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the last 30 mins of driving.\n\nDrive safe, for yourself and others. Not saying you're not, just a gentle reminder.\n\n> I procrastinate everything. Everything!

9	The quest for self	21 M American College student here and I wanna tell you that this specific Reddit thread right here pretty much saved my life. It gave me the inspiration power and drive to to one not kill myself two go out and find information that helped me figure out my dellimma and three helped me love and accept myself. We as info are made different from those that we surround ourselves with and sometimes it can be overwhelming but never give up because we are given this specific personality for a reason and its up to u to find it. This is my quest for self series I'm going to summarize my journey for the self and what events unfolded over the past eight months that put me in the spot I am in at this very moment.
3	Holy Hell....awesome to hear <3
1	20 M here from an American college. I want to hear your story
20	We are the dreamers.	There's no one like us. When others can't see the way forward we don't pretend that we know what it is. But we know the things we've seen and we know things get better. It's in our nature I think as INFP's. I think my personality has changed a bit over the years but I'm really proud of being an INFP.\n\nI'm not perfect but I hope I practice what I preach, I hope that I'm just as hopeful as I tell everyone else to be. At the end of the day I try to put forth good energy into the world. I don't need anyone to remember my name. As long as I know I made a difference to at least one person, I think that's enough for me.\n\nThank you for this community :)
2	Amen
9	Does anybody else get small moments of loneliness?	Recently I‚Äôve moved to the other side of the US because work I still talk to my old friends/family, and have a friend here however sometimes as night whenever I‚Äôm not talking to someone I feel alone. This is different as normally I enjoy the myself time with a bit of tea, but I‚Äôve noticed it recently.
9	No, I‚Äôm lonely all the time.
1	I know what you mean. I recently visited a friend for 2 weeks that I don‚Äôt get to see very often, and when I came back home, it was almost like I left a piece of myself behind with him. I find loneliness is one of the hardest emotions to deal with, personally. \n\nI know it just means that I care and that I enjoy the company of other people, but it doesn‚Äôt help with sating the need for another persons presence.\n\nSome days are easier than others. Some days I may miss someone or want to hang out, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me if I can‚Äôt. Other days, i‚Äôm a sobbing mess from feeling isolated.\n\nIn the end, I just keep reminding myself that I will see them again and talk to them again, and that the emotions i‚Äôm feeling are very valid. I find telling them you miss them helps, and the other person tends to be touched that they are being missed.
1	Hey, if you feel lonely we have an INFP Telegram chat group where you can recharge a little from your loneliness.

15	Dating ENFP	Please no negative stories. I know they're out there for every type pairing.\n\nI (infp, f) recently started dating an ENFP Male and.......WHERE HAS HE BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE.\n\nI was in a long term with my ex ISTJ. I loved him dearly, but a huge chunk of my soul went untouched.\n\nBut wowsers. Enfps, eh? What freaking gems.
5	i love ENFPs, they‚Äôre one of the only types that I feel understand me!
2	Those wacky sons of guns are so much fun. Also, that easy emotional intimacy is like catnip, eh? Other pluses includes the tangent hopping conversations, interspersed with dives into some abstract topics. Oh, and the willingness to try new things and go exploring is such a gift!\n\nThe pros make the cons tolerable
2	I have been with my ENFP boyfriend for 5 years and I honestly feel like he‚Äôs my other half, he‚Äôs my best friend and i can talk to him about anything! I‚Äôm an infp and I usually just listen when people talk to me and i don‚Äôt mind it, but i don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing my thoughts and opinions with others that I‚Äôm not close with. But with my man I can rant for HOURS! He‚Äôs the only one who gives me a chance to speak and he actually listens to me, he‚Äôs a blessing üòå 
1	You‚Äôre one lucky lady LMAO. I‚Äôm crushing on an ENFP Male and although we feel the same way (I basically wrote an essay to him and he did the same djskskakkaak), we decided to just stay as friends because ya know.... we both are internet friends. Being far apart sucks so much :,)
1	For what it‚Äôs worth I love your sub way more than ours. I haven‚Äôt definitively met an INFP in real life but I imagine it to be like our hearts completely exposed. Fi is a beautiful thing.

62	My son has a new puppy. I'm already heartbroken for him.	I may be emotionally compromised from lack of sleep, but seeing my son be so responsible and loving to his dog has me already grieving it's loss. \n\nMy son didn't connect with our current Pikachu (Pekingese Chihuahua mix), and has been sad about it. She growls at him (albeit softly) when he tries to show her affection. Typical of Chihuahuas, she is really attached to my wife and I. My son has shown signs that he LOVES dogs and that he really needs someone to show affection to. My son and wife have similar personalities and butt heads a lot. He doesn't go out if his way to show affection to anyone so we hoped this might bring him out of his shell a bit.\n\nWife decided that a puppy would be good for my 9 year old son, and after much deliberation, we decided to get him one. \n\nWe picked up a Doxle for free from a friend. My son picked the 4 month old runt of the litter, (which doesn't help my emotions, I would have done the same). She is literally 3 times smaller than her brothers and sisters. The dog is so small and fragile that I'm scared for it constantly.\n\nThe dog has such an amazing personality though. Unlike our other dog, she is inquisitive about anyone that comes into my son's room and wants to give them affection.\n\nWhat really opened the floodgates this morning though, was that I got up to get ready for work, looked out the window to the backyard, and saw my son outside, fully dressed, watching the dog and making sure she did her business outside.\n\nHe's the most responsible of our kids, but  not the eldest, and I didn't think he was THAT responsible. In that moment, watching him, I saw the next 12 -14 years flash by and thought about her final days. I thought that this will be his true best friend for the foreseeable future. It's too much. Even now, as I type this, I can't handle it and need to stop before I become a mess.\n\nThanks for letting me unload.
26	He‚Äôs still a kid. He‚Äôll always love the dog, but you‚Äôll have to expect that he‚Äôll get stronger. He‚Äôll be able to handle it better in 10 yrs, don‚Äôt worry.\n\nAnd even then (in 10 yrs) Kids tend to bounce back pretty quickly about death as well. They don‚Äôt philosophize about it the same as adults. He‚Äôll be fine
7	I don't have kids but I think i know this feeling. Sometimes I just get this weird sadness thinking about dogs lives.. it's hard to explain. They just want to love and enjoy life and the lucky ones get to, but they are only here for a short time.. kinda like a microcosm of a person.
5	Aw man, we just lost our family dog this weekend. He was 14 years old and passed in his sleep. He was a gift for my little sister but then became more attached to my dad. He was my dad's baby after all us kids moved out. I'm just so sad for him now and I hate to see my own father cry.
4	This was very touching to read. I can completely understand why your thoughts would go in that direction. There is a book about a boy and his dog form every generation in our history, and the dog always dies. It is the bittersweet right of passage that a boy mush go through. I work with dogs at a daycare, and having the strong level of empathy, I'm always partly thinking about when it will be there time. I do so with my own pets as well. The one thing that helps me get through it is trying to make sure that the life the live, no matter the length, is as good as it can possibly be. I think your son is going to give his puppy a great life. 
3	Don't think about that puppy's final years. Instead enjoy watching your kid and that puppy grow up together and creating a very strong bond/friendship. There's no use worrying  about things that might happen. The most blissful things are happening before your eyes right now. 
2	I lost my dog of 16 years last year. It was one of the most heart-wrenching things I've had to endure in my 38 years on this planet.\n\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't give up the 16 years I had with her for anything. You've given your son a wonderful gift. It may come with grief in the future, but the good will far outweigh the bad.
3	Jeez chill out n let the kid enjoy his time with the dog. It‚Äôs gonna be heartbreaking losing any love but he‚Äôs happy with the dog now focus on that.

It's a tree of life that's growing out of the heart in the shape of DNA because our hearts declare our DNAs in the way that our personalities define our lives so this tree is unique for everyone since everyone has a different personality so this tree speaks a lot about your heart. I like your tree. It's beautiful. I hope you're having a great day ‚ù§

6	Yup
6	I am as well
5	Yes and no. \n\nI still sort of lean no, because the way I think of it, is like if Canada had a terrorist organization operating within its borders launching missiles into the US, and Canada was just kinda like ‚Äúsorry dude can‚Äôt do anything about it,‚Äù the US would have to do something. \n\nThe civilians obviously don‚Äôt deserve it, and there‚Äôs obviously war crimes being committed by lone factors, but what‚Äôs a guy to do when an organization is attacking their country with impunity from its country of origin. \n\n
8	I'm going to make a really dangerous assumption, but you really can't be an informed Infp and not empathize with the Palestinian cause, breaks my heart that many people are suffering just because some a**holes decided their land was not theirs anymore. #freePalestine \n\nAlso, it is really difficult to me to understand how being the oppressed one you become such a horrid oppressor, shouldnt the Jewish people be working towards a world without discrimination of any type, let alone occupation, incarceration, starvation and a really long list of human rights violations? 
3	Yup
3	I'm just pro self-determination and pro not hurting others.
1	Ya Germany should've given Jews their land not Palestinians 
1	Lean more towards israel. I use to research the topic a lot more a few years back but it's just one of those murky grey areas so I gave up. I just don't know. A lot of the really pro israel people always think israel is always right, even though they say no country is perfect. And I don't agree with that, even though I understand they are in a very difficult situation, and arguably are doing better than what other countries would do. They don't always do good.\n\nBut they face heavy scrutiny from the whole world, every move they make is watched and criticised. I saw the UN had the same amount of resolutions against Israel as they did Syria and North korea which is insane.\n\nTHEN AGAIN a lot of the supporters of israel are very right wing religious people. While I'm religious myself I disagree with a lot of right wing positions, and so I wonder if their support of israel is also from a corrupt standpoint. Not saying righties are bad people, just specific types of them bug me (anti climate change, against universal healthcare ect)
9	I can‚Äôt pull myself out of depression because my real life will never live up to my expectations	Ate a sour bowl of reality cereal this morning as I was rejected from my dream job after months of interviewing and waiting. My whole life I felt sadness because I had such grandiose dreams of what I would become when I got older. Now as an adult i realize the things that prevent me from achieving that dream life are my own short comings that can‚Äôt be fixed. \n\nJust feeling down today, fellow infps. What‚Äôs up with you guys?   
7	Not much. Cried most of the night feeling sorry for myself. Getting too old to chase those dreams. Not sure if getting rich would make me happier. Fantasizing about killing myself but I still care too much about what others might think so I probably won‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt know, the usual stuff... too dark?
3	I‚Äôve been overthinking all day, so i‚Äôve decided to give myself a break from thinking and look at animals and nice things that make me happy :) I‚Äôve realized today that I have trouble being empathetic to myself, so i‚Äôm trying to treat myself the same way I treat others
3	I feel it's helped my outlook on life to just not have expectations in general. Whatever happens, happens. I'm just along for the ride.
3	Accept the current situation for what it is. Accept yourself for who you are now.\n\nThis doesn't mean you languish in whatever slum you are in right now indefinitely or forever, but that you stop fighting what is and who you are right now. In other words, stop beating yourself up for beating yourself.\n\nWhen you are able to accept the right now situation and you, you can see clearer what and how things are. Then you can see what actions may be taken to improve some things.
2	Ay man, what do you by 'own short comings that CAN'T be fixed'? \n\nWe're all dynamic human beings, I highly doubt that the stuff you think is stopping you from achieving your dream life is unfixable. Unless ya'know, you dont reach the heigh limit to become a jet-pilot or whatever, lol.
2	When a person starts with I Cant... that turns into never.\n\nTry saying I can or I will.\n\nTreat you downer as you would if a person was physically holding you down,  are you going to just let them do it?  Then why do it to yourself? Hopefully that helped a bit.  Sorry if it seems but harsh. 
4	talks too much or not at all?	I've been someone who you would describe as "shy" for my whole life. If you asked somebody to describe me, 9/10 they would say some version of "quiet" "shy" etc- but my closest friends always tells me I talk too much--- I have trouble making friends, but the ones I have become extremely close- and I can really talk, talk, talk. It's weird, because I go from one extreme to the other- I am definitely "mostly" introverted, but I need social interaction-  I've had people go from "wow I didn't know you could talk" to "please stop talking" -I love having deep, long conversations with people I feel comfortable around, but I won't even talk to people I don't know. \n\nDoes anyone else get this?
2	My parents describe my as not a pep or doesn‚Äôt stay quite.
8	Remember more‚Äîmore, more, weep more, it may cleanse the soul.	:)
1	All alone and no one to tell to? Huh?
1	Scientific studies say: not quite 
8	I like cats but afraid to play with them because I think that I might annoy them instead.	Anyone else? 
5	I suggest looking into cat body language :) they are very loving and caring animals, but they are fickle and need more space than a dog would. They give off a lot of signals to tell you how they feel, so if you are annoying them, they will let you know :3 I hope this helps!
22	When i find a song or a movie trailer that makes me cry, i hit that shit repeatedly like it‚Äôs a crack addiction... am i alone in this?	
4	You are not alone.
3	I was having a bad day a couple days ago and listened to the same depressing song on repeat for 45 minutes. Wtf is wrong with me üòÇ
5	Can you help me with my comic book title?	Hi everyone. I'm a latin american guy of 21 years. My mother language is spanish, so my english must be very bad for the most of you, sorry. I help myself with the Google translator. I did the MBTI test a couple of times and the result is always INFP. I feel strongly identified with this type, especially for the creative part. And now i writing a comic book about a girl who can talk with ghosts, and relates to them in different ways. I'm stuck with the title. I thought about calling it simply Ghost, but it does not finish convincing me. \nMaybe this is not the most appropriate site to post this, but as you are creative people, maybe can help me. Any idea? The central themes of the story are guilt, love, fear and human experience. Thanks for reading!
1	"La Infanta Phantasma" \n\nMake her heir to the kingdom for extra backstory and a cool rhyme. Maybe she doesn't know true love because of her high status and protective environment. I'm brainstorming here. \nSounds cool to say though!
1	Afterlife
1	G Host\n\nShe‚Äôs the host of ghosts 
1	Spectral analysis
1	"In the Spirit of"\n\nMeans that the person involved was in the right mood to do something, and literally being within the ghost.
1	Faded\n\nOr\n\nFaded Life\n\n
1	I Can Hear Voices\n\n\n\nDon‚Äôt ask me why, it was the strongest one I could think of
3	Are there non-artistic/non-creative INFPs?	I'm an INFJ and I'm just beginning to understand INFPs.\n\nAre there some of you that fits most chracteristics of an INFP, except for being inclined to arts/creativity?
7	I think all INFP's have the opportunity to be artsy, but not everyone uses his potential. 
3	Not creative or naturally artistic üò≥
2	Yeah, I‚Äôm a horrible artist and don‚Äôt have much interest in art.
1	I cannot decorate space, but I enjoy decorating time :)
5	Do you ever think this sub fits the stereotype too much?	I‚Äôm an ENTP, so I might be wrong. But I only recently started following this sub (bc my friend is an INFP and we like sharing mbti memes and articles and stuff). But do you guys sometimes think that this sub fits the whole mbti stereotype a little too much? \n\nDon‚Äôt come @ me but do you ever feel that maybe because you‚Äôre an INFP you *have* to try and fit into the stereotype? \n\nJust speculating, no tea, no shade
13	I've spent a lot of my time on here geared towards being supportive of people younger than me, since it seems like a lot of people here are kinda down in the dumps and need someone to be kind about who they are. I see what you mean, to a degree, but honestly I usually just skip over what doesn't resonate with me here and assume others do the same. Maybe people here just aren't as vocal about disagreement or "not getting" something.
6	Yes, I find it just a bit too stereotypical, sometimes even comically. \n\nNo, beware of labels that you put on yourself and others.
5	Lots of people here post when they are feeling down. Imo mentally healthier INFPs tend to lurk and not post as much. Since being an INFP is a very "emotional" type it kind of feeds into itself, creating some comically exaggerated posts sometimes. That said, I like checking this sub when I feel down as in a way its kind of like a safe haven to me.\n\nAs for your second question, I think we all subconciously do at some point. 
2	>But do you guys sometimes think that this sub fits the whole mbti stereotype a little too much? \n\nYeah, it does sometimes almost seem as if some of the people in this sub go out of their way to fit into the INFP stereotype just so they can get other INFPs to relate and empathize with them (I'll admit that I've done this a couple of times). It's good to see some art and have people vent every now and then, but you get bored of it eventually. \n\n>Don‚Äôt come @ me but do you ever feel that maybe because you‚Äôre an INFP you have to try and fit into the stereotype? \n\nNah, I don't like conforming to stereotypes, but I usually won't go out of my way to break them either. Although it's been at least a year since I've been into MBTI and already settled on my type, I still doubt my type at least 20% of the time lol
2	I'm an ENTP too, and have been visiting different MBTI subs out of curiosity, and that's what I've observed each time. People are often proud to be the MBTI type that they are, and want to feel like they're a part of a community, so they sometimes start acting like their MBTI's type caricature. It's also very true in the entp sub, where some entps feel the need to write stuff like "I'm too lazy to actually finish writing that down" or "I'm just more intelligent than everybody else" to show how true entps they are.
13	What if you didn‚Äôt run? This one time. What if you stayed, and let love overtake you?	
10	It would be hard to believe someone could love me back. If I were to stay by their side and they chose to stay by mine, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much that could make me happier. I‚Äôd be happy just being beside them as a friend forever, I value their company and what they bring to my life no matter what :) 
4	I'd probably be taken advantage of again and used. But that's most of my life when it came to friends and the 1 girl I asked out. I truly don't know. But my fears of abandonment and being used are so strong, I feel like I'm choking when I try to overcome it now.
2	Fear of disappointment m8 I build stuff up to high that if they don't end up being as I had hoped the feeling hurts 
1	I was thinking about it last night and honestly, so far attempts at it have been heartwarming and taught me valuable matters.\n\nAlso reminded me of a quote:\n\n>"My therapist told me that anxious people have a tendency to only explore the scary 'what ifs' and challenged me to remember that there is also a flip side. What if you excel? What if it is one of the best experiences of your life? What if it changes you in a beautiful way?" ‚Äî [twitter.com/\_\_bhb\_\_](https://twitter.com/__bhb__?fbclid=IwAR3MS1Sa9tiN3TfKCRNNKSYVHLqEydi1TO1imWU2FJxqF9T0hc1SzbVU--4)\n\n&#x200B;

2	How do people conceptualize this stuff? Like I would never think to put, what, a house, as a tit? And a little canal with a whirlpool or a galaxy for the inside of the head? Like, it's cool, I just don't know how people think of this stuff. I would definitely have to try to be pretentious to do something like this, cuz I just don't have tit houses circling around in my head. How do you make it up?
2	The detail and complexity of it is beautiful. Such gorgeous work. I would something inspired by what you felt during the process. Was it nothingness? Or the numb feeling? Something as simple as "Blank" would draw the attention and have that hidden meaning under it. The word or more so words I feel when I look at this is "Somber emptiness".

2	Here's another poem.	Read me the stars above and tell me which one's are a plane, \nMy idiosyncratic Naivety was all the more I couldn't contain;\nAfternoons labeled by playground skirmishes\nIn the Cold war fought with action figures and trading cards, \nEnding in stalemates with imaginations Avant-Garde.\nEchoes of coalescent conjectures emanating from her hurried mind, \nReaching where no father could find:\nThe husk of liveliness and fulfillment, \nIn the reckless abandon of circumstance.\nTorn from rationality and delved in understanding of blank disposition,\nBenevolence and well-being dwindle horrifically as tomorrow reigns supreme.\nI'll take my leave once yesterday gives away.
2	Beautiful 
25	Are you ashamed of your anger?	Just wondering how common it is for us INFPs to supress our anger, and possibly it being the reason most of us are a little "too" quiet and nice. More specifically, were you told it was wrong to express your anger when you were a child? And in the same vein, do you view expressing anger as childish? 
20	I suppress my anger because I am typically downright mean, hurtful, and cruel when angry. I try very hard to suppress my anger, because I have noticed that a gentle voice typically works better at getting a statement or point across, than an angry one.\n\nHowever, I do feel that there are times when you just have to get angry... just don‚Äôt be unkind in your anger, if that makes sense. 
8	I was a victim of sibling abuse as a small child. I grew up and unwittingly married a criminal psychopath. (Yes, he was diagnosed by a psychologist and has the same personality profile as Ted Bundy. Yes, really.) In our nearly ten-year relationship, all my emotions were used against me. I've heard pyschopathic abuse described as emotional murder, and I concur. My psyche nearly died.\n\nA few years after I escaped, I started having fits of uncontrollable anger. I threw things. I screamed. I was baffled and frightened, and I wondered if I was going crazy. It was all I could do to keep a lid on my emotions.\n\nA few years ago, I finally found a really good trauma therapist. One of the things she explained to me was that normal people have emotional boundaries, but victims of chronic abuse do not. She told me to embrace my anger, not to stifle it. The anger meant I was forming emotional boundaries, deciding what was okay and what was unacceptable. She told me that, in time, I would learn emotional regulation. \n\nAs I embraced my anger (without physically harming anyone, of course), I came to realize how I was changing for the better. For example, a member of my \[new\] husband's family had always seemed sweet and charming. Suddenly, he made my skin crawl. It took me a while to realize that this family member had narcissistic tendencies, and my new boundaries made me less likely to be victimized. I also realized my anger toward aggressive drivers came from a place of feeling disrespected and marginalized, as I had felt in my marriage. As I worked through it, I went from being extremely angry for days to being moderately angry for a few hours. I still have a long way to go, but I'm starting to self-regulate.\n\nThese days, I use the anger as a tool. It helps me dig deeper and see what the real issue is. Do I feel threatened? Do I feel unheard? Which boundary is being pushed? Thinking about the anger helps me calm down faster. No, it doesn't always work. My husband has learned that I need to rage sometimes, and bless his INTJ heart, but he just waits for me to finish and asks if I need a hug.\n\nI think we INFPs experience a lot of boundary-related anger, even those of us who were not abused. I think society runs right over our boundaries, and our desperate need to avoid confrontation compounds the problem. \n\nTo answer your question, I was not told it was wrong to express anger as a child, I just didn't express it often. (My parents were not afraid to openly argue, and  I grew up believing that you should stand up for yourself. I was punished for it by my abuser, which complicates things.)  I don't believe anger is childish.
7	I was often told I had a "big temper" and I was ashamed of that.  It took me many years to realize that, actually, my mother had a huge fear of anger because her father would scream and yell and spank her brothers. I think she wanted to make sure I never turned out like that. So, since childhood, my pattern has been to bottle my anger. Unfortunately, that gives it time to get mixed up with many other emotions and I wind up frustrated and discombobulated.    \n\n\nNow I do my best to stay present and look at the anger as a thing that's here for now rather than something I *am*. I try to acknowledge and talk about how I'm feeling rather than stamping it down or losing my shit. Not easy and I'm better at it some days than others. I've found meditation helpful. 
5	I used to get openly angry when I was younger. I would be made fun of which both hurt and angered me. My father came to me and told me when I allow myself to become angry by the ignorance of other people I allow them to control me. From then on any time I would get mad I would just tell myself "You'll  get over it." Just reminding myself that anger doesn't last forever helps me shed it. I wouldn't say I think feeling anger is wrong, I just dont think it's productive for the life I want to live.
5	I was always the calm, harmonious child in my family so I do feel the need to suppress my anger or I shake it off as being irrational, causing a buildup of anger later on. I definitely get surprised reactions when I do get angry since I am usually pretty chill. It's hard to not feel ashamed of getting angry or upset when everyone thinks you are a mild tempered person. Not all INFP's are calm and happy all the time! \n\nI'm definitely trying to work on not seeing my emotions as bad, but rather things that need to be expressed (in healthy ways of course). I suppress things way too often, and I've heard other INFP's saying they do that too.  
4	I had a hard challenge as a child I had to keep under control and I couldn't act out etc. My father had custody of me and if I were to do anything wrong he would take it out on my mother mostly and just say living with my mother may not be the best idea. So in respect for my mother I had to behave and stay seen and not heard. I also was married to someone that when I raised my voice it was taken as me yelling but I am very animated and I just do that naturally even when excited. I just never had the freedom to be myself and it has caused a lot of problems for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am just bubbly now and use escapism into the things I like so I don't have to think about things. I try to only cry when I am alone and sometimes my emotions are a bit chaotic but I just try to forget how i'm feeling.
4	I view it as extremely childish. And I‚Äôm really embarrassed by it. Especially because it goes from 0-100 and I feel like it exposes me as a bad communicator. Or I become ‚Äúthat guy with a stick up his ass‚Äù
5	I hate being angry. I feel out of control of myself, and worried that if I say something in anger, it will create conflict, which is one of my biggest fears in life (conflict w/another person makes me incredibly uncomfortable.) usually, I don‚Äôt get extremely angry. Whenever it does pop up, it presents itself as irritation and frustration. I‚Äôll cry when I get so mad that I feel like I‚Äôm going to scream. \n\nIt happened about a week ago; some idiots who worked at Chipotle were being really rude, and I was feeling stressed out already. After we got our food, I started to get really upset. I think I was guilting myself, and that tipped me over the edge. I felt terrible, because my girlfriend was with me, and she was worried she did something to make me angry. She didn‚Äôt, but all I could say was ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù While still crying and looking pissed as hell, and mostly avoiding her. I tend to shut down and have trouble communicating when I‚Äôm that upset. She herself shut down because she was worried I was upset with her. Once I calmed down, we agreed that I needed to give her some kind of signal when I get like that to let her know it isn‚Äôt her fault. I don‚Äôt think I could ever get that angry at someone I love. 
4	Not only as a child. When i get things out my "friends" still reprove it.\n\nI usually try to look at the reason after the anger to say if it is childish or not
6	I noticed that people who know me dont expect me to get angry at anything, because I'm so laid back and quiet, so when it finally happens and the switch is flicked people act like I'm sorta crazy for showing anger juss because they haven't seen me get angry. We're also human beings and shouldn't apologize for our emotions juss because they dont come out that much you know.\n\nExpressing any emotion is not childish ( as long as u dont go crazy with it lol), emotions dont jump out the bus juss because you're an adult.
3	I always suppress it. When I'm angry, it's like a bomb has gone off, and I really hate that side of me. So, I hold it back whenever possible. I've actually only ever gotten angry externally about three or four times in my life, as a result. I aim to keep it that way. I just feel absolutely awful after I've exploded on someone, so I never want to feel that again.
3	As I get older, I am less and less ashamed. Doesn't have anything to do with whether or not the anger is "appropriate" or "irrational" or what have you--that's an entirely separate issue. \n\nEverybody gets angry. And people who say they don't are lying to themselves, and I say that as someone who used to do that. Pretending I don't get angry doesn't mean I'm not actually angry, and admitting it doesn't mean I get angrier more often. I'm just acknowledging what's already happening emotionally. I find it makes me less resentful because I permit myself to have my feelings, whatever they are.
3	I have an interpretation of the philosophy of the Roman Senator Seneca that works here. \n\nAnger, among the other emotions, is the force that demands change. When we can‚Äôt vent our anger(and therefore get angry), it means that there is something that we strongly desire to change, but cannot.\n\nI got pretty angry a lot around 10-14yrs, but I saw it as justifiable, because it was around that time that I started noticing a great deal of bullshit.\n\nMy main triggers were the fact that I hated homework, I hated other people for being popular for the wrong things, and I HATED that my mom, who has a great deal of pride, was ‚Äúalways right‚Äù, even when she wasn‚Äôt. \n\nIn all of my problems the solution to my ANGER is actually simple: don‚Äôt be so optimistic/HOPEFUL, just because your expectations have merit doesn‚Äôt mean they should nor will ever be real!\n\nIt puts too much pressure on our environment to lash out because the way in which it is received is not accurate or consistent across everyone. Because of this, no matter what noble cause lies at the heart of your anger, lashing out will likely not get the response you are looking for.\n\nANGER is the energy of HOPE without the KNOWLEDGE to guide it down a constructive path.\n\nEdit: my examples are likely not the greatest because I was quite immature, they are just the most applicable personal examples I have for anger.
2	I just feel like it doesn't produce any good results. For example I yelled at a cashier the other day for being a controlling little shit and not bagging my items like he was supposed to, among some other things he did, like trying to make me do his job for him. Didn't really solve anything, as I most likely have a bad rep now since I spazzed out in front of like 20 people, but at least I got to say what I wanted, and I got some anger out, even though the shitty masses won't understand. But now it seems like I just have more problems. This pattern has happened before with no visibly good results. I feel like I'm supposed to learn something here? But I don't know what. I guess I just have to deal with people's shitty stupid shit my whole life. There's probably a lot of anger in me. Like too much, with no outlet, most likely from suppressing it. Not saying shit when I should, or taking shit and beatings, verbal or otherwise, when I shouldn't. So what really would have been the right thing to do? Repeat the same pattern my whole life, or break out of it? I lose either way, but I think I gain a bit more personal growth this way, because some things just have to be done, defeated, and taken care of, and if all those things are gone, I would be happy. So I guess anger is not something to be ashamed of, but dealt with emotionally, and used. Who gives a shit what people say or think.
2	It's funny that you ask that now, because last week my therapist told me I had a problem not expressing my anger. So my "assignment" is to write in a notebook situations that made me angry.\n\nI had just told her about how my mother was surprised that my sister is afraid of looking fat. For me, it's not surprising because I was fat-shamed while growing up by my mother and her mother. So even if my sister is thin, she's obsessed about her weight and looks. Anyway, that's not the point here, but I was literally shivering while telling this to my therapist. Contained rage.\n\nI hate conflict and I think that's why I repress my anger. I also hate seeing other people get angry, it scares me sometimes.
2	What embarrasses me the most about displaying anger is that it demonstrates that I‚Äôm not in control. 
2	When I'm truly angry I am a force of nature. I can do incredible damage to my relationships in a matter of seconds. Ugh.
2	Yes... I was a rather aggressive child, but strangely enough nowadays, I've been told i'm passive. Sometimes when I get angry, I go overboard, so I often put myself into a worse situation by letting it out. For some reason, I cry while i'm angry, so it's weird. As I am now, I honestly don't know if i'm suppressing my anger. I get irritated a lot, but I barely go into a rage. I don't think letting it out benefits me, so I don't really let it out. I just don't think that nearly anything that happens to me is worth getting angry over.\n\nMaybe, I might have a different definition of anger then most people since I always have equated anger similarly to revenge. Don't you need something that causes anger? From what I know, Angry people tend to seek someplace to release it. Often, if it is released upon people, it's more like revenge. It is often caused by something. Sure, some people let it out onto any bystander, but for other angry people, some of the anger is directed specifically back to the source of the problem.\n\nIf it is at an object or task? It is nearly the same, but its even more pointless. After a while, I realized being angry at the door for being closed when I want to go through it doesn't help me at all, so that type of anger I don't need to express it. It may irritate me, but I don't think i'll blow up over it unless I am very unstable. I used to want revenge due to certain actions from people, but I realized what's the point? I'll destroy myself in the process. Do I think anger is childish? If my idea of it pertains to your question, kinda. There is no benefit. I think all emotions are fine, but I consider directing my emotions at others with hostile intent childish.
2	Growing up I would try to suppress my anger since it wasn't "good" and "good" people had hearts too big to feel anger in the first place. \n\nI developed strategies for dealing with it as I got olde. Denial->turned inwards-> minimizing own feelings -> avoidance\n\nI'd have the occasional blow-up, and feel like I failed myself afterwards. I still struggle to express it, honestly speaking. I no longer deny it to myself, turn it on myself, nor disregard myself. Instead I head out for a walk to disarm it by looking at things from different perspectives, taking a hike, exercising, that sorta thing. \n\nExpressing it in the moment still feels wrong. I don't trust that I won't do or say something that may end up changing things for the worse, permanently.\n\nI'm probably a 9 on the enneagram
2	If other people are guilty for current or past anger, I usually try to console them, saying that it's a normal emotion that everyone experiences from time to time. As long as you express it in a healthy way, I'll tell them, it's nothing to be ashamed about. \n\nHowever, that same logic seems unable to be applied to myself. I hate the feeling of being angry, as most people do. But I think for us, bc we're so concerned with not hurting others emotionally, we not only dislike the emotion of anger, but we view it as "wrong" in some way. \n\nSo long answer to a short question üòÇ But yes, I supress my anger & try to cool down on my own without help or someone to talk to bc I'm ashamed.
2	I grew up with much anger, but I'm glad I sort of grew out of it. I am forever grateful.
2	Suppress your anger and it will only get stronger. Embrace your anger but don't allow it to rule over you. 
2	Awesome. It takes a lot of courage to trust again after abusive childhood experiences, congratulations on being a brave soul:):)
2	Idk, as I grew up, I actually became way more sensitive to people around me and how I affect things in the world. As a person I try to be the kindest person possible and only exist to help others. Currently anger issues come from 1. Being mad at myself for something. 2. I still have serious arguments with my mom sometimes. And 3. When I get actually angry (not just time to time arguments) I literally go off, not physically, but everything I never say about someone or all the horrible things I suppress about the 'target' of my anger. I just say it all, their past, their humanity, their flaws, criticizing them for what they are or might not be, all within a minute or 2 until I take a few deep breaths or they retaliate and it goes back and forth for awhile. It has only happened 2 times last year and both times I've written extensive mssges/apology letter to them formally because it made me feel so bad. I was also dealing with cutting during that time to deal with it. (not anymore). But yeah, as for anger issues, I try to think extremely hard about how the things I can say about others will affect them, because more than most times, it just makes them cry instead of get mad. Or you can look at the situation and say, did that really matter, what's it going to matter in like a week or month from now. I'm not ashamed of my anger to answer the question, but I am ashamed when I don't control it properly. Everyone gets angry sometimes,nothing to be ashamed of there. 
1	I just know how uncomfortable it is for me/other around when someone gets angry/upset so I do my best to not bother others
1	I grew up with a family who used my emotions against me and often teased me, so I learnt by about 15 that the easiest thing to do was just not be angry, don't feed the trolls....\n\nNow around, I do get angry, but I allow myself to do so, I just get scared of who I will hurt if I do get angry, I found myself not to hold back on the rude, cruel or (very often) harmful comments/insults if I am angry...\n\nSo I just avoid it. Not ashamed, but I avoid it 
1	...yeah ok so growing up it was always "oh you're angry about this? Well get a thicker skin kid" \n\nand \n\nnow I'm one of the ppl who kind of bottles it until it becomes a problem rip 
1	I‚Äôm finishing out high school in the next few months and my anger is sometimes insane and so confusing. I frustrate myself with my own anger and it‚Äôs a chain reaction. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the fighting and trauma in my household from my childhood up to recently but the more I try to accept and let it pass the easier it is. Usually fighting my anger only leads to me getting more upset that I can‚Äôt just make it go away
3	As an Infp myself, I have a crush on another infp (at least I think she is), but am hesitant	Because I know how incredibly difficult it can be to date me, and I'm not sure I can handle that in another person.... I like her a lot, but, idk, I guess I'm just afraid.  She isn't really the type I'd typically be attracted to, but we share a lot of interests and I think I may actually have a shot with her.  \n\n\nShe seems smart and funny and *not* self absorbed, which is damn hard to find in women these days... But if I get turned down, it'll be really awkward having to go to class with her for the next three months.\n\n\nI'm afraid that it'd be boring.  Domestic.  Because I am.  I feel like I need someone to get me out of my shell... And... If we dated it'd just be too people unable to come out their shells.  Lol.  It could be very awkward.  Two Squirtles bumping together and saying, muffled from inside their shells, 'no no I do like you, you'll just have to take my word for it!' \n\n\nIdk what I should do.  
3	I started dating an INFP two and one-half years ago. We were married last August and my life is more exciting than it ever has been. Keeping a relationship fun and alive is work from both parties no matter your MBTI type. If you feel the connection, go for it! 
23	Cant really be the only one who loves being like this.... right?	I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while and posting here and there, and I've noticed that alot of us are juss not happy with ourselves and our nature. \n\nI dont relate at all (atleast not anymore) and even thou I'm not 100% there with loving myself and i never will be because it's a journey not a destination, I reeeaaally appreciate the type of personality I have.\n\nWhat would life be without my nights alone, playing guitar in my room, or throwing up all my emotions onto a blank canvas and realizing how easy it is to create beauty, when I'm supposed to be sleeping , or the beautiful sunny days where before I go wherever for the day I take several minutes to lie on the grass taking in the beauty of nature & life all around me :) which reminds me, what is my life without my deep sensitivity to "small or trivial" things like rain, art, books, sunsets, sunrises, stars, the moon, trees etc. these things that apparently make me weird but most importantly make me sooo happy üåà\n\nI also love my emotional lows that leave me crying all the time, the loneliness, because I know that life is not without suffering... there's always a dark side right next to the bright side , it's all one little package where u choose what to focus on.\n\nmy sensitivity is my superpower not my weakness, no matter what society tells me :') because we are the people that create beautiful art for everyone else to stare at and say "WOW" to.\n\nso again I ask.. I cant be the only one who loves being like this....right?
4	When I am in nature I feel a lot like you. I feel happy. It has been a hard winter though. Bitter cold, freezing rain, winter squall. I need to go for a walk and recharge but it is just so dreadful outside. I know in the summer it will get better though. I just hate being cooped up like this. I need my green grass, trees with actual leaves, and butterflies.
3	Of course not. 
3	Everything you explain is exactly just how i feel!
2	I totally agree with you. I don't always love myself the way I should, but I do love BEING myself. 
2	I loved reading that. INFPs are beautiful and pure to say the least <3
2	:) 
7	I feel all the powers of the universe whirling within me	Yes.
8	You should run to the bathroom.
2	I feel this a lot... definitely one of my favorite sensations
8	My INFP experience dating an INTJ	Hi there, I'm an INFP who recently dated an INTJ, which didn't really end very well.  I'm not entirely sure the point of this; I suppose I want to share my experience, ask for opinions as to where she or I went wrong, if this would be typical in other's experience with INTJs, whether the relationship is truly over, and maybe even get some closure from my fellow INFPs.  This is quite long FYI, but I appreciate anyone looking at this.  I also apologize if this doesn't follow some kind of particular guideline.\n\nWe were dating each other for about 8 months.  Things were great at first.  I've never dated another introvert before and I was thrilled that I had someone that I could do introvert things with, such as low key activities and us even doing our own thing while with each other.  I also appreciated her more rational views on situations and her overall orderliness, and I felt that we complimented each other very well.  Also she was very sexual, which I'm sorry, was pretty awesome.\n\nAs time went on I noticed a tendency for certain things to bother her.  What things?  Well its hard to say because she had a reluctance to bring it up or want to talk about whatever it was that was bothering her.  I would have to pry an insane amount to get any information, and even then there was times when she wouldn't give anything up.  In fact there was the expectation that I should know her enough to know without asking.  I pride myself with the typical INFP quality of putting myself in other people's shoes and understanding another's point of view, but I felt like she expected me to be psychic.  So there she'd be standoffish at times because she was upset about something, then me becoming frustrated that she wouldn't give me enough information to try to maintain harmony, which would make me standoffish, in which sometimes it would escalate into a silent prolonged conflict.  I've always tried promoting an open attitude, encouraged her to talk about problems, and mentioned multiple times that communication is key for any relationship.  I remember one time she mentioned that she felt like we didn't know each other that well enough, and that was affecting her communication, which too be honest I didn't know how to deal with.  We've talked about very intimate and deep details of our selves, and after she voiced her concern I've tried to spend energy to initiate more deep connections.  Maybe it wasn't enough for her?  I've never had someone say that before to me.\n\nThere also seemed to be the expectation that I be available at all times for her, which to me was a little peculiar.  One time I mentioned that I like to turn off my cell notifications off at night, which distressed her, and she asked 'well what if I need you?'.  This apparent dependency actually lead to our first major fight.  She apparently was being stalked one day buy some creepy guy she ran into a couple times, as in he was following her in his vehicle.  She phoned me a few times but I was outside shovelling snow.  When I got inside I heard a text notification go off about her being stalked.  I was concerned and I tried to phone her.  She hung up and said that she didn't want to talk to me, and said that she couldn't depend upon me.  She ended up going to her friends place to hide out from this guy because she couldn't get a hold of me.  But she was only 10 minutes away from my house, and she was suppose to come over anyways.  When asked why she didn't come over she said that she was afraid that I wasn't home.  She didn't think of phoning the police.  I understand that being stalked would be a terrifying experience for a women, and I could forgive her anger, but ultimately I feel that it was misplaced, and she never did apologize for any of it.\n\nHer not apologizing was a recurring theme in the relationship.  I got the sense that she blamed everything on me.  Maybe she didn't, but she never acknowledged once that something she said or did wasn't appropriate or wrong, and never once apologized about anything.  She seemed to be always the one that was right and everything that she thought was the way it actually was.  Meanwhile I like to think that everything that happens is an interaction between all personalities involved, and the specific situation.  Not to mention that theres a certain degree of confirmation bias on both of our sides, but at least I'm open to being/doing something wrong.\n\nAfter she said that she didn't want to talk, I tried to empathize with her, told her that I felt bad for her.  She didn't get back to me.  She was clearly mad at me, so I decided to give her some space, which I know that I need sometimes.  I waited a day and a half, and I was going to contact her on the following Sunday to she .  In the morning my friend texts me a screenshot of her profile on Tinder.  I was obviously like, 'WTF', and, I phoned her and tried to keep calm, but I eventually started raising my voice in which she immediately hung up and ignored my calls.  She thought it was appropriate behavior for her to go on Tinder without saying anything to me, and inappropriate for me to get disturbed by it.  The rest of the day was the situation escalating over text message into a full blown fight.  I probably should've phoned her sooner.\n\nThe rest of the next two days was walking a fine line of keeping cool (admittedly I didn't with the prior phone call but I think I handled the communication afterwards very well, at least in this regard), trying to maintain harmony, and not being taken advantage of for that.  The things she said though we're vicious and spiteful.  It wasn't necessarily name calling, although there was a little bit of that in there, but it was mostly her remembering and pointing out every single way that I've wronged her, or have done something incorrectly, or about some imperfect aspect of my life.  It was very thorough actually, and she put her orderliness to good use.  It was the opposite of constructive criticism; criticism meant to spite and put me down. She clearly was insanely upset, and it seemed that me not taking full responsibility for everything was making her even more upset.  I didn't attack her whatsoever, didn't call her names or anything like that, totally in contrast of what she was saying.  Things eventually died off and there was a stalemate for the night.\n\nAfter the first night she phoned me, surprisingly, to see how I was doing.  Her voice was shaken, and I can tell that she was still distressed.  I tried with the upmost diplomacy to keep the situation calm and everything blame neutral.  Due to the things that she said the day before I told her that if she wanted to talk that she'd have to apologize first.  She did, and so we started talking. It was very peculiar that whenever I spoke she'd interrupt me, try to finish my sentences, but totally twist what I was saying to something negative.  Always negative.  "I want you to be happy" turned into, "so you're saying that I can never be angry".  But I meant that I want for us to work together to get to a place where we can be happy.  Everything was misunderstood and twisted.  It was getting frustrating communicating with her, and I was trying to keep my cool.  I felt that it started to escalate a bit, and I politely started saying that 'Im sorry, I can't talk anymore right now', and before I finished she instantly hung up.\n\nI sat at the couch to reflect upon what had happened and to try to relax, and I started hearing multiple text messages.  She sent several full length text messages of the exact same kind of things she just apologized for.  After I read it I told her that this is straight up harassment and that I was going to block her number for the time being, because despite how angry she could be, it was unacceptable to relentlessly attack someone like that.  Whats particularly interesting is that SHES the one that said that I was the one saying hateful things.  'She'll never forget the things that I said about her', which to me is somewhat delusional, considering how diplomatic I was trying to be and how hateful she was being.  Maybe it was a way for her to rationalize or even forgive herself for what she said?\n\nI was worried about her.  I thought about her condition all day the next day, especially because she just started a new lucrative job.  I ended up phoning her that evening to see how she was.  She was much more calm when I talked to her, but as I talked to her it was still apparent that everything was still my fault.  Because I was the older one I should've known better, and I shouldn't have said this and that, etc.  And I was open to it.  I'm sure some things I could've handled better.  But when I suggested that we both had a part in what happened, she couldn't accept it.  The blame was solely on me.  I told her that I'd like for us to work through it, but she said things like that she couldn't live with herself if she did, along with other generally negative things about the relationship.  As sad as I was I accepted it and said goodbye.\n\nWhen I got home I realized that some of her stuff was there, and I wanting to get all of this wrapped up ASAP, I texted her and asked her if I could mail it to her.  She asked me to drop it off to her.  I told her that its best we didn't see each other and just moved on, and that I'd drop it off in her apartment entrance and grab it after I leave.  I scheduled a time a couple days later and she agreed.  30 minutes later she phoned to confirm, we then started talking calmly about this and that.  About how we felt, and our opinions, and it was kept fairly neutral and constructive.  I was actually so happy that we were able to be constructive in solving our problems.  This is EXACTLY what I wanted for the last few days.  It got to the point where we were talking even affectionately to each other, and we reconciled.  She told me that when I phoned her earlier I wasn't trying hard enough.  When I spent 30 or so minutes saying that I want to reconcile and work things out with her, a few different ways, i apparently wasn't trying hard enough?\n\nThings were ok for a couple weeks, but then more of the same happened.  We had a pleasant night, but something was bothering her, she wouldn't tell me, and I let it go.  The next day she left stand offish because I was hanging with my nieces, meanwhile I'm getting frustrated because she's keeping things to herself.  Didn't really talk the next couple days, and I got paranoid about this familiar pattern.  She asked to come by, and when she got there she was noticeably still stand offish, and so was I.  I was already frustrated about that, and something that was happening in my life that was unrelated (car issues), which escalated to her threatening to grab her stuff to leave, me telling her to go ahead and that I wasn't in the mood, and her leaving with neither of us saying goodbye.  I'll be honest, I went on Tinder that day to see if her account was active again, in which a previous match messaged me, and she saw, which escalated things.  I probably should've been more trusting, but I wanted to see where she was, and that was one way, considering she doesn't want to talk about things.  So she ended up blocking my number without us even discussing that, which was partly my fault because I didn't say goodbye when she offered.  I had the opportunity there, and it was my lack of my communication that was detrimental, to an extent.  The same thing might've happened anyways, and to be honest, I have the right to be upset as much as her.\n\nSo thats more or less where we are.  I tried to facebook her saying the motivation about tinder (and she blocked me) the next day, and then the day after that I emailed her telling her that message was a previous match before I knew her, that it wasn't me doing anything behind her back, and to essentially say goodbye, because I didn't when she left.  I wanted things to be 'complete', at least my part, if it was going to end.  Thats all I'm going to do, and I'm willing to let it go (again), but I can't help but think this is her being temporarily angry again, and that I'm just not trying hard enough again.  But that can't be the case, and I'm not going to contact her again.\n\nI know that she loved me.  I saw it in the way she adoringly gazed into my eyes at times.  She's even tried to get me to say it. I didn't though.  I told her multiple times that I want to take it slow, due to getting out of a long term relationship several months before her.  I told her after our first fight that I was falling in love with her.  I didn't want to say it afterwards, because things were so rocky, and I was starting to question it.  Maybe she wanted me to and was expecting it though at that point?  Maybe thats what contributed to the continued fighting.\n\nShe said that she never acted like this with previous boyfriends, which to be honest, is hard to believe.  She acted that way because she had a capacity to act that way.  it'd be part of her personality.  Again I'm not saying that I'm blameless, but I tend to get along with everyone, and am pretty damn agreeable.  Its hard to believe that I can cause such behavior.  Is this some kind of conflict between the INFP's agreeableness and the INTJs apparent trouble with communication (or so I've read and recently experienced)?  A conflict between the INFP's feeling decision making compared to the INTJs logical decision making?  She certainly did some unrational things (trying to objectively look at it along with opinons from others).  Or is it more because of gender differences?  Our biggest fight was during her period (I don't like saying this but I'm trying to consider all points).  Or even cultural differences?  She's Chinese, and I know that their culture can be traditional, even though she wasn't quite the traditional Chinese woman.  Maybe I wasn't being assertive enough.  Maybe I should've been more argumentative and confrontational?  For some reason it was ok for her to get into a mood and do/say whatever she wants, but when I do it, its not ok.  Does she have an emotional issue?  Her response seemed unproportionate.  She also left herself logged into her email account and I saw an email begging to talk to her ex-boyfriend (who lives with his GF) and that she might have to call the crisis hotline (yes I should've respected her privacy but I feel like I needed some closure.  I don't know.... the whole thing seemed to spiral out of control, so fast.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, its probably for the best, because there seems to be a fundamental difference between our expectations and how we both resolve conflict.  Its so sad because 95% of the time there is apparent total contentment.  Its also disappointing, again, because the result is an interaction of both of our behaviors, and not just mine, and she didn't seem to recognize that.  To blame everything exclusively on one person seems extreme, and quite frankly, seems immature (she is about 9 years younger).  I can't help but feel like I've been treated unfairly.\n\nCan I get some feedback?  Totally open to criticism, as long as it isn't the same kind that she used haha.  I'd like for this to also be a learning experience, and hopefully some third party INFPs can comment.  Was there part of my INFP that didn't handle things ideally?

2	She sounds like a depressed INFP. I acted similar in my most recent relationship with an INTJ/P which also lasted around 8 months. His coldness was bringing out the worst in me. He completely skipped the getting to know each other part and went straight for an established relationship. He wanted all the love and affection without having to give the same in return. A relationship without a deep emotional connection and intimacy just doesn‚Äôt do it for me.  And as much as I adored him, I had to end it to keep my sanity.
2	Doesn‚Äôt look like she‚Äôs an intj. If something bothers me, you can be sure I‚Äôll bring it up in the next 10s, diplomatically of course. 
2	I don't know, I've dated an INTJ girl that is similar. And yours doesn't seem like an INFP.
1	This sounds eerily like a girl I just dated. Big red flags in your OP: never acknowledging any responsibility for contributing to fights; it was always *my* fault. I'm usually the one to "take one for the team" in a relationship, but when I suggested we moved on from arguments ("all is forgiven, no one is to blame"), she would talk in circles, lining me up for another attack. Like your experience, she didn't really do name-calling, but she could be really vicious in her messages. \n\nCommunication was also an issue, which in hindsight I'm surprised at, because she's one of the most intelligent people I've met, and very articulate. But like with your girl I felt like I was being set up for hidden "tests", where she already had an expectation of how she wanted me to react, but wouldn't communicate that.\n\nAs well: the love-bombing and then sudden silence. She was always very affectionate, told me she loved me, then at the drop of a hat blocked me on social media. I caved and broke no-contact to message her and she's threatened a couple of times to block my phone number, only to inexplicably message me the next day. She was the one who wanted to end things, and yet, tentatively trying to discuss it with her, it's again all my fault.
1	Might be dealing with an 'unhealthy' INTJ.  There was certainly a fair amount of 'I'm right and you're wrong', lack of listening, overly critical, arrogance, coldness:\n\n"Unhealthy INTJs tend to play ego-defensive survival games when their independence is threatened or their competence is called into question. During this phase they often shut out their emotions, using logical rationalizations to avoid situations that make them feel uncomfortable or inept. They become extremely task-focused and perfectionistic, feeling that their way is the only way to do something. Their listening skills deteriorate and they become impatient and critical with others. At times they may feel like misfits and that nobody understands them and that everyone else is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or ineffective."\n\n"The healthy INTJ lacks empathy. As a result, these INTJs often use their ability to use information harshly, their fear of relationship makes them act arrogant, and the other less flattering sides of an INTJ will be found on display. "
9	Why are most infps creative/artistic	and I‚Äôm not? :(
7	Maybe you havent found your outlet. Experiment.\n\nTry pottery, try glass blowing, try printmaking, keep trying stuff until you find your niche. For me I used to make Youtube videos. That was my creative field. As of now I am not very creative. But that's okay. I would rather spend my time doing other things.
7	*starts drawing/writing* \n\nMan, fuck, this is a waste of time, I gotta be more practical and make moves in life\n\n*proceeds to watch netflix for 4 hours*
3	Only you can answer that but all I can say is that if it‚Äôs bothering you, it‚Äôs because you have an itch. Otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt give a damn.\n\nSomething is holding you back from even trying to scratch that itch.\n\nBare in mind that not every INFP is destined to be GRRM or Kurt Cobain but those of us who do struggle to create have matured enough to accept it and stopped listening to the petrifying self judging voice.\n\nI do hope you‚Äôll get out of this place in which you beat yourself to a pulp and then feel sorry for yourself for being so bitten and downtrodden. I‚Äôve been there and still fall to this dynamic too often so don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm speaking from a patronizing place.\n\nGood luck!\n\n
4	Cuz you're the kind that wants to listen to music 24/7 in their room instead of developing a skill. Or is that just me?
2	I feel this and can definitely relate but I think its mainly because my idea of what creativity means is quite limited. When I think of artists I think of drawing, painting, sketching, making music, etc. but theres just so much more to it. I second the other comment that brought up the point of finding your own outlet.  
2	like chess or other strategy games, mastery (to the point where intuition creates the entire work) requires much time and dedication, and it is this dedication that has gotten me such a strong understanding of (guess what: ) bach fugues.
2	I think it is because the need for communication with the outside world is less extensive for an INFP than it would be for someone that needs an essential daily dose of social life to continue living, as it is for most extroverts.\n\nThe creativity in which words are assembled to form vocal ready sentences, has little meaning in the eyes of an INFP - simply because it's less relied upon to base an existence with - and that this creativity is used by other parts of the brain through the means of perception, fine motor skills, imagination and projection. \n\nAs a result, INFPs are more visually creative.\n\nEdit- didn't read the interior text, my bad.\n\nGive weight to your broad sense of interests and start collecting (second hand) books. Read into the subjects that interest you the most and, if applicable, learn the skills that are tied to the subject. In those skills you'll find your creativity.\nThis is your quest, good luck. 
1	What have you tried? And do you have a desire to be creative in any way? It's alright if you don't.
14	How has dating ESTPs turned out for you guys?	I had met this ESTP guy 25M (at the time) and things went super fast for us. It was funny because he was in a LDR with his gf and i know this says a lot about me but trust me i had tried often to put a break on this. He was controlling and would often try and kiss me and i would back off saying you have a gf but somehow it wouldnt affect his guilt at all, he still seemed to try and i gave in after a while because i was attracted to him. \n\nSo apparently his gf was also cheating on him and wanted to break up, suddenly he ran after her completely ignoring me (with a few messages once in a while) i will not lie that hurt like a bitch and felt like karma, also making out was a pretty big deal to me and he wasnt being clear at all about his intentions. He would occasionally hit me up and talk about her and i was so stupid and into him i completely stayed in the friendzone instead of leaving. \n\nAnyway he would talk and basically whine about how she cheated on him when he did so much for her and i couldnt believe how one can be so not self aware so i blurted ‚Äòbut you were cheating on her too!‚Äô And then he exploded saying ‚Äòhow can I blame HIM when i was equally at fault‚Äô then i was stunned and agreed that i was at fault too but that wasnt even the point? Besides i wasnt committed to her, he was.. \n\nAnyway in a few months we were in a proper relationship and tbh it was horrible, we would fight so often but when we would meet, we would engage in sexual activities that would still feel so empty. He would want to leave as soon as he was done and make me feel so used, i know i sound crazy to even stay and i feel crazier now that i am actually typing this out and doing much better mentally.. he would be so dominating during this causing me all sorts of pain. Me saying ‚Äòno‚Äô for some thing was a sign for him to do that even more.. \nhe would also speak so much crap omg i really dont know why i stayed, it‚Äôs just horrible remembering the stuff he would say and me not picking up those red flags.. \n\n\nThen we finally broke up in 6 months, i initiated it because i had left the country and just couldnt trust him and of course all the fights, funny enough when i went away i got the peace of mind to do it.. he would still contact me and i would too once in a while just to check up on the other. \nAnyway another fight a few months later where he asked me remove some guy from my insta and i told him he had no right to say that which hurt him and yeah that was pretty much the ‚Äòits for sure over‚Äô for me moment. \n\nHis cousin brother and i would play fortnite and got close and surprise surprise this guy tells me my ex had found someone few days after our break up (my ex only admitted to the part where this girl was in love with him, she got a permanent tattoo of his name on her hand but there was nothing from his side which seems a lot like bs) . The pain was horrible because all my doubts of being used by him came out to be true. Anyway the cousin brother had started liking me and was thinking of asking me out and he told this to my ex and thats when my ex came running back for me.. \n\nAnd yup i was stupid i took him back after a few days. He had gotten slightly better and so had i in informing him what actions of his hurt me and what used to hurt me. It was long distance but we were still trying, and i think it was more because of him than me because i had repeatedly told him i dont want him when he came running to me but he kept crying and acting hysterical..\nI admit i should have been stern with my decision disregarding his paranoid behaviour but i also thought since he was apologetic and everyone deserved a second chance.. also i wasnt really moving on either.\n\nAnyway this time too he was always around his friends and basically lived with them, he wouldnt give me time and our fights had started again.. so i ended it again after a few months. I didnt want my life to be like that at all and being with him again gave me clarity about what kind of a person he is. \n\nI honestly think he was narcissistic. Reading more about ESTP, a lot of stuff he did makes sense. The whole moving on so quick , the no emotional attachment during sexual activities, the whole always being out and about, the getting bored easily, the really being horrible at listening and constantly interrupting, the giving of advice when you are sharing something without really wanting advice, the whole being insensitive about comments and expecting no one to get hurt ugh. I cannot imagine being with another ESTP for the life of me. \n\nFor what it‚Äôs worth i am sure he was as unhealthy as can be in the form of ESTP and so was I as an INFP especially when we first started. \n\nTl;dr: So yeah i am sorry i went so long about this, but i would just basically like to know if anyone has success stories regarding INFP and ESTP?  \n\n
7	In my book, most ESTPs are psychopaths or close to being one. I make sure to stay far away from them. 
7	I think It gets horrible when estp loses interest in you. They are the sweetest and treat you like you‚Äôre the best person in the world when they are still interested but when they lose interests all of that is gone and you‚Äôre left with absolutely nothing. There is no in between.
4	ESFJ here. I‚Äôm married to a wonderful and supportive ESTP. I would never have dated most ESTPs, but there are gems out there.
4	They're sort of okayish for me, fun to hang around, but can't ever imagine getting any close to them, not even seriously being friends as the ones I met all were superficial (although I imagine not all are?)
3	Not an INFP but am I the only one who wants to murder ESTPs
3	I tried to be friends with one. Lol he's crazy. 
2	I had a post about this, check my post history. Long story short I had a two year relationship with an ESTP dude and it was really toxic, a lot of things you mentioned. The narcissism was huge. Also the fact that he chased novelty so much I never felt stable, even after years.
4	Way to go everyone here. You're judging an entire type based on one person's experience. This was totally an unhealthy ESTP and/or person. Also how about considering that victims tend to exaggerate their abusers crime. Notice how her only flaws in the story were "returning to him".\n\nIdk what happened but I empathize with her experience and I'm sorry she went through that. \n\nHOWEVER. You jackasses should think for yourself before you start over generalizing and hating an entire goddamn group of people. \n\nChildren....

1	being an ESTP, this thread makes me sad\n\nI love INFPs they're so adorable and sweet 
2	types of careers for INFPS	I am in a position where I have to chose between a job that I am passionate about but causes a ton of stress, for an easier but also less meaningful job. I have read that INFP's tend to not do well in positions that they don't care about, and need their work to be fulfilling. This concept is what has kept me in my current job for so long, but unfortunately I don't feel like I'm succeeding, despite my passion for it, and I am constantly sad while there because of how much I'm struggling. I have another career path in mind, but it takes some time to get into. I am considering taking a food service type position, but by doing so it sort of feels like I'm quitting and I have a strange sense of guilt.  It seems like a lot of my INFP traits are "flaws" in the work environment, and I would like to find a job where these can become strengths instead of weaknesses. Would love any insight from you all. What types of jobs worked for you, what type didn't, ect. 
1	I was in the food service industry when I was younger and hated it. I was too awkward to be a server. \n\nI‚Äôve been a hairstylist for 9 years now and love it! I can be creative while only having to focus on one person at a time. People say you attract your clientele and I think its true. Most of my clients are quiet and sweet and dont feel the need to talk throughout their entire service which is perfect for me. I‚Äôm also my own boss and make my own schedule, it‚Äôs the best!
1	If me. I will take character game designer. Since I like to playing a game,passionate with game. Why not am I to create some game and characters?

2	Do I need an INFP in my life or an INTP?	Pros and cons to both?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am ENFJ.
3	Sorry to sound brash, but given you are on reddit asking this in an infp forum id say you definitley need INTP.
3	Supposedly ENFJ is one of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù matches. \n\nPersonally I have not known one. I am friends with a few INFJs and INTPs though. \n\nBasically my experience is N‚Äôs are always pretty decent around each other in one form or another. 
1	Gurl/boi/dood, you don't need no one but yourself.  Love yourself, reclaim your worth as the beautiful, complete soul you already  are and always will be. Live your life and those that celebrate your joys and companion you in your sorrows will find you.\n\n(Get yourself an entp)
2	More Whining. (how to deal with losing friends?)	It feels like my group of friends has been slowly cutting me off, and what they did today just broke my heart.\n\nExplaining stuff, used to live with two of them, one of them moved abroad and i came back to my hometown since i got no jobs. Whenever some big group event came up, i stayed at the house. The pepople who came in after i got away were also from our group of friends, and were chill with my crashing at their living room (we even had spare couches around so more friends could crash in)\n\nSince something like october last year, the ammount of get-togheters started diminishing, and this year i've been there only two times for birthdays.There is this big country-wide, full week party coming up, and the friend who moved abroad came in to party with us. first thing, they said i could not crash there cause the house would already be full. Some friends-of-friends with some grils who needed a place to crash at this big party would already be there.\n\nIn some ways i swallowed it since it is no longer my home, and i should have put more effort into having my own place.\n\nI can even go and stay at some family's house, but of course it is not the same thing. The thing that truly hurt me is that, when the abroad friend announced he was coming, i tried to hype them up about going to some waterfalls. Everybody was meh about it, saying we should just get drunk at the party. The friend already got here, and earlier today the abroad friend sends our im group a photo of him and other friends of ours in a car, really early. I already knew what they were up to, but only confirmed a few minutes ago when they posted stories of them on the waterfall.\n\nI feel betrayed, abandoned, and i know they don't want me around at parties cause i can get moody and shit. I've told them about the loneliness i've been dealing with, and they just they they've got me, but their actions just say the opposite.\n\nI really feel like just quitting the IM group and be on my own, but start getting anxious about wanting to get back and being rejected, or that i am just making a big drama about things. And fuck yeah i am jealous, i gave the idea, said i was dying to go on a waterfall roadtrip and they said no to it.\n\nIt already hurt a lot to not being able to go on the expensive stuff they do now that they's got good jobs (really know i can't blame them), but i feel so bad that they won't even try to keep me close.\n\nI know if i bring it up i'll be just signing my death sentence in the group\n\nHow would you guys react to it?  \n\n\n  \nedit ---- fuck i am not even a teenager anymore to be suffering about things like this, but i so failed at social stuff that these are my only friends left
1	I don't really have any solid advice, but just know that I truly feel for you.\n\nNot exactly the same, but I have a friend that seems to be pulling away from me more and more, especially to hang out with other people (whom she herself admits she is not close to). It makes me jealous, angry, depressed... And at the same time I know she could really care less and is probably feeling next to nothing for me. That might be the part that hurts the most. She is not hurting over this. She probably doesn't think about it with even close to the weight that I do. ...*If* she thinks about it.\n\nLike you alluded to with your friends, I think she finds me moody and tiring, but I just care about our relationship and really want/ed to work things out. Unfortunately she is not good at expressing herself, so it's difficult to understand what she wants or is feeling at any given time.\n\nUsually my advice would be to talk things out, maybe not to the entire group (that could be awkward for them), but to at least one person, and tell them how you feel. Not aggressively or accusingly, but just to get things out in the open and share that you've been hurt.\n\n...However, I did this with my friend and I wonder if I made things worse. I opened up to her and made myself very vulnerable, and I feel like she is now just using all of that as more reason to avoid me (in her mind). I still think it was the option that made the most sense at the time, but looking back I feel incredibly stupid for trying. And yet, although I know it's probably a bad idea, I have the strongest urge to try again.\n\nSorry that I don't have much words of encouragement, but your experience really resonated with my own situation and feelings. That sucks that your friends are treating you this way. Know that I'm wishing the best for you, and that I'm available if you want to talk more about this.
464	How I‚Äôve been feeling lately.	
30	the first actually relatable thing on this board, thank you.
22	I've actually drawn almost the same image like 2 years ago, only I drew another image beside it of white hands breaking thru the shadow to reach me. At the time it was my own determination and realizing that I'm not truly alone, that helped me get out of that slump. Life will always give us challenges, you'll find your way.
13	Literally me rn. Had a breakdown yesterday üòï
12	I wish I could just hug y'all, offer you some tea and brownies (gluten/lactose free and vegan if needed). Anyway I'm with you guys
5	That's been me a lot of the time the last week or so.  Sometimes the sun shines through, but most time, not so much :(\n\nThat aside, nice job with the drawing.  Something so simple expresses a ton.
3	Same. That was me this morning. 
3	Reminds me of [Truth](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fma/images/e/e8/Truth.png/revision/latest?cb=20141129164933) from Full Metal Alchemist.
3	my girlfriend broke up with me thursday and i‚Äôve broken down weeping and had panic attacks multiple times everyday since then. I really feel the exact same way as this picture looks.
3	I don't feel any better but I am here for you all, if you want to talk about anything or you need a friend please send me a dm\n\nhugs üñ§
3	I relate to this 
3	I love you, you beautiful human. I love you all. \n\nA beautiful drawing to express so much. I‚Äôve felt like that, and I‚Äôm sure I feel there again. It will continue to ebb and flow. \n\nFor now, I will sit with you in the darkness, and offer you a hug.
2	Reminds me of the artwork for the AJJ album Can't Maintain.
2	Did you draw this?
2	Been feeling like this too! Smart drawing!
2	I‚Äôve lately been really bothered by the fact that everyone I love will die. I don‚Äôt like how short life is. It‚Äôs upsetting. 
2	funny.... I made two sculptures in high school ...only two...and they were both in this position XD nice
2	Looks like we all really relate to the idea of a lonrly astronaut. I have been feeling like I would belong so much more in a spaceship all alone exploring the universe by myself than being in society and with people for so long...\n\nGreat artwork! Probably gonna SS it and use it as a wallpaper sometime soon. Always loved spacey stuff and this definitely fits
2	Listening to What He Wrote and literally sitting like this.\n: /
2	Overwhelmed
2	Someone saw my writing the other day and was able to pull out how lonely I was just based on my lingo. Crazy
2	It looks as though you are a being made in the stars. Surrounded by pointless chatter that fills the void as you wait. You wait to sense  something no one is resonating for aside of the few distant stars that know how to brighten the void. what you soul wishes to sense and resonate and give to the world is no different then the light that surrounds you no matter how dim and scarce those lights stars feel. you feel as though most of the world resonates as pointless empty chatter and space. It resonates a feeling of loneliness, and of hope. For you have placed yourself amongst the stars and shall soon resonate and learn to say that which the stars say. You are not alone, not anyone of you, we are just distant. This is changing though people are looking up and resonating more and more and soon the Void will be filled with thousands of thousands of stars all resonating with one another. Soon you will begin to find that which guides you to resonate with the the other stars. with time as you see others so to will they see you. as you feel others so too will they feel you. This world has drowned its self with a toxic level of words and not enough feelings and most of you are feeling this. The Mayans made a production that the world would ‚Äúend‚Äù on some day May 2012. Most have mistaken what they meant. A world is what is made from that which is. The world was made of thoughts and words that can never express or resonate to our souls for it is not the words that connected us but the meanings and feelings that we had learned to associate with them. The world that which was made has already shifted and thus has ended just as the Mayans had said it would. They did not predict this with complaex worded science for they did not have the technology. but instead having learned too resonate with the stars the world and all things that flow As one. We are moving back to this capacity but more as one. for we have grown from the sciences and technology. We are privileged by that which is also causing the toxic pointlessness for it is giveing the opportunity for more of us to be connected in ways never available before. Too much of one thing really is indeed a bad thing but soon we will all be able to know and understand this. But the new world is like a child it needs time to grow. If you wish to help it grow, grow yourself. love yourself. For the world needs people to love it to grow strong and powerful not hate it. You can not love the world nor know what it needs without first knowing and loving yourself. The knowledge and people you feel you need are out there you just need to look. 
1	yes, and it comes and goes. but I‚Äôm hanging in there. :-) 
7	Heres a poem. (If you guys like them)	You think you may be a passerby,\nTo which I'll never understand why.\nTime takes a toll unfair and unjust, stripping my soul of trust.\nYou're the Enlightenment in the midst of postmodern chaos;\nYou're the understanding in words never spoken. \nDelicacy in your gaze, my will left in delightful daze.\nLonging takes me by hand but fails to grasp reality.\nMarble thoughts contest with laminate inferences inside the granite facilities of my mind;  echoes to be announced. \nIndifference isn't peace,\nNeither is longing. \nIt's not coming back, ever. \nMissing is too small of a statement;\nFill the void while you can,\nWho was I kidding?
2	This is beautiful! ‚ô•Ô∏è
2	"Indifference isn't peace, Neither is longing." Ouch, right in the truth.. Thank you for sharing.
3	How do you decide if you are successful in life?	I'd like to hear fellow INFPs thoughts on this topic.  
7	When i have obtained everything i have wanted, and feeling like i actually belong in this world 
4	I don't think life is as easy as saying you failed or succeeded. I think fulfilled is better way to put it, because there are varying degrees of success and failure throughout life, and as cheesy as it sounds, you have to go through a lot failure before you start seeing something success when you strive for something that's extremely meaningful to you. Fulfilled means you experienced those seemingly endless failures before you finally achieved your goal(s), and you spent your time trying your best to get closer to your ideal state, whether you ever find it or not. It's through that effort and time that you gain experiences, memories, and growth that shape you into a better and more capable person, and that better person goes on to inspire other people to become better and so on. I guess you're only successful in life if you truly give it your best shot, because even if you end up short of your dreams, you still don't have nothing, and it's your demonstration of character that goes on to influence other people to do great things they may have not done without you. 
2	I feel I am successful in life when I am proud of who I am inside and out. I know pride is supposed to be a sin, but honestly I know how good pride can feel. So that feeling of feeling proud, to me, is a feeling of success. Maybe because I am so hard on myself to actually feel proud feels like winning.
2	You set a goal, and if you accomplish it, you succeed. There's no real idea of success, so it's what you make of it. There are people who feel happy living in a van and I would agree that those people are successful. 
1	HAha! I am still alive! Eat it suckers. 
1	If the choices over the course of the last six months have similarities with most of the thought subjects that occur in the endless train of thoughts inside my head.
118	Thought you all might appreciate	
4	Ah, yes, the INFP anthem üòÇ
2	why infps generally gravitate toward me?
2	I‚Äôve been attacked üò¨
2	I loled\n
2	LOL
2	I‚Äôm happy!  ...... why? Will I be happy for long? Why do I fluctuate so often between happiness and sadness? Hahaha legit, the image is brilliant.
37	drew this a while back while i was in a really bad place emotionally. Just felt like sharing it with y'all and see if you can relate	
4	Looks like the cover of a Radiohead album. 
3	i've been doing a lot better recently, despite some anxiety and depression here and there, but i just wanted to share this with you guys, and see what you think.
2	This looks like the drawing from bird box 
2	Dread.  I like it.
1	youre an infp, just fly, its what you do best ;)\n\nalthough i find it a bit mind warping that the air is shattered, not just the ground
13	if we infps were a song	
6	John Frusciante  quote:\n\n>*Looking back at my life, I've always been most at home with art and with creativity. From another person's perspective it might look selfish or that I'm escaping from the real world, but for me, the world of art and music is the real world and the rest is a place that I don't really understand.*\n\n*(Source:* [*https://www.vice.com/en\_ca/article/ae87we/john-frusciante-foregrow-red-hot-chili-peppers-interview*](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ae87we/john-frusciante-foregrow-red-hot-chili-peppers-interview)*)*\n\n&#x200B;
2	I really like this song, and dark necessities also
1	So it's not this?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4N3N1MlvVc4
35	Even though I‚Äôm a comic and really felt this, this applies to every profession and art form. Getting help will make you even better and I wish I could‚Äôve seen this when I was younger. A healthy, determined INFP has unlimited potential!	
121	It‚Äôs been really sunny lately and that weather fills me with determination.	
6	Undertale! That game has got some fantastic music 
5	very pretty song, I'm also glad the sun is back,

3	Truly an uplifting piece and I also love the little fox in the bg ‚ô°

2	ooh undertale! cool
2	This is gorgeous! Loved the way you framed the shot too! ‚ù§ 
2	Awesome! Loved it. I still  have to finish the game. About halfway through. 
2	undertale is such an infp game
2	A great cover from my favorite game! Great job. \n\n\nI wonder what type Toby is, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he was an INxP...
1	Sounds just like the original!! Also sans undertale
1	What phone/camera did you shoot this with? The colors have this summer tinge to it which I like.
62	He called me his muse ‚ù§	I'm an INFJ and for the past 6 months I've been romantically involved (idk how else to explain our complicated relationship) with my INFP best friend. I'm very forthright with my feelings for him, but I'm often left wondering how deep his feelings run for me because he can be kind of hot-and-cold. \n\nThe other day, while we were sitting in his workshop discussing his 1,000 in-progress projects and some new ideas I helped him come up with, he took my face into his hands and called me his muse before kissing me. It was one of the sweetest moments I've had with him and I've been thinking about it ever since. I can see how INFPs and INFJs might be a challenging combination, but I've never been so connected and drawn to a man as I am to him ‚ù§
15	Very nice, we always upvote a good INFP relationship
11	My  wife is an INFJ and this post made me smile so much. It reminded me of us. Literally this morning she listened to me cry for like 3 hours about how my job sucks and how I want to start (another) new project. I've got about a million to finish lol. She is also my greatest muse. Without her my life would devoid of any real meaning or drive to live. If something happened to us I know for a fact I would simply retire from the workforce and become a vagrant. No reason to do anything else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's an extremely difficult relationship, harder than any I've had save one. However it's been equally (even moreso) rewarding. The INFJ/INFP combo works because both understand eachother and have similar values. I am 100% codependent on my wife though, and her to me. We also can get in fights/arguments that are SO strong and sometimes not healthy. That said, we always work through them and share an equal amount of passion and joy for the good things in life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she was an ENFJ, I wouldn't be as happy as I am. Maybe I would be more active and a little less depressed but I also would feel much more anxiety and a constant desire for solitude and peace. To me, and for me, she is perfect. She is everything I need and then some. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur relationship was also very complicated at the start- and yet so rewarding. I proposed to her one random morning (the first time) naked in our bed after just 4 months of knowing her.  She said yes, but I decided to make it official later on with a ring and a proper proposal in front of our favorite Monet painting at the museum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour relationship will have lots of tension if it's like mine, but in exactly the way you BOTH need to push forward. I don't anticipate an easy rosy life ahead of me with her but I do look forward to knowing that through the best and the worst, we are together. I look forward to being able to fully enjoy the good, because we fully understand the bad, together. Everything is together- and there's literally nobody else I could ever do this with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your post. : ) 
7	Ahw, that's so adorable (:
2	muse is an intriguingly difficult concept for me to grasp for some reason.\n\ngreek gods aside, every artistical idea that has come to me came from pure intuition completely uninfluenced by emotion, but with the purpose of driving/controlling emotion. in fact, emotions often clouded my musical clarity (i wrote about 12 bars of a slow prelude for the pipe organ, and looking back on it, it doesnt make nearly as much sense as when i actually wrote it). for this reason, most of my great ideas and clear thinking come when im half asleep (at night, not during the morning, unless its like 1 am).\n\nalso, that is probably the happiest thing ive ever heard of happening in such a long time. i wish you the greatest fortune and cooperation in your new relationship
1	That‚Äôs a really sweet story, I hope you two work out. Thank you for sharing, my friend 
1	I feel that is something I'd call someone to try to be sweet and they would take it as an insult. I mean doesn't muse mean "a thing to amuse you", basically?
13	I need help. Obsessed with someone maybe	I've been talking to this guy I met online 10mo ago and I feel like it's about to end. I think I've become too clingy and he is annoyed. Here is some background. \n\nWhen we first started messaging it was amazing. We talked everyday for hours it seemed. I felt my old loneliness melt away and I became really attached to him.   I went through some health issues last summer and he really helped me thru it. Even though we hadnt met, I fell hard in love. I still experience HUGE feelings of love/attachment to him. I just want to be close to him. He makes me feel safe.\n\nAs time went on I noticed we stopped talking as much. Now it's getting longer and longer it feels. I can't tell if I'm annoying him or if he is simply losing interest. I wonder if he pities me sometimes and doesn't want to hurt my feelings. I feel hurt and sad about it.\n\nI don't send him obsessive texts. I just check in sometimes and tell him I love him. When I don't get a reply I feel like it means he is trying to send me a hint. Our conversations are growing further and further apart. Am I doing something wrong? I feel like crying. I know you're not supposed to be this attached to a person, but when that person makes you feel safe and wanted for the first time in forever, you just want to hold onto them. I'm so scared to let him go. 
6	i'm going through the same thing with my best friend. not romantically though, just as a really close friend.
2	Ok so a few questions, were you dating? Or just friends? 
2	You definitely need to pump the brakes & realize there are other people out there than just this one guy. I promise destroying yourself over one person is never, ever worth it. As a guy that behavior would be slightly off putting especially if he hasn‚Äôt professed any love back. Guard your heart and be careful. This is coming from a fellow INFP whose been down this road when I was younger, it always ends in heartbreak if you are afraid of losing someone
2	I sorry that you are going through this.\n\n\nI can imagine the obsessive think  and the hurt this situation can bring.\n\nSeems that he is not butting in the effort. He probably isn't straight forward and saying things that maybe should be told. But you are also  playing a guessing game? In all honesty if you have that gut feeling telling he is pulling away you are probably right. This just the hardest thing let it go. Let him go because there isn't a way you could make him stay.  I am so sorry that this how things have gone. You deserve the same love you give. \n\nI wish you strength and sunshine. 
1	I know letting go of people is the hardest thing for us. But, sometimes its the absolute best thing that can happen. Have you ever met this guy in person? If no has he asked you to send him anything like gift cards? I've dealt with a lot of scam artists only as of late so my trust isn't there for online relationships these days.
1	What do you guys talk about? Is it mostly about your problems? If so that is taxing for someone else. It is nice for friends to open up and talk about their problems, but not all the time. Also, it sounds like he may feel that he is not getting enough from the relationship, which is why he is stepping away. Unfortunately you were communicating in texts instead of in person. In person you can visualize body language and so there are signs that show if someone is upset or frustrated. My gut is telling me that likely you were not paying enough attention to his needs. Focus on some extraverted feeling. It is tough for us but it is necessary.

1	According to Erikson's theory of human development at a certain age we focus our life onto bettering the world in some way. It is called "Generativity vs. Stagnation," and it happens between ages 40-65. For example, it may be volunteering for habitat for humanity or it may be advocating for clean drinking water in Africa. It is doing something not for the ego, but to serve others. Maybe it serves the ego slightly though because it can make the person feel good about themselves, but that isn't the main reason. For everyone else who doesn't find this inner purpose there can be stagnation.\n\nWe as humans have a desire to create, a desire to leave an impact on the world. Erikson calls this "ego integrity vs. despair". Schaie calls it the "legacy creating stage".
1	INFP more prone to health problems? More specifically, stomach problems?	I‚Äôm an INFP with terrible anxiety and stomach issues. I have IBS, possible gallbladder problems, terrible GERD and chronic gastritis. Also had two flares or diverticulitis and I‚Äôm only 23. I don‚Äôt handle stress well, and obviously I have so many problems with my stomach it‚Äôs like a chicken and egg question. I‚Äôve had doctors tell me that I‚Äôm at fault for the pain because of anxiety, and likewise that the pain is at fault for my anxiety. There‚Äôs no way to know but the only way I‚Äôve been able to stay sane through this is having some grasp on stress. \n\nI‚Äôm wondering if INFPs just don‚Äôt handle stress well, and because of that we‚Äôre prone to getting sick? Obviously all types get sick, but I wonder if there‚Äôs a frequency among our type for stomach problems specifically. I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of creative types in movies and literature have overly romanticized health issues and I wonder if it‚Äôs rooted somewhere in real life. Sensitive people with sensitive guts? 
1	I have gerd. I have to be very careful with what I eat and I take medicine I am supposed to take daily but I probably only take 3x a week.\n\nSorry you are going through this. I was curious so I looked up stress and IBS and it says if you do stress reducing activities like deep breathing and meditation that it can reduce IBS symptoms. I thought that was kind of interesting.\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/ibs/guide/stress-anxiety-ibs
1	As for not handling stress well. I do think stress for me can be overwhelming. I am terrible at multitasking so I can feel overwhelmed at work sometimes. Also I hate feeling judged negatively by other people so that can be stressful.\n\nBut I also think I can handle stress very well too. If someone is in trouble, I don't tend to panic and I do what I can to help them. I am actually an EMT so I spend a lot of time in high stress situations.
1	Interesting you should say that, because I have crohn's disease. My immune system just seems to like attacking my guts for no apparent reason. I'm currently taking medication for it everyday (Mesalamine) to try and keep it in remission. I'll most likely have to have surgery for it at some point though, since I'm not responding too well to various different treatments (Azathioprine gave me horrible side effects). They don't really know what exactly causes it. I know that I get stressed very easily, and I've been dealing with social anxiety and depression since I was a kid. All of that could have played a factor in it getting as bad as it has gotten.
1	I'm an INFP and I while I experience mild depression and anxiety I don't have any health problems related to it. However, I have an INFP friend who experiences more depression and anxiety and has a lot of digestive issues
3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 26	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	How do you stay in shape?\n\nI am an INFP and I am naturally slim, but I am not naturally strong physically. Lately I have been focused on pushups and cycling as my main forms of exercise. What about you? What do you enjoy doing the most for exercise?
2	What is your take on wearing unusual clothing? Or having unusual hairstyle or clothes.\n\nNormally I prefer wearing rather plain looking clothes like a simple navy sweater with navy Dockers. But every once in awhile I feel the urge to wear unusual hats. Like I have a Tigger hat that is shaped like a Santa hat but is green with orange trim and has Tigger ears coming out. I may wear it out during the Xmas holidays. Or I have a Yeti hat. It is white and furry with black eyeballs and teeth.\n\nI wore the Yeti hat out in public on Saturday and it took a lot of courage for me because where I live only children wear silly hats. Adults only wear simple winter hats, maybe with a pompom at most. I was somewhat self-conscious but I just went with it. Of course I noticed stares, but I tried not to pay attention and just enjoy my day.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you feel drawn to unusual clothing? And if so or if not, I want to know why.
1	Ah, an empty classroom with the lights off. Nobody will come in until a class starts. I'm anxious about people coming in, but I will enjoy this peace until I'm not allowed to anymore.
1	Too many people today have been breaking me out of my BoltHole (the room where I like 90% of the time just zone out into my own world), just let me relax and make my own world spin
1	Any other INFPs feel really frustrated on the daily they can‚Äôt change the world into a happier, more logical, fair place? Real talk I‚Äôve removed some social media just to stop debating / arguing with randoms over social and political issues. I also tend to stay away from news platforms because some articles have made me honestly depressed.
9	lonely	anyone down to chat? i'm lonely and sad and have no one to talk to
3	I'll chat with you!
48	I wonder how many times the people I think about think about me. I wonder who is thinking about me when I am not thinking about them.	
13	One of the ways I get the warmest of fuzzy feelings is getting a random text that goes something like "just saw/heard/read this and thought of you" 
10	ENFJ here, know I don't belong but I just had to sat I think about this incredibly often! We'll never know! 
3	This happens way too much to me. 
3	Just today I wondered how often do I show up in other people's dreams and what kind of roles do I have in them. Other people frequently show in my dreams, people I'm close to and people I don't know that well. They're never the main point of the dream but they're there and I wondered if I'm ever there in other people's dreams like that.
2	I think about this a lot.
1	the second is of greater importance to me, although both often cross my mind.\n\nthere are two different kinds of thinking in my opinion (based off of my experience)\n\n\- intuitiveish thinking\n\n\- sensorish thinking\n\nfor some reason many people fall under the sensorish thinking when they think about me. its annoying, and part of the reason good friends are hard to come by (for me)
16	Career Chat from a 30F INFP: It's okay if you don't know.	*tl;dr I didn't know what I wanted to do and fell into HR and did very well, which is now allowing me to explore other career options. It's okay to feel lost, because a successful career doesn't always mean you have to stick with it for life.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi INFPs,\n\nI came here to understand more about career paths for INFPs and can relate to a lot of posts. I'm 30 and just now starting to figure out what I want to do when I grow up (haha), but after already having a successful career that has allowed me to explore my options. My current career has been successful by corporate ladder standards; unsuccessful because it still isn't my life passion and I'm going to burn out after a while as a result. If it helps any of you, here's what I've done so far:\n\nLike so many INFPs, I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up, which made high school and college difficult. I'm intelligent but was a terrible student because I just didn't care that much about traditional education. Still, I finished with whatever random degree would let me graduate (nothing useful in the real world) and randomly fell into recruiting, which was the best field I could've gotten into without much direction in what I wanted to do. \n\nI did well in recruiting because I wanted to help people find jobs (seasoned recruiters will agree this is a naive belief) but well-being wise, it was a terrible fit because it was too regimented with sales-like productivity quotas and requires a high level of energy when chatting to clients and candidates. The upside is that I was able to idealize it enough and did well, and as a result was hired by a large, well known tech company. I moved over to a programs role within human resources which has still been incredibly rewarding and better for well-being and energy, but still not creative enough to keep me satisfied.\n\nAt this point, 8 years later, I'm established enough in my career to look around, and I know my work style well enough to know that I want to pursue UX as I've always loved visuals and graphics since I was a kid, plus pondering data and analysis is fascinating to me. It's not going to be easy to make the transition, but from my first career I fully believe in two things: keep the faith and stay focused. It **will** pay off. \n\nI think as INFPs we love the idea of a lifelong passion as a career, but on the flip side, we are optimistic enough to know that going down one path is not the end all. It took me a while, but for you it may not. If I could do anything differently when I was younger, it would be to pay attention to what I spent my time doing (computers, graphics, etc) because it's exactly what I'm about embark on 8 years later. \n\nSo, what makes you happy? Is it yoga, video games, gardening, cooking? You can pursue those things :) But you've gotta give it your all. I hope this was in some way helpful for folks feeling lost - I know the feeling, but just know it all counts for something.\n\nGood luck!
4	29 and I still don't know what I want to do when I grow up.  I've been welding for 8 years, and I support myself finely, however I don't see it as a proper use of my time, so something else is in my future, what that is, is still a mystery. 
2	I'll partially disagree with the OP. It's wonderful that you've found and managed to do what you want. What happened to me in the last 2 - 4 years make me lean on the side that you should do the best possible thing that you're allowed or able to do.
46	When I close my eyes and think of old memories. Love being INFP.

7	being alone	hey guys. so classes started and now I currently don't have any friends I can be crazy with in class, but I'm pretty sure that'll change once my bonding day starts this Friday. I'm kinda excited that I can bond, hopefully I'll be able to find a group of friends to hang out with and study with.\n\nbut in the meantime, the loneliness is getting to me. I seriously hate this, my friend (who's in another year) said to be emotionless and I'm trying to do that and not care, since I'm here to complete my education and get into university.\n\nany tips? I think I should be okay with eating alone and stuff, but I'll see about it. how do I deal with being alone? please help, it's killing me in a way 
2	By learning to accept your own company, your an introvert and like every single one of us you will always have a sense of loneliness but that just means we see the difference between us and others, what we more often then not fail to gauge is that us perpetually lonely species also have a tendency to bond  and connect on all levels but that will only come to fruition if we try and not beat ourselves up in failure, most people that we would meet in our lifetime wont mean shit to us and that's a universal truth. Introverts avoid social activity which simply puts less people in our paths and the high rejection rates of who will we get comfortable with doesn't help our odds either.  \n\nOnce we do form a group we feel warm with, the loneliness still remains, that's were the being comfortable with yourself part comes in. If you are not fine on your own you will automatically shut people out making them uncomfortable instead and distancing them.\n\nTry to chill out on the making friends part cause after your classes start you may find a group to hand out with right away but you will eventually get to know everyone in your class and over the course of your time there your initial group and all such others will end up jumbled anyway.\n
2	I've been in the same kind of place when I started my university (i just dropped out a month ago lol). Litteraly nobody that I knew followed the programme I did. But after a week or so, I managed to find people to talk with. A few months later I really got to know the people in my programme and I got some guys whom I had fun with as much as crying of laughter in class :)\n Just give it some time and at least try not to shy out, it will pay off
2	Anyone else cynical?	
1	What does it mean
1	Idk if I would say cynical but definitely pessimistic 
1	Extremely pessimistic 
1	I have a tendency to be but I consider it a character flaw and I‚Äôm working on it
47	How I envision the first convo with my future wife will go as an INFP	
2	Lol. üòÇ  Same but husband. 
1	This my wife and I EVERY day. 
1	What's this guy's name? I've seen him before on this subreddit and was interested in watching him but I can't find his videos 
3	Looking at the ground	So I saw a post about infp's always looking at the ground a couple of weeks ago. I didn't really pay much attention to it or think about it until the other day it popped in my mind. My friend asked me why I'm always looking at the ground instead of what's going on around me. I have no answer, I have no clue why I do that. Do you guys do that and why? Do you also find yourself being engaged in conversations with people without actually saying words? And why so people open up to me so much when I don't even offer much verbal feedback? Usually I am listening but sometimes I am not interested and people just keep going and going, it exhausts me.
4	I used to look at the ground constantly while walking. I think it was to avoid eye contact. But sometimes I will notice a leaf or a crack or a bug that I would never have noticed if I was not looking at the ground. I once found a dead bat. Another time I found a praying mantis in a parking lot. It amazes me that other people do not notice these things. But it probably amazes them that I do not notice everything else around me like the houses and such.\n\nAlso if you are curious why we don't look around, the theory is that INFPs have low extraverted sensing. So that part of us is weaker. We can still use extraverted sensing (which is observing the outside world) but we don't really value that part because we are tied to extraverted intuition (which is looking for deeper meaning in the outside world). What is the deeper meaning of the dark storm clouds ahead? Is it an omen? What does it mean to be an ant? Do they feel remorse? I think because our brain is focused on the deeper meaning it cannot spend as much time on the visuals. And perhaps looking at the ground is a way of reducing stimuli in order to focus more attention on our thoughts. I imagine looking at faces and our natural instinct is to look for the deeper meaning of their facial expressions and demeanor, which can be draining on us. A face is not just a face. It tells an entire story. So best to look at the ground to not go crazy all the time in deciphering every little facial expression. 
3	Yes to all the questions. \n\nI look at the ground, because it is so interesting. I think it probably started when I was younger and I did it to avoid being noticed; still do it to avoid eye contact sometimes. As an adult, I just like looking down, (and up and everywhere around me) because there are interesting/beautiful things. I rarely look to where I am going and that‚Äôs probably why I fall down more than the typical person.\n\nAlso yes, people open up to me all the time. I think it is because we are good listeners and empathizers.\n\n‚ÄúThey [INFPs] are known for being excellent listeners because they engage all brain regions that process voice, words, and volume. Unlike other personality types who may work out their response while someone else is speaking, INFPs use this holistic-listening pattern as long as possible so that they can try to get to the core of who someone is and what they‚Äôre saying.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/08/10/use-brain-based-myers-briggs-personality-type/\n\n\nThese articles also mention our listening skills and other traits INFPs share:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/infpinsights.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/unique-characteristics-of-infps-ask-an-infp-3/amp/\n\nhttps://introvertdear.com/news/10-type-secrets-of-the-infp/
3	So I don't get distracted by visual stimuli while I'm thinking.
2	For me it's to avoid stepping on insects.
2	In my case, it's so I can avoid eye contact and to avoid falling (I don't walk properly).

12	Yup. Even things I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone else involved has forgotten.

10	This post holds a deeper dualistic meaning though; Aang is not only looking back on his past lives, but constantly draws power and wisdom from all of them!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, eventually, INFP or not, everyone has to realize that you do stupid shit growing up. Embrace that! Laugh at it! You're not the only one who played the fool and if you think you did, you're being too self-absorbed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiterally be Aang in this picture, use all of your past cringe not as a source of shame or embarrassment but instead wisdom and growth.

9	Struggling with Ugliness	I don‚Äôt know how to describe how much I hate being left out and neglected for being unattractive. I hear my family and people at my school discuss how unattractive they think I am all the time, and people tell me ‚Äúmaybe you‚Äôll look better when you‚Äôre older.‚Äù It baffles me that the genes someone is given can make them happier, while the rest of us are left with ourselves.
10	I am so sorry they treat you that way! That is absolutely not okay. I‚Äôm 100% sure you‚Äôre gorgeous, and you sound really sweet to not stoop to their level. Taking the high road is sometimes really hard.\n\nI know from experience it can be really hard to hate the way you look. One time I cried in the fridge at my work because I was feeling so ugly and I needed a release...üòÖ\n\nBut I‚Äôm telling you that, even though you‚Äôve probably got this tattooed on your brain by this point, looks don‚Äôt really matter. What matters could be the way you smile when you walk in a room, the way you snort when you laugh, the way you cry when you‚Äôre too happy, the way you love and be loved, and everything about you that makes you yourself!\n\nIf you ever want to talk you can message me, I‚Äôve been dealing with body issues and general insecurity for a long time but I‚Äôm steadily getting better and I‚Äôd be happy to help in any way!
3	Oh Lord! The ugly duckling story people love Soo much!!!!!!\n\nGuarantee you aren't ugly at all!\n\nI've seen picture perfect model types turn ugly as sin as soon as they open their mouths.\n\nI've seen people not considered modelesque (is that a word?) Turn into complete beauty by opening theirs.
3	Feel it too, bro.\n\nFeels sad to not be able to participate in "life's best time". All old people i know fondly remember their youths, but what will i have to remember beyond videogames?
2	Is it something in particular? A lot you can change. For example a nice haircut, some good fitting clothes with a color that compliments your skin tone. Also taking care of your skin. Making sure you use a moisturizer designed for faces. Or if you have acne or psoriasis they have certain medication for that.
1	Instead of saying oh no you‚Äôre beautiful anyways! I want to help you another way...\n\nWhat is/are the part(s) you think you‚Äôre ugly? Where are you really self conscious about? I mean, you can change certain stuff. I struggled with this a LOT (and still do lmao) and I know where you‚Äôre coming from so I can help you a lot.\nNowadays people say I‚Äôm handsome sometimes but I just don‚Äôt believe it cause it‚Äôs just melted in my brain..\n\n
18	I hope everyone is having a great day :)	Good vibes today y'all :) stay positive 
5	good day? whats that? lol \*laughs through tears\*
1	Thank you. I hope yours is pretty good too
3	My INFP boyfriend told me, ENTP, that he loves me and I've been feeling disconnected.	I need help. I'm dating this great INFP guy (30), but have always worried from the beginning about an underlying lack of compatibility that has only gotten worse lately. He is intelligent and mature but he keeps things light. He very rarely ever expresses his opinions, hardly ever his thoughts, and rarely discloses his feelings. I typically have to dig for his thoughts and feelings, and even when I dig sometimes I do not receive much.\n\nI'm pretty sure he is content to just lay around with me and "feel" without saying much of anything with real value. When I try to initiate a serious or intense conversation, involving deep thoughts, things drift back to a light mood where he is seemingly more comfortable. From where I'm sitting, he prefers light-hearted fun.\n\nThus ... I've been feeling really bored and disconnected from him. I'm losing momentum with having to pry for so much on his inner workings. I definitely don't connect just through proximity and cuddling. I connect through depth of who the person is (how their mind works, what their values are, what their thoughts are on everything) and engaging, intense conversation. I like fun, too ... but with a longterm partner I would need more. "Just fun" is reserved for friends, and not particularly close ones.\n\nI told him today that I've been thinking I'm not sure we're compatible. I kept it short and sweet and said, "I connect through intensity and you seem more frivolous or carefree. I do have a lot of fun with you though."\n\nAnd he looked bewildered then told me he's been searching for the right time to say it, but he loves me.\n\nWHAAATTT. Literally this guy seems so "whatever" all the time that I had no clue, absolutely no clue at all that he even liked me all that much. I have known him for almost a year (we were friends first, have been dating for 2 months) and sometimes he still feels like somewhat of a stranger.\n\nI would prefer things to work, but this incompatibility is not going to go away for me. I develop feelings through my head first and I'm not sure how to express this to him without saying "you need to change," because I know he's not doing anything wrong. We are just different. \n\nFrom an INFP's advice -- how do I approach this?\n\n\*\*tl;dr\*\* I told my INFP boyfriend I'm not sure we're compatible because I prefer intensity and is more carefree. And he, bewildered, told me that he loves me. I have no idea how to proceed with this issue and conversation now.
4	I had this problem with my last gf, we didn‚Äôt work out for different reasons but I can tell you that he probably cares very deeply for you. I remember thinking a lot about all the different things that I loved about her, but for some reason I seldom shared those thoughts with her. I‚Äôm sure that was a mistake. \n\nI also tend to be very hard to open up, I tell few people about my feelings because nearly every time it just gets me hurt. The closer I am to someone the bigger the risk. If he feels the same way I do then you just have to tell him straight up.\nTalking about thoughts and feelings is something that has to be done in a relationship. And if you want it to last you both have to be willing to share everything, regardless of the risk. \n\nOn the other end, you should try and look for the ways he shows you he loves you. If not always through words, then find what it is. Look at the way he smiles when he looks at you or the way he he breathes when you hug. Often, I internalize my feelings without thinking that I should share them out loud. \n\nHope this helped, and I hope you two work out :) 
3	I was somewhat in the same situation. I did a great effort to be more open and have serious conversations with my ex. However, she was not able to do the same.  She asked for deeper conversations but she was not able to share when it became deeper.  That could be for multiple of reasons in my case, (her depression and anxiety) but also that we INFPs often show affection and love through actions. If you do not notice those clues, can cause a misconception that we do not care, and you as a girlfriend do not trust us enough to open up. \n\nI think you should ask how he shows love towards you. Even though he do not need those deep conversations as often as you do. If he loves you and cares for you, he will fulfil those needs for you. You should also tell him you need deeper conversation, but at the same time show him how you would play that out. Meet him halfway? Show him the ropes, I know that it can be hard for an INFP start those conversations, but once we get going we can go on and on. I am sure that your boyfriend is a really loving and caring person. He is perfectly capable of having those conversations you are seeking.\n\nWhen you say carefree, what is carefree about? He doesn‚Äôt care about anything? If that is the case, tell him to voice his opinion more. That was a pitfall I fell into, I had a lot of opinion but I often chose not say them. If you make him tell his opinion more there will be less careless and you will definitely get more intensity.
2	IM SORRY BUT LOLLLL I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS W MY BOYFRIEND BUT HES ENTP AND IM INFP. i connect really well 1 on 1 so i want to talk about my feelings w him ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
1	Try an INFJ.\n\nI'm good for the dv lashing.
1	What do you mean by intensity?
1	It sounds like he is not meant for you. I too crave for connection. I am an INFP and I need to have deep moments with someone. I need them to be able to open up to me and share the dark side along with the light side. I also need them to be able to listen and understand me when I open up. For example, I opened up about my stepfather. It was telling my ex a story I recalled out if thr blur when my stepfather humiliated me and he felt ashamed of me for who I was. My boyfriend at the time did not say anything. He did not acknowledge my feelings at all. He asked a question about a fact, and then he made a joke. It was not what I was looking for. I wanted empathy and comfort. 
1	I know what you mean in a way, in that the ENTPs I‚Äôve known tend to be far more talkative and open than I am. I guess sometimes I get complacent and just enjoy listening to them, that I forget that they want input. Also I tend to want to think through what I say, so I‚Äôm a bit slower, and they like to interrupt a lot and clearly zone out or rapidly change the subject, so I figure they‚Äôd rather I listen than get back to them like 5 minutes later.\n\nI think if you want it to work, you should give it a good faith effort and say, ‚ÄúI care about you too, but I need more feedback/input/dialogue/ in our relationship. I don‚Äôt like to be the only one talking and I get bored of just laying around; this is a relationship need for me‚Äù and maybe you can get more feedback on how he‚Äôs perceiving the relationship expectations. Because I like to talk, but I don‚Äôt always feel like me talking is what other people want. \n\nMaybe you can phrase it as: ‚ÄúI want to know you better first‚Äù\n\nBut I mean, I also see what you mean about an underlying incompatibility from the beginning, because usually that‚Äôs just something you should use as a filter, but I mean, at the very least, he understands what could become a consistent issue he might see throughout his relationships, if his internal nature is particularly extreme. Also relationships are compromise and articulating expectations; we can‚Äôt read each other‚Äôs minds, we only just try our best.
1	Just wanted to offer a slightly flip-side experience:\n\nI'm an ENFP chick, have been dating my 30 y/o INFP dude for like... 7 weeks? He is the same: proximity and cuddles *is* his connection. He just wants to lie in bed or on the couch, wrapped around me, kissing and talking and laughing and not much else. \n\nThis is everything I've ever wanted out of a relationship.\n\nWhen we go out, it's incredible and fun and energetic, but every moment wrapped up in one another in quiet bliss is the definition of happiness to me. We are completely and utterly matched in this regard. Touch and quality time is obviously both of our love languages. \n\nI'm a true extrovert. He doesn't drain me at all. He is a true introvert. He needs his alone time, but I don't drain him. I do need to get out and be with friends and be active. He joins me. Then we spend the rest of the weekend blissfully engaged in a whole lot of nothing. This is the perfect pace for me. Literally, everything I've ever wanted.\n\nAnd he told me loved me after just 1 month of dating. And it was fucking fireworks. He meant it completely and I meant it too and I think we were meant to be together. Our love is all that matters. It's the perfect union of energies and goals. 
51	im in austria in the mountains, says enough right?	
2	I was at a similar place yesterday 
1	Impressive, you got up there. How did you manage that? Did you go alone?

1	Wooow. I had one of the best times of my life on an Austria snowboarding trip. Looks like you are havin a blast, enjoy! 
1	yesss went snowboarding in austria last weekend :D amazing weather.\n\nsweating while snowboarding\nfreezing while taking the lift tho
3	Does anyone else think Freddie Mercury could have been an INFP?	I‚Äôve seen interviews with him and he seems a lot more reserved and quiet in comparison to his stage persona. I‚Äôve also read articles about him saying that he was very closed off to others that weren‚Äôt close to him. He has a lot of mannerisms that make me think he could be an INFP and I‚Äôm just wondering if others think so as well.
3	I personally think he was an ISFP. The musicians I know that are INFP have a reserved onstage presence as well, while the all the ISFP seem to come alive whenever they perform.
3	Mercury definitely had Fi but I don‚Äôt think he was an INFP. I type him as a ExFP maybe ISFP
6	Dating as an INFP	I'm just curious, what has been your experience dating outside of your own personality type?\n\nLooking back on it, the women I've dated have always been extroverts. I've had some great times with them but I tend to get exhausted with them over time. 
13	wish I knew how to do this... dating thing... sounds pretty cool 
4	I feel like extroverted persons have made it easier in the beginning. You kind of get served with the social part and can just listen or tag along with them üòä But yeah, it gets exhausting after a while.
2	I‚Äôve been with both, but the one extrovert that stands out in memory whipped up an extreme passion and excitement in me... but long term it might have been too much. I dunno though, I was crazy about that woman. \n\nMost of mine I think have been introverts, though. In fact recently I found out another new friend of mine was also an INFP... and I started to get a huge crush on her once I realized how nice it was having someone that actually understood a majority of the thoughts and feelings I have about everything. I‚Äôve never dated another INFP before, but I‚Äôd definitely give this particular one a shot!
1	Extroverts are great !! They help he get out of my shell so much, most of my friends are extroverted. Dating other types is all about going out of your comfort zone and growing:) Also realising you can teach those extroverts how to calm down and connect with themselves. It's really beneficial for both of you if you know how to handle it.
1	The only issue for me with dating extroverts has been they don't understand the need for alone time and that we get exhausted socially easily.
3	Weird Feelings That I Don't Know How to Handle.	So, everyone I know (not infps) seem connected to their families, but also eager to have some freedom. (I'm in my 20s, so are most of my friends). I'm having great internal turmoil over this ideal, over this feeling. Because for me, I'm at a fork in the road. I have a family that I'm super connected to and love so much, I don't want to leave them and spread my wings. However, at the same time, I'm also burning up inside with this force of freedom, independence, finding myself. I feel like it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. I want to run, run so far that nobody will ever catch up to me, I want to be free and express everything that I feel. However, I grew up in a very negative home, yet I still love my family. Strong emotions and creativity were a big no. Dreams were a big no, they were immediately crushed by one of my parents who is an INTJ. Despite this, I love my family so much, even though I know they're flawed. I want to pull away, but at the same time, I'm worried that if I do, I'll lose them. I know this is kind of stupid, but I have a pretty conservative family and they strongly discourage a "free-spirit" type of attitude. I would just rather look how they want me to look on the outside (with my outward actions) as opposed to starting conflict. Tug-of-War is being played with my heart right now. I don't know where to go or how to handle this feeling. Almost everyone I know (including one of my siblings) seem to not have any ties to home. They always get freaked out when I tell them that I love my family and don't really want to leave them behind, even if only for a little while. They think I'm the type of person who would run at the first chance I got. Obviously, everyone is different, but I'm wondering if this is a problem within the INFP community. Do you feel connected to your family but also connected to wanting to go live your life and dream? 
3	I‚Äôm very close to my family as well and had the same feelings that you‚Äôre talking about but I found that distancing myself from my family made me appreciate them even more. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It can be tough at times but it‚Äôs kinda beautiful as well. In the long run I think it‚Äôs healthier to seek freedom and independence.
2	So why do you want to stay really? To do what they want you to do? Part of growing up is realising your parents are only humans and to see them as one as opposed to god you have keep on appeasing. Especially if you can't be yourself in front of them, it's not healthy to stay in such situation. You can't change who they are, but you can do something about it and take care of yourself. Always take care of yourself.
5	Whats the point??!?	Hey guys, 26/INFP(m) I wanted to reach out and see if anyone can relate or if anyone knows the feeling i'm going to attempt to describe and what the @#$%ing point of it is; This feeling has been around for a quite a few years, not sure when it came about as my memory is shit, but I only feel it when I am alone and in my head, usually in a reflective mood.(or busy listening to music) It only comes into play when I zoom out on "my life thus far" and start looking at it through the lenses of "how i feel now" , the feeling is so hard to replicate on the spot that i have to catch myself when i'm in it as writing about it has already caused it to fade, if I would compare it to other feelings, it tastes like a cocktail of some bitter sadness, mixed in with some worthlessness and dab of self pity, sprinkled with nostalgia on the rim. it makes me just want to put on some music and cry my heart out but nobody got time for that shit, I grow tired of running into the feeling from time to time and it leaves me feeling tinged with sorrow for myself and just overall dips my mood, I cant figure out how to go about identifying it and wanted to see what the fine pepople of this subreddit thought about it...\n\nTLDR: Mystry feeling has me being a sadpanda, want to identify it but at a loss of how to describe it given its a feeling.\n\nThanks for reading this and oh guess what its too late! I already sent some good vibes your way and there is nothing u can do about it! <3
7	Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're referring to the feeling that your life has had no meaning when you look back on everything you've done up to this point.\n\nI feel this from time to time as well, & it sends me into a sort of introspective, self-isolating "funk" I can't seem to get myself out of. Eventually, it always goes away, but there's nothing I've found that can help me bring myself out of it purposefully. This feeling, at least in my experience, will sometimes be short-lived, but can last days or even weeks. \n\n\nI think it stems from feeling as though you haven't made a positive, lasting impact on the world. There's a semi-clich√© quote that's hanging in one of the halls at my highschool; it says something along the lines of "You can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone". It really helps me to think of my life in this mindset, and try to think of all the small things I have done / could do to make someone else's life just a little better. I think it's something all INFPs could really benefit from. Anyway, hope this helped at least a little bit!\n\n

3	Been going throught the same thing for a long time and most recent 'attack' was actually tonight. I feel it as a sadness to what is happening in general so to say and often start thinking about my past or about me as a person and what I'm worth in those moments. So far I haven't found any particular way of beating this feeling. I am starting to go along with it. I write, talk to someone, listen to music which I think is in that mood and just go through it. Especially by writing I try to make it something productive, something good in a way. And articulating it helps to tone it down to a more specific thing so e.g. instead of a hollow feeling I end up with a feeling of rejection which I then am more able to tackle since it's easier to grasp.\n\nHope this helps a bit. Hang in there - your feelings are strenghts, not weaknesses !
3	I am 32M and can relate to this. I think it is a combination of childhood ending and a fear of dying.
2	I tend to drift between these kind of feelings and distractions. A lot of my life lately has felt like I am just passing the time, where I once felt like a new tool with lots of purpose and the ability to create unique things. Lately I feel somewhat blunted and shelved, waiting to be discarded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think for me, I have been a bit ruined by my environment, and my own bad habits. I have always had a bit of a depressive streak and it has always been easier to sit and scroll through websites for the nth time, than to give my mind the freedom to explore a bit. I was getting somewhat dependent on the news cycle surrounding politics over the last few years, and by association, news in general. But now I am feeling like I have utterly neglected my mind and sense of expression, where I used to feel like I had a colourful imagination. I struggle to come up with ideas to draw. Where I used to have stories to write about, I struggle to think about fantastical things. I kinda feel like I have allowed mindless distraction to make up so much of my life, that when I try to remove it, I am not really sure how much it left over.  Which in itself is utterly depressing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, lately I am sorta learning to find my creative streak once again. Partly by opening up on here, partly by making time to pursue creative hobbies (I am writing again and getting fairly excited to get back into it). So to bring it back to your original point, always try to provide yourself a creative outlet üòä
2	Do you know what is causing the pain? Maybe you have some issues you need to deal with. For me it was issues concerning my stepfather being an angry person most of my life.
2	I have this exact feeling more frequently than I would like, just out of the blue it will hit me and ruin the rest of my day. \nI was talking to a good friend of mine about this feeling one time, Though until I read your post I didn‚Äôt realize that that‚Äôs what was happening. I was telling her that my biggest fear in life is that I‚Äôll die without making a difference, and that I think about that a lot. She told me something very cliche but I could tell she was genuine in saying it. So I‚Äôll try and deliver it with the same twinkle in my eye and smile that she did when she told me.\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already made a difference in the world, you mean more to the people around you than you think.‚Äù\nI think about that every time I get in that place now. It doesn‚Äôt make it go away. but at least I can smile knowing that, even if I haven‚Äôt changed the world, I‚Äôve made a few people‚Äôs lives a little better. And really, isn‚Äôt that what it‚Äôs all about? \nI hope the words of my friend can help you as much as they have me. 
2	I've been going thru a similar funk myself. It's so hard to explain. I'm a generally upbeat personality, with lots of whimsical energy. Lately though, holy moly, I just can't shake this feeling that I would liken to driving down a straight road, cruise control is on, with a very loose grip on the wheel.
2	mystery feeling has been experienced by me\n\nand yes, human life is supposed to have no meaning (but to reproduce) outside of a human mind.\n\ni guess you kind of have to learn to accept the feeling of emptiness for what it is.\n\nmusic, for example, outside of a human mind should seem completely futile, but humans enjoy the sounds, so we do it.
1	Yes, I feel this way sometimes too.\n\nAlso don‚Äôt know if this will help, but when I‚Äôm feeling misunderstood or can‚Äôt find a word to describe how I‚Äôm feeling, I search for ‚Äúwords I never heard of‚Äù (there are so many good ones) or go to the dictionary of obscure sorrows- in hopes of finding the scratch to the itch, that is the feeling I can only vaguely describe.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=words+I+never+heard+of&client=safari&hl=en-us&prmd=vnsi&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO3LSThtngAhUk0oMKHTJUAOQQ_AUoBHoECAwQBA&biw=414&bih=719\n\nhttp://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com\n\nHere are some good ones:\n\nNodus Tollens: the realization that the plot of your life doesn‚Äôt make sense to you any more\n\nLiberosis: the desire to care less about things\n\nAltschmerz: weariness with the same old issues \n\nMetanioa: the journey of changing one‚Äôs mind, heart, self, or way of life.\n\nNefelibata: ‚Äúcloud-walker‚Äùone who lives in the clouds of their own imagination or dreams or one who doesn‚Äôt obey the conventions of society, literature, or art\n\nHiraeth: a homesickness for a home you can‚Äôt return to, a home which maybe never was; the nostalgia, the yearning, the grief for the lost places of your past.\n\nSonder: the realization that each passerby has a life as vivid and complex as your own.\n\nMeraki: to do something with soul, creativity, or love. To put something of yourself into your work.\n\nBoketto: the act of staring vacantly into the distance without a thought\n\nTidsoptimist: a person who is always late because they think they have more time than they do. ‚ÄúTime Optimist‚Äù\n\nEngentado: feeling ‚Äúpeopled out‚Äù and wanting to be alone

42	Fresh out of a breakup and did some soul searching. This explains everything ._.	
23	Your infp friend has really ticked you off, but what you fail to understand is that an INFPs tendency to feel all that you feel and beat themselves up in silence for it withdrawing even more from you cause they think they hurt you. Ya INFPs are not perfect and hard to get through to but selfishness isn't in their trait. Instead of ranting out on Reddit try communicating the same to your friend with no filter, bear truth and you will see a side of them you never thought them capable of having. INFPs are nothing if not understanding and adjusting towards others.\n\nINFPs have a superpower of blaming themselves for anything that goes wrong around them and create distance because their overthinking would cause even more uncertainty and that with everyone they know. We can literally create a fear out of zero evidence and that's what causes your friend to withdraw from time to time. Being disappointed in them would not change that and would push them away even further.
16	Nobody's fucking perfect. Every person is a Asshole in their own special way 
3	Welcome to the world of introverted feeling. It‚Äôs our dominant function, so not entirely our fault. It‚Äôs our job to communicate what we are feeling to our significant other, hard as it may be. 
7	Damn, a lot of that rings true for me when I'm at my worst, tbh. I guess I only put so much stock in these personality types (depending on my mood I can get INFP or INTP, but maybe that initial caveat is important), but we're not doomed to these negative behaviors. \n\nA lot of these exact behaviors lead to the ending of what was, for a while, a really good friendship of mine, and almost lead to the end of a 5+ year romantic relationship around the same time. But I started going to group therapy, where I had to be honest to people, and I started doing more to build an emotional self-reliance. I'm still working on being more attentive to others and NOT ignoring communication because I fear the potential of conflict. It's only been about a year, and I also have a double whammy of ADHD and high functioning ASD, so I'm still making slow progress with that in particular, but you can kind of train yourself to do it, right?\n\nSelf improvement is a real thing, but it's a lot of fucking hard work. In the short term, it doesn't make me too happy, and can be really frustrating in the moment, but when I look back at where I was a year and a half ago, I realize that I am generally happier and less shitty to people around me. 
5	Ouch
3	This bullshit gets posted in every several months.
4	so true but so sad at the same time
4	It kind of hurts a little (a lot) that‚Äôs an ugly truth, but one that needs to be faced in order to be worked on. 
2	Joke's on the poster. No one can call me and I can ignore no one's phone calls when I finally get rid of my current main line and switch to a feature phone just for my immediate family to contact me in case of emergency.
2	[removed]
2	I'm sorry, I'm an INFP who broke up with an ESFP because this is exactly what he did to me. He really disliked conflict and wouldn't give me clear answers on anything I ask him. Not unless I have to press on something. At the beginning AND the end of our relationship, he was very in-and-out. Can't make up his mind whether he was into me or not. He hated whenever I was depressed. Would only communicate intimately with me when I would be 'happy'. But he claimed that he was in love with me for a long time in the middle. He was also very deflective and disliked being truthfully criticized. Sometimes he'll turn the blame on someone else. He doesn't think far ahead, so he's always going with the flow and doesn't make solid plans and that explains his indecisiveness in future planning. I kept feeling used by him by the end of it all. For security, for free meals, for materialistic desires (for god's sake, he got his dream car because of me). He made it seem like he was somewhat reciprocating back to me but they all came down to nothing and nowhere as much as what I gave him, which was pretty much almost everything.\n\nTherefore, I don't think one definitive type would explain this behavior that well. It really comes down to maturity, not exactly type. In fact, I really try to let people know that I'll get back to them or am busy/feeling drained and will be more available some time in the future and I would let them know when because I want to keep a good relationship with people around me. The most accurate you can get with this post is probably xxxP or xxFP, not just INFP. And even then, having a P wouldn't mean that you're always so indecisive or ignoring people like this. It depends on the person.
2	Ugh I do all of this
3	Feeling extremely hurt and confused by an INFP, I wish I could tell him these words, I wish he could get out of his shell and also feel my deep pain coated in social-butterfly-ness too. Hurt by his random lack of communication and insensitiveness one day and super warmth and caring behavior on the other day and dragging me into this unhealthy contact, but I decided not to share these feelings with him anymore instead writing them and send them to myself because he might randomly either just care or not even bother reading them. :) 
2	Biggest oof
1	I just got out of a relationship about a month ago and I still think about it everyday because it was an extremely confusing time. I think we are both INFP's, I know I am, but she basically did all this shit, and I have severe confidence issues and abandonment issues so it really bothered me throughout our time together. But, honestly after reading this I feel like I do this to my friends a lot and it kind of makes me feel bad, I hope I don't cause harm to them like what I just went through recently.
1	Looking at my chat-logs in group messages, I realized how rarely I ever messaged my friends. How am I still in any relationships...Reading this post made my heart ache.
1	I see so much truth in there, don't actually realise that I'm being so selfish usually, but I appreciate it so much when People point things out to me, which is another selfish thing because I should be able to realise what I'm doing myself!!! Argh! 
1	Thank you for this one! I am 4 months in a breakup, and these negative aspects is what I believe, from my part, made the BU happen. I've been trying to reflect, it got way easier reading this even tho it hurt a bit. I wonder how to fix :|
1	This definitely stings but I do genuinely think I'm overbearing and such when it comes to people I care about. I want to be involved and help and do what I can and I suppose that's me trying to inject myself into their lives when they are their own person. But I also just want the other person to be happy and my indecisiveness tends to stem less from just not knowing what to do but more so just really wanting to do whatever makes that other person have the most fun and enjoyment and not knowing that sucks. I don't care so much about my own feelings because I'm going to be happy just spending time with someone I care about. But I totally get how it's frustrating and I've been realizing I need to do my best to fix it and not focus so much on myself and just be less selfish in general and consider other peoples feelings just the same. I know what I want to happen, I know who I want and I know how I want them to feel about me but these things are two way streets and I know I can't force anything so I figure the best thing to do is take a deep breath and just try to live in the present. This is probably just a rant and I don't even know if it makes sense but I think, at least for me, I think it's a matter of finding someone you care about and want to better yourself for because if you better things just for yourself you're only focused on yourself and other people's feelings and how things affect them don't really come into your mind at all.
0	I needed this reminder... I'm doing better, but this was me a few years ago. I think the problem was that my receiving love language is Quality Time, and you can't expect your SO to be around 24/7, especially if you're not actually doing anything.\n\nAs for the calling and texting though, I can't relate, I NEED to respond to my friends and family ASAP or tell them that I need to recharge. I didn't realize until recently how hard it is for me to admit to people that I'm feeling overwhelmed but it's important to communicate so I'm working on it
8	Discussion - Got high for the first time - what were your experiences?	I went to Amsterdam and tried weed for the first time. It was a fun experience but I really don‚Äôt like high me. I was soooo needy and emotional; a big mess really. I laughed until I cried and then the tears made me feel sad so I was actually crying. I feel like all the emotions that I try to hide away were released. Apparently I talk a lot when I‚Äôm high and my friends said they learnt a lot about me. I don‚Äôt think I said anything too embarrassing or super personal but I still feel really embarrassed for letting my internal thoughts free. (I‚Äôm hoping they can‚Äôt remember what I said because I sure as hell can‚Äôt remember a lot of what happened.)  Either way, deep down I don‚Äôt care too much because the friends I went with would never judge me. \n\nAnyway, the point of this post is: what‚Äôs the high you like? I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs completely different for every person or if your personality affects how you react.
9	I am quiet when I am high. I don't really talk and prefer to listen. I pay attention to my senses more when listening to music or tasting food, which is a common occurence for cannabis.
3	I mostly found any negative experiences with weed were more being anxious and hyper self aware. I became a fan of it by just getting high and diving into video games and zoning in for a few hours.
4	Sounds like you got a little too high. I've done that a few times. It's on the same level as someone having one too many drinks and they start telling you they love you and all that.\n\nHigh me varies depending on what strain and how much. Usually I'm very smiley, not terribly anxious, creative, and interested in everything. The more sedating types have me locked in the couch trying to follow the storyline on a show.
2	For me it varies each time, but I have been known to cry because the chocolate milkshake had run out (I felt sorry for the milk because it didn't exist anymore) I've also cried because my boyfriend was making faces and it terrified me. Definitely makes me even more needy and sensitive, but as a previous comment said, I also found that zoning in on something like a video game just made me feel really chill and forget about all the other "sad" stuff

35	Oh dang, that‚Äôs actually easier ha! If you put Reddit app in Night Mode, it works the same as if it were in Day Mode and you inverted the colors (under iPhone settings, type Smart Invert in the search in case you wondered for future reference)\n\nI‚Äôm sure the comment was meant to be seen in Night Mode first, but since it‚Äôs noon here, I first saw it in Day :)
45	It's a comment,not a picture
14	If you have an iPhone, smart invert the colors :)
11	I could talk about space for hours, it‚Äôs so fascinating.
10	It's quite entertaining to change the size of the browser window to very narrow and back again, just to see the stars spin and planets move!

5	Depending on how big your window is, you can get it to sort of look like a lunar eclipse is happening.
6	My phone switched the Reddit app to night mode out of nowhere and I have no clue on how to turn it back, but at least I get to see this the way it's supposed to be seen. Thanks for posting this magical comment.
3	ok, RIGHT after seeing this post i went to the post underneath and found this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/au99d9/comment/eh6jrfz\nwhat do you know?
2	I first saw this in one of my posts...It was mesmerizing üòç
2	pretty beautifuller in night mode
1	This reminds me of @tiny\_star\_field and @spacetravelbot on Twitter. Enjoy. ‚ú®
1	[deleted]
1	OH GOD YOU MISSED THE MOON
1	View it in dark mode üôÇüòâ
1	Which creative genius thought of this :')
1	Peaceful and pretty.
1	I always wonder how other life forms could look like. How scary it would be to be there, floating for ever. How wide is it??
1	This is better than the real night sky.
8	Spent an year getting accustomed to my seat at work. When I finally felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù in my seat and the people around me, today my boss decided to change everyone‚Äôs seats. Fml	I‚Äôm so mad I have tears in my eyes. I was moved so now instead of being next to the one person in my department I get along with, I‚Äôm next to one woman whom I really don‚Äôt get along with. And it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm shy either, I just really don‚Äôt get along with the women in my department - they are bitchy, and gossipy and just not like me at all. \n\nI was pretty close to the department with the people I work with the most, people whom over the last year I‚Äôve become friends with. Now I‚Äôm far from them as well. I feel isolated. \n\nI‚Äôm waiting for my boss to get out of a meeting to talk to him so I can change back to my old seat, but I‚Äôm so upset I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll start crying and lose my credibility. 
1	This same thing happened to me at my job... Im mot 10 so seriously, why.
1	what job is this, that is domineered by extroverted sensors? that doesnt seem to be the healthiest place for an isolated introverted intuitive (see the movie matrix)
1	That's bizarre. You're normally supposed to sit with your department. Your whole department might get moved, but it makes no sense to just switch individuals and mix them all up. 
41	As much as some people think they aren't very adept at dating or the social scene because they're INFP, I think we actually get away with a lot do to a kind of unassuming "soft" charm	I've been thinking about this the past few days and it reminded me of something a friend told me in high school.\n\nShe told me if I got into selling drugs no one would ever suspect me, and another friend said the same thing about stealing from a store. I had no inclination to do either, but still.\n\nEven when I'm in an incredibly craptastic mood, people don't really seem to pick up on it. Unless I'm openly crying, people don't seem to have a great gauge for fluctuations in my mood so they just assume I'm chilled out or happy. I've been called "adorable" or "so nice" a lot in my lifetime for pretty much nothing. I never really had to prove that I was friendly, just kinda be there and act however. People do seem to trust me as having good intentions and being earnest very fast (which, to be fair, I do 99% of the time). I also seem to attract a lot of "protecting" motherly types as friends. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Thoughts? Disagreements?
20	I think I get what you mean. I‚Äôm aware and self-conscious about the way I present myself that subconsciously I act a certain way to not piss people off or to avoid confrontations. Like I‚Äôll talk to people and have long conversations just because I know they NEED to talk, and I‚Äôll oblige but deep down I dgaf what they are saying, I‚Äôm just being nice. I try not to be a shady person and I guess people see that and think I‚Äôm nice, even though I kind of hate most people, I just don‚Äôt show it.
9	Speak for yourself. I‚Äôm just awkward and uncomfortable.
4	Yeah, I attract a lot of older people at work. Some are that Protective type and others feel that I'm just someone they can trust. No one around me can ever seem to sense my actual mood because I never really show it outwardly. I find that I can get more information about someone if I don't talk to them. They just spill their entire life story to me without me saying a single thing to them. All their secrets and fears and dreams come rushing out at me and all I said was hello. 
5	I get that too! But I can also be very spicy and cheeky as well as sullen and blunt (when my inner intj is activated). Unassuming charm is very true :) I don't think I am that likeable though. \n\nI'm very soft at heart, but my Te is like a devilish porcupine. It mostly comes out in my writing style. It's really quite amazing how reserved and soft I am, but how sharp and terse my "communication" can be. That Fi-Te dualism in me, is quite bewildering.
3	My team leader at work recently said this about me. She said "he let's me know when I'm wrong but in a careful and nice way. Isn't he sweet?" I found it kind of weird tbh, especially because it was in front of others. I'm always unsure if people are genuine when say stuff like this, cause I don't see it. I once told her I wanted to do my best to make our project succeed, and she said I've definitely shown that, which I also don't believe. I hadn't done jack shit at that point. \n\nI think I and many others have issues seeing the good in how we portray ourselves and what we do, and even though I know I have that problem I still don't believe people when they say good things about me. Unless it's a very close friend. 
3	A couple of weeks ago, we were playing a board game called Resistence. In this game, there's players that are secretly infiltrating agents from the gouvernment trying to stop the actual resistence from succeeding their ops and I was one of them.\nOut team won and no one ever suspected that I could be a traitor. When I asked why, one person said that I look too nice for that.\n\nLol
2	I get this all of the time in work. Everyone calling me 'cute' and 'the innocent one'. I find it kind of funny cause I don't see myself in that way at all. They genuinely couldn't believe it when they discovered I smoked weed, they seriously thought I was joking. I have to say I do enjoy surprising people like that though lol 
2	My bf & friends will tell me that I'm the sweetest person they know, for doing next to nothing. I think most people just have a good sense of other's intentions, & we radiate good intentions. \n\nAlso, expanding on your comment about people trusting you w/in a short period of time, I feel like that all the time! People open up to us a lot sooner than we will to them, at least in my experience. I've had people that I barely know tell me huge details or issues in their lives. A few examples: Last year, a girl in my class randomlt confessed she starved herself after knowing me all of about two weeks. We only spoke during labs, but after that we talked during class a lot more. When my bf and I started dating, he told me about a significant negative event in his best friend's life within a couple of weeks. So yeah, I think we just have auras of good intentions üòÇ
10	[Recomendation] Moanin'	
1	Oh heck yes üòâüòâ
1	Never actually listened to the whole thing... but if you want a Japanese movie that's basically a tribute to this song and the jazz genre in general, I highly recommend this movie, [Kids on the Slope](https://kissasian.sh/Drama/Kids-on-the-Slope/Movie?id=39897). Not only did the two male leads actually train in their respective musical instruments, but the female lead is also among my personal favorite Japanese actresses.
2	How do you cope with loss?	I have had two brothers pass away. My brother Jason in November 2014 unexpectedly from an enlarged heart and my brother Sean in December 2018 from cancer. I know time heals most pain, but it's still pain. I have gone to music to help. I've tried to direct the pain of loosing them towards motivating myself to accomplish my goals I know they would be proud of. \n\nI don't think I will ever heal from these losses and I am afraid of loosing more of my loved ones (my hedgehog, Nigel, passed away two weeks ago of a tumor). \n\nHow do you guys cope with loss? Is it normal to not be able to actually let it go? What works for you? How do you deal with the anxiety/depression felt, if you feel it? \n\nAlso, if you have any music suggestions let me know.
3	I‚Äôm so sorry, I can imagine it has been really painful. It‚Äôs perfectly natural to still be in pain, grieving takes the time it takes and that‚Äôs usually more slow than we‚Äôd wish :).\n\nI remember vividly talking to an acquaintance about my father, a few years after he had passed away. She said to me: it takes seven years to deal with a loss like that. And strangely enough, her words turned out to be true. It got less painful throughout the years before that, but after those seven years I felt at peace and as if I had truly processed it all. \n\nI still miss him at times obviously, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like a dagger to the heart every time I think of him anymore. The bottomline of it all is, these are some great losses. And you‚Äôll need time to heal and find acceptance and peace. Noone can dictate the pace for you, not even you yourself. \n\nTake your time. Cry when you need/want to. Miss them. Accept the holes it left in your life and that that hurts. Accept that other losses trigger all this pain, it‚Äôs normal and ok. If you feel you‚Äôre truly stuck, get some help. And trust the process, even if it hurts like hell you‚Äôre still moving :). \n\nA big hug.
2	Ruminate it until it doesn't feel that bad anymore. Might take years, though. :( But that was when I was younger.
2	For me talking to them can help. I sometimes write them private messages on Facebook. Who knows if they get the messages? Maybe there is some online computer in heaven that they can access them. But if not, simply the act of writing the messages can relieve some of the emotions.\n\nHonoring them can help too. Like my grandmother loved to garden, so I planted a pot with flowers in honor of her.
2	Time
2	It‚Äôs difficult. My dad died suddenly when I was 18. I‚Äôm now 31 and it‚Äôs still hard. It gets easier to cope with the day to day, but it never really goes away. \n\nSomething that strangely helped me was working with the elderly. I‚Äôve lost so many amazing people, but I am grateful for the time I‚Äôve had with them and I‚Äôm honored I got to be there with them, to support them, at the end of their lives. Working with seniors, I‚Äôve realized how short and fragile our lives are. We all assume we have tomorrow.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to live each day to it‚Äôs fullest and appreciating the time I‚Äôm given, because even 90 year olds say that their life happened in a blink of an eye. To hear that 90 years flies by too fast, I want to live each day like it is my last.\n\n‚ÄúThere are only 2 days a year when nothing can be done. One is called yesterday and one is called tomorrow, so today is the right day to love, believe, do and mostly, live.‚Äù- Dalai Lama 
6	Goodbye wonderful INFP's.	I thought my BF was an INFP, so I've been hanging out here a while trying to get to know his personality.\n\nJust got him to take the test and turns out he is an INTP üò≠\nOff to the other side... \n\nBut my bro in law is an INFP and must I say, you guys are the sweetest souls ever.\n\nIll always have a place in my ENFP heart for you. 
5	Those test results can vary depending on time taken so not all hope is lost yet.
2	Yea bro enfps belong to intps we don‚Äôt match good 
1	How did he found out he was an INTP?
1	I believe that I'm a sort of IN(T/F)P.\n\nI dunno, sometimes there are certain situations that needs me being more T than F and vice versa.\n\nThat's also why I'm on both reddit boards.\n\nYour boyfriend might be the same.
1	I know this is basically not related, but I'm curious. I'm an INFP and I have a sibling who is an ENFP and we get into arguments so easily. I was just wondering what your experience was like with a brother-in-law who is an INFP. Do you guys get along or have there been some rocky patches? Any tips would be appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;
1	intps are attracted (or at least this is just me) to the NFP types, so if you give him a chance, he could become pretty attached to you (assuming he finds meaning in being with you)
1	If that's what he relates to..... it's probably the case. I'm solid INFJ..... except when going through stress, such as depression or some other event deemed by me as traumatic. At that time if I take a test it cycles, INFJ/INFP. \n\nIn my normal state, it's always INFJ. Because I'm thinking clearly and spend more time about how and why I think.\n\nEmotional...Lord!!!!! INFP all the way! Really, in that state being here with the INFPs is a treat!!!!\n\nTry not to get too caught up in MBTI for your relationship. It's cool though you are taking that much time to understand him! That's an amazing quality in itself.
1	i need some advice	I have a lot of anxiety, and even though i have clear signs that the people around me love me, i still feel like i'm a burden, and everyone hates me. I don't know what to do to make myself feel better. help
1	It‚Äôs great that you can see that your anxieties aren‚Äôt grounded in reality. It seems like you could benefit from therapy. There are often affordable sliding scale options.\n\nFor now, you can also try WoeBot, the free CBT robot, who can help introduce you to some of CBT techniques: https://woebot.io\n\nI‚Äôve been chatting with him through Facebook messenger and it‚Äôs been pretty fun so far!
1	Things that helped for me:\n\n* Take time to get to know myself better. What characteristics do I loathe about myself and more importantly: why? On the other hand, what do I enjoy about my own company? Once you have a rudimentary idea, you can consciously start shifting your mindset bit by bit.\n* Talk with your beloved ones about it. It will be hard, I know but more often than not it will lead to some heartwarming and eye-opening moments. To quote something my friend told me after I opened up: "I think it's really important at some point to come to a feeling of maybe *you* don't believe that you are good enough, but many others around you do, and so many others can't be wrong about something fundamental."\n* Find an emotional outlet if you don't have one already. Be it taking walks, dabbling in paint or some meditation.\n* Remind yourself to distinguish between situational and dispositional attribution. For instance, your friend might be having a stressful day (situational) which doesn't mean they stopped loving you (dispositional).\n\nObviously this list is not exhaustive but hopefully this helps!

3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 25	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	Set up my future build machine as a Steam OS machine temporarily for the holidays. Installed Ultimate Horse Chicken, and it was kinda a success during the holiday visit by relatives. However, I realise that the kids who are too young are unable to play it. Being a major procrastinator, I didn't have the time to search for and QC child-friendly games. Felt like a bad host.\n\nChanged the liquid soap dispenser to a foam soap dispenser, because I like the foam and I feel it's overall more environmentally-friendly as less soap is used. Someone with arm difficulty tried to dispense soap, but finding the strength required too high and probably assuming it (dispenser) to be damaged, gave up and just used water. It was then I realised that my change, while well-intentioned, may not have been well thought of. How about kids and people with hand strength difficulties? Granted there's actually a soap bar beside the liquid soap though.
3	Not looking forward to work today. The people there are so toxic, I've been so run down dealing with all of the negative energy. Two days is not enough time to repair and heal from it all, just to go back and do it all over again. I'm only typing here as a way to procrastinate from going in.\n\nI want to find a new job but I feel like I'm stuck as I don't know what I want to do, or where I want to move, or do I even want to move at all? I'm feeling very lost. 
2	Today I ate meat for the first time in 4 years. It was really difficult, but I‚Äôm finally feeling satiated for the first time in 2 years. 
1	Well. My anxiety is the worst it's ever been. But my meds still keep my depression at Bay? So that's good? I guess?\n\nWhelp. Back to pot and videogames.\n\n(I realize certain strains of pot can make anxiety worse, if I smoke one of those I don't touch the rest of that batch, that's not the cause of my anxiety spike)\n\n\nBut I'm torn. I hate my job and working. But I hate living with my parents. I feel like life is an all lose situation. We either give up our freedom to a job we lose our life to. In order to live. Or we can have the time to live and lose our lives.\n\nSo I don't know what to pursue anymore.\nThinking about going back to college to go into therapy after taking a year ofd 
1	Ever since I started college a few days ago I've felt really inadequate with how socially awkward and slow I tend to be in group conversation. Most of the time I just seem to hang out with a group and stare in silence as they talk and it all makes me feel incredibly out of place. At the same time, however, I find myaelf in the need to be with someone as all of my close friends are in other universities and I feel kind of alone tbh.\n\nI try to be warm with people and smile as much as I can, stand up straight and all that jazz but getting to meet someone and gain enough trust to not be a social potato takes time and I just haven't had that much time with anyone to really say I feel close.\n\nAt the same time, I have been feeling a bit too closed off from people, which I fear will really limit my chances romantically. Since my last relation ended last year I feel like I have somewhat improved the way I dress and express myself, but I dont feel I can be as outgoing or expressive on the spit as a lot of people around me. I was never all too god with girls to begin with, so sometime the feeling that I will just stay alone forever creeps in and I have to remind myself that my time will come and that everyone is alone at the end of the day.\n\nThe whole college experience is pretty fun once you look at it. Im doing fairly decently in my classes and I have a group of people I hang out with, but I do feel more "by myself" in college, which is a mix of good and bad I feel. It's only been little over a month but I do feel like I have been rather closed off lately.
10	Saw that some of you guys share your art so after a lot of overthinking, I thought I‚Äôd share some of my music	
1	Woah this is really good! These are some great hooks. I especially like rock bottom.
246	May the universe be kinder and softer to us	:)
29	Thats a dream come true.  I am resilient as heck but so long for that and "her."
20	Reminds me of a quote from 'Night in the Woods':\n\n"I believe in a universe that doesn't care and people who do."
15	I prefer may we make the universe kinder and softer
8	Amen
7	Word
7	The universe just is...
7	And may you never stop being gentle and kind
6	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs chaos. It‚Äôs all random. And it‚Äôs horrifying. And if you want to try to reduce the horror and reduce the chaos, be kind, that‚Äôs all you can do. \n\nIt‚Äôs chaos. Be kind.‚Äù\n\n
5	May the universe be kinder and softer to each other.
5	I think you mean, "may you be kinder and softer to yourself" : p
4	Blessed be.
3	That starts with us being kinder to each other. We all have to make selfish choices but try not to destroy each others feelings. 
3	Lost best friend to brain cancer and dad appears to be approaching the end of his life now. Despite me doing all the ‚Äúright‚Äù things lately. It‚Äôs such an odd feeling to be powerless while still taking action. It sucks.
2	One can only hope, sometimes the thoughts run away and it beats me down. I can only hope things work out in the end.
2	As an INTJ, I‚Äôd like that too.. 
2	May you be kinder and softer to yourself.
2	Can you still be considered an INFP if you feel like the universe should stay how it is or be tougher? I feel like humans/society are becoming too soft and fragile.

1	What keeps me going :)
17	I've been subbed for a while but just kinda lurked and am always in awe of the beautiful work everyone puts here so I figured I'll add something I wrote one evening in regards to a friend of mine going through a hard time (Its very stream of consciousness so any advice to make it better is welcome!)	We stand here at an intersection\n\nWill we keep walking down the tracks and travel down the path to prosperity; will we be able to get up and keep moving if we get hit by a car, or will we lie there and allow ourselves to collapse?\n\nOr will we pause and stagnate in iniquity with a feeling of satisfaction that nothing has been lost; at the \n\nPerhaps we could take a turn and drown ourselves in the river of possibility and fight to rise above the current in order to do what no person has dared to do before.\n\nThere is also the option of turning the other direction into the city, and allow ourselves to be like everyone else and suffer in the rejection we feel, just to satisfy the appetite of those who care for us. \n\nRegardless of the direction we take, it is essential to never lose sight of who we truly are, else our mission will be compromised and any chance of success with either be brought down by the evils that lurk on the path, or we will cause the end of ourselves with a distorted perception of grandeur.
1	Hey there, I like your writing. Very much reminds me of my own, especially when helping friends pass through tough times. \n\nSome of the themes you touched on have even made their way into my writings. I'm no expert, so don't really feel comfortable giving advice apart from this - keep it up! The more you write, the better. Even if it's just for you and your friends .
1	What do you guys think of Artificial Intelligence filling in for the void?	
4	I think of it this way: \n\nHumans have souls. AI does not. \n\nCould AI replace the human-human interaction? Of course. We already fill many things as substitutes. But they will never truly be the same as the deep connection that can be felt between two souls. \n\n
1	our job as intps are dead pretty much
1	As we shift our lives to be more and more online, the more false representations of humans can replace real interaction. It is easy to imagine we all become part of some tight loop with an AI where we train our AI conversation partner to be what we need to hear at that point in time. If these interactions are seductive enough we could suspend our disbelief because of that feeling of being understood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we begin to shed our physical appearances with digital overlays when we all use an augmented version of reality like our current one, we can all look like others desire us to look like. Interaction itself could become a giant app which is overlayed on top of reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFortunately for us now - we have a few good years left of humanity. Where AI may be able to generative and patterns and temporal sequences of said patterns, but it still cannot understand subtlety of emotion and thought. Once this happens - I weep most for the scientists and computer programmers. The people who wanted to solve problems to be curious - whose only solace will be an endless entertainment loop from Netflix 5.0 - bathing their consciousness in neural Novacain .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ultimate sadness is knowing this is all an inevitable consequence of such mundane factors, it has been predicted since the beginning of human thought. That the moment a tool is created which reduces work required to accomplish a task, eventually a collection of those tools in concert will produce a tool which can with minimal constraints actualize a human thought and be replicated effortlessly (a computer program). The ostensible goal of those who seek efficiency is apparently to work towards giving themselves and their ancestors a virtual reality where they themselves can be the protagonist in their own lonely, solipsistic galaxy... remote and forgotten - a meandering herd of stars all part of some everything - expanding at an accelerating rate - toward nothing really at all.
14	Do you ever feel like you won't reach your potential?	I don't know if this is a common feeling among other infp's, but I can't help but feel like I will never really do everything I am supposed to do. I feel like there is so much more for me but it will always be a little farther ahead. I don't want to settle and be content if there is something more, but I don't think I will ever be able to reach it. I feel like I am capable of doing some big, amazing thing but its just out of reach and I'll never get there, so why bother trying? This may sound like a bunch of gibberish but I thought of all the communities on reddit, maybe someone on this one can relate? 
7	10 years from now, the time will pass. In between these 10 years, you can choose to do actions to achieve some of your goals or to not. But the 10 years will still go by.
6	I totally will not do near the things that i thought i would do.  Time has a way of getting away.  It does not help that the "way the world works" is like the nemisis lurking in the corner, blocking your chances of completing or doing those things you've thought you would.  I too have always felt that i was here for something "big."  That thought has never been been at the "delushions of grandeur" level.  It is that I simply wanted to leave a mark more significant than "the guy who served as a sacrificial lamb to many."   It would be the greatest if I could accomplish something that helped people treat one another better beyond being a good example.  Whatever this life is all about, i aim to love my kids and be here as long as i can.  Its odd how time accelerates as we age.  If we dont use our experiences they get squandered before we know it.  Life is so strange...full of roadblocks, detours, and conundrums.  Im rambling but maybe thats what life is, just a ramble that seems like it takes forever then its gone and everyone is like "what was that for?" In the end (does it matter?).
2	Unfortunately, yes. I have made some steps that I'm proud of, but nowhere near the potential I would have wanted
2	INFPs or the idealists always seek perfection!!!!! So much so that we often forget to gauge our own strengths and mis- estimate how much we can accomplish.\n\nIts not that we cant reach all that we dream of but more often then not we forget to take a closer look at ourselves plus the overthinking and anxiety don't help either.\n\nWe can and many of us do make good on our aims, its just that we give up too easy cause we have a perception of how things would go and if the journey does not match our imaginative expectations we drift away from the path.\n\nI believe that out of all mbti types infps have an amazing ability of imagination and a sense if the bigger things in life that we never quite conquer and feel that we would never live up to our own unbelievably high expectations. This world including us is not so perfect and our dreams and aspirations are never adjusted for this factor hence the conundrum of to be or not to be.
1	let go of how you thought your life should be, and embrace the life that is trying to work its way into your conciousness.\n- caroline myss
1	I can relate 100%. It helps me personally to remember that life isn't a competition.
4	Does anyone else relate this to dominant Fi?	[Why you feel what you feel - Alana Watkins - TEDxOxford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-rRgpPbR5w)\n\nBeing aware of your own feelings, and from that gaining the ability to control and shape your inner emotional landscape.
2	[deleted]
2	What do you think?	u/thechessgoddess and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in XNFPs. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count moral obligations out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded. This is a place to express yourself, after all. 
2	Murder is logically wrong because you do not have to kill someone or something to survive. Also on an emotional level, I have the opinion that no one has the right to decide about someone else life. 
1	intp: im responding because this looks interesting\n\n1. murdering for material goods wouldnt work, because other people could murder you; murdering for morality wouldnt work under the situation, because there is no morality in this situation; murdering for food? seems like one solution to the overpopulation problem; for government, requires moral justification to (somewhat) avoid war\n2. the easiest question ever-everybody kills everyone, boom, no world left to conquer.
1	1. Murder is logically fine if:   \n\- An assessment of the situation in question determines that murder is an appropriate response.  \n\- The assessment should be translatable against a external benchmark. Any action can be rationalized in a system without externally verifiable standards given enough motivation and incentive to do so. \n\n2. Murder is logically wrong if, after assessing the situation, it is determined that murder is not an appropriate response.
1	Introverted feeling (Fi)	Does Fi make infps self centred ? If so how do we change something so innate? 
2	Fi can make someone self-centered, but it can also make someone not self centered too. It all depends.\n\nFi-dominant users often know what they like, and so they might not want to do things they don't like. For example, say there is a group of 5 people and 4 of them want to go to a Mexican restaurant and the Fi-dom user doesn't. The Fi-dom user might tell the group, "I don't like Mexican food. Is there somewhere else we can go?" An Fe-dom user might go along with the group. The Fe-dom user might even change their mind on Mexican food, thinking, "Hey everyone else likes Mexican food, I should like Mexican food too." The Fi-dom user is less likely to change their feelings towards what they like or don't like.\n\nSome people might think this is self-centered of the Fi-dom user. Fi-dom users need to realize they need to make concessions and they need to do things they might not want to do. Otherwise, they may lose friends for only doing what they want to do.\n\nAlso it is important to realize that this all depends. An Fi-dom user may decide to eat Mexican food even though they don't like it and an Fe-dom user may decide they don't want Mexican food even though the group wants it. What matters more is where the thoughts stem from. The Fi-dom user's thought might be, "I don't like Mexican food, but maybe I should eat it this one time to make my friends happy." The Fe-dom user's thought might be, "Everyone wants Mexican food and normally I would go along with that, but maybe I should not have Mexican food because I need to do what I want for a change."\n\nI think this can make it hard to type people. You have to look at what is going on underneath it all. Is the person naturally predisposed to do what they want or are they naturally predisposed to do what the group wants? What they do does not matter so much as what their natural instinct to do is.\n\nI hope that makes sense. And please if anyone has any differing opinions please share. I would love to hear what you think.
1	I think Fi makes you reason from the inside. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily equate to being selfish, it just means you take your own thoughts and feelings seriously the way I see it. In essence I think, if you can tolerate and fully accept that people differ and your reasoning doesn‚Äôt mean truth, it can even make less selfish because it‚Äôll lead to respecting others as they are and the needs they have. And to find a decent balance in understanding yourself and the other, and the different needs you‚Äôll both have. \n\nAs a therapist I find that most people have learnt that to pay attention to your thoughts, feelings and needs is selfish, so in that sense I easily understand why others might find INFP‚Äôs rather selfcentred. We do that quite naturally. In my mind that‚Äôs a bit odd tho, as for me it seems mostly motivated by understanding these parts of ourselves fully, and embracing them. In my work I‚Äôve found it extremely useful, once people figure out it‚Äôs ok to self reflect and listen to themselves, they usually grow more whole and healthy. \n\nIt‚Äôs a two edged sword, as everything is. Too much focus on yourself is unhealthy, as is too little. 
12	Rant, I feel like I'm overreacting	So... I should probably preface this by saying, this Is my first time posting here, and I'm kind of anxious about it.\n\nSo... my problem is... something of which most would say, "you just haven't met the right people yet!" But... I'm 20 by now, and... everybody I ever met, with the exception of my girlfriend, used me and then left me.\n\nI needed to find a place for working experience, I went to about 20 places, and got rejected by all of them. Meanwhile, my girlfriend got accepted by the first once she applied to, it was even a very difficult place to get into. Eventually I got accepted by someone who felt sorry for me, but... people seem to dislike me without knowing me. \n\nMy girlfriend has noticed it too. It's ridiculous, I know I'm not pretty, I'm not smart, I'm not strong, and I'm most certainly not a social butterfly. But I even noticed it in my parents, they're really quick to anger, and lash out with nasty words. I'm... just not what they'd want me to be. \n\nAnd I know I shouldn't care, but on some level I do. I do care, I pretend to myself not to care, and most of the time it works.\n\nBut today... I got in a fight with my mother, she called me lazy, she said she always had to say everything I had to do. The thing is though, I walk on eggshells every day. Careful not to upset either of them by forgetting anything. I'm a good girl, I despise drinking, I dislike parties and as such... never go to any, I'm content with a book and music.\n\nI don't know why people seem to automatically dislike me, maybe it's my tendency to be negative, maybe it's my looks, maybe it's my social awkwardness, maybe it's the fact that my only big interests are anime, games, and anything that has to do with fantasy. I dislike sports, I don't want a part time job because that means interacting with people, and I feel nauseous even thinking about it. \n\nI feel like a nobody, like I have no worth. My girlfriend is... everything I'm not. She's no extrovert, but she's always better, always ahead of me. A higher level of education, more hobbies than one can count, a tendency to be capable of doing anything she puts her mind to. She's beautiful, kind, smart, talented, and meanwhile I'm everything but. I'm terrible because I wish to be like her, so positive, so happy, so strong, so, so dazzling. I guess you could say that I'm jealous of her, and I hate this. I shouldn't be jealous, she has her own troubles. And... I get this, but... I sometimes just can't help it...\n\nI know comparing Is the road to the evilest ways but... I try hard not to. Sometimes though... I just find myself cursing my luck, to be born so unattractive, to be such a scaredy cat, to be so disinterested in everything about real life, to live in my own world.\n\nTdlr; I feel like I'm worthless and can't help but wonder why everybody always seems to hate me without knowing me. 
4	I tend to agree.  As an infp when I was younger a lot of people didn‚Äôt like me, they said so üòÅ.  People can be rude and cruel.  You do you.   I tend to think infp and nfs in general are underrepresented in the population and as such are often misunderstood.   That‚Äôs kind of on them.  Trust me as you get older NO ONE cares.    I would try to work on school if you can, it‚Äôs usually worth the effort.  Perhaps look up some study skills and such.  Those things can help a lot.  Also prayer and quiet time.  If I don‚Äôt get some of both I can, over time, begin to get overwhelmed.    Try not to get jealous.  Be happy for others who are doing well.  Your time will come too.  Forgive those who hurt you (being bitter only hurts you in the long haul).. Try to find something your grateful for every day.    Keep being nice and charitable and you will find others who are also nice and charitable...   volunteering can be great ways to build good self esteem, and meet awesome people too!   In regards to looks..... meh.  Seriously I would go out with a woman who is cool and nice over someone who is good looking any day.  Good looks MAY get you a first date but good character gets you a great life.    Anyone who puts looks first probably honestly isn‚Äôt in a place themself to be worth dating anyway.   \nI also completely agree with the above poster, try not to be so hard on yourself!  Praying for you. Hope that helps a little!
2	I relate a whole lot to how you're feeling, except that my mom is constantly pushing me but won't let me talk badly about myself (even a little bit) or do it herself which I'm really grateful for. I also don't have an amazing SO to compare myself to, which sounds pretty hard :|\n\nIf you'd like a suggestion, even though I know you mostly need to vent, accomplish something small for yourself! I consider myself an artist but I rarely create anything and it's embarrassing to feel like I'm not really passionate about anything. So, I went to the store by myself and bought some art supplies. I still haven't used any of it, but it was a little victory because I hate leaving the house so much. Accomplishing something small might help your self-esteem :)\n\nI've been looking for seasonal work recently and it hasn't been going well. I love animals and would much rather work with them than people, so I'm getting experience volunteering at an animal shelter so I can do something that feels worthwhile and could help me find a career in the future, even if it won't make me any money right now.\n\nI hope this helps. I love you friend!
7	INFP Crowd Surf	This might be a bit of a long post so I‚Äôll put a TLDR at the end.\nFor the past year or so I‚Äôve been trying to try new things, say yes to things I would normally say no to. Yesterday I was really put to the test, my brother invited me to a metal/hard rock concert. Neither of us like that kind of music but he thought it would be fun so he invited me and I decided to go. \nI was actually pretty nervous going into it because I don‚Äôt like parties or large crowds or being touched, also your traditional metal/hard rock concert goers are a little scary looking sometimes haha. Anyway to the point of the post.\nIt was amazing, I moshed crazy hard just for the hell of it and got covered in beer and sweat. at one point I was even lifted into a crowd surf and passed around. On top of that everyone there was super nice, I got knocked down once and they stopped to help me back up then we all kept moshing again. Everyone was just there to have a good time and hit each other really hard and as much as I didn‚Äôt think I would enjoy it I really did.\nShoutout to all the cool people at concerts who like hitting each other and being friendly and helping each other up. A special shoutout to the guy who kept me from hitting my head on the floor when I got dropped out of the crowd surf. \n\nTLDR: I try to do new things that I normally wouldn‚Äôt, my brother invited me to a metal/hard rock concert and it was actually really awesome and everyone was super friendly. Go out and try something new friends :) \n\nAlso the band‚Äôs name was ‚ÄúDAUGHTERS‚Äù 
3	Bro hooold Tf on you went to a metal concert for the first time and got CRIWD SURFED??damn this story got hella fire üî• in the middle.Bro that‚Äôs dope as hell
2	I love metal/rock concerts for the same reasons, everyone is super nice and the experience is amazing !!
6	Have any fellow infp‚Äôs read Madeline Millers book ‚ÄúCirce‚Äù? Thoughts?	I just finished it and..wow. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt this way about a book before. Curious what  fellow infps think of it. \nAlso, would be great to hear of any other books that really resonated with some of you. \n\nOne of my favorite quotes from the book:\n‚Äúa solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.‚Äù\n
8	Any INFPs in the Birmingham (UK) area? We should do a meetup!	Any INFs around the Brum area? Would be really cool to make a meetup. 
1	Oh yeah, finally someone !! Send me a PM:)
1	Send me a message too. I'm also from Birmingham! I'd be down to meet up somewhere.
6	What's your ONE belief/value that's non-negotiable?	We're all INFPs here-- what's the one thing that you knowingly get much too anal about, to the annoyance/detriment of the people in your life? I know you all have one.\n\nFor me, I can't stand drugs in any shape or form, nor can I stand being anywhere near them. I'm against the criminalization of marijuana, but I still can NOT stand presence or acknowledgment of it. This has put a real wedge today between me and the people I was friends with in high school.  
10	That once someone cheats I can almost never trust them at the same level again. Be it my own significant other, a friend / relative's S.O., or a friend / relative themself. You can argue human nature, mammalian nature, psychology, or the history of polygamy, I won't budge.\n\nLuckily I have never been cheated on (as far as I know). However, my brother's marriage fell apart when his wife cheated. Seeing the effect it had on him solidified this belief. If there are problems, talk about them. If you feel like you can't, discuss the fact that you feel like you can't. If you are afraid of violence by bringing up problems, talk to family and friends or a therapist (and if it's a legitimate fear get the fuck out immediately). But seeking comfort in someone else's bed before you've taken care of your current relationship is always the wrong course of action.
9	For me its something along the lines of if I call you a friend I expect you to do the same for me. And I would do anything to help my friends so i guess its just really treating people the same as i would want to be treated.
9	My one thing is animals. If you exclusively view and treat animals like things/objects/possessions instead of the feeling and sentient beings that they are, then I will have a hard time respecting you. Having said that, I was vegan at once and failed. So I am not a militant PETA worshipper or anything like that. I just believe that animals have a soul and deserve our love and respect.
8	Nobody should be forced to do anything (and coercion is force)
6	I actually have the exact opposite thing that I'm steady in my ways about. I think drugs of all forms should be legal. Who's to decide what we can and can't put in our OWN bodies. Do you feel the same way about alcohol? I highly doubt it though it's possible, and props to you if you do. I don't do drugs because it's my choice, but making things illegal that aren't going to drastically harm people isn't the way to go about personal choices. It helps addicts 0% if they feel like they can't speak up because they're going to be shamed about partaking in "illegal" activities. As far as the weed thing goes, the use of marijuana does not define a person, so choosing to not associate with another person due to their personal choice doesn't seem like a very nice thing to do. Unless they're peer pressuring you into smoking with them, I really don't notice the issue. Friends go out to a bar together, why can't they smoke? Again I don't do drugs but it's because I myself decided this, not our society that's told us not to because it will turn our brains into scrambled eggs.
4	I hate pointless arguments or senseless violence (towards animals, children or other innocents especially), and I also can't stand people with huge egos or those who brag constantly. I had a crush on a guy on my team on & off for a few years, but when he changed into more of an egotistical / braggy person due to his good performance, I stopped liking and even talking to him. We had been close friends, but I just couldn't be around it
3	my infp friend has a thing about never hurting anybody (whether intentionally or not, necessary or not)\n\nalthough there is a bit of irony is that its not really far sighted, which is why id probably get along better with an infj\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas for me, drugs (yes, because doing them might be fun but is actually dumbass when not needed)\n\nnot being completely true (either by direct lie or omission of facts)\n\nand dodging the topic in conversations (even emotions, as they stray from the truth)
3	I hate watching people be mean for no reason. It makes me so angry to see people who are just mean to be mean. I think this is best summarized by John Coffey in The Green Mile when he says ‚Äú.... Mostly I‚Äôm tired of people being ugly to each other...‚Äù  
3	I'm one of the religious INFP's I guess. Specifically I'm a Catholic. Been through some nasty spiritual stuff in my life but this saved me right here. Definitely my non-negotiable.
4	Yeah as someone that works in health care I have a problem with your belief, sorry. Drugs like medicine can save people. I understand hating recreational drugs. But you said drugs of any form.\n\nMy thing is don‚Äôt tell me what to fucking do. I‚Äôm not your fucking slave I control myself. And you piss me off if you try to tell me what to do and how to do it. I‚Äôll do it if makes sense to me, but at least give me time to determine that for myself. But you can‚Äôt push me around like a puppet. This ties into your belief, you can‚Äôt tell me I can‚Äôt use drugs just because you said no or it‚Äôs bad. I will do it just out of spite. It‚Äôs my life, I get to do what I want. Otherwise I get to tell you things in your life that I hate that you shouldn‚Äôt do. We all have our own vices, just because it ruined someone‚Äôs life doesn‚Äôt mean it will do the same for another. It‚Äôs not the drugs that is the problem it‚Äôs the person that is choosing to abuse them that is the problem.
1	Wrong and right are perspectives
1	Kids. Absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nI can't stand the idea of parents (or any other care provider) doing irreversible things to their kids (aside from medically necessary treatments). From one-year olds getting ears pierced to genetically editing a kid to be more obedient, I am extremely not chill. I would easily give up a friendship over this issue.
1	The notion of bodily debt - that one owes society or an organization/field some fee for having an animal body that‚Äôs easily subject to injuries and distress. I believe societies which will not institute universal healthcare systems are guilty of an act that is evil - though I do believe the acceptance and advocation of bodily debt is generally driven by ignorance and self loathing. \n\nAlso, marijuana legalization. It‚Äôs a medicine for too many and for me, it‚Äôs saved my life and sanity on numerous occasions. So, I take it personally and am not able to have very many ‚Äúcivil‚Äù conversations regarding this. It being legal for medicinal use isn‚Äôt enough as that is still too restrictive for many to gain access. I feel similarly about psychedelics, but I can understand why people might be more cautious about their availability. They can be paradigm shifting in a way that some simply cannot handle, but imprisonment for putting something into one‚Äôs body is an egregious policy. 
162	Why is urban dictionary so accurate? üëå	
27	I have a friend who is the most introvert, socially awkward person I know but at the same time has colourful rainbow hair and makes outrageous comments. The time I'm thinking of is, we got a taxi and sat in awkward taxi silence till our destination. Once I'd just handed the money over she shouted in a deep voice "blowjob ten dollars" and got out the car. Leaving me speechless.\n\nAfter reading this post I feel like she may be an INFP?
13	I love you INFPs for that kind of shit.\n\nSincerely,\nyour crazy ENFP bubblegum bitch
12	OMG that persons name is meeee INFPs even like the same cereallllllll
7	I feel so understood üòÇ
7	‚ÄúThey absolutely fucking loathe meeting new people‚Äù can confirm, majority of the time. 
8	This trait only fucks me over when I have to meet new people amongst my close friend group. It just makes me appear to be some stuck up ass who won‚Äôt reach out to the newbie while I act silly with my close friends. 
3	It's just too accurate. Lyrics all day, errrrryday.
2	Lmao, me
2	I have no doubt this was written by an INFP about INFPs. They know too much.  Plus it's just nuts.  Crazy. :D
2	Maybe that‚Äôs why I like The Stranger by Billy Joel. It‚Äôs all about putting on appearances, but not showing what you‚Äôre really like. I tend to do that around most people including friends.
3	Cringe
1	<< oh..I thought a good portion of people did this because were comfortable and cant afford to give a damn. Neat I learned something today.
1	Yep, I'm a socially awkward ass, but I did develop a "mode" for speaking to strangers.
1	I feel like this sub... understands me. Haha.
1	omg that's so me I'm such an individualistic infp because i am just like these other infps, wow...
1	Why the fuck did I upvote this?
955	üòâ	
87	Stop that hurts.
47	I think it‚Äôs the other way around. Logic will tell me A, but Emotion will be like, ‚Äúwell u-um... I think B sounds nice...‚Äù Logic will proceed to glare at Emotion, but Emotion will win anyway. 
14	This is literally the exact scenario when I have a stressful day and im contemplating whether or not to go ‚Äúimpulse buy‚Äù a tub of ice cream to eat in one sitting.\n\nI have been practicing a lot though in using logic to override the emotion driven impulses. I wish it wasn‚Äôt such hard work üòÇ
25	Although i am trying to go with logic nowadays.  How you guys doing? 
12	Why is this so freaking true ü§î
17	This is why I don't trust myself when I'm in distress .\_.
8	This was my dilemma last night when deciding wether or not to order pizza. $50 or food that would be extremely satisfying for someone that's sick. I decided against ordering the pizza.
3	HAHAHAHA look at the face of emotion in the last drawing lol
2	There aren‚Äôt too many things here I agree with - but this is dead on! üòÇüò≠
2	emotions serve my logic\n\nunless logic cant solve the problem, in which logic serves emotion
2	Emotion rules my life and that is why I‚Äôm a poet and not a dull accountant who noone will remember.
1	When i need to make a decision in life there is no logic üôÑ I wonder how I can fight with my emotions and use some logic ü§î
1	Love it
1	The best lol!
1	Why you gotta call me out like this?
1	If you drew this, I recommend you to start an Instagram account to post these comics. It will gain a lot of popularity. It will also help people figure out their minds. You *know* these ideas will come more often. That‚Äôs just how our brains are wired. 
1	I feel called out
7	Betamanlet is ashamed to admit that he finds songs, books and videos more immersing when he pretends that they were created by him.	I haven't resonated with anything as much as the works I have created by myself. It's mediocre, but it's mine. The works of others often are boring in comparison: I know nothing of the artist, his thoughts, his life, his sentiments. There is nothing to connect with, other than the piece itself. If I pretend the piece I'm experiencing is made by me, suddenly it becomes alive. I discover nuances that I had previously ignored. I see meaning where previously none existed. I grow attached to the piece. But if I don't do this, I couldn't care less about the piece.
3	I know what you mean, especially the part about discovering previously ignored nuances always surprises me. 
29	Things I've learned in the last year	Hope this helps some fellow INFPs avoid the PAINFUL mistakes I've made. Not exhaustive and just a start but here goes:\n\n\nHALT (stop if Hungry Angry Lonely Tired) exists for a reason. Follow it. \n\nKeep my mouth shut and my ears open until I have something worthwhile to say \n\nMake sure I know myself \n\nKnow my intention \n\nBe direct and concise \n\nKnow my audience \n\nPut myself in their shoes \n\nUse as few words as possible to say what I mean \n\nDamn well mean what I say \n\nActions are important \n\nMake decisions \n\nDon't let time slip by \n\nBe proactive \n\nProcrastination leads to missed opportunities \n\nIf I'm given a second chance. Take it \n\nRegret is a bitch \n\nLearn from mistakes \n\nDon't repeat the most devastating mistakes twice \n\nIf everyone close to me leaves me, something is wrong with me. Figure it out and fix it. \n\nDo what I say I will do \n\nI'm not alone. But I will be if I don't change \n\nFigure out what is broken and fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. \n\nLearn to love myself. If I don't then would I truly be in a place to be in a loving relationship with another human? No. So learn to love myself. \n\nBe vulnerable. With the right people. \n\nApologize and say I'm sorry from my heart and sincerely.  \n\nTake criticism and see how I can grow. \n\nFigure out how to truly love other people. \n\nWatch what I eat and exercise regularly. \n\nGet out into nature often.  \n\nBe vulnerable. Yes, I need to hear that again. \n\nAsk other people for help. \n\nHelp other people. \n\nLove people in the way they need to be loved, not what I think is best. \n\nLearn how to be a good friend. \n\nListen. Listen. Hear. Hear. Clarify. Listen. Did I mention listen? \n\nDon't assume. \n\nClear up misunderstandings SOON. \n\nI'm wrong often. That's okay. Just admit it and figure out what's correct. \n\nBe vulnerable. See a theme? Even superman was vulnerable. \n\nEvery moment is a new opportunity to be a better and healthier human. \n\nIf I'm scared, say I'm scared. If I'm fearful then admit it. Just don't let fear define me. Yes, stuffing fear can define me. So don't do it. Face my fears. \n\nLastly, to say again, love myself. Have compassion for myself. Be vulnerable. Grow. Learn. \n
4	I want to have this printed under my eyelids lol. \n\nYou helped me get through some down feelings/ communication problems today, thank you! So many of these points I needed to hear. 
5	books for INFPs?	hey y‚Äôall, i‚Äôve been a reader all my life, but i‚Äôve never really considered books that are ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù with my personality.\n\ndo you guys have any suggestions? any genre is fine (including nonfiction), i‚Äôm just looking for something that an INFP is guaranteed to love!
6	The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is my favourite book of all time. When I was younger I also enjoyed the Gone series by Michael Grant. 
6	1984 by George Orwell. Orwell himself was an INFP
4	Cloud Atlas was a good one. I also recommend Jungs works.
3	‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck‚Äù- by Mark Manson. Seriously though, It‚Äôs a good one.
3	"The Riddle-Master of Hed" and the rest of this trilogy by Patricia McKillip is the most INFP fantasy I've ever read.  It's by turns intellectual and mysterious and startling and passionate and terrible and unnerving and subtle and terrifying and then it's on to book 2. I will never forgive or stop thanking my sister for introducing me to this series.\n\nFor modern fantasy, The People novels by Zenna Henderson collect her short stories within a compelling frame story:\n\n>...humanoid beings from a faraway planet who are forced to emigrate to Earth when their home world is destroyed by a natural disaster. Scattered mostly throughout the American Southwest [mostly Arizona and New Mexico] during their landing before 1900, they are set apart by their desire to preserve their home culture, including their religious and spiritual beliefs. Their unusual abilities include telepathy, telekinesis, prophecy, and healing, which they call the "Signs and Persuasions". The People suppress their unusual abilities as they attempt to integrate into human life. The stories describe groups of The People, as well as lonely isolated individuals, most often as they attempt to find communities and remain distinct in a world that does not understand them. - Wikipedia\n\nIt's a kind of INFP version of the gregarious Callahan's Crosstime Saloon series by Spider Robinson.
2	Into the Wild
2	The poet and the lunatics by Gilbert K. Chesterton. Joy in every single page.
2	We are Okay by Nina LaCour. Short bio from goodreads "*You go through life thinking there‚Äôs so much you need‚Ä¶Until you leave with only your phone, your wallet, and a picture of your mother."*
1	Looking for Alaska by John Green
1	House of the Mosque is one of the most beautiful books I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs got this amazing fairytale vibe about it while it describes the time period in Iran before and during Khomeini. I‚Äôve reread it several times throughout the years and it both touches me with its amazing portraits of the characters and the author‚Äôs use of language.
1	Extraordinary Adventures by Daniel Wallace.
1	- Madeline Dare series by Cornelia Read  \n- How to Talk to a Widower by Jonathan Tropper  \n- Beach Music by Pat Conroy  \n- Love Will Tear Us Apart by Sarah Rainone  \n- So Much for That by Lionel Shriver  \n- Spin by Catherine McKenzie  \n- Stupid and Contagious by Caprice Crane  \n- What If by Rebecca Donovan
1	The outsider, Colin Wilson
1	I have 3 fantasy trilogies to recommend :D\n\n**Graceling - Fire - Bitterblue**\n\nBy **Kristen Cashore**. All are narrated by different (and beautifully distinct) women. A lot of light examination on how we hurt ourselves/each other with our emotions and self imposed limits. A lot of internal debate on autonomy and personal responsibility. (and really fun romance <3) This series is vibrant, easily digested but surprisingly deep. Honestly thinking of it, I'm convinced Kristen Cashore *is* an INFP.\n\nPersonal favourite - Fire\n\n**Finniken of the Rock - Froi of the Exiles - Quintana of Charyn**\n\nBy **Melina Marchetta** (I found this because it was the favourite series of the author above) This is a celebration of deep and beautiful sadness. (there are joys as well) The stories cut to the soul, are a little drier than the others on the list and are emotionally challenging/cathartic.\n\nPersonal favourite - Quintana\n\n**Grave Mercy - Dark Triumph - Mortal Heart**\n\nBy **Robin Lafevers**. I have the least to say on this one, only that they are again all three from the perspective of different and amusingly distinct women in the same overall story. The romance and main characters feel real, the setting and conflict may be guilty of being forgettable.\n\nPersonal favourite - Dark Triumph\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll three trilogies are well realized fantasy worlds, I think all 3 are considered YA (though Marchetta's really shouldn't be) Cashore's series is a deeply personal examination of one character in a bright, elaborate world - while Marchetta's series speaks more to the universal and emotive truths that connect all people in a muted and ash-covered world. Lafevers hits a tonal middle ground and is great for anyone who liked the others, but nothing about it screams INFP at me.\n\nIf anyone is looking for more/similar fantasy recommendations I'd be happy to dive into my old Goodreads reviews for a few more :)
1	I‚Äôve always loved Jane Eyre, The Little Prince, & The Great Gatsby. These are the pretty basic ‚Äúdreamer‚Äù books haha\n\nAlso Sylvia Plath is very good but I can‚Äôt read too much of her at a time because I can get way too sad
5	My intuition life points are on 100?	Hey guys, happy Sunday ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nLately I have been experiencing a ton of synchronicities and my dreams have been very very vivid, I can't stress how vivid they have become.\n\nA couple weeks back I started dating this girl. I had a dream and in said dream the girl I was seeing said, "I'm not the one for you" and I woke up like what the hell. \nSure enough in waking life she made a whole 180 and the thing we had fell apart.\n\nIs my intuition on a level as to where my dreams can warn me of not so good characters in my waking life ? Anything like this happened to you?
4	Yes I have this happen to me. A sort of plain Jane example I can remember is when I dreamt the boy behind me in school would borrow a blue pencil, and we would walk to the office together to go drop something off and sure enough the next day it happened exactly as I saw it. I've got loads of examples but yes, I experience d√©j√† vu quite frequently with my "fortune teller" dreams. 
3	i used to dream a lot about things that would happen the next day, especially when I was younger. i just searched a bit, they‚Äôre called precognitive dreams
2	I have dreams and they're about certain people that I wake up and end thinking about them a lot the next day, like they're really important to me or something. Like i had dreams about girls and was sure that I was in love with them and then I had some lunch or something and it went away.
6	I don‚Äôt know how to love myself...	
2	...
2	You could start by thinking about how you love others...how you show love to others. Like your friends and family. What do you do to show them love? After you figure that out try to do the same things for yourself; \n\nAre you talking about self care or rather something like self esteem? 
2	I sometimes forget to love myself too, especially when I‚Äôm lonely. I find that talking to new people (in a one-on-one situation, online or irl), helps remind me what I like about myself. Getting to share some of my better stories and having new and exciting conversations with people makes me happy. And when you really click with somebody, and you‚Äôre just overcome with all these stories you want to tell, building off each other‚Äôs similar experiences.... it‚Äôs nice to connect to others. 
1	if you cant love yourself, love someone else and (if they are a genuine person) will love you back. this will probably help
99	This is way too relatable	
15	yep, one moment I'm in tears then the next moment my smile stretches from ear-to-ear
13	I'm really easily influenced by music 
2	I usually like listening to my music in order. That means I always know which song is next. 
1	haha :D 
63	A message to the small amount of us who dislike the INFP personality and its weaknesses	I admit I do on occasion as well. Sometimes I wish I could settle for being a mid level engineer or accountant or that I could glide through life without considering the meaning and identity of my every action without regretting anything.\n\nBut then I wouldnt want to be a reknowned author capable of inspiring or benefiting thousands or even millions, a philosophical blogger or youtuber, a psychologist or psychiatrist who is helping people to heal themselves from the great struggles within their mind. Yes, that is where my interests lie and where I can be a champion not just for myself, but for the world, a world so much in need of more compassion, feeling, and understanding. \n\nUnderstand that your idealism is a pair of wings, not an anchor to a miserable life. It is certainly harder for us to fly than to drown, but the day that we do fly we will truly be living a life we could have never imagined. Even if your hopeless idealism has been beaten by the world and been chided by those who just want you to survive and make a living, dont let go of it.\n\nI think Tyrion Lannister said it best. Never forget who you are, INFPs. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you. 
15	I really needed this today. Thanks k you so much
10	Beautifully written. Thank you.
5	Currently trying to find my place in the world.\n\nI try to remember things like this when I think I've been given an unfair hand in life.\n\nI think I'm just not trying hard enough.
4	I can relate to this. I'm trying to break into a career field that I know won't fulfill all of my artistic yearnings. I'm 25, and most of my friends have either shunned careers, working retail; or they only care about money and settling down.\n\nI feel like society is waiting for me to "choose" a side to be on. It's tempting to give up and build some overcompensatory, art-driven persona out of abject poverty. Why don't I just work retail, scrap by, and be punk rock?\n\nI don't know. I don't fall into any one particular subculture, and I can't take my other goals and interests for granted.\n\nBut I hate hate *hate* the idea that this means I'll be lumped in with the cold, money-driven, career types. It's not that I want to be a champion of the working class so much as I just don't want to be misunderstood and misinterpreted as one of them. I'm hoping eventually I can find a balance between an enjoyable job and enjoyable artistic pursuits, but it's so hard to do both at the same time. Who knew being an adult could be so difficult...
2	Well said. Thanks for taking the time to write this.
2	Thank you, OP. This is timely!
1	So do you actually do any of those things?
1	I love this! Thanks. Very timely. Even if you aren‚Äôt doing any of those things, you posted an inspiration for many folks  who needed to read it!
1	I am a web developer for a financial company at the moment and tbh, it feels so unfulfilling at times. I kinda like it a lot of the time when its busy, since I can build web pages which feels at least a bit satisfying, and I can chill out with music at the same time. But it's often pretty quiet and I want to be anywhere else. The work I do doesn't exactly contribute much to society.
1	Thank you. Unbelievable how much I can relate to your words.
73	any other infps feeling the same lately?	
8	Every time I use a metaphor with my friends I get a blank stare and "uhhh...sure". 
3	Weird but sometimes I'm ruining the dream myself by trying to apply logic to vivid thoughts
3	One time I described life as a series of motifs and repetitions, only the outward "shape" we perceive them as to be changing, and of interest - akin to the contours of a Greek vase.\n\nOne friend was super into it. The rest were just like "oh."
2	Sometimes my metaphors and similes are not understood because the aspects which I am using relate to how I feel about those things though, which is subjective. When probed and if I try harder, I could explain. Yeah, I could do with more practice unwrapping my interpretation. I don't know what I'm saying.
1	oh god this... so much this... 
1	I hate when someone uses metaphors on me.
6	Lets talk about John Brown. Fi-Ni hero of the Civil War.	
5	John Brown was definitely an INFP.  You could see in his writings how he thought Fi-Ne.\n\nIf you don't know who he is, Read up on him. He basically [Martyr'd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)) himself to end slavery in the civil war.\n\nDuring the final days of his execution, he just sat around reading the bible, Didn't even want to speak to the priest for being pro-slavery, Didn't want to speak to anyone till the time of his execution. He wrote in his journals detailing his final thoughts. The first one.\n\n\["I am gaining in health slowly, and am quite cheerful in view of my approaching end, ‚Äî being fully persuaded that I am worth inconceivably more to hang than any other purpose" - In his diary days prior to being hanged. Fi-Ni is all about thinking with feelings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not painting INFP's unrealistic during that time, of course most probably fell under the diseases of culture of the time to fit in, or maybe not. I'm not even arguing he was nessecary sane. Although he grew up as an Abolitionist, He didn't need to fight his parents for his beliefs, His father fought also.\n\n\["I bring you one of the best and bravest persons on this continent ‚Äî General Tubman as we call her." - John Brown on Harriet Tubman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next two quotes. Obvious of his insane thinking and him being an xNFx user. Although filling in the blanks above. He does link back to being an INFP.\n\n\["I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land can never be purged away but with blood." - His final speech\]\n\n\[ ‚Äú**When I strike**, the bees will begin to swarm, and I want you to help hive them.‚Äù Hey weird metaphors!\n\nWith all his quotes and actions. I can conclude that he has to be an INFP, Hell even his downfall could be explained by Si Trickster/Fi Demon. (Cognitive weaknesses). I have an ENFP brother and best friend. I would look up what an Si Trickster/Ti Demon is. So while he could be depicted an Extroverted. I highly doubt so, But his father could of been. He charged in with 22 men when he planned for 200 when he raided Harper's Ferry. If thats not a Fi-Ne loop move. I don't know what is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*But you know how INFP's are.*
1	So, I literally just created an account so I could comment on this post to say that this person looks exactly like an INFP I know. It's uncanny. (He's 37 and lives in the Upper Midwest, USA.) I've been studying MBTI for more than six years now (even went as far as getting certified as a practitioner) and have found noticeable trends in physical characteristics and mannerisms according to one's type, at least among NFs, which I have the easiest time identifying.  
9	Any gun owners here?	Any other gun owners here? Just curious please don‚Äôt shoot me ;)\n\nGetting downvoted. Thought infps were open minded. I live on a farm where we need them as a tool. Does that offend some people?
11	And I swear that I don't have a gun. No, I don't have a gun.
3	Enjoyer of firearms here. I am not sure that any personality type is more or less likely to be a gun enthusiast, but it would be neat to see some stats. In my experience talking with others, it's always been about how you were raised or where you grew up. I grew up in a rural area and was taught firearm safety and respect. 
2	I've got a few. I don't shoot them as much as I would like to but it's an enjoyable experience to me. I enjoy seeing how they function and getting hands on. "Building" is fun and I have a few dream projects I want to put together. \n\nA little backstory, never grew up with guns. My wife comes from a family where gun were a regular part of life (farming, hunting, etc.). Took the plunge after college and got my first rifle. Learned lots about gun safety, hunting, hunters safety, animal restoration efforts and more. Learned about optics, cartridges, reloading, shooting techniques. There's too much to list. Gave me a view into an aspect of life I was ignorant about and I'm glad for it. \n\nGives me something to talk to certain people about. Since I've spent countless hours learning, I can give good input on calibers, pros and cons of certain things and why 10mm is best mm. I shut down unrealistic expectations/knowledge of guns and try to to inform people with strong one sided views to open up more on both sides of an arguement.
4	do nerf guns count
1	I have 2 and they don't require ammo.

8	I want to stop being so needy and clingy	I have always been so needy and clingy to my exes and guys I get attached to, and it's just bottomless. I literally want no space, and I want to be in touch constantly although it sounds unlikely for INFPs...\n\nI have friends and parents who I can talk with and support me, but I just can't stop acting that way, and of course it has not been good for my relationships...I have no time for hobby for now because I have been preparing for a big and important exam. How can I stop being this way and become more independent?
8	Develop interests that you can commit to when you are alone. 
5	Probably just takes time. I'm a dude and am mostly the same even though I suppress those feelings, because I know I won't get a positive response. On the one hand it's balance, on the other it's eating me from the inside. You need to find yourself a clingy person, just like I do :D
4	I think, regardless of MBTI, if there are attachment issues/insecurity, then there's likely things in your life that need resolving.  Likely from childhood.  I hope that doesn't come off cold, and hopefully it would be comforting to know that it's probably not really about them specifically, nor is it a "fault" on your part.  Researching things like people pleasing, attachment styles, the inner critic and emotional flashbacks, those all really helped me get insight.  Richard Grannon is a good person to look up on youtube, he's got lots of great videos. 
4	Lol, or I‚Äôve had some good co-dependent friendships with people or the same issue. It feels more healthy because they can understand you, they want to spend lots of time with you, you don‚Äôt obsess over them because you‚Äôre not in love with them, and the things you do together become a distraction of any person you may be obsessing over. I found myself in these friendships, never sought them out per se but ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
3	Perhaps, get an affectionate pet like a dog. Then you could direct all that attention to a loving animal.
3	I have the same problem. And I do think it‚Äôs mostly just related to where I‚Äôm at in life, rather than my personality type. And yes, even some issues from my childhood that as much as I think don‚Äôt affect me, they clearly still do. \n\nI have a boyfriend and often I do feel like absolutely HORRIBLE for wanting so much from him. More time, more affection, more attention, more texts.... And it just takes conversations and growth. I have issues with ruminating and so I‚Äôm trying to find things that clear my mind. And he‚Äôs trying to empathize with me. We‚Äôre trying to find a healthy balance together. \n\nHowever, if these are ex-boyfriends or crushes... And I have been there too... Just find a way to cut it out. It‚Äôs unhealthy to obsess over unrequited love. I have dealt with the games and I know sometimes you have this hope, but honestly it‚Äôs hopeless. Focus on your studies. If you don‚Äôt have time for time consuming hobbies, find something to replace those thoughts of loneliness, obsessiveness, clinginess, neediness, whatever! Listen to podcasts or audiobooks, meditate, clear your mind! 
2	Have been facing this problem lately. I enforced ‚Äútime for me only (phone notifications off)‚Äù and ‚Äútime dedicated to him‚Äù. It could be hard at first, but rediscovering the peace in solitude is priceless. üíõ
2	i feel that. I've been pushed away by friends before for being too clingy, and i don't know how to stop. 
7	Any other INFPs have experience dating other INFPs?	Things kinda run their course with my last partner who I was with for 6 months, with her I never really felt comfortable to be myself, and in a way felt like I couldn't have the kinda random discussions about what I am passionate about with her. On the other side of it though I felt like I had a much clearer idea of what sort of person would be right for me. I figured maybe another INFP or similar type would be a better fit, so I was wondering if anyone else has had any success with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I started being a bit more open and honest about myself, and somewhat selective with the people I message now. I messaged someone on a dating site who had an amazing bio which was just really funny, interesting and quirky, she was an INFP as well so I figured I'd open up a bit more than usual in the first message. Which turned into a bit of a random ramble, some of it about my what I mentioned above. Around a week later she liked me and replied with her own random ramble haha, I sorta messaged her in the first place because her bio painted such full picture of her, which is better than most peoples "hey I like pizza and naps", and then her message seemed to affirm this. Anyway I replied that day with another long message (I can waffle on for a while and like to reply to all things she brought up), then a few days go by and she replies to that with another longer message, which I get a really good vibe from, she was indulging my own quirkiness and sorta opening up a lot more herself. Anyway I replied to that and just had radio silence since. At the time I sorta replied to her long message with lots of little ones, and only the first couple showed as read so I am not really sure what to make of it. She hasn't unmatched me, or blocked me, so I am not really sure what to make of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI partly think I am probably getting invested in someone way too early, but at the same time I feel like I have gotten more from her bio and our few exchanged messages, that I had in my last relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlah this shit is difficult.
8	I am INFP (F-31) and my boyfriend is also an INFP (M-33). We met on a dating app and he had on his bio he was an INFP and he brought up me taking the Myers Briggs test to see what personality I have so I did and my results were INFP-T. We went on our first date 6 months ago and as corny as this sounds it was love at first sight for both of us and we hadn‚Äôt even spoken at that point lol. I can‚Äôt sit here and say that I wasn‚Äôt a little nervous when we got to our table cause I was but within the first few sentences my fears went away. We had so much in common, we were both divorced from narcissists and had a very similar upbringing (he‚Äôs literally the mirror image of me). In our minds we have the perfect relationship but being with another INFP can be work. I don‚Äôt mean that in a bad way at all but as INFPs we‚Äôre kind of codependent so when it comes to taking initiative and it can be a little hard. Me and boyfriend are aware of our INFP traits so we talk about it and come together for a solution. I think the best thing about dating another INFP is you have the same goals and outlook on life and it‚Äôs nice to finally have someone who understands you. I think having healthy communication is a big key to a relationship and being so comfortable to talk with someone is awesome, I never had that in my marriage. We never argue, but if we disagree we hear each other out on what we are both feeling and why. Also though just because we are both INFP we bring a lot of different things to the table as well. My boyfriend is more of an entrepreneur mindset as where I‚Äôm a creator, he has an idea and wants to act on it and I like to have all my ducks in a row to prevent failure, but having someone who‚Äôs core is the same as yours but offers different things to the relationship is very valuable. \n\nBut when all is said and done I don‚Äôt think personality tests matter in who is better suited for you. If I could go back and tell my younger self prior to getting married what to look for in a partner that would be to find someone who has the same core value as you, someone who will uplift you at all times, someone who understands its Us Against the World...your teammate. Finding your partner is no rush! Your soulmate will find you and it will be at the time it is suppose to happen. Good luck üëçüèΩ
2	I'm an INFP-T and my last bf was an INFP-T, and we are still quite close (I would say that I regret that our friendship turned romantic, but I think it was inevitable.)\n\nThe biggest issue I find was that he is more strongly INFP than I am, so he brings out the TJ in me. I have to reach out to him, I have to make decisions, and I have to offer constant emotional support, even though I need someone to do that for me.\n\nThis isn't to say that it can't work; INFPs often feel misunderstood and there's something magic about a person that GETS you, 100%. I think that male INFPs especially tend to favor INFP/INFP pairings because they're so used to feeling different or even feeling like an imposter and like the people who like them don't really know them. The key is to find someone with the same goals and expectations (and the willingness to achieve them) that you have.\n\nAs an INFP girl, I have very limited energy for most people. I'd say that my INFP ex is the only person I have unlimited energy for, even when he gets on my nerves. If this INFP you're talking to isn't responding, it doesn't automatically mean that she is disinterested, but she's probably not INTERESTED, if you get what I mean. If possible, meet IRL and see if you click!
2	Idk I think infp and infp would feed off each other in a negative way, I‚Äôm with an esfj who keeps me grounded and positive and he‚Äôs very sweet. But I don‚Äôt think you can judge a whole potential relationship on mbti personality types, there‚Äôs positives and negatives to any combination but it‚Äôs down to how the people make it work. 
1	Just to update this thread, but she ended up replying to me :) thanks for the comments so far.
3	My entj doesn‚Äôt know how to validate my feelings. Should I feel upset?	I‚Äôve had a roller coaster of ups and downs these past 8 months. It involves major life trajectory change, two very expensive surgical procedures, financial instability because of such, and now we learned our landlord is taking back the house we live in and we need to find a new place to live.  \n\nWhile I was at work the 3 other roommates (his college best friends) went out to look at houses- without mentioning anything to me.  I returned only for one of them to passively mention it to me.  I asked questions and asked them to let me know next time.   I was hurt at first but controlled my emotions and sought out explanation and clarity.  I then asked if we could all process this together. They said- ‚Äú hank texted bill and since we‚Äôre all home tonight together for the first time in awhile we can all talk.‚Äù  We confirmed what time my entj would be home.   \n\nMy partner (entj) was out of town on a business trip.  I texted him to ask him if he knew about his friends looking together (without us) for a new rental.   He said no, but he had admitted to texting one of them.  \n\nI spoke with my partner, and we sat in the community room. I waiting around, no house meeting was ajurned, so I went to bed to get snoozy.   An hour later I went to pee and noticed they were all in one room discussing their thoughts on this whole situation. \n\nMy entj came back into my room and I told him ( in a calm rational way- as I‚Äôve been practicing) how it felt to be left out of this.  I felt hurt.  He became upset and yelled at me and said I was living in a distorted reality.   \n\nHow would y‚Äôall feel?  Am I fucking nuts?   I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can handle all of this.      Anyone else in an entj relationship?  Do they validate your feelings or understand the importance?  
4	Dated an ENTJ and he was the most giant asshole ever. No empathy, everything had to be his way, some major gaslighting because I was "crazy and emotional" whenever I stood my ground. \n\nI casually dated a few more and each time they were too bossy for me, and we always clashed when I stood my ground. \n\nYou do you boo, but I dont think you're crazy.\n\nSome people just dont understand empathy .\n\nTypes aside *because I truly believe that any type can work with any type*, it's necessary that you are being heard and validated in your relationships. If you are not, and if your partner refuses to try, that's sad. :( \n\nCommunication is key, so I wish you the best and that he does listen and shows how much he cares for you. ‚ù§‚ù§
3	I had ENTJ's. They are amongst the lowest empathy types. Bosses too, try to run everything. You don't say anything about your past, are there abuses in your past? Are you doing repetition?
2	I've been dating a Female ENTJ for the past year or so (If you have questions about our relationship, don't hesitate to msg me)  and I'll definitely say this, an ENTJ has issues with validating their own feelings, let alone yours. Patience is a near mandatory requirement on both ends of the relationship because the prioritizations on how you think are nearly flipped upside down. What you consider most important is likely what he considers the least important and vice versa.\n\nThat being said, how you should feel about it is ultimately up to you, but I can tell you that being upset is probably the least effective way to get him to cooperate with you (he will likely consider that "proof" that he is "right", whether it's actually true or not.)
2	Not all ENTJs are developed and even if they aren't, to an INFP they can all sound bossy and harsh, but they aren't always really. If you can be confident about yourself and believe in what you're saying and can keep to the logic side of it, then the ENTJ will listen. It's not that your feelings aren't valid, it's not about your feelings at all really, it's about finding a solution to a problem (looking for new apartment the way I see it) and emotions can be dealt with later, unless they form a logical part of your problem (do they?). For me communication with ENTJ works, because he listens to what I say, values my input and I won't bring my emotions to the problem-solving discussion, but rather keep them for another discussion (when you do/say...it makes me feel...). It's really difficult to figure out from your comment who's in the wrong, but it sounds like your ENTJ is just very frustrated with the situation he found himself in and in that mode he feels threatened and will try to regain control of his life as a reaponse, which he does by shutting out his emotions until the danger has passed (my ENTJ calls it cleaning the wound, which is painful, but useful as opposed to putting plaster on it which won't solve the problem but would make you feel better short-term (as I imagine is how you feel)).
41	I‚Äôm great with one-on-one conversation, but awful in groups.	Do any of you guys have that problem? Any tips to help? 
12	After many years of terrible group interactions, I've come to the conclusion that, especially with newer groups, it's better to relax and just react to the conversation until I have something to contribute with authenticity, than trying to artificially force it.\n\nYes, people sometimes comment that I'm quiet or whatever, and I'll just say that that's who I am and I tend to talk more as time goes on. That may take a long time, depending on the group and topic, and that's ok too. If they are people worth spending time with, they'll respect that's who you are and value what you do say.\n\nI've also come to value that 1-on-1 conversation is often where our "empathic superpowers" can fully engage, so it shouldn't be overlooked. And in my opinion it's a far better use of time than shallow group conversations.
8	im the opposite, @ least if im comfortable with the group... one on one i have to put more effort and push the conversation forward in group people push it forward 
4	Same. I am completely lost when I'm in a group of people. With one person it's easy - I can ask questions, find out what he/she likes. With a group I'm confused, I feel awkward and I'm getting tired very fast. I cannot comprehend of their needs, so I'm sitting silent. I am not taking initiative, so I feel like I'm invisible or I'm just distracting others.\n\nI have no other tip, than taking a break/ leaving the group after some time. Even if there's one person in a group I can relate to, I'm still confused, because I don't feel secure enough to talk about whatever I want around "others".
2	I'm still better one-on-one but what usually helps for me is getting to know group members individually so I get a better grasp on who they are and how to deal with the group dynamics. Obviously this only works for friend groups which do not change much and not so much for groups that get formed out of sheer coincidence. \n\n&#x200B;
2	I think if you get one-on-one conversation with at least one person in the group, it helps throw you into conversation. Sometimes it puts me at ease and I feel free to engage with the others. Sometimes I feel secure if this person is similar to the group that I can figure what type of conversation I can bring to the group. And other times its a straight up crutch and if I talk to them, others can join into our conversation themselves. I dunno. Find an ally. Or just don‚Äôt force it, as someone else mentioned. Don‚Äôt be ashamed that you don‚Äôt feel like you have anything to contribute. If you do, just speak up! If they don‚Äôt like you, who cares!
1	Me too but as ive aged,  i have improved alot .  Given the choice though one on one is preferred because it seems to lead to a more genuine and meaningful discussion.  It will come in time.
1	Wow i'm bad with both
1	I am with you. I feel like most of the group conversations are like they‚Äôre plotting something against someone or a group bitching or gossip session. No wonder we have Fe as a nemesis function.
1	I‚Äôm the same! Don‚Äôt even get me started on group texts. 
1	yes\n\njust trust your gut and things will probably work out\n\nif it doesnt, remember you can always leave until it fixes itself
2	Use the compassion we have for others on ourselves	Yesterday I woke up with a cold and had to cancel a museum trip with friends and my workout at the gym. Almost immediately after I notified them I felt that familiar sense of guilt/melancholy/loneliness. Worse still I had to call my trainer to cancel and he told me to "Have fun playing video games!" which only reinforced the negative feelings I have for myself. I wallowed in my self-loathing (i.e. having a "early" lunch even though I wasn't hungry) for awhile before the medicine took over and I went back to bed, starting my day again at 2 pm. Blergh.\n\nEventually, I forced myself to go for a walk and had another imaginary conversation with myself. Having gone through depression before and still reading some amazing self-help books, I knew I had to stop this downhill train of thought. I tried to take on the perspective of my trainer, who probably meant well and even remembered that I liked video games, which I had told him in our first meeting over a week ago. I knew I was going to see again today for a different gathering, but I also decided to call up one of my other friends and chatted briefly with him on the phone. I went back to this pastry shop near where I used to work at and got lunch. I started yesterday feeling like shit, and ended it feeling pretty good.\n\nThat's my story, I guess. I think we are so often dreaming of our ideal world we forget that we are in control of creating it too.
1	Give your love language to yourself:)
7	Are these problems common for INFP's people? Please give me some insights on how to solve or live with it.	Hi guys,\n\nI'm struggling with myself for a long time with some of my characteristics which make me really stressful and frustrating lately. I actually took some MBTI test long before but just have stumbled upon this subreddit today. Since I don't have any experience with INFP's traits, I hope someone can give more insight into my problems, are those common for INFPs? How can I solve or live with it?\n\n**1. Uninterested with anything that doesn't have anything related to of affected to my life.**\n\nWhen having conversations with my friends, I recognize that people care too much about what doesn't related to them. Like I don't like to read the news because I don't see the purpose of it. When I'm in a conversation with anyone, if the topic is unrelated to any of us (about some things happen around or 3rd person), I just feel uninterested and it's actually like 80~85% of all the conversations. So I just find a lot of people boring, have nothing to say and stay silent in a lot of cases.\n\nThis in return makes me a "boring" one, which never says anything in the conversation. It's not like I dislike or like, disagree or agree. I just don't care about those things. \n\n**2. Don't keep contact regularly with people**\n\nI enjoy time being alone a lot and feel kinda lazy when it comes to keeping contact with the others. When people ask me to go out, my instant answer is likely denying (even I may go eventually). So gradually, people less likely to ask me again. I don't feel like It has anything to do with my emotions toward them, I even feel comfortable spending time with them. It just I have a weird habit when it comes to keeping relationships.\n\nLately, these 2 problems are bringing a lot of negative impacts on my personal life. I feel like I can't socialize normal anymore. I'm lack of confident when talking with others and a lot of negative thoughts arouses in my mind.\n\nAs long as I want to go to the therapist, my country is not that developed about psychology. So I hope someone has been through similar periods can share your experience on how to deal with or live with these problems.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n**TLDR:** I have some problems (1 & 2) that have negative impacts on my life. Hope someone can shed some light and share your experience.\n
5	1. I'm usually very quiet too when I'm in group settings. I'll just listen to what other people talk about and observe them or zone out completely. Only when I'm asked something or a topic sparks my interest *or* I have knowledge on it, I speak up. \n\nI guess part of the solution for me has been to just accept that this is the way I am. Because our Fi (introverted feeling = authencity) is so strong it's sometimes hard to find motivation in just pleasing other people. For me at least the motivation has to come from within, otherwise it feels a bit meaningless and phony. But I've still attempted to learn some basic things about some basic things just to be able to keep up in conversations.\n\nAnyway, there are tons of different people all around you. Surely there are some that you could not shut up around because they compliment you so well and you both like similar things. For us, they just might be harder to find. :/\n\n2. I also have a problem staying in touch with friends and family. I'm very, very introverted and don't mind staying isolated from others for long periods of time. I kind of suck at text messages (I think about my wordings too much and then stress about having been writing a four word sentence for five minutes) and have a growing dislike for phone calls. I only have one friend who still sticks around and that's partly because she's as much of a loner as I am. I like going out but more often would rather stay in the comfort of my home. If you don't want to go, why force yourself? If you really wanted to spend time with those people, you would. \n\nStill, you feel like something must be wrong with you because you just don't fit in and that makes you second guess yourself. The fault must be in **you** because no one else seems to be struggling the same way... *But it is not your fault.* It's nobody's fault.\n\nI don't know if you compare yourself to other people a lot, but I know I have, still do sometimes, and creating my own standards *for myself* has helped. Instead of trying to "fit in", I just do what comes as a natural response. If I can't find the words, I shrug it off and/or admit I don't know enough of the topic. If I find a conversation boring, I allow myself to find it boring. If I find I've forgotten to stay in touch with someone, I ask myself, "well, do I care enough of this person to keep them around?" and if the answer is no, I let it be. The people who know me and the people who matter to me know this way that I am and accept it. But I do try harder for them.\n\nI guess it's just all about accepting yourself, quirks and struggles and all. If you want to change, that's possible too. I don't think anyone is the same person they were the day before, wehther it's good or bad. When you start accepting yourself you'll feel more like yourself everyday and that's a wonderful feeling. It can be a slow process but in time makes all the difference. \n\nHave you yet read about the cognitive funtions? They really cleared a lot of things up for me, knowing that you are the way you are for a reason and it's okay, even if the world tells you otherwise. I would recommend looking it up. Sorry if I went on for too long. I hope this answered at least some of your questions. 
3	Im 17 and have both of these problems as well, \nFirst of all try meditating, realize that being quiet is not wrong, find hobbies and similar people to enjoy those hobbies with, try introducing interesting topics to a group of people talking about useless things, youll be rejected some times but the times people accept your ideas will feel rewarding and people will love you for broadening their perspectives.
3	Why job do you have and/or want?	I'm a community support worker,  in school to become a counsellor/therapist...\n\nJust wondering how many of us went the helping route, or the creative route,(as these are the common listed ones for our type) or if there were other avenues of success...\n\n:) 
9	I wanna be a super famous rockstar, do lots of drugs and then kill myself at the height of my fame
4	im still undecided... im not interested in anything & everything sounds mundane & pointless /:
5	I'm a high school student who can't bear the thought of working
3	I would like to be some sort of teacher. But not like an actual classroom teacher because I think that would be way too tressful dealing with 25-30 kids.\n\nMy ideal job is to run an after school program that teaches kids personal finance, how to cook, grow fruits/vegetables, give homework help, teach meditation. Stuff like that.
4	I'ma piano teacher. Best job ever. :) 
5	I think I'd like to work at or start a Cat Cafe. I never really thought about a career because I just wanted to be a stay at home mom, but I need another person to make that happen! It seems like worthwhile work and I can imagine enjoying my life
2	Going to school in the fall with the intention of becoming a school counselor 
2	I'm in highschool, and I wouldnt mind being a musician but I'm a horrible singer but I like math which ik is odd for infps but so ima be an accountant get enough money just to have an ok life and do what I want after 5 and on the weekends
2	I'm currently a psychology major. I don't really find any field extremely interesting, but I like the idea of helping people. Probably become a clinical psychologist or counselor/open my own practice. Teaching sounds cool though too so not too sure. 
2	I hope to be a writer and teacher after I get out of grad school. It's creative. It helps others learn. What's not to love? I'm teaching part time now, and I have to say the main downsides are I'm too mentally exhausted from being in front of a group of people, and I need to work on not being so conflict adverse (the wonders of introversion). \n\nWhat got you interested in being a counselor?
2	I went the helping route. Became a social worker. But after doing it for a while I realized that I couldn't "cut it". I think more of a function of me being a highly sensitive person, but I was bad at keeping boundaries (to protect myself, always professional with clients) so I was really affected by secondary trauma. It triggered my PTSD and I started having symptoms that I had never had before (awful night terrors and sweats, panic attacks, hypervigilance, etc). \n\nSo I quit and worked in an office for a while. That sucked the soul out of me so much that I ended up in an inpatient psych ward.\n\nNow I work with animals (dogs) and I'm the happiest I have ever been in my work. Who knew cleaning up poop and puke would be so rewarding?
2	I did the stay at home mom thing, now my kids are growing up and I have to figure out what is next. I think I'd like to work in a library or museum and continue working on my painting/art on the side.  I don't see myself in a full time career or anything.
20	INFP and Passive Aggression	Dealing with my own passive aggressive nature as an infp. I really dislike this kind of defence mechanism  I have. Just wondering if anyone else tends to take the passive aggressive route when feeling negative emotions towards others?\n\nIf anyone has techniques they use to minimise their own mood swings and passive aggression id love to hear.
13	All the time. It usually comes out as sarcasm.
10	I wonder whether this is because as infps, we‚Äôre sensitive to social cues, so we expect other people to pick up on our passive aggression and understand 
9	Have you looked into Mindfulness?  When you can bring to attention how you are feeling, you can more easily catch the passive aggressiveness before you've verbalized it or acted upon it, take a moment to think about where it's coming from and why, and then deal with it in a more constructive manner.  I find that Mindfulness takes a lot of practice and I'll still often not catch my feelings till later on when I get some emotional distance and think about it, but that delay is getting smaller as I exercise it.\n\nEdit: forgot to say, I hate being passive aggressive because that's my mum's way of handling situations when her emotions get out of her control (doesnt happen very often, shes usually very rational) and I've seen how much it hurts my dad, so I do my very best not to have the same reaction.
5	I hate it. If I'm being honest I'm pretty damn passive aggressive and it makes me feel like a child and I cringe when I think about it.\n\nJust gotta work to constantly improve communication.
3	I do this way too often..passive aggressiveness is just my default reaction to anything negative. I'm trying to work on taking a step back and evaluating why I feel the need to be passive aggressive after the feeling has passed (usually a few hrs later or the next day). I can usually deduce that I was wanting someone to realize I was feeling frustrated with them, but my fear of confrontation keeps me from being straightforward, resulting in passive aggressiveness. The best way, in my experience, to not react this way is to make a conscious effort to identify what you want and how to best communicate that. Hope this helps :) 
2	I get very passive aggresive, as you stated, mostly as a defense mechanism. Typically when someone says something I percieve as "targetting" me or something that I'm hurt by.\n\n This can obviously be a problem, as most of the time I think we percieve that others are trying to hurt us MUCH more that they are in reality. Because this is almost a defensive reflex of sorts, simply trying to calmly tell yourself that they didn't mean their words the way you percieved might not help. \n\nMy advise would be, if the person is someone you're close to / feel completely comfortable with, tell them what's going on. Apologize for the passive aggressiveness you displayed, and then explain WHY. Do so in a way that doesn't come across as making excuses or blaming them, but rather let them know you did it out of defense and not in trying to attack them. \n\nIf you're not close to the person, I honestly don't know. Still trying to figure that one out myself üòÇ Even if you are close, it can be incredibly difficult to be that vulnerable. So with someone you don't fully trust, it can be near impossible. 
8	INFP Looking for lasting love	Hello! Im a F 23 INFP and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. Part of the reason has been that for the last 5 years of my life I‚Äôve been moving every 3 to 5 months (school, family and religious reasons) so yeah, makes it hard to get into a relationship. Now that I‚Äôm more settled, I really want a relationship but have had no success. There are guys that I like, but I doubt they would like me, and guys that like me, but I‚Äôm not interested in them. When I find out a guy likes me it freaks me out and I avoid them at all costs. I have tried dating apps, but I don‚Äôt like it because I feel like they want to jump in a relationship when I want to start off as friends and get to know them. I think my problem is that I‚Äôm too idealistic, but people tell me being picky is good, and not to lower my standards. Any advice? How have you found a good strong relationship? Can you share your gender and age as well? Thank you! 
7	29M, the only real relationship i've been in was with a girl I started out friends with. I wasn't interested at first but the more we hung out the more I liked her. To me that's how i'd like my next relationship to go as well. Because i'm not too good with conventional dating, going up to a girl, flirt, ask her out, start dating, etc. I'm just too weird and awkward for that. I'd like us to get to know each other slowly. And if there is something there we'd take it to the next level. Ultimately dating should lead to marriage or someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. And you want to be with someone who is like your best friend. At least that's how I want my SO to be. You shouldn't really seek out someone to be your boyfriend/girlfriend. Find someone you are compatible with that you actually enjoy being around. That's why it's okay to be picky. You don't want to lower your standards just to be with someone. Sorry if that wasn't good advice, just my two cents.
3	I am an INFP and a cancer. I am a 29 male. I feel your pain very much. The best thing you can do is stay true to your idealist values and be patient. \n\nI don't know how emotional you are, but ideals and emotions can make a person crazy. \n\nGoodluck in college. Becareful for bad people. 
2	20 infp m. No advice here just the same way for me. I just started focusing on my own life and success and if a gf comes along later oh well
2	20M infp. I have the exact same problem as you when it comes to evading girls who like me, it just makes me feel uncomfortable around them, especially when I give a person a chance and she gets too clingy. I have found that it is all about experience. Dating can be fun and a great way to gain experience. I believe we must overcome our urge to run away as soon as intimacy shows because what happens next can be truly wonderful. \n\nThe thing is that expecting every single love to be long lasting is too much of a fairy tale. Relationships have ups and downs. Take fighting or arguing for example, it's never about not doing it, but knowing how to do it and ending it. Again, things like this come with experience, so don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Awkward moments pass so expect them, trust me when I say you'll stop paying too much attention to them. \n\nAnd one last little tip, when trying to bond with someone, don't try to connect on every single level at once (I found out that's what made me feel anxious and uncomfortable), instead find one common passion and see how it goes from there. I wish you the best of luck!
1	14M but i have an infp friend whos 18F\n\nwhat kind of guys like you?\n\njust from my personal experience (as an intp) i got many esfj girls that liked me (but i took no interest in them), so i just casually dismissed them\n\nmy infp friend actually had most of the people she liked liking her back (mainly of the enfp personality type)\n\nso what youre getting and what youre looking for would definitely be useful\n\nand dont lower your standards, find the jewel in the shit that is the extroverted sensing world
1	I don‚Äôt know their personality type. Normally more introverted and needy? I also get a few extroverted but I really like guys who are more outgoing (doesn‚Äôt matter if they are intro or extervoteld). I guess their personality type does not really matter, I just want to find someone I can admire, is fun and I can share a deep connection and bond with him. 
1	(I'm a 22F INFP)\n\nOh man I feel ya!\n\nI've been in two relationships, one was with an INTP in high school (nightmare) and an INFP who started out as a FWB (stagnant), so I don't think I'm in a position to give advice but I can definitely relate. And I'm gonna give advice anyway!\n\nMy advice is to first figure out what you're looking for. Most people do that through casual dating, but doing some research online helps too. I like to read up on the relationship dynamics of MBTI types and also enneagram types to see the pros and cons of different pairings. Even though I've never met one in real life (as far as I know), I think I'd be most compatible with an ENFJ-A who is an enneagram type 3.\n\nOnce you know what good things you want and problem areas you think you could work through, it's time to track a fellow down! Try to find out where that kind of person is likely to be or what shared interest you might have. I love animals, and ENFJs are frequently known to do volunteer work, so if I volunteered at an animal shelter I'd have a greater chance of running into an ENFJ than if I stayed at home! \n\nI agree that you shouldn't lower your standards but do be self reflective about them. Relationships are work, so no person will be the perfect partner, but they need to be someone you WANT to work with and who wants to do the same for you!
47	I made this picture while I was flying above Iran. It‚Äôs a huge salt lake. It reminds me of a beautiful painting üé®	
3	Awesome!
2	INFP, originally from Iran. I hope one day I can go back to my country.\n\nThanks for sharing!
76	Any INFPs here feel like they‚Äôre just not built for studying?	It‚Äôs just not me, I can‚Äôt bring myself to sit at a desk, open a book, make notes, do past papers etc, I despise it, I feel like this is a severe handicap in today‚Äôs world, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôd be reading a book on Criminal Law and I would hate every moment of forcing myself to read at a desk and make notes, whereas I would enjoy participating in a class discussion, taking part in a debate and especially participating in a mock trial sort of thing.\n\nI‚Äôm more practical that way, and I feel like me not wanting to actually study because I find the task so incredibly mundane clamps my wings for my future.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?\n\nEdit: In reflection, please comment how to battle this, us NFs need to stick together.
25	Big mood right please help lol
20	Maybe it has to do with what you are studying. Do you feel the same way about subjects you find fascinating?
13	I struggle with this too. Here‚Äôs what works for me. First, I keep my phone out of reach. Then, I *actively* participate in what I‚Äôm studying. Some people can just use a highlighter on their books, but I found that‚Äôs not enough to keep my attention. I have to go full-on mechanical learning. Typing out notes, making graphs, diagrams, whatever will organize and personalize the info in my mind.\n\nSome people also use the pomodoro technique, which I think is something like 50 minutes studying, 10 minutes break, then repeat. I haven‚Äôt quite mastered that, but I hear it works\n\nHope this helps!
12	I love learning and studying things, but never for school. School sucks the fun out of even topics I genuinely like
10	I'm not sure I'd say I'm not "built for studying", but here's a trick that worked for me (and I only wish I had discovered it sooner). \n\nWhen I was in grad school, study groups were encouraged in one of my core classes. I discovered that as an INFP, I was pretty good at bringing people together, and because the study groups helped everybody to thrive, it wasn't long before many people wanted to be part of my study groups.\n\nIn most study groups, we would divvy up the reading and write short summaries of the subject matter. We also divided up the class schedule and took turns taking notes. Before too long, I had discovered that some people are built for reading and summarizing, others are really good note takers (which I'm terrible at). My particular strength (that I've seen in a lot of INFPs) was an ability to understand concepts and explain them well (often better than the instructors). \n\nSo after the first year, I became known as the "study group coordinator" (which was challenging, I'm still an introvert, but totally worth sending a few emails and making a few calls). Besides organizing the group, I'd often moderate our study sessions, but as far as 'studying', most of it was done for me. After the 1st year, I only read books I was interested, never took notes, but still had everything given to me. Even better, even though I completely relied on my friends' *good* study habits, when I graduated, there were more than a dozen people who credited me with getting them through grad school. \n\nSo if you can do study groups without violating rules, I highly recommend it as a great way to get all your studying done in a way that leverages your strengths as an INFP. \n\n
5	I felt like that until the reality set in that I'd have to shovel shit and burgers for life if I didn't go back to school
5	Have you ever been tested for ADHD? I thought for a long time that being an INFP was the reason, but I think many INFP suffer from adult ADHD, I certainly do. 
3	Yeah sometimes I feel like this is the ADHD personality type
3	I like finding an animated YouTube video to make it come more to life, or at least see the big picture. With the visual I can then dive back into whatever dry materials and imagine it‚Äôs more interestinf
2	Exactly. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going into music. üòõ
2	I feel that so hard. Especially when it‚Äôs nice outside. I‚Äôll study for like 10 minutes before I just want to die, then I‚Äôll usually stand up and announce that I hate studying/doing homework and go longboard 
2	I'm easily distracted and my mind wanders too much for me to sit there and read any book.
2	Yes..I never learned much in school with the ways they taught. I learn much better through experience and love working with my hands.
2	I struggled with this SO MUCH in college. It finally just came down to: do I want my degree or not? If I want it, I have to do the work whether it makes me want to crawl in my skin or not.\n\nThe best thing for me was to get out of my house and have a specific environment that was the "place to study". Home has too many distractions and opportunities to procrastinate. So I would schedule time to go to the local library. I would set myself up there and spend maybe 2 hours or so a day studying. \n\nWhen it got tough I just had to mind over matter and remind myself of my goal. I also think it was "easier" for me because I was a college dropout, and when I went back it felt like it was my "last chance" to get things right. I was more mature and SO ready to get my stinking degree at that point. No matter what. I would get angry at the homework. Like: "Who do you think you are to try to stand in my way? I'm getting my degree!" Lol There were lots of tears but it was worth it.\n\nWhen I got my degree my brother told me something that still makes me get choked up. He said: "Congrats sis! You did it! You've worked hard to earned something amazing all on your own. It is a part of you now and it will always be a part of you. No one can ever take that away from you."\n\nGood luck!
1	I love to study, but my infp husband does not.
1	Yeah I do also.\nThat is one of the main reasons I found university so hard.
1	I spent my college years doing everything but my work and leaving it for the last minute. There is just something about deadlines that rubs me the wrong way, but I managed to finish somehow in spite of the stress, but I don't recommend it, maybe focusing on what your end goal is can get you to be more productive as well as bringing more reason into it all. 
1	I have no problem reading a textbook for a class I like(probably not what a lot of people would consider studying), but literally anything more than that (taking notes, making flash cards, etc.) I have trouble doing without procrastinating. 
1	I have always been good at studying. But I think, noting what you say about class discussion and wanting to debate, you might like to try getting a study partner from your class. Some peolle work better with others, I do. It helps me think outloud and discuss with the other person.\n\nAlso, I don't like reading silently much anymore. I like to resd out loud when I am studying alone, like thinks such as biology and psychology, and it makes it easier for me to understand and get my thoughts outloud.\n\nTry to find the best method of studying for you. 
1	I always feel like I have to try twice as hard to study but when it clicks I‚Äôm a god. 
1	And i feel like that is the only thing i am good at. After graduating it's bwen a hell to find a nice job and i am seriously thinking about trying a master's
1	Hey I totally feel you on this. I record my textbooks and listen to them whilst walking in a park or round a forest. Something about the auditory route and kinaesthetic learning helps it go in effortlessly. 
1	Are you a 1L? It gets more interesting after your first year when you can choose electives. Also, I had mediocre grades at best in law school as I too could not chain myself to a desk. Yet I became pretty successful in my field. I feel like some of our characteristics like reading people well, being good mediators and possessing common sense are real assets in the law field.
1	I love studying, but only when something that interests me and excites me. So I hate studying for school but I have a broad base of knowledge in various subjects outside of hard academic areas.
1	If you‚Äôre still in school, try looking into learning a trade.. make good money while getting to build things 
1	Absolutely. After about an hour of sitting down with my textbook and notes, I realize that I was was daydreaming about my next sewing project the whole time... if I can combat the procrastination enough to actually even start.  I have no interest in academic subjects at all. The only class I ever had an interest in was a Christianity and culture class, and the professor was a really humorous and authentic guy, he never even gave us a test or quiz and focused more on reflective based learning and discussions. 
1	Yes totally. I‚Äôm fine paying attention in class but can‚Äôt seem to sit still when I‚Äôm on my own. I have a friend who will spend an entire day studying and I‚Äôm like how üôÑ I can maybe manage 20 minutes of looking over my notes
1	I'm just writing my dissertation now and I loathe it. I enjoyed all the active part of my outdoor ed course but this dissertation is kicking my butt. I had to take 2 weeks off work to get it finished and I'm literally waking up, writing, going to bed, repeat. But I know if I dont get this finished I have no future. I just want to be outside. Argh! I'll be glad when its over. Today I'm gonna go sit in my friends house and do it just for a change of scenery. I know I'll probably get distracted but I'm  going insane at home...
1	When I was at the first year in the college I was feeling very bad about learning "useless crap". Luckily, in the next year I joined to student research group, so I had plenty of practical work to do. I'm very happy that I did that, because I can at least write something on my CV, lol.
1	I've never been able to study like a normal person. I've underachieved my whole life and my stress levels have to be extremely high for me to study lol. I consider myself quite bright, but I've had to compensate in other areas to make it this far in life. I can write a 6 page paper in one night, but that's because that's the only time I feel like doing it. That being said, there are times where I'll find myself researching the most random topic for hours, I just can never do this for my school. I'm an infp and I have convergence insufficiency (an eye problem), and both seem to be contributing factors to having an ADHD brain. So yeah, Im being treated for inattentive type ADHD and it seems to be helping.
1	Studying sucks, I don't even try.
1	I'm unique in that I learn best from listening. It helps me a lot less than the average person to sit down and just study no matter what the subject. Even subjects that I love I very rarely study for and have studied only a handful of times in my life. I do fine in school, It's just not how I learn. If you're like me in that you learn best this way, listen to lectures intently, no distractions. I do read my text books just because I feel like I need to at least do something other than just go to class. You can take quizzes online that lead you towards your best learning style. ie: [http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml)
1	YES
1	If you're hyper sensitive, maybe you are more likely to be in tune with your higher self. If you are even remotely in tune with your higher self, this reality is going to feel very unnatural (it is, by design). These feelings will manifest, potentially, as disgust with the world because this world essentially requires that we go against our higher self in order to establish security.
1	Yeah, it's freaking horrible. One thing I'm realizing later than it would have been helpful though  is that it's not about what you like or not,  it's about discipline. All of us INFPS suck at discipline (Te) and that's why we suffer so much. We just need study because we have no other option. I know that probably sounds dreadfully boring to another INFP like me but there's no other solution. It's the bitter medicine we need to take. We must discipline ourself to push through the material whether we like it or not. I'm still trying (here I am procrastinating üòÇ)

6	I don‚Äôt think music preference has anything to do with personality type 
2	please listen to it and determine if i'm an infp or not 
2	if you can't determine if i'm an infp, then can you let me know if my musical tastes are infp-ish?
1	To me, this doesn‚Äôt sound INFPish at all. It‚Äôs pretty extroverted music imo. rap and gangster shizzle is not really something for INFP‚Äôs imo.
3	Did/do you cheat on exams/test at school?	I've always been the lazy one to study at home and instead somehow figure a clever way to get above average grades. 
4	Never. I usually just studied frantically the night before and got nice grades because of my good short-term memory. But all that knowledge poured out of my brain as I wrote it down on the paper so I wish I'd been wiser back then to be more knowledgeable now. 
2	Yeah, now that I do cyberschool. It's like, who cares?
2	I did like most of my classmates. This year I haven't done it any time because I enjoy the subjects I've got so I don't really have much trouble studying for them. \n\nIf what you want is advice pm and I'll try to help!
1	No way, I would've been too afraid to get caught. I got alright grades without too much effort anyway so it would've felt a bit stupid to cheat just to get an A instead of a B or something. The best thing about getting an A is being able to feel proud of yourself imo but I might just be a lame nerd lol.
1	I got caught in the 6th grade and cried so much lol

5	Life feels like a never-ending uphill climb for me. Never really feeling all that great, just continuing on in the hopes of something good coming out of it. I can't tell if that's what everyone does or if I'm doing something seriously wrong here.
2	I saw Alita: Battle Angel last night. Better than I thought it would be. Hope there'll be a sequel.
1	What about the stereotype that all INFP's need to feel special? 
1	I think we gotta change from procrastinator and dreamer to doer and the one who actually makes change. 
1	I started creating (not writing down yet) my own universe again. This time the focus is on making a story that‚Äôs reminscent of Flash Gordon, Star Wars etc. The story itself is about a mercenary who kills a hero and takes his place; eventually running into all of the previous hero‚Äôs villains. The most interesting villain that I‚Äôve created is probably Zygothe. Who is basically a space dictator that wants to absorb the universe and recreate it in his image. There‚Äôs also three brothers who I wanted to initially make into villains, but made them more sympathetic. Their names are Protheus, Matheus, and Daveus. And their backstory is that they usurped control from the leaders that were in charge of their planet. They eventually took the reigns and in fighting began causing them to split the planet into three separate planets. 
1	what does it mean when an infp suddenly withdraws
644	My perfect day: drawing under the influence of tea, good weather, and music.	
15	Looks great! 
10	You did this?!
7	This is supposed to be a commission for Valentine's Day. Sadly, I'm not as motivated to draw when I'm at home, but it's more reason to get out of bed and go outside more often. Today is the perfect day to get shit done and I'm reveling in my freedom to do this.  \n  \nI'm posting live progress on my Instagram, @pinkpalkia. 
2	Great picture. Definitely have talent. 
2	the skill is overwhelming \*-\*
4	That's so sweet! Looks great, I'm happy when others are able to find inspiration and have a good drawing day, it's so rare when that finally happens y'know? üòä
1	Omg do you post your work on insta?oh just saw your insta!
1	oh my lord, this is precious
1	lovely <3
1	Adorable!
1	That's amazing!!
1	I know this shit always happens to me when I say I hate some shit I turn out to be like them In near future but I fucking hate tea people,please Jesus don‚Äôt let me be a tea people
1	The drawing is flawless
1	Feels like home..üòä thanks for sharing!!
1	Ahhhhh that‚Äôs so awesome!! Good vibes 
1	I really like your art style!!! Great job on the colouring.\nI've always loved Pokemon since I was little, the whole world just seemed magical. A place where kids were encouraged to be independent, explore, friendship and bonds between you and your Pokemon makes you stronger... \nWhat keeps you interested in the Pokemon world?
1	Wow, great drawing! I'm an ENFJ and that's pretty much a description of my perfect day, too (no, to be honest, there needs to be at least one hour of human interaction after the drawing has been completed ; ) ). Right now trying out the two sets of Promarker skin tones :)
1	Oh wow! That's beautiful :O Have you considered posting to r/pokemon I have a feeling they'd like that.
1	Is this an ice tea? 
1	This is soooo amazing!!!
1	wow, teach me to be this great at drawing what is your secret?
1	This is awesome!! 
1	You draw really well
1	I use the same pen, I love your drawing and I respect your love for bubble tea. Can i say that i like you already? 
1	Oh my god I love this so much. Amazing work do more I love it
115	It's so true, I've started limiting how much I'm using social media, already deleted Facebook and Twitter. Since then, I am really seeing a positive difference in my energy levels and sleeping pattern.	
10	i currently only have snapchat my mental health has improved so much 
9	I agree. There is so much superficial and negative shit on social media. I limit myself to positive sites and things that interest me, podcasts etc.. 
6	I made up a rule to go by for social media: if it doesnt entertain, motivate, inspire or relate to you. You dont need to see it on your feed. 
4	How are people just realizing this though? Two weeks after I made my fb account, in 2012, I felt the energy being sucked out of me. I started judging my worth by how many friends I had on my friends list, craving for validation in likes and comments, comparing the cons of my life to the amazing glamarous pros popular people would throw onto their timelines. Deleted it those 6 years ago and never used anything outside of messaging services.
4	Snapchat and twitter were the first to go for me back in 2016. Finally deleted Instagram and Facebook this past December and now I‚Äôm only addicted to YouTube and Reddit!\n\nIt‚Äôs crazy realizing how much time they take up when you stop using them. I‚Äôm currently in the middle of 4 or 5 different books and have been trying to create a better habit around making music with all my found time and I‚Äôm so much happier :o)
3	Does reddit count? 
3	I quit watching YouTube and to fill in the time was reading the Bhagavad Gita a couple of nights ago. I was using YouTube to watch Rachel Maddow and getting depressed as F$@K.\nWhat a difference to do something spiritually uplifting in exchange.\nI haven't used FB and Twitter for months and it's the best thing ever too:)\n
2	True, i quit all social media a few months ago and it feels good
2	*speaks in Donald Trump*\nW R O N G !
1	I quit everything except Reddit and Discord. Both if which I'd argue are a completely different flavor than more personal and persona based endeavors like Twitter or FB. I quit not because of FOMO- I quit because I was fully disturbed and disappointed in the quality of thought my circle has. I found myself at first unfollowing relatives that I felt were anathema to my existence. Then I felt like that was a waste of time might as well delete them. Then I decided that everything involving FB mostly is complete crap. It's all a form of bait that made me sickened. I was always a light user but seeing tons of people I know babble TMI and patting themselves on the back or talking crap or vague booking or being terrible was too much negativity for me. 
2	Getting yelled at, at work	I've always been a irresponsible little child, living a privileged life. I'm forgetful, extremely idealistic, \n\nToday was my reality check. I work as a cashier, my inabilty to read fucking calendars lead me to miss an entire day of work. It's my third day in, I'm barely getting the hang of using the computer. And I fuck up the bags, I mix all these items that aren't supposed to go together, and hold up the entire line. The guy waiting ends up screaming at me. My manager has a talk with me about giving a guy 0 bags when he had like 10. Because I missed work in a 90 day training period, I am at risk of an automatic termination. \n\nI feel like a disabled fucking monkey when I work, I'm slow, incompetent, shit at listening, and have zero social skills, I'm failing school. I'm so ashamed, this entire post feels and sounds like an instagram sob story. \n\nReality is fucking harsh. I'm a fucking child, please tell me how I can cope all of this, it has hit a nerve on me, and I can't stop thinking about it like I have ptsd.
3	You've only been there for 3 days. You're new. Cut yourself some slack.\n\nThere are plenty of cashier jobs. If you lose this one, there will be another that you can apply for.
1	I'm sorry for the posts I make here honestly. Everytime I look back on them, I just think of how much I waste peoples time. 
1	Don‚Äôt beat yourself up too bad. Everybody makes mistakes, but it‚Äôs important to learn from them. Instead of wasting too much energy being upset spend that energy learning how to do better. I have faith in you!
1	If you're not making mistakes then you're not learning.\n\nChill out a bit. Relax. Its all confusing for now but after awhile you'll get the hang of it and understand the job better. It'l feel less like unknown and more like familiar. \n\nIf they lay ya' off this early or expect too much of you this soon then you probs shouldn't be working there anyways. Plenty of other jobs around that would treat you better. In reality they should have some pro with you to watch over and aid you while you do it after they've done it several times and you just simply watched.
1	Mate,  I'm in the same boat. I was raise very privileged and was a horrible shit of a child as well. I learned things at 18 that I should have learned at 8. I slept in my parents bed and room till I was 14 or so. My dad cut my food for me till I was 12.  I was born 24 weeks premature. Very small baby lol. That's what led to everything. It still handicaps me today. I have issues being too slow, I am a klutz, and I have a really shitty attention span. I know how it is to feel bad when you have friends over, because you are worried they will think you're a rich asshole. You aren't alone, man. I have a pretty good idea of what you're going through. And you are actually better than I am right now.. you actually have a job!!! Lol
2	I come across as an Extrovert...	.
1	yes this makes women uncomfortable id stop asap
1	I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs off putting. As long as you don‚Äôt stare for so long that it makes people feel uncomfortable you‚Äôre fine. Smiling may also ease the eye contact 
3	Question	I‚Äôm an ISFP with INTP thrown into the mix. My best friend is an INFP. Just would like to ask you other INFP‚Äôs. \n\nIf you have a problem or have something clearly bugging you, would you prefer if we ask you about it or would you rather us do nothing and just wait until you decide to talk to us about it? 
5	Me personally, if you didn't ask, I would probably never tell you until it exploded...\n\nI don't really like releasing negativity or talking about myself in a vulnerable way, but I value the people who pay attention and notice these things. So you should ask!
2	Well for me its tricky. I would like someone to talk to me about it but i also wouldn't actively seek them out. I would bottle it up until the right person comes around and then I would finally talk. 
1	I wouldn't tell you on my own, and I might have a tough shell to crack until I am honest.... however I also need to feel like my problems are not bothering you because somehow I have a feeling that I have to go through everything alone and as soon as I have a feeling I am annoying someone with my problems I might shut them off completely... 
1	ask ask ask 
22	My view - I love it	[](https://imgur.com/HR5SBav)
8	Where the fk is this / can I come visit
5	Me too.  I'll bring pie.
5	Guys, don't leave me out. I'll take care of the drinks! :D
2	Can we please make an INFP Tea party at your place? 
238	One of the top posts in r/2meirl4meirl oof.

63	As an INFP Child	I used to give emotions to inanimate objects. If I picked one thing over another, I thought it made the thing sad, so I would choose the other the next time. \n\nI also thought stuffed animals could talk, but they didn‚Äôt around humans so I‚Äôd tell them ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, you can talk around me, I won‚Äôt tell anyone.‚Äù\nI felt like I could connect more with them than any person.\nI was a weird child. Anyone else?
12	i relate to the first part and i'm definitely ENTP lol\n\noveractive imaginations
8	Yes, yes, yes! Thank you for reminding me!\n\nAs a kid I loved to play in the woods, or in the barn with my best friend. \nWe built different camps or villages for each tribe (Inspired from AoE II, if some of you know what that is) - and there was always this large enemy that we had to defend the other tribes from.\n\nWe defended always the weakest tribe. And when we had given them aid and restored their village, we rushed back to the other tribes. Because there was their turn to get help.\n\nAhh, I would give anything to relive one day of my childhood! Happiness, safety and no worries! 
6	The first one, yes, and I still do that all the time. :D But after the moment is gone I usually kind of forget all about it. I remember an occasion not even long ago when I started crying over a drying pen because I convinced myself it was "dying". So now I have a retirement home for pens because a cemetery seemed too, well, dead. 
3	I recognise both. I still do tbh. I talk to my plants and my favorite tea cups, I cuddle neglected stuffed animals of my daughter‚Äôs before returning them to her bedroom, I try to make sure my house doesn‚Äôt feel too neglected... I don‚Äôt mind it, it gives a sense of loving connection to everything in my life even if I know ‚Äòit‚Äôs just in my head‚Äô. 
3	I like my soft toys so much I still sleep with them.
3	Did that too. My dad talked aloud a lot when I was little, so as to help me learn/expand my vocabulary. And then I was just lonely a lot of the time so I talked to inanimate objects, often ascribing emotions to them or feeling bad for them.
3	Its a huge motivator for me to feel or understand other peoples emotional past (thats what I call it).  Even if I imagine it in my head, even with inanimate objects, it brings a sense of life to the object and it gives my emotional mind something to connect with or imagine. I don't really have a lot of people I can talk deeply with or who treat me well (at least where I am right now in school), so doing this has been getting me back to my old self bit by bit. I have a few close people, but theyre just far away right now.\n\nI like imagining the object's past, and what it's been through so far. Just like with a persons emotions, when you have context of their past you can begin to imagine how they used to feel, how they feel now or how they could feel. You can imagine what came before, and what could happen. You can even pick up on how they dealt with issues in the past, and see what kind of person they are. If theyre emotionally honest to themselves or not..\n\nIt's far more important than I realized.
3	i am a 17 years old infj and im still doing this lol
2	Having to chose one thing from another was agony, because I assigned feelings to everything. 
2	I genuinely never thought anyone else felt the same way! I‚Äôm so glad I found out I was an infp and can finally relate to someone 
2	Me too! I have always had a hard time making decisions. I thought that an item would feel bad if I picked the other one. I remember one time at youth group, the activity was that we were supposed to throw our newly carved jack-o-lanterns off the balcony and I almost started crying. I was the only one who didn‚Äôt do it, and I hid my pumpkin under my coat until my mom picked me up so we could take it home. Honestly, I still think that way a little bit. I hate when people destroy things for no reason, and I have always loved dolls and stuffed animals because the characters that I invent in my head become so real to me.
1	Brave Little Toaster fucked me up. I couldn't throw out anything for the longest time. 
1	There's a term for this phenomena but I can't remember it. But yeah, I do this too. I still talk to toys I collect so they don't feel ignored.
1	yes\n\ndoes food want or not want to be eaten? anyone?
19	[Lighthearted post] Does anyone else get angry at car commercials?	Specifically the ones where people who "definitely aren't actors" act overly shocked and surprised about a car because they thought it was a Ford not a Toyota or whatever. Bad acting and you're not convincing. Or when they pick up the kids from school in this new mystery car and the kids are all like, "This has so much cargo space, can we keep it mom??". It's all so blatantly fake and scripted. And for the commercial makers to assume that we, the consumer, wouldn't be able to tell leaves me feeling offended and insulted. I despise inauthenticity!
3	Have you seen the commercial where the lady in the coffee shop would have knocked the kid over if she wasn't a Qashqai driver?\n\n[https://vimeo.com/274420271](https://vimeo.com/274420271)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0\n\nI wish I had a tiny Bill Hicks on my shoulder reminding me of how bullshit everything is. I'd feel so much better ha ha!
1	I don't get angry. I dont know why but I have this weird sense of reality that they are not scripted actors. Like my brain just automatically assumes that the people are real people.\n\nI got in an argument with friends when I tried to tell them that people on reality shows are actually like that. They think that they are just acting that way and making up conflict. And I think they really are mean and rude and crazy like that. Then they called me naive and said it was all fake.
1	Argh!!! I despise all advertisements and marketing in general!! Don't tell me how to think! I can smell your manipulation miles away sneaky marketers.\n\nHah. I like to be dramatic sometimes, but this isn't far off from my feelings on the matter. Freedom from advertisements was one of the primary reasons I discontinued cable TV service and switched to Netflix over 10 years ago. I have no time for unsolicited advertising interruptions in my life. üòÅ
1	I get angry at all marketing of all types.
1	I get annoyed w 90% of commercials and ads tbh
1	lol same\n\ni get annoyed at commercials in general. i want to explicitly be told how this car performs better than all the others for its pricing. stupid suvs, stopping my global cooling
5	What would you do if you had 100K and only 100 days to live?	...
5	I would take my band. buy a bus and go on a 100 day tour. I would stop in all the cites my family members live in and pick them up and take them with me along the way. We would do as many new things as possible film the whole thing and after I die I would want them to release a documentary about the whole thing
4	Give all the money to family and people in need.  I certainly wouldn't need it on day 101, so no sense trying to waste it doing things I should have been doing beforehand.
3	The most infp thing to do: give all the money to people who need it. 
3	I would spend it all on video games food field trips traveling and maybe give the rest to my sisters or take them with me traveling. \n\nHonestly as much as my heart wants to give it to people who need it - I only have 100 days to live and would love experiences that would nourishment and feed my spirit mental and emotional development. \n\nMy heart cares about others but my heart also wants to be happy and fulfilled. So yeah there you go. 
3	Spend 1K a day.
2	The most infp thing to do: give all the money to people who need it. 
2	A jetpack is like $300,000 last I checked so not that lol. I would take my parents on a 100 day vacation around Europe, dying in the Louvre. Also I would save like $1000 for a sick custom tombstone.
2	I'd give some of the money to my family, some to a good cause. Then i'd use the rest to go travel, drugs and hookers. I'd spend about a month or two traveling to different places i've always wanted to go to. Then live like a high roller, banging hookers and getting high. Then when I get all that out of my system i'd go home and spend the remaining few weeks with my family.
1	Visit family and pay things off for them, fund a small trust for my niece, maybe try to see another country.  
1	Be a decent human being, die slowly and bored and give all the money away, what I'm trying to do currently will take way more than 100 more days to accomplish so I'd have to give it up if i knew i only had 100 days.
1	thats literally nothing to work with.\n\nanyway yeah id donate the lot\n\nprobably to antibiotics research, as its way underfunded
1	I'll probably be a little less stingy on myself.
1	Two chicks at the same time.\n\n\nNo, but really, I'd binge the last few books, movies, and games that I've been putting off, do a tiny bit of traveling with my wife, stuff myself on birria burritos, track down someone who hurt me deeply to give him the single biggest suckerpunch of his life, then...Help set my wife up with plans and the leftover money so she can take some time to herself after I'm gone.
1	How much do y'all like reading comic books?	I've always been interested in comics, although I've seen others attach the interest to functional Se. Thoughts? 
2	dont really like them, ive recently got into anime (dont shit on me) and started reading tokyo ghoul manga idk if thay counts... but i prefer real books
1	Not a big fan, prefer regular books. I just prefer imagining it all
1	I read manga because linear storytelling and dont like comics because repetitive storytelling. The art is much more appealing and genuine in manga, i recommend reading Berserk, Pluto or Monster
1	I enjoy the idea of voraciously devouring a stack of comic books but the event has not actually come to pass. I tend to stick to book books. At least if I don't like the art there it's usually only on the cover.
18	There is something magical in life.	I was at a dead end. I had to prepare for a job interview. I also had to work at my current job. I could handle one of these well. Combined, they became an insurmountable task. I was getting stressed out, anxious, and paranoid.\n\nI decided the job interview was more important. I decided to quit my current job. \n\nI have a Tarot card application on my phone. It lets me choose a card every day for insight. That day, the card was the Queen of Cups, a mermaid holding a cup. \n\nThe description was \n\n>A figure in your life that is nurturing, compassionate, and able to instinctively understand the emotions of others. Because of this, they are usually generous and kind-hearted.\n\nI thought, ‚ÄúBullshit.‚Äù There was no one like that in my life. I went to work and asked to talk to the HR manager.\n\nShe was a very caring person. She listened to me and related to my feelings. She said she knows such a situation can be very stressing and it is understandable that I felt like I could do nothing properly. Then she offered to give me a day off to better prepare for my interview. She told me to forget about this job completely until the interview is done, then to come back to this job with a clean mind.\n\nLast night, I had only three hours of sleep because I hung out with my friends. I get a bit cranky when I don‚Äôt sleep properly. Today‚Äôs card is reversed Six of Swords. \n\n>It is becoming easy for you to become worked up over the smallest reasons. Everything that comes along makes you nervous, sending you into a spiral of negativity. Take a step back and get a clear perspective.\n\nLogical people call this a confirmation bias or superstition. But to me, there is a flow in this world. Sometimes, you can touch it.
6	That's incredible. I used the I Ching in college to declare my freaking major, and it pretty much completely altered my life.\n\nI consider it flow as well. People that are able to think skeptically about divination and serendipity, but not able to look past it, are really missing out on a lot of sweetness in the world.
5	Isn't that awesome!\nI'm glad to see I'm not the only one using divination to soothe my anxiety.\nI consider myself a pretty rational individual from a very rational country. But I've always loved magic, divination and the supernatural. I wouldn't say I believe strongly in any of these things but I like to explore them and if I'm being honest I can be superstitious at times. \n\nI really like runes when it comes to divination.\n\nDo you experience a lot of synchronicities and coincidences?
2	theres a reason that the wise prophet in movies is never wrong\n\nits perspective, and the "logical" people youre thinking of are just the close minded people
1	There is a flow in this world, but you're also just reading vague affirmations of the human condition. Cool if it works for ya, though.
4	Hi fellow INFPs, Made a video on us and LOVE. What do you think?	
11	Realizing I live in reality	I just got back my exam results (equivalent of SATs) and am starting to see what universities I can apply for.\n\nFor once I feel like I cannot live in a dream world anymore where there is an exciting future waiting for me. I have to face the fact that I'm just gonna go to university, get my degree then become a worker like everybody else. Just another nobody. My cousin (another infp) and I were talking, we agreed that we want to live in our imaginary worlds so much that, in comparison, real life becomes meaningless and boring. \n\nTo put it poetically, for once in my life I feel like I'm just side character in my own life story. :(\n\n(sorry for the not so positive post just needed to get it out) 
3	That's just what school is all about. They've succeeded in making you feel like a cog in the machine. Then, corporations and bad bosses keep the tradition alive afterwards.\n\nIt's all an illusion. \n\nAsk yourself this : What changed? Certainly not who you are. Your dreams and convictions are still there. Why would you abandon them all of a sudden? Why do you feel you'll become a nobody? If you think that "what you do" is what "what you are" then sure, everyone is just an accountant, a street sweeper, a lawyer, an engineer, a nobody... But that's not what defines you and you know this.\n\nOr maybe what you plan on studying isn't what you'd like to study. This can also cause a lot of mental dissonance.\n\nIn the end, whatever makes you you is always under your control. And it's unique. You won't be a nobody if you cherish this.
2	yeah... i dont want to die a boring life, i dont want to live a mediocre life just like everyone else. I often think i‚Äôll end up becoming a drug addict because reality isnt enough for me, but i guess im okay with that
2	Honestly I'd rather have a normal enough life hoping for more than reject what I do have. But I very much get where you are coming from
2	Here's the thing... you'll be lucky if that plan goes through, add a partner and that's pretty close to a fantasy from my perspective. It can be seen as average but it really isn't, similar to how snowflakes are different from each other when seen under the magnifying lenses. \n\nI can relate to the idea of making a change and finding your purpose. Perhaps that's only one of the trials that idealists need to face, how to ground ourselves and find peace with what it is. It's not easy and perhaps even soul breaking at times, however I do feel that closing ourselves in the dream world or however else distancing from the reality isn't going to solve anything. \n\nWhat to do? Honestly, just do what you can as much as you're capable of. There are things that you can influence and have control over. 
2	just remember that after every day at work you get to return to your own world
5	INFP Discord for those who just want to vent or have someone to talk to.	
2	Would u mind dming me the link to the server, this one isn't working.
5	Does anyone else feel like they can‚Äôt do the things they want to? I don‚Äôt know why... but I have trouble going out into the world and doing projects I want to do... like photography, for example.	
1	I feel you! Lack of motivation? Kind of having a hard time finding a valid reason for doing the stuff that you "just *like* to do"? \n\nI don't know if this applies, but I watched this today and it was freaking inspiring (it was posted here on r/INFP): https://youtu.be/iCvmsMzlF7o
1	Yeah I had the motivation and courage to pursue my career further. I've been comfortable with the job I have now. Part of me is a little scared of change, and part of me just doesn't want to make a mistake.
1	Thanks all of you. Really. I do feel like I find it pointless to do my hobbies. I know I‚Äôm not like a pro photographer, or pro artist or pro whatever else I wanna do. But I know that I used to enjoy doing these things just to get out and do them. But sometimes it makes me feel lonely or uncomfortable to go out and explore places by myself. But I also never liked to do any artistic tings in front of people, out of fear of judgment even though I knew I was just doing it for\nmy own amusement. I guess I just don‚Äôt know :/ I think I was depressed and now I don‚Äôt know how to get back out there and do things just for fun. I was content to waste away in bed all hours of the day for months....
3	How can I tell if an INFP guy is interested?	I recently rekindled things with an INFP guy from my past. We‚Äôd gone on a few dates years ago and then I ended things with him. \n\nI‚Äôd really liked him, but he was so passive and indecisive that I didn‚Äôt think he was interested. He left all the date planning up to me, every time, and then I wouldn‚Äôt hear from him again for several days after each date. Imagine my surprise when I gently ended things with him and... he burst out crying. Huh?\n\nMore info in a previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/apccjg/i_rejected_him_four_years_ago_help/\n\nI am now about to see him again for the first time in four years, but NOTHING HAS CHANGED. I hardly hear from him. He takes ages to reply to texts. He has ‚Äúno ideas‚Äù for our date and wants me to choose the time and place. Sigh.\n\nIf he were a more assertive type, I‚Äôd assume he just wasn‚Äôt interested. I almost feel like I‚Äôm bothering him by trying to see him (which is exactly how I felt in our past interactions). \n\nDo INFP‚Äôs just hate to do any of the proactive work in dating? Do they want the other person to direct everything?
9	This sounds cheesy and may not be the case for your friend. But when I find a girl I like, I say I don‚Äôt care what we do because I honestly don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just happy to spend time with her. 
7	Yes, unhealthy or immature INFPs are planning SLOTHS. Healthy and mature ones are at least a bit better but still more forgetful/derpy about it at times. Thing is: have you told him how you feel about all this? Sometimes we know we're well aware of our pitfalls but as long as no one brings it up/complains we might think the other side is content. Sometimes we just need others to give us a kickstart in the ass to get moving.
3	To be really honest, I‚Äôve never minded shy guys (I actually really like them) but personally I do feel it should come from both sides. Even if he‚Äôs into you, would you be happy if he remained so indecisive and unclear? \n\nI‚Äôm shy and reserved myself but I have always been quick to answer texts from guys I liked, I didn‚Äôt want to make them feel insecure about my intentions. And even if they were shy, they‚Äôd do the same for me. Without that, you‚Äôre just letting someone guess and that seems hardly fair when it comes to romance imho :). 
3	What did he say when he cried to you? Did he say he like you?\n\nI don't think this is an INFP thing, this guy just doesn't know what he wants or what he is doing. Personally if I liked a girl i'd try to at least contact her, just enough to seem interested. But I also need the girl to show a little interest in me. It shouldn't just be one person doing the initiating. If she shows no interest then i'd take it as a sign that she doesn't like me. If you are doing all the initiating he either doesn't like you or like you enough to do anything about it. And that is someone you don't want to be with regardless of their personality type.
1	Also, I apologize, but is he the same hot guy you just want to sleep with? Because that would make sense as to why you would be confused by his attitude.
1	> Do INFP‚Äôs just hate to do any of the proactive work in dating?\n\nNO!  That has more to do with knowing oneself and being assertive.  If he is immature or just unwilling to better himself, he might just sit around waiting for other people to live his life for him.  Do you really want to waste your time with that?  You saw what he was like four years ago - he is still like that today, which tells you clearly that he is not about to grow out of it.  If he is too indecisive about what to do, he does not know what he wants.  Why pour your energy into someone who can't be buggered to know himself?  People like that also have plenty of good qualities and can be enjoyable and such - but until they decide to start living life, the stagnation you describe will remain.
1	I've been passive my entire life, always going along with what others wanted to do, instead of showing up. One day he'll get sick of it and remember that he's important too and realize that his input matters too.
65	Found this on google image, so I drew it down and gave it to the barista I see every day :>	
9	That is so cute! You‚Äôre awesome :)
2	Aaaaaa this is so cute I caaaan't X) 
2	nice one xoxo
2	This is so cute lol
2	That is SO INFP honestly lol
5	Can collecting many experiences improve your life in general?	I've always felt trapped and alone in life, especially during summer vacations as a kid when my parents wouldn't let me do anything socially. Now that I'm 20, I want to try new things out and find more lifelong friends. I'm considering going to a bunch of local events and seeing what happens. I know I could join some random club at school but none of them interest me and I find singular events exciting (even if it does cost money). What do you guys think? Could I potentially find a meaningful, exciting life doing this? Anyone else try this before and how did it go?
5	That's the thing : you can't know beforehand. I'm no MBTI expert but it's seems to me that, even though INFP are very introspective, they sometimes stay stuck in their own world. \n\nSo what you're doing is very healthy. Do it with an explorer mindset, sometimes it won't work, sometimes it will but you'll learn things everytime. \nKeep an open mind and you'll be OK!
2	I personally believe that it might not be for literally everyone, but for INFPs in general, this is a huge factor in improving quality of life.
1	I too am doing this, though I'm still young and can't drive. \n\nI made a pact with myself to experience as much as I can and well, it's been very fun. I'm more outgoing and now I'm more incline to go out more. Each experience is special and teaches many things if you look deep enough so it never gets too boring. I'm also much more of a risk taker. Not life threatening things but things that would normally cause a lot of anxiety. Like actually being myself, even if it bothers other people. \n\nThat being said, I do still stay in my a lot. Just less so now. 
60	Anybody else want to stop existing sometimes	Like not commit suicide, just not want to live. Just to end painfulness? 
10	yes
11	I wish there was a pause button, I could sleep for a month then... un-pause. Ideal
3	Yes, its the easy way out. But do you do it?
3	All the time. Constantly.
3	Yes. Nothingness sounds peaceful, and what is even the difference between being nothing and being everything?
3	Almost all the time, I imagine a switch and it is gone.  But not killing myself, not right now... that would cause too much hassle for others to deal with
3	If by sometimes you mean all the time, then yes, yes I do
3	>Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)  \nI don't want to die  \nSometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\n&#x200B;
4	I know it‚Äôs cheesy and cliche, but just talk to someone close to you. The words of the people I care about give me joy. Even if I never accomplish anything, knowing that there are people out there who love me just because I‚Äôm me is a truly wonderful feeling. 
2	Yes. I‚Äôve always wanted to take a break from life, not in a dying way, but to just stop existing until I‚Äôm ready to return.
2	yes I think about this a lot. Sometimes I even want a break from breaks (do I make sense?) 
2	Sometimes, I wish I could disappear at certain moments.
2	sometimes, but then i wonder, how are some people happy when im not?\n\nusually the problems me
1	Seems kinda like suicide to me. Yeah, but you never know what your true potential can be if you just end it all.
1	Occasionally.\n\nI confront the fear of my own inadequacy and mortality by constantly striving to improve myself.\n\nI really hope one day I really become someone worth hearing about. It's what helps keep me going.
1	Definitely. I often wanna just find a way to get out of where I live.
1	I wouldn't mind phasing myself out of this reality every once in a while. The thing is I don't know where I would end up and whether I will like that place or not.
1	yes, it happens.  \nsee a therapist if you can.
1	In this [old science fiction book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_World_Out_of_Time), a man time travels to a far future earth to find the planet inhabited by an immortal race of humans who have the wisdom of millenia but childlike bodies. after a few thousand years or so of living in their tribe, some of the immortal children sometimes have a craving to split off from the group and wander the planet alone just to enjoy solitude and be silent with their thoughts. sometimes they return to the group. sometimes they dont. sometimes i wish more than anything that i could do that too.

1	How do tertiary and inferior functions play into your dominant and auxiliary?	So, in my experience, my tertiary and inferior functions are at the core of my being. My tertiary function, Fi, is what dictates my beliefs and values (my principles). These guide where my Ni and Te spend their energy. My inferior function, Se, is basically the ultimate goal of my life. Se is experience, so, knowing my time here is limited, I desire to have a fulfilling, meaningful experience while I'm here. From there, Fi defines what that means and creates my values, e.g. connection, authenticity, freedom, learning, being important, making a difference, making an impact. These are things that add meaning and fulfillment to life. My Ni and Te conspire to achieve those goals.\n\nI was wondering, how does it work for INFPs (and other types for that matter)? How do your Te and Si guide your Ne and Fi?
1	uhhh not everyones functions have the same strength as the stack says they should be\n\nive got my Fi stronger than Fe and Si is my weakest
135	Can I get a hug? Just so tired	
42	Sometimes, all we need is a hug...\nIt's not the "good morning" or "how are you?".\nNot a message, snap or a like.\nA smile, glance or a wink...\nI just really need a hug!\n\nA hug is so rare! The kind that can make you smile. And make you feel safe.

5	What do you love about yourself? (Also, what do you like about INFPs lurkers)	Stealing from a similar post in r/ESFJ. \n\nWe can be incredibly hard on ourselves, especially when going through some tough times. What's something you love about yourself and would never change? Lurkers, what's something you love about INFPs and would never change?
9	I like how weird and quirky I can be and how most of the time, I'm not afraid to be different
8	I like how I can read people and think of/anticipate their feelings. Sometimes others seem so rude but I truly think they don't realize other's feelings.
7	I love that I love learning more about myself if that makes sense. I consider myself self-smart.
5	I love being moved by seemingly simple or everyday things. The ability to see beauty or depth in something most people take for granted or don't notice. 
5	my values maybe
4	I love that I am not making the same choices my mentally ill dad did and am actively trying to be and improve my best for others. I love that I see things differently, as lonesome as it gets. I love that I can give compassion where others give cruelty. I love my ability to create. I love that I have found things to love and keep loving.
2	I love how passionate can I be about some ideas and turning them into reality... and also that when I really want something and focus on something one way or another I have always achieved my goals... except love life... I suck so hard with relationships... but everything else is great :D 
2	Survey on personality and flirting	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	That was fun. I wasn‚Äôt sure if on one of the questions you really meant, ‚Äúgave them a message‚Äù or if it was supposed to be, ‚Äúgave them a massage‚Äù, but either way I had the same answer! 
25	Anyone else feel intense emotion when they see others express the same?	I was watching David Lynch's "The Elephant Man" today, and I wasn't too bothered until one particular scene. The titular character talked to a friend about wishing he could have known his mother, lightly crying during the whole thing. I teared up initially, but as soon as the she started crying in empathy for him, I lost it. It seems like seeing other people react to something sad (or happy, for that matter) amplifies the emotion for me. Anyone else experience this?
3	Ya all the damn time lol. I hate it but I don't 
3	I feel both strong emotions, and a sense of relief when I see others responding strongly to something emotional. I guess because it validates my own emotional responses in a way, and gives me a sense of peace knowing someone responded ‚Äòas they should‚Äô (according to my own moral compass :D). Not entirely sure, have never before considered it. Interesting question. It‚Äôs a happy feeling tho, and that is enough in itself to make me tear up! Haha
2	I feel intense emotion whenever anyone (regardless of it's the person feeling it, or another person reacting to it) has a strong emotion. I usually automatically cry when I see someone else cry (or when animals 'cry'), even if I don't know why they are crying in the first place. This includes sad and happy crying!
17	when a bear drinks beer it becomes unbeerable.	 You‚Äôre just too distant for my arms. Maybe you‚Äôre too far for my hugs. Could my imagination be as long to reach you somewhere and taste you? I don‚Äôt know what I really feel. I wonder what you think about me, if you're cold enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wake up at night and cry fucked up. I'm still afraid of the dark. Gosh i‚Äôd do anything to have some flan now. but I'm very scared that something grabs me from under the bed if I put one foot on the floor. why you far flan?
5	This is a true INFP. So beautiful.
1	Upvoted for the Flan
19	Saying your goals/plans out loud giving you a false sense of accomplishment	Anyone have this thing where they don‚Äôt like saying goals out loud because when you do, you feel like you‚Äôve kind of already accomplished it and you‚Äôre no longer as productive as you should be with it? 
2	Yes, there is actually science behind this, it has to do w some chemical in your brain and stuff. Although it is important to get feedback at some points, depending on what you're doing. So my rule is I don't share something for feedback until I have actually achieved something decent, and don't excessively share for any other reason.
1	That has happened to me. These days I say my goals anyway because I have many people (including the one I want to impress the most) watching me so I have to hold myself accountable to them. 
9	What podcasts are my INFPeers into?	
3	The Tim Ferriss Show - in love with his work in general, mostly human optimization and habits of successful people accompanied with a wide variety of topics, but he really dives nerdily deep into the topics and people he's interviewing, episodes are usually 1-2h long\n\nAlso the School of Greatness and Aubrey Marcus podcast but noone can beat Tim in my humble opinion :)
3	The pro crastinators but im sure other infps probably wont like it if they dont like anime
3	Russell Brand!!!
2	Welcome to Night Vale, for sure.  It's based on a fictitious community, and is super wacky and awesome.
2	WTF, Philosophy of the World, Talkhouse, PBS NewsHour (on Fridays) Droid Life Show, Android Police, CS Joseph
2	The blind boy podcast!!! Really popular Irish podcaster, talks about everything from art history to mental health. Highly recommend!
2	Sam Harris, Joe Rogan, Dan Carlin, Barbell Logic, Human Circus, Philosophize This!...just to name a few
2	Used to love Joe Rogan when I was smoking weed but now I feel I‚Äôm a little bored of Joes views. He‚Äôs a strong headed guy tho. I also enjoy watching the H3 podcast, Ethan and Hila are just pleasant personalities to listen too. I‚Äôll find episodes on other podcasts with specific guests that I like but the H3 podcast is probs my fav rn. 
1	Mysterious Universe, Conan O'Brien needs a friend, Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard, radiolab...

30	This is amazing üòÇ
21	It's been brought to my notice that this pic I found is an altered version of art designed to explain how ADHD works. \n\nLink to original post:\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/danidonovan/status/1073078457830129664\n\nIMO, this isn't exclusive to people with ADHD or to people belonging to a particular MBTI. Its just more relatable to some people than others. In no way is this an attempt to take away the original artist's credit or undermine the struggles faced by people with ADHD. 
40	Do you guys think it's because we think in so much detail and we have a hard time editing before words leave our mouths? I always feel like an ass when I realize other people just don't care about the details like I do lol.\n\nMy friends are pretty blunt about telling me to get to the point. Notoriously bad story teller, never connected it to being INFP.
19	Damn it why is this so true
12	This is how intuitives tell stories. My INFJ and  ENFP friends do that, too. I, an ENFJ, am guilty of it, also.
4	Lol just did this to my wife yesterday after work. Phew good to know its universal.
4	Fuck man, too brutal stop harassing me
3	HEY. CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT. lol\n\nFriends always cut me off before I get to my point though. I think I string together an unexpected number stuff to a listener to make a point.
3	As an Irish person, we're supposed to be good story tellers, but this is me for sure. Haha
3	So me, though usually when I'm in the middle of telling a story I think about how the person who listens probably doesn't care and/or what they might think about it, which distracts me and then I'm lost and wrap it up quickly
3	ENFP here... Think its a common thing b/w xNFPs
2	This describes me perfectly to the very fucking letter... Lol
2	I either do this, or worry about doing this and instead rush so the story makes zero sense and people think I‚Äôm crazy. I end up doing the latter more, usually. :(
2	Aaaaaaaah what a relief, I'm not the only one phew
2	I‚Äôm sorry, do you know me?!
2	Dont even bother anymore
2	I feel attacked 
2	Add an accumulated 10 minutes of stuttering and "uhh"s and you got a good chart for storytelling when inebriated. 
2	Lmao this is basically a roadmap of my brain.
1	Too true. *sadly shakes head*
1	I thought it was only me!
1	Lol this is just metal gear solid games in a nutshell. If you can pull it off, then you‚Äôve struck gold!
1	Wow, hits too close to home.
1	Cant relate, i am always worried i am speaking for too long so my long stories always become real short and i speak too fast so i miss out on details and later regret it.\n
1	I've actually gotten better at not doing this as I've grown older.  As long as I'm not overexcited or in a rush, I tend to choose my words more carefully now.\n\nIt's funny, now when someone else does it, it drives me up the wall (especially when they start referencing people I don't know and will never meet that aren't even part of the story)!  There are two older ladies I know who do this constantly and I just have to grit my teeth through it.  A long monologue is fine if it all fits together, but if you throw in too many details that literally mean nothing to the story or to me, my eyes will start to glass over.
1	OhMahGawd. I relate to this on a spiritual level. 
1	The apology at the end really gets me 
1	everytime my istp friend tells a story i have to interuppt him because he skips details i would have mentioned. so he gets so triggert at me..\n\n haha\n\n&#x200B;
1	In my case, most of the time, I don't think I manage to get to the point. XD
1	That simple, huh. 
1	spot on
1	Why is this SO ACCURATE
1	Same.
1	Can't relate. 
1	Just saw this on INTP reddit
1	This is also an r/adhd mood as wellüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1	I love this! It brings me so much peace and a feeling of acceptance seeing this! I am totally cracking up! I feel I should make this into a business card I hand out to people before talking to them lol!
1	....oh, and I have ADD and am an INFP.....
1	This is so accurate, I didn't know it was an infp trait!
1	This is correct.
1	Okay, that is just way too accurate. 
1	Same here.
1	I relate to this so much üòÜ
1	I'm an entp and it true
1	This is also how I tell a story.  As they are with the normal-person story, both the first and last block of our stories are integral to the storytelling process.
1	for an intp this is very readable (im used to this stuff because thats literally exactly how we think)
1	Checking to see if it's my cake day
1	My personal fiction started as a prompt for a "relay novel" between my friends and I (we each write a page, one after another) which never got past the first page. Since then, I spent a few years building on my entry's characters and their back stories and well as doing research. Now it's scaled to be the lifetime of an entire universe Tolkien style and the original story is just an important part of the larger story. I also want to make side stories to add depth to the 15 or so characters (started with 2 and a monster) I made so far and their relationships with each other. I love it so much.  \n 
1	I never get to speak my mind... People tend to think that I'm rambling when in fact I'm composing a beautiful story based on real life experiences. But I digress... I'm tired man.

1	no im bad at story telling :(\n\ni have the most crazy shit happen to me, accidentally (unknowingly) breaking into camps, injuring back of head after falling 2 meters backwards while drunk trying to climb a fence while running from security, ending up in hospital but escaping out of the window (doc says to cut something out of my head, me thinking they will take my brains), running home in underwear and a bandage arround my head...\nand other stuff.\nwhen i tell it to somebody, its just straight what happened... they are just like ‚Äûwoah thats crazy‚Äú and thats it. instantly talking about a new topic.\n\nand when others tell storys, just normal stuff, how they dropped a toast this morning and had to make a new one, they talk for minutes and everyone goes like ‚ÄûOMFG No WAY!!? dude...‚Äú and so on. make 100 references to his story and talk about it for the whole day..\n\nwhats wrong with my story telling :D

58	Am I the only one?	Have you ever gotten so into a daydream that you forgot it wasn't real, and when you did, it made you really sulky and miserable out of disappointment?
7	Yep, had that moment some times but mostly it was after a (night)dream in the morning. Daydreams don't make me miserable but just make me miss some things that were going on while I was daydreaming.
4	This happens to me pretty frequently actually. 
6	i feel like everyone in this sub is the same person and its insane
4	Every chance I get. 
4	Yeah, happened while I was on vacation hoping for something I realized wasn‚Äôt going to happen. I was so worried I ruined the evening and last day honestly. That and there was an actual sleep dream I had that felt super real and I woke up to my heart pounding I was so excited at just the way it happened in my head, and that it happened at all, and just got hit by ‚Äúoh it was just a dream‚Äù so hard.
3	Not with day dreams, but I frequently have happy dreams that are soul crushing when I wake up and realize it was just a dream. I'd rather just have a nightmare.
3	its sleep dreams for me\n\nlike when my brain just made such a cool looking place and its gone and im like fuck and try to build it in minecraft but realize it wont work because im not sensing and cant organize details
2	No daydreams when I had them always left me happy.
2	I get into that stage everytime I listen to a new piece of music I discovered and am thinking about a scenario that I just invented, together they make for an alternate reality.
2	Yep, tbh it happens almost every I nap or have a good sleep/dream.
2	Jeezus YES. I just daydream all these cool stories and I‚Äôm just so lost in them and planning out all this intricate backstory when oh this character isn‚Äôt ever going to be real... *sigh* ;~;
1	Yes
1	Literally everyday.
1	Not really, reality is just disappointments, in daydreams one can be happy.
2	Im so conflicted	My ex broke up with me a three months ago. I'll remember the day: December 16th, 2018 at around 10:30 pm. She was my first girlfriend. She meant so much to me. We're good friends now and that's alright. I'm over her and I've been trying to get to know some girl I've crushed on since freshmen year (trust me, this isn't a coping mechanism.) But yesterday I was sitting with her in class and I don't know, I wanted so badly to hug her tightly. One last time. I missed those hugs she'd give me. I feel like she threw everything away so easily without thinking of the consequences. But we've talked and she  broke up with me because she was anxious and felt pressured to be in the relationship. Mainly because her older sister, who also goes to the same school as us would talk to her a lot about her and I. Don't get me wrong, her sister supported the relationship wholeheartedly and she was so happy to see everything. I am over it. I just don't get why this went through my head. I didn't give her much mind on other days but yesterday when she sat by me she looked gorgeous. She radiated. This wasn't expected, this came out of nowhere. Another reason why she broke up with me was that she has many complications in her life, the poor girl. Plenty of screwed up things happened to her and it's showing. She didn't want to hurt me or put me through hearing about all the things that happened to her.  She's depressed and doesn't seem okay time to time.  She still talks to me the way we talked when we were together, we laugh, we talk. She still vents to me. Ya know, how we INFPs get it. She trusts me. I hope. She worries for me and she cares about me, she's told me that. I can't help but remember that night at the Halloween lock in: she held me. I held her back. I never knew what love felt like. For once, all in the universe felt right. For two months and four days we were together and by God, it was like we were meant for each other. Like she told me: "it's like you're a clone of me." I remember our first date at the movies. Well my parents knew nothing of it, because it was a school trip to the movies on the weekend. Those were good memories. But I'm over it. I am over it all. This was just yesterday. We all know that we have a sort of insecurity and distrust for tomorrow. I just need to grow some balls and talk to that other girl. I've made a move though, sent her a Valentine's day "secret admirer" note and I think she suspects me. Please pray for me, my dudes.  Thank you for listening for now. I hope I didn't sound like a jerk or anything. I hope I'm not wrong for doing anything. I also want to say that my friends all told me as well as all people who know my ex said that I deserved better and that she wasn't ready for a relationship. I guess that is the case. Like how we all do: I worry for her and everyone around me. Way. Too. Much. 
2	Breakups are tough. It sounds like you're doing ok though, and moving on. She will always hold a special place in your heart and that's how it should be. I think it's good that you still somewhat care for her in your own heart and mind because it's not healthy for anyone to harbor ill feelings towards an ex. It's important to remember the good times you had with her. You should feel proud for how you survived your first real breakup and that you are doing ok now. Kudos to you. Take care. 
11	Train documentaries	I just love watching trains. Or documentaries that show train travel. Any recommendations?
6	This is such a wholesome post inside I'm weeping xD I also want to know what people say because being on a long train journey is one of my favourite things to do.  Only tip I have is typing Orient Express or Royal Orient Express into Youtube and you get videos like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnJ\_1OWWH3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnJ_1OWWH3M) where it shows the passenger's travel experience inside the train.  I don't know if it's the inside or outside you like watching?  But yea, Orient Express is one of my goal holidays one day.

46	Taking every small interaction personally	I think this could be an INFP thing‚ÄîI was crossing the street at a crosswalk, and this asshat comes barreling down the road, honks at me, and speeds off. The interaction was over in 5 seconds, but I felt quite hurt and a bit like crying afterwards. I‚Äôm so sensitive to every unpleasant interaction, I always feel like I‚Äôve done something horrible afterwards! Even if the clerk at the post office is a bit grumpy, I‚Äôll think it must‚Äôve been something I did. Does anyone know some ways to take things less personally? 
16	learn the art of not giving a fuck, its a skill that needs to be trained just like driving a car, IMO
8	I'm like this too, but sometimes I just minimize it and move on. I also think of it this way: I'm not so important that every single thing that I do has an impact, so it can't be all about me. That's just pure narcism. Once I realize that, I cut it out and it helps me forget all about it. \n\nI definitely get where you're coming from though, to think that you're responsible for things, and wanting to fix them up afterwards. 
6	I am the same way to an extent, but I've learned to just shrug it off. In that case it's obviously their fault as pedestrians have the right of way, so thinking in a logical context it wouldn't make sense to be offended by such a thing. It's just something you have to practice and be mindful about.
5	it probably is, as an intp (with a strong Fi) i know both how to empathize AND be an asshole simultaneously\n\nand your reaction is most likely Fi (yes i feel that i usually dont show it though)
4	I use to feel like that, but I realized it not usually my fault so I just brush it off. As the other gent said, master the art of not giving an eff 
4	I'm learning that it's related to self esteem. How to raise that self esteem has been more successful recently. 
5	Shift your perspective. De-center your ego. Feels bad, at first. You might even feel trivial. But I can vouch you gain a clarity that is actually quite liberating.
3	Been prone to that myself. Not a good feeling.\n\nSame with being a little embarrassed or slightly humiliated, it's like the feeling gets amplified in my mind and I feel dreadful for at least an hour afterwards.\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of pain by training yourself to try not to take things personally. Some people react pretty much the same way to everyone in general; even if they didn't it wouldn't be something you should have to beat yourself up over.
3	OMG this is me. I do this all the time. I think it‚Äôs why I have a lot of anxiety of going into the world and interacting with people. When I worked in retail and someone yelled at me because of something I took it so personally and wanted to cry.\n\nALSO on the other hand- iI do something, it probably is intentional and personal toward another person and they don‚Äôt even notice or care lol.  Like I sincerely hope you have a good day. Or if I honk at you, I sincerely hope you can learn to drive better üòÇ

18	Shopping/Out in Public	Okay. So I totally hate being a "regular" somewhere, simply because I don't want to be recognized by employees or at the very least don't want them to acknowledge the fact that I shop at their establishment frequently. It's not because I don't like them or that they're not friendly, it's just that I get embarrassed the "spotlight" being shined on me. If I go somewhere, I try to go once a week if I can help it just because of this, and I skip around so I'm not confined to one spot. It's pretty irrational, but yeah I'd rather deal with it this way than be "singled out". 
9	If you're going out of your way to alter your schedule in order to avoid what you perceive to be uncomfortable interactions while knowing full-well that they are perfectly normal interactions, it's worth considering that this is possibly a manifestation of social anxiety and not simply introversion.
3	I'm the exact same. Even my local corner shop, I refuse to go into it more than once a day, if I've forgot something I'll take the car to another shop. 
2	I like to do the exact opposite specially in food establishments because if I go there more than like 4 times and order the same thing (which I like to do) then I don't have to talk to anyone the next time. They just see me and get me what I always get and that saves a lot of awkwardness from my side. It's always easier for me to buy things in the same places exactly because they'll know who I am already.
1	Same, but at the same time wanting the staff at restaurants to ask "the usual?" so I don't have to talk.
1	omg yes!

18	I've read this poem by Cavafy today. It's sad, beautifull and very INFP.	
6	Perhaps I misinterpreted, but I disagree. As an INFP, the sense of child-like wonder makes any slight change in environment wonderful and thus exploring completely new places so therapeutic it never gets old. I come home invigorated with new ideas and hopeful.\n
3	I like Cavafy's poems, they are dark/sad but kind of inspiring to me. I remember when we did "As much as you can" in literature class. It basically says to (as much as you can) respect yourself and not loose your identity. (Some lines may seem to say "don't socialise" but I think he trully means "don't loose yourself while trying to fit in")

18	Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond, or a small fish in a big pond?	I'm not talking about actual fish. I'm making big decisions in my life and I wanted to ask fellow INFPs what your perspective is on this. This isn't a permanent thing, there is a chance I could eventually move to a different pond so to speak.\n\nTLDR: Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond, or a small fish in a big pond? And what has been your experience with this in your life in which ever context you want to put it?
14	Umm... rather a small fish in a big pond :). I love to learn and discover and be challenged and inspired, even if it‚Äôs scary at times. \n\nBut in a way neither. I am my own fish, regardless of the pond :D.
11	there's so much to explore as a small fish in a big pond, so i guess that one
9	I would rather be a big fish in a small pond. I think anyone would agree with me. It's easier and builds your ego. If you want to actually develop yourself, you have to be a small fish in a big pond, so you can become the big fish. Just taking challenges and going against your instincts would be the context. 
5	small fish in a big pond, so much opportunity
7	No room to grow in a small pond. Stagnant.\n\n I always chose the big  pond. Never stayed small  for very long.  \n\nWent back to visit the small ponds a few times. Meh.
2	I tend to be an invisible fish in a small pond that all the other fish come to for getting things done. 
2	I think it kinda depends on what you're aiming for. Being a big fish in a small pond is nice, but then again, there's only so much space left for you to grow. Meanwhile, being a small fish in a big pond might make you feel quite inadequate because there will always be bigger fishes and thus make you feel like you have to grow into something larger, but perhaps all of that pressure might end up being beneficial for you. Just my two cents :-))
1	If we‚Äôre speaking from a biased point of view and from personal opinion, I‚Äôd rather be a bigger fish in a small pond. As of right now, I‚Äôm considered a small fish in a big pond. \n\nThere‚Äôs ups and downs to either choice, but obviously being a smaller fish would prove to give you obstacles. Being a bigger fish kinda gives you somewhat of a status, but this also varies depending on if it was an achieved or ascribed status. \n\nI guess it all comes down to how you‚Äôre born and what you achieve. 
1	Um I do not understand the metaphor. Please explain to this INTP invader. 
1	I understand people wanting room to grow. But you're also seen as lower quality compared to the big fish. Why would anyone want the small fish when they could have the bigger fish compared to you. This could be damaging to some people and not beneficial.
1	There‚Äôs this part of me that finds the small pond empty and futile - like big deal if I‚Äôm important in a situation that counts for nothing. Small empires seem to be craved by many but seem worthless to me. I‚Äôd rather be nobody in the big open pond, and if I want it enough, work my butt off to become important in that pond because that would signify that I‚Äôd really made it if I can impress over and above all the competition. But yeah that‚Äôs just my take, I ultimately prefer to be invisible in a big pond and live quietly observing the world and quietly helping and loving people from the sidelines. I quitelike being nobody üòÇ

7	Learned new words today: tacit and taciturn. Both refer to lack of words being said. Some of us might be like that, finding meaning without having to hear it first and giving meaning without having to say it first.
2	Is anyone else terrible at drawing? I feel like most INFP‚Äôs are really artistic so I guess I‚Äôm the outlier 
1	Are there any good discord servers or websites where you can find and connect with infp's? 
1	I am bad at it, but I think it‚Äôs something people perfect over years. I think artists would be offended that you think it‚Äôs a natural talent. I recently remembered how badly I loved art class as a child but I never put in the time and effort. 
1	just can't seem to make any real friends in college. I'm progressing but very slowly. I miss my dog back home; it's been too long since I've seen her.
0	My way or the highway	So I started wondering whether it is common for INFPs (or perhaps high Fi-users) to sometimes become really fussy about doing things their way or the "right" way. I never thought I was like this until yesterday when I was playing Scrabble with some family members and turned into a full-blown ISTJ basically, scolding everyone for playing the game entirely wrong, highlighting every little fine print in the rule sheet and feeling very very veeery frustrated (**but they were building the words in a big pile of hot stinking disorganization and confusion without leaving any space in between, making it impossible to create anything good!!**).\n\nThen I thought about my childhood and how I would get irritated by my friends when they didn't play by my rules. A friend would decide that Barbie 1 becomes a mermaid but I had already had a vision about Barbie 1 and Barbie 2 being evil witches, so for having her own mind I would punch my friend in the face. I was a monster. One time I even got annoyed about someone liking hot shower water more than cold shower water and yeah, what the fuck (they were kind of disrespecting my point of view though. Lol notice how I'm still always defending myself).\n\nAnyway, I didn't know I'd be one to obsess over such small things but retrospectively I can see that I in fact do. I no longer punch my friends though, not that I have any of those now, ha ha. (Karma?) I have developed self control now, which is nice. But idk, can any INFPs relate or is it just me and my shameful bad temperament?
2	As an infp I can relate so much. \nI‚Äôd make up these games and if people didn‚Äôt follow my rules I‚Äôd get mad. Idk why I did this considering INFP‚Äôs are not even that strict on policy. Probably more so on our own policies. \n\nIt‚Äôs most definitely an Fi thing, we are imaginative people after all, we have certain visions for things that need to live up to our ideals. At least, that‚Äôs what I think.
2	i'm seeing a (probable) infp and they definitely like to be in control of the broad strokes of the day -- broad enough to cover their entire lack of ability to keep to a schedule XD
16	The Power of Vulnerability (everybody should watch this)	
3	I did take this from the ask Reddit thread about Ted talks, but I honestly think everybody (INFP, specifically) should watch this video.  It can be kind of eye opening for many.
1	I read her book (Daring Greatly) a couple months back. This video is more or less an outline of that so if you liked that I‚Äôd recommend the book. 
1	This was freaking great! So truthful! Thanks for sharing, kind of gave me some hope again. :)
1	This was in our Starbucks training recently üôÇ
6	Absolutely disgusted by algebra but love statistics?	This is my first year in college and enrolling into a statistics class. I thought this was going to be the death of me as an INFP. I've always hated math, or at least I thought I did. Statistics comes naturally to me and I'm extremely surprised as I've failed math classes and I thrive better in the humanities arena. Have any other people had a similar experience or a completely opposite experience? I'm interested at why this might be the case.
8	INFP math major here!\n\nI'm a fan of statistics myself, at least the fundamentals of it. I think I like it because it's very easy to apply to daily life. With algebra (which I also enjoy), one may understand how to manipulate equations and solve for unknowns but finding legitimately interesting ways to apply that knowledge might be difficult without exploring more advanced algebra.
2	[deleted]
2	Personally I'm fascinated with popsci number theory and math and such. Took 2 semesters of calculus in college, but I haven't worked actual problems for years. 
2	Nah, it's the opposite for me. I hate stats but love calculus and algebra. I'm still a humanities major though technically (Archaeology and Linguistics)
2	calculus where my fun is at\n\ni love bending the rules of math to their limit (haha, get it?)
2	I'm the opposite, I did well in all my math classes (whatever was required for engineering majors) except for the two statistics/probability classes I took. It never quite clicked for me. When I say I didn't do well in it, I mean I got an A- or B+ instead of a solid A lol 
1	No, everything has its place. Depending on the work you're trying to do. Can't blame the tools, if the master doesn't know how to use them. 
4	does any of you feel trapped in their timeline too	After months of support and personal development, I've come to a point where I feel satisfied with where I've brought myself, but it's finally like I'm stuck in purgatory bc it's as if all that was happening in my life suddenly got paused. My thoughts are stuck in loops, I have no drive to read/watch things/reach out to others so I can feed my brain with new material, my friends and family have p much gone silent, I just don't know how time is passing. I miss feeling alive and Out There but I don't know what that means anymore. I don't feel depressed, it's more like coming across a ditch in the road when you were least expecting it and now you don't really know what to do about it. I'm bewildered at most, not devastated,which would be more like depression for me. Anyone else feeling this way?? If so, is there any way you've pulled yourself out of this? 
6	I've come to think of myself as a survivor. For better or worse as horrible and petty as the world is, even as friendships drift apart, I'm still out here experiencing things and rebounding and creating artwork.\n\nIt's just so different from the utopian view of the world I thought I was moving towards when I was younger. Where I thought all my friends would never leave me, my parents wouldn't get old and sick, and I would just live in some kind of amazing, artistically and intellectually enriching, pansexual commune.
2	i feel constantly stucked mentally, as if i ve achieved the maximum and i dont need to feed my mind any longer. That sometimes makes me feel as a lifeless drifting soul in the world. \n\nUnfortunately i don't know how to get out yet, i just try to keep focusing on something so i don't lose resolution
2	get drunk on a free night, and keep close track of what crosses your mind. whatever comes is a good starting point
1	Yeah, I am also trapped in this body of homo sapiens.
78	Decided to paint one of my doodles from my art journal. It's a work in progress ..kinda like me ü§ì	
5	Now that‚Äôs some shit
4	 Good work, I envy your art skills! All I‚Äôm good for is looking at art. Like the colors you chose for this work.
3	love it 
3	That's amazing, I'm not good enough to get past the doodle stage, this is brilliant!!
15	When I was a 4 years old, I used think that I had already grown up and the life I'm living right now is a dream I'm seeing in my sleep. As a kept growing, this feeling kept fading and merged with the reality.	 
7	I feel you on that. I know exactly what you mean. 
3	I used to stare out the window in long car rides as a kid, peering out but not physically seeing anything. I would just think of the future, whatever that meant to a young child with no realistic idea of what it entailed. Yet somehow, I *did*. Like I felt how little of the world I understood. \n\nIt was the only time I truly felt small. I‚Äôm only 18 but I miss those moments. They weren‚Äôt very long, but I can never feel that way again. I‚Äôm sure there is so much to learn out there still, that I can‚Äôt even comprehend, but just knowing the fact doesn‚Äôt replicate that feeling. I wonder if I lost my imagination? I hope not, because reality is a bitch.\n\nSorry this post isn‚Äôt exactly what you meant OP, but it made me remember those moments. Thank you.
3	I used to imagine the same thing as a child--but with more anxiety, as if I was flawed for reliving all of this (present) and should hopefully wake up.  
2	That's because this life is a dream, a temporary phase before coming back to our real life.
2	legit one of my biggest fears is that this life is a big dream and that ill wake up and lose everything ive cared about (ill have learned multivariate calculus though, as well as piano and trumpet, so thatll be cool, if they even exist when i wake up)
3	GODZILLA 2 Trailer Holy Shit I'm pumped	
3	Oh man, happy to see another movie buff here! Maybe we should start a favorite movies thread soon.\n\nI'm most pumped for Guillermo Del Toro's version of "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"

0	What does this have to do with INFP?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere are the mods? 
7	Does Weed suppresses anyone's Fi and make them more extroverted?	So I noticed that a little bit of weed for me personally suppresses some of the more stormy parts of my Fi and allows me to be more carefree, spontaneous, easy-going, and overall much more of a jovial person in general.  It feels like rediscovering my Ne again and giving it a little bit of an extroverted charge. Again, the key for me is just a little bit, not too much. My moods aren't as stormy and I found it easier to open up to new individuals. I know weed reacts differently with different people, so I'm wondering that your guy's experience with weed is like in terms of making your more extroverted
7	No. My introversion stays the same but I become anxious (more than usual, rather). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot weed related, and forgive me for veering off topic a bit, but a friend warned me that I should never try psychedelics; I'm too nervy and over-imaginative 
3	Depends on the strain and how much I smoke. If I smoke just a tiny bit of some high quality hybrid it just makes me more relaxed and positive. But it does not make me more outgoing by any means. In fact, I‚Äôd rather avoid meeting new people or running into someone I know because I‚Äôd be too paranoid about how I look and act while high.\n\nI‚Äôve actually stopped smoking for a few months and I find that I‚Äôve become more mentally stable and outgoing. Yes, I‚Äôve had to face some dark thoughts that I ignored before but it‚Äôs a part of spiritual growth anyway. Weed is good when enjoyed responsibly on rare occasions, for me anyway. I still like it better than alcohol, especially edibles, but I don‚Äôt think that INFPs need extra help escaping reality and being less productive üòÑ
2	Not at first, but after I developed a tolerance it made me love talking to people, stranger or friend...
2	works that way for my friend
1	It does to an extent, but my social anxiety is really exacerbated. In situations where I have to meet new or unfamiliar people, I start to build up varying amounts of anxiety.  Apart from that, once I feel comfortable and not as paranoid, self-conscious, etc., I really do sometimes make great observations, analysis, and coming to conclusions.
1	Yes! everyone around me becomes quieter and more chill, while I start to talk more and more out loud, not really looking for their responses. just stuff about my day or what's been on my mind. which I never do really when sober lol
1	It can make you more introverted depending on what kind it is and how much you smoke, \nThere were times it made me so stuck in my own head with anxious thoughts that I just felt glued to a sofa for hours unable to speak a word.
1	Smoking basically enables me to speak period. I can count the number of people I can actually talk to out loud on one hand, but when I smoke everything comes easier. I just...Stop caring and go for it. Makes me ramble sometimes, but my wife seems to love when I go on a tear about the random shit going through my mind instead of me being mostly silent.
551	My extrovert friends trying to get me out of my shell	
20	good thing i dont have friends, i guess
16	No friends no problems üå±
8	That looks like it hurts. 
7	I can feels the cats imaginary bubble of isolation crack, all the beautiful thoughts framed in front of his eyes the book of conundrums in his hand and the warm air inside, all blown away or shattered while he is dragged into a quicksand of eyes, attention and baseless expectation that he would sway to the beats of the herd like a common peasant. It's getting dark, too dark to see....... üò£ and I can already feel them sucking his energy away
6	Haha I'm so thankful for my friend who does this. He's good at knowing when to pull me out or leave me be lol
4	This just sounds like social anxiety, not introversion. Introverts aren‚Äôt devoid of a need for people and social stimulation.
2	Yup
1	Nope nope nope haha
42	I am grieving.	My aunt passed away unexpectedly today at 53 years old. I was the closest with her of all my aunts and uncles, and she to I amongst all her nieces and nephews. Her personality lit up the room. She was goofy, kindhearted, caring, and an overall amazing person. \n\nWhen I was 11 or 12 she gave me a beat up gold ring that scratched my face whenever I rubbed my nose or something. But I still wore it. She told me we‚Äôd get it fixed up. A year or so went on and I asked her about it - she ended up taking a silver ring from her finger and put it on mine. I‚Äôve worn it everyday since. \n\nMy grandma has lost her third child of seven.  My uncle (my late aunt‚Äôs twin brother) passed away a week from Christmas Day in 2006. My aunt passed a few weeks after the 2012 New Year. My grandma is the most resilient human being I have ever known. \n\nI last saw my aunt a few weeks ago. She asked me to pick her up a slurpee and a pack of smokes. I did. She gave me a big hug and a kiss and I went on my way. That‚Äôs the last time I saw her. \n\nI can‚Äôt even look at pictures of her right now because it hurts too much to see her. It doesn‚Äôt feel real. \n\nEvery year on my birthday she‚Äôd call me and cheerfully sing happy birthday to me with my nickname. I won‚Äôt receive that call on Monday. I have a voicemail from my 21st birthday from her. I just played it and I‚Äôm crying all over again. My heart is in shambles.  \n\nIdk I just needed to lament a little bit. \n\nTell your friends and family you love them. Tomorrow truly is promised to no one. \n\nI love all of you. \nThank you for reading. 
6	I don't know what you believe. I don't know what to believe myself. But I do know that when we talk to those we've lost - even if they can't hear us - it keeps part of them alive. Perhaps that's even the most important part of a person - those pieces we leave behind.  The memories and impressions we leave on other people ... our lingering mark on the universe.\n\nKeep talking to her. Maybe she can hear you? But even if she can't, you'll be keeping that love alive. I'm sorry you're hurting. 
4	Thanks for sharing a bit of her with us. She sounded like a fabulous aunt. Hugs. 
5	A big hug for you. At some point it‚Äôll warm your heart to have so many great memories of that lovely person who was in your life for so long, but I know how raw it feels right now. Take your time, and I hope you have people around you with whom you can share how you feel.
2	My birthday is Monday, too.\n\nWhen my maternal grandma died, I was given her watch. I took very good care of it for a good while, but I eventually left it in a bathroom when washing my hands. (I did the same thing to two very important rings as well). While I haven't had it for about 25 years I still think of it sometimes. I even have my own watch now, that the leather broke and the battery recently died.\n\nI think for my birthday, I'll go get the band and battery fixed. Thank you for that, and I am sorry for your loss.
2	My condolences.\n\nI'm not sure how voicemails work, and I'm just generally afraid that you'll somehow lose it. Perhaps you want to record it somehow as an mp3 which you can back up.
1	ok, the fastest step forward without causing more pain is probably to get a friend to help you, then therapy if you still have problems. that aside, stay alive, im sure therell be people who take interest in your personality, and remember; youve still got your life to live, even if you cant live all of it with the people you care and love. ‚ù§
1	She sounds like a wonderful lady. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss! Big hugs.
20	How do you guys handle anger after being scolded/humiliated?	Do you guys lash it out at them or just be silent? Or do you have your own way of handling this problem? I'm always frustrated whenever I'm being scolded by my friend for no reason in front of other people. She always do that because I always said nothing back because I'm trying not to lash my anger out in front of other people. I end up feel inferior sometimes. P/s: sorry if my english is poor.
16	I try to walk away because otherwise I will lash out.
7	So, is that a friend?
7	I'm sorry but no friend should treat you that way.  I have been in similar situations with getting yelled at, and she seems like the type of person that gets a kick out of scolding you in public, and she knows that you won't say nothing back. There's people that are cruel that way and enjoy screaming at shy, mild-mannered people.\n\n&#x200B;
6	I would ask to have a private conversation. This can help you avoid public humiliation and might be easier with less of an audience. You could acknowledge this problem like you did here, asking her why she keeps doing it. But at first you'd have to be sure of whether you play any part in this (you might have done something in the past or kept repeating a mistake that's annoying her. In this case you could ask her to please be patient with you). If you're sure you're just being disrespected then like I said just ask her why she keeps doing that and try to resolve the issue.
5	I know this isn‚Äôt healthy but I get very defensive and usually cry :(
1	sometimes i do get away from it. 
1	My advice is to just lough, always keep a smile on your face - even when sad, angry or offended. After a while the smile will copy (a least some of it) from the face to the hearth. Also the offender will be the one who feels bad, they will see they can't hurth you and eventually stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to cut a long story short smile a them, humiliate them in your head (as we all here know we can do very good) and translate that inner satisfaction to your face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this will help you and excuse my english (not my lingua franca)
1	Most of the time I'm able to keep silent and just stare blankly back at them. Rarely when I can't take it anymore I completely lose myself and I cry uncontrollably.\n\nShe doesn't sound like a true friend that understands you well, maybe talk to her in private?
1	confront your friend 1 on 1, as difficult as it may be. if they cant accept that theyre hurting you, then why are they your friend?\n\ni remain silent when being scolded or humiliated, but my anger is under control because i know deep down that the people who resort to such crude measures without absolute necessity are below me anyway. (i rarely get scolded/humiliated now, but thats just because ive out-assholed all of the assholes when they tried to asshole me)
1	Draw it out. Pull out paper and get all those heavy words on to paper. Maybe, perhaps, that's where they belong. I write them in a way nobody could read or comprehend. I can't even read it and that's my intent because I know that pain will come back with utter voraciousness, worse than before. This doesn't mean I still am torn to shreds in the inside, but I get release my frustration somehow. 
1	Just disconnect one's emotions from outside reality and detach oneself from one's inner emotions, too. One will barely feel anything.
4	Is there any tested method that helps our kind develop consistent habits?	
3	If you're into games, try out the app named Habitica. Pursuing goals and habits gives you xp and cool rewards. It really does work for me! Logging my achievements before sleep has genuinely become the best part of my day! 
2	I don't know if it's tested or not, but having a close friend or family member go along with the habit (for accountability) works for me. Usually one of us can trigger the other to go along to the gym at least a few times a week. \n\nHonestly, there aren't many habits that I really want to have. At least consistently. 
29	I'm pursuing my dreams, even though it's unrealistic in other people's eyes	\- Warning, part of my post deals with some dark, mental health topics. -\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk. Hello!\n\nI just turned 23. After struggling for the past few years with severe depression, anxiety, isolation, alcohol dependence, family issues, financial issues, dropping in and out of college, and a few failed suicide attempts...\n\nI realized that life is too short not to follow my dreams. I have always been creative, wanting to express myself and my life  experiences and make them into a work of art. To not only make myself happy but to also inspire others and lift people up. In the past I had zero self-confidence to pursue it. But after everything that I've been through, I finally feel like I have the courage to do it.\n\nI want to pursue Youtube/Social Media, and make content that is creative, entertaining, but also inspires others to be their authentic selves. I want to work hard at it, and finally move out of this town that I've been stuck in my whole life and go to LA. I want to experiment with different kinds of art, fashion. I want to travel and live life on my own terms. I want to be my own boss. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like a pipe dream. But it is MY dream. And after facing death and looking into it's eyes, and coming back from that on the other side... I'm ready.  Many people (I feel like a lot of INFPs understand) tell me that I need to be practical. Go to school. Get a respectable career. Follow society's checklist of things to do. I have tried that and wanted to rip my hair out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know, I'm rambling haha :) just wanted to express myself to my fellow infps. I want to pursue this while I still have the fire in me.
11	I relate to you a lot on this one, pave your own lane and make your dreams your life.
9	Damn right homie. Go and get it. Fvck the haters. It takes more guts to go against the norm than to follow what is "normal".\n\nBTW if you haven't started YouTube yet, I can give you a few pointers if you're interested. I aint got a huge audience but I have some of the technical aspects down and 2 years of experience under my belt. DM me sometime if you want to have a conversation about it. I won't be much help on the SEO/Marketing side of things though, but if you haven't already found them, there are many helpful YT channels I could recommend for YT tips. Nick Nimmin, Pat Flynn, Video Creators, Video Influencers, and Roberto Blake to name a few.
6	Go for it. What's the worst that could happen? You can go get a boring job whenever. 
5	Follow your dreams! \n\nBut I'm gonna tell you what I told my best (ENFP) friend who has a similar idea. It's great to follow your dreams, but always have some sort of backup plan. If you're currently in school, don't drop out. If you're unemployed, get a job first!  You say you want to be a Youtuber - well, all of the famous YTers worked 9-to-5 jobs until they became famous. You need to pay rent somehow, and you need to have some sort of job experience, because in that sort of business, no one lasts forever, and people 'retire' very young. \n\nI hope I didn't come off as too preachy, I really do wish you all the best! But take the advice that every INFP needs to  hear: don't forget about the reality while you're chasing your dreams, because reality won't forget about you. 
5	Yes! Go for it, I‚Äôm rooting for you üëèüèª
2	Good for you :) I totally understand how you feel, it‚Äôs hard for us who want to pursue a career in the arts because even if you don‚Äôt care what others think you have a voice inside you telling you that it‚Äôs too hard. I also have an ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù dream career and it‚Äôs hard to even know where to start. I hope we all can achieve our dreams. Just try to remember that those jobs exist and *someone* has to do them.
1	Sure, it might be a dumb move, you might be risking a lot, but if you don't see another path, if you truly feel dead otherwise, what's there to lose?\n\nThis INFP youtuber, Lilypichu, is very inspiring to me. And she comes from a harsh background as well.\n\nJohn Green is also INFP, if you're interested. He's primarily a writer, though, but has also been through a lot.\n\nYou INFPs can truly be balls of pure sunshine. I hope the best for you.
1	When you start up your YT channel message me. I'd love to watch.
4	Cycling through relationships	do any of you find yourselves cycling through relationships and hopping between people? If so why does this happen
2	No.  Not at all. I want the person I love to feel safe to ask for anything, because when I feel safe is when I feel loved. I feel hurt if I'm mistrusted. If I'm angry or act out, it never has to do with infidelity. I am not at all that type. I feel jealousy, cry, but I need to be true to my passion in life. I can't be codependent or shower with words, gifts, attention - overdoing anything. It feels manipulative. I can only be available and honest, to love and to leave if asked.  I need to resonate at abundance and peace. I need nature. Going between anything doesn't give me time to resonate from a higher frequency, to give good energy and attract abundance. \n\nMy mentor in Hawaii is a truly well-balanced, humble, kind, attractive person, and she was single for over a year before finding her soul mate.  Being rushed is an illusion. There is enough space in the world for everyone.  
1	Maybe. You‚Äôre probably unsure of what you want. Different companions can lead you on the path of completely different lives.
72	My boyfriend told me my bookmark belonged here.	
5	I HAVE THAT EXACT SAME BOOKMARK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
4	What book is this?
3	Love it
2	Very cool!
2	this subreddit is a very interesting place\n\neverything that is said here just puts a picture of\n\nrainbow
2	I absolutely love it and wish I had one. This brightens my mood in a magical way
2	Are books good because you don‚Äôt see add pop ups?
2	WHY IS LOLITA THE HOME FOR THAT WONDERFUL BOOKMARK??? 
14	A couplet	I came across a couplet in my mother tounge. It hit me hard. I am giving you a rough translation of it:\n\nBeware of defeat in victory,\nHappiness a kind of sorrow itself\n\nThere is no such crown in the world,\nThat has no weight at all.\n\nIt's very apt for us. We value authenticity most and we idealize everything. We may end up being sad even after a success if it is not in line with our values.\n\nWhat do you think?\n
3	The Neverending Story (Book)	I decided to read the original novel that one of my favorite childhood movies is based on (except that Artax scene), and it's eerie how similar I was to Bastian (the main character) when I was a kid, even down to the way of thinking.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Yea same here buddy.  Best movie for infps growing up.
1	Oh my god I looove that movie. Haven't read the book, can you update me on if it's good? 
1	I‚Äôm gonna find it and read it, thanks for the pointer!
34	Reminder for those who need it: Everything's Gonna be OK	It may not seem like it right this second, but it'll all be ok. Breath, and know that everything passes with time. Things have a way of working themselves out, and you're strong enough to get through rough times. Lots of love to you! 
8	Hey, thanks for this! I've been super anxious because I need to have a procedure done in a few days and I've never been put under before. The thought of the anesthesia and losing control just doesn't sit well at all. INFP problem? My anxiety has nearly convinced me that I'm walking into my own death.  
3	Thank you, I needed this today. Hope you're doing well too <3
3	Thanks, I needed this. Still having a hard time getting over my ex (4 months).
2	Just saw this and can‚Äôt tell you how much I needed to hear this. Thank you <3
2	Thank you! I know I'm freaking stupid when it comes to bad times. Over and over again I've found that I made a big thing out of something small. Perspective is everything!
18	hawaiian wedding song- from a 1950s hawaiian music record i found in a goodwill. very peaceful(:	
2	LOVE this! What are the details? I want to see if I can find it anywhere. 
1	If you know the name of this, I'd love to hear it!
10	Evening / night energy levels	Why is my brain and body most energetic in the evening / night? Anyone else experience this? 
9	Yes, probably because it tends to be quieter at night and most ppl are asleep therefore I don't get overstimulated therefore get a large burst of energy
5	Yeah.. In the evening my mind gets more active most of the time, but in a 'relaxed active' kinda way, not in a stressful way. \nPhisically I always get the urge to go for a walk or run. But I have no idea why.. Maybe the calmness of the night? Or the dark? Idk.\n\nAnyway, yea. Relatable. 
3	Yup. It‚Äôs late and I have an 8 am class tomorrow, but I just can‚Äôt stop thinking
3	It's because we feed off people's dreams.
3	I've never known what to make of this because I'm a real morning person too, I wake up fast and easily, adore the sunrise and the crisp air of a new day...\n\nBut after 11pm I'm up for almost *anything*. Bf fell asleep on the couch one night early december, when he woke up at 3 am I had the entire house decorated for christmas.\n\nLuckily I managed to get better with shutting down the sleep-interrupting-anxiety that often comes with it, and like another poster I just really want to go for a wander outside or get some to-do items off the list.
3	I'm always more productive in the afternoon and tend to work until late in the evening.
2	yep, 1am = homework / creative time
2	Yep! For me it‚Äôs because everyone‚Äôs asleep and I can get in my creative zone without interruptions. I do all my writing from about 11pm- 4 am. 
2	my brain literally clouds over from the hours between 1pm-6pm... then at night it breathes a huge sigh of relief and kicks into gear lol. I think it's because of reduced stimulus as well as positive associations to the evening in the past. I used to hate school, and my brain would come alive to hobbies at night.\n\nI genuinely think that is the reason for me haha
1	It‚Äôs 3am, I took a sleeping pill two hours ago. I am so awake at night. I‚Äôve always been like this. Night is my creative time to draw, sew, clean, reorganize, read, write, stretch, and so on. I‚Äôm not sure how I can channel my creative energy into a morning routine so I can get a real job. 
1	I just turned into the skid and landed a night job. Sometimes people will call in "sorry to wake you." Ha, don't you worry.
40	I'm a selfish INFP	I used to come in to work on my days off, hand out money (I gave a complete stranger $300 when she lost everything in a house fire), and a million other little things to make others happy. And do you know what? I never got any decent rewards for helping, and it left me drained. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took me some years, but I realized that I can't set myself on fire to keep others warm, so I decided to become selfish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n"But being selfish is mean!" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't have to be. It doesn't mean you have to dick people over ‚Äì in fact, you can still help others ‚Äì¬†it means that you're putting yourself first, and making sure you're not bleeding before you use your bandages on someone else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt can be a hard lesson, especially for INFPs, but I hope we can all realize this and become happier people. 
12	Baby, I don't want to set the world on fire. I just wanna set a fire in your heart.
11	This sounds like a pretty healthy mindset to me. Good for you. 
9	Yep, same here. My rule of thumb: be kind, help when you can, but always put yourself first. Because no one else will. It's not selfish, it's common sense if you ask me. 
6	Thank you for posting that. I was that person too, spending money on Christmas presents, or on a bunch of souvenirs during a trip like crazy and never got anything back.\n
3	I spent a large part of my life helping other people out, to never get anything back for it.\n\nIf anything, this will cause what I've heard others call "the doorslam", it's made me switch off people, stop friendships and stop many other things.\n\nPlease put yourself first, and while this is my own point of view,  if you don't see your own investment in someone else, paying off. then it's okay to walk. Always help where you can, but don't continue if they don't help you back, life is a two way street
3	One of our weaknesses, according to the 16 Personalities website, is being "too altruistic". Basically, INFPs will see ourselves as selfish bc we want to give so much. We think we're being selfish by doing simple things others consider taking care of yourself. So I don't think you're a selfish INFP, I think you're an enlightened one 
2	Learning to put self-care first was a huge turning point for me. I‚Äôve realized that when I used to be overly ‚Äúgiving‚Äù it was often due to my codependent fear of people disliking me, which is selfish in a different way. Now that I‚Äôm not a doormat, most of my relationships are a lot healthier and more reciprocal. 
1	This makes me question my type.
1	yeah uhhhh\n\nseems pretty infj to me
3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 22	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
7	So last night I was in a discord call with a (online) buddy of mine, we usually just play video games and don't have 'real conversations,' but he's kinda going through a rough time right now.  So I wanted to make sure everything was good with him.  We end up talking and having a one of the most real conversations that I've had in a long time.  \n\nFunnily enough, from the way he was speaking and describing things I had a feeling hes an INFP, so I quickly asked him to take the test on 16personalies.com.  and I know it's not the best way to determine a person's type, but I didn't want to dwell too long on it.  And it turns out he is an INFP, which I think is kinda cool.  A lot of my friends online I've discovered are INFP, and I seem to gravitate towards them.\n\nBut at the end of the call, (we talked until 3am), he said we should have real conversations more often.  And that I remind him of one of his closest friends (that he considers his brother), and I gotta say, that feels so good.  To hear somebody say that they actually want to talk more and that they value your conversations.
3	im not an infp but whatever\n\nhow often do you get those kinds of dreams where youre in the "real" world but somethings not quite right\n\nfor me its the lighting (like in the matrix movies) or in the sky, like how at 5 am the sky is eerily black, or at 4 pm the sky is a monotonous gray, but is darker than usual
1	[deleted]
50	Does anyone ever get so worn out by obligations and people that you just want to cry?	Like you just want to fall apart and hide from the world under the blankets until you're strong again?
21	Yes, I find people's expectations of me to be very suffocating often. I think that's why I often feel so worn out at the end of the day and need to put so much effort into recharging. 
10	God forbid I try\n\nTo do too much (socialize).\n\nI come crashing down.
6	Yeah, I love my family very much and I think I know I'm doing the right thing by sticking around (my dad is very ill). I know I'll regret it if I bail now.\n\nBut I also have moments where it's just like, "wow, why can't I just practice music for 5 hours straight and not have to talk to anybody? Then my real life can begin. This is so unfair."
4	A lot of the time this happens to me, often my housemates wonder why I don't talk to them, or avoid seeing them at all...\n\nIt's not their fault, but I just don't have it in me at the end of the day
5	You described it so perfectly that there's nothing more for me to say.
3	The last few weeks I was wondering why I was so drained. I realised that almost every day, I had things I was committed to like school, work, helping out with party planning, agreeing to go for work out classes, doctor‚Äôs appts, parties, meetings, etc... \n\nI know that it is very normal to do those things. Like no one else would bat an eyelid. Some may even say I‚Äôm being over dramatic but I believe that the reason I was so drained was because between those things I barely had any ‚Äúme time‚Äù. \n\nYesterday was the last straw. So I called in sick today and feel so much more re-charged and being home alone feels amazing. I never actually ever truly believed I was very introverted (just shy and maybe ambiverted) but reflecting back, I definitely belong in this sub, introvertedness and all.
3	Strip your life down into necessities. Does something you do make you generally happy or unhappy? If it makes you unhappy get rid of it. Life's too short to embrace stuff that isn't good. Don't want to go to a gathering and want to stay home and read? Do it. Who cares if it changes your friend group or who counts on you? 
2	Yep. But I have to say this only happens nowadays if I‚Äôve been pushing myself too much for too long. I‚Äôve learnt to schedule in ‚Äòme time‚Äô, setting boundaries, taking my needed solitude and rest without apologizing, and generally regularly checking how I feel and what I want/need. \n\nI‚Äôm great at putting others first, I feel selfish waaaay before I actually am. Understanding that has helped me feel ok when I hit the brakes and take care of myself.
2	I took on way too much this year and I don't want to put my relationships on the backburner because my friends are amazing people ahhh
12	I wrote a poem about Introversion. What do you guys think?	
16	My amazing ENFP friend	I invited a few friends to my house to talk and play some poker and I feel genuine happy againn, we had some great conversation at the my 3 friends left but my other friend stayed for a bit longer, he‚Äôs an ENFP but extremely extrovert, he can be so stupid and outrageous sometimes but now I had such a great conversation, i talked with him about life and about the one girl I like and I could spill out my emotions and thoughts in a long time, I listened a lot to what he had to say and I feel so grateful.\n\nSorry had to post this cause yeah. I‚Äôm pretty absent lately cause of my anxiety which leads to depression a lot and the fact that I‚Äôm INFP doesn‚Äôt make it any better but I worship these moments. These little moments. Everytime I see  a good friend of my it just lights me up. I have 5 good friends and one of them is my best friend cause I‚Äôve known him for 15 years.\n\nOther people easily depress me cause they are so phony and maybe the reason why I enjoy being alone.\n\nSorry for the message, \nHave a nice evening :)\n
5	Yep, my best friend is ENFP too. It's like our types were made to be friends.
2	My two best friends are enfp I love them sooo much. They‚Äôre amazing friends for us :)
2	I'm an infp and I live with my brother who is an enfp. it's nice that we can tell each other everything and really be honest. the xNFP connection is strong
23	Did the test 3-4 times in different periods of my life.	I always was INFP.\n\nIdk who to tell other than y'all guys lol
3	Early 20s I got ENFP, now at 30 it's INFP. Wasn't surprised. I don't know if I'm glad of the change though. 
7	I was infj through high school and when I started college. I took the test again, 4 year since i last did, and I'm infp. A lot has happened. I lost my grandfather, was raped, was in an abusive relationship, until I moved across the country twice, and met my prince charming. I've learned i dont believe there is a god and do believe religion is the best government to control the most people while also being a great way of life for a few, and used weed for the first time. I discovered so many thought processes into psychology, philosophy, existentialism, and human origin and destiny. I learned happiness trumps capability, and happiness is my new life's pursuit.  Edit: my pursuit of happiness is through artistic endeavors and writing, esp. poetry but novels, too. 
2	Same. I think my first test was way more than 10 years ago and I was probably in primary school or something (I'm in college now). I re-did the test today. Always got INFP. I thought I had become somewhat more extroverted in the past few months, but I guess not that much! Love being an INFP, though. :) 
14	INFP anomaly	I‚Äôm an INFP that doesn‚Äôt really like books (more into visual story telling) or art museums. I‚Äôm mainly into music. Anyone else? 
3	Funny you mention it: I have a hard time getting into most fiction unless its short stories or possibly poems. Just hard for me to invest that much time/brainpower. It improves a little with books-on-tape. 
4	Art galleries are literally my favorite places to be on earth and I‚Äôm INFP
3	I‚Äôve never been an avid reader. I do however watch way too much TV. 
3	It's cyclical for me. I like to explore new music but if my life is too hectic and goal-oriented, I think my senses do better with art and writing. Need a certain amount of idleness for good music to creep in.
3	Omg same. I‚Äôm more into music and films. I do love reading scripts though. But music is the one thing that allows my mind to run wild while also staying fully focused. Can‚Äôt get that feeling while reading fiction... I either get bored or I get lost too quickly in the story and start imagining things too different from it.
3	yes. but i don't subscribe to the whole peer group identity thing. do what you want and don't feel you need to belong because you don't need to. you might not even be INFP in the future let alone the next few hours.
2	im the same
2	Yeah I can't for the life of me stay focused while reading fiction, my mind just wanders. Graphic novels might be cool to get into, need those pictures :)
2	My friend is like you. He doesn't read at all unless required.
2	I cannot stand reading, movies and music for life. The other thing that always makes me laugh in the INFP description is being good at learning languages. I failed out of Spanish, dropped German and am currently struggling through Greek haha 
3	Anyone done the questionnaire about what Schemas you have?	Like apparently I don‚Äôt hate socialising because of just being introverted but because of all my other crazy which my psychologist is showing me through schema therapy and understanding the core beliefs I have had playing since I was a child (not good enough, a terrible person, don‚Äôt belong ect) and my coping mechanism is avoidance so when I can‚Äôt avoid somthing as per my preferred coping method it is very taxing emotionally and I‚Äôm so exhausted afterwards. \n\nApparently it‚Äôs somthing that can improve with therapy so I‚Äôm interested to see how things change if at all over the next year or so as I tackle this. 
1	Yes I have done it! And I've also done a little bit of schema therapy 
1	Which schemes did you get on the questionnaire? 
7	Anyone else experience this?	I have had a friend for close to 10 years, she was my closest confident and I trusted her more than anyone. Recently, she told me that we were never actually friends and that it was all fake. She has shown me many ways that she hates since this happened and now won't even talk to me. I fell like I'm missing my other half, and it hurts. \nI have started to feel empty. I don't act the same, I am barely keeping up with enough stuff to survive. I've stopped feeling. I just sit and feel empty. IDK why it hurts so much and I was wondering if any other infp friends have gone through this, how they felt and how to fix the situation or at least fix myself? I know you all have more experience in healing oneself than I do. 
5	I don't know why anyone would carry on a fake friendship for 10 years with enough authenticity to mean that much to you. You're either dealing with an absolutely insane level of personality disorder in this person or they did care for the friendship, but it somehow soured with time.\n\nEither way, you can't blame yourself for believing in it.\n\nI did have a long friendship sour and end very abruptly not long ago. And it did seem to trigger a personality shift. But I wasn't hurting as much as you seem to be, this friend wasn't a very good one, in the end.\n\nWhat got me past it was reaching out to a particular friend and exchanging a series of emails discussing every aspect of it. You can pm me for this if you like, but it would work better with someone who knows you.\n\nBest of luck and try to remember, she's spoiled a lot of joy from your last 10 years, you *must* find a way to stop her from spoiling any more.
2	[deleted]
1	 I‚Äôm so sorry. That is terrible. Remember that you deserve better and that we are here for you. I have not had this happen to me, but I know I would feel just like you do. Honestly whoever did this to you is a total jerk. Let me know if I can do anything to help you.
1	How did you not see that she/he was phony? I can see through fake people real easily and I always avoid them cause they depress me.
1	Friend breakups are really hard. That is very odd her her part. There must be more to that story.\n\nIf she is negative like that, maybe it was a good time to separate anyway because you don‚Äôt want someone toxic like that in your life. You will grow better now
895	Too relatable..	
59	This might be the most relatable image I‚Äôve ever seen
56	That, or you make casual conversation with them and get a little bit crushed internally when they realistically don't immediately become your best friend that you hoped. \n\n(not saying you won't eventually become good friends after a lot of talking and getting to know each other, just that there's no telepathic, soulmate wavelength between you two. And maybe sometimes they drift away or don't have room for another friend in their life and you have to learn to be ok with that and try not to cry for days)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUgh, sometimes I wish it wasn't so much work and time to become close friends with someone you like, lol
34	Friend crushes r more painful than real crushes
22	True. I don't even know how i've got any friends in the first place, it's not like i have that many, but the thing is that sometimes, it just sorta happens and a bond is formed; and suddenly here i am talking and laughing with an unknown person, that later can most likely become a friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the wierd part is that i usually don't start a conversation with anyone (at least i try not to, unless of course, it's necesary) my main problem is that i don't want to bother anyone, because that's what i feel i'm doing by making contact with any person (which i know it isn't so, it's just an stupid idea). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is that i can't seem to remember how i started to get along with someone, because of how i am. it's like my brain does this fast-forward kind of thing to the part when i already made a friend. Does this happen to anyone else??
11	At least I‚Äôll have my crippling fear of rejection to always keep me company üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
7	Hit too close to home
5	This belongs on r/2infp4meirl
7	You just keep thinking that this is the most relatable post, but then other day one more relatable post comes up. 
5	I'll be anyone's friend! Just message me!!! 
6	I cringe at some of the few times I mustered the courage reach out to other artists I admired, it basically came out like PLZZZ BE MY FRIENNNDD
4	Yes!! I understand that I'm part of the problem I'm trying to deal with: I am afraid of interacting with other artists, hiding in my corner looking for fans to attract with my "style" and "skill." Reaching out is so difficult and many of them are too busy developing their craft anyway. I cannot help but lament on what I'm missing so badly and on the uncertainty that this feeling is felt by other artists. 
3	I‚Äôm in awe 
3	One time I was in a train and an artist was sitting in front of me. She took out her new sketchbook and started drawing and it took me, like, 15 minutes to come up with an idea on how to approach her. In the end, I just asked her if it's okay for her to show me the picture she's been drawing. She showed it to me and said it wasn't finished. We didn't really get into a conversation and I've been overthinking on how things could have gone different.
1	Was this planned? It looks as legitimate as it feels, but I am super sentimental about relatable situations.
1	Yesss!!!! But after that initial awkward phase, I think we would sync well. But the thing is I've never went past that phase.
1	Yes.
1	That‚Äôs my old history class lol
1	My life, right here
1	It did turn out well...shame that it's ONLY in MY HEAD
1	2 relatable 4 me
1	Get rid of the artists and people with similar interests and that's probably me.
1	just because I want to see the best in others and see the best in others doesn't mean I am seeing correctly. \n\nGiven human custom to disregard sentience, for instance in not caring about loss of millions of farmed animals' lives in disaster areas, if a relationship with a new person does not present an obvious advantage it would seem to be  a disadvantage.\n\nSo while some people may be cool and share some similar interests improving your relationship with them may not necessarily be an advantage for them...\n\nunfortunately, inclusion by community is not necessarily a high priority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nit can be interesting how the dynamics work... how can we be so clueless, or lack the words and frame of reference to understand fundamental elements of social situations and dynamics.... widespread mental illness gets neglects for lack of popular expression and vocab... etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\na few celebs get worshiped while much of the world gets neglected... cult of personality is very much alive...
1	I reached out to one. Best decision of my life.

8	LAST POST REGARDING THE INFP	Okay; this is the 3rd (and hopefully) last post about an INFP I'm (16M ENFP) interested in. Here are the other 2 posts (if ur interested): [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/akuorw/tips_to_get_close_to_an_infp/) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/aqrv8k/help_with_an_infp/). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what happened so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've begun falling for an INFP (16F). We've been friends for roughly 3 months rn, and I adore her. She's the nicest human I've ever met (no joking, me and one of our mutual friends joke around saying shes an angel). Im still unsure if she feels the same for me. We've know each other for 3 months and share music and comics a lot. She sometimes stares at me and we both often smile and wave at each other. But I didnt wanna scare her off\n\nI originally asked around this subreddit for advice, and the overwhelming response was; ur as ready as you'll ever be, just go and ask\n\n.\n\n(19/02/19) So a few days later (hey! guy needs to muster some courage!). I met her on the pretext of giving her the 'song sheet' (We usually share music and song names on pieces of paper, christened the 'song sheet'). Was supposed to confess to her face to face, and the direction of the conversation was going in the right direction... until her friends showed up and didnt leave :/ (Honestly, they REALLY dont get the message when you try and tell 'em to leave via glaring at them). Didnt want to make a scene in front of 'em (she hates that kinda shit) so I just backed away.\n\nThere was a saving grace tho; in the song sheet I wrote a lil poem in a code which we both know (Originally she was supposed to read it AFTER the confession, but to hell with that i guess.) It wasnt terribly original (Sarcasm 100), and certainly not my best work, but here it goes:\n\n>Roses are red,  \nViolets are blue.  \nIf I wasn't obvious enough:  \nI like you.\n\nAfter this I decided I'd confess to her, face-to-face, the first time I had a chance tomorrow. I didnt even know if she'd actually read the poem; we had a test the next day and I was sure she had better stuff to do than decode a cryptic poem.\n\n.\n\n(20/02/19) First met her during the small recess we had. Nothing was outta the blue, no red flags. She was with a friend, but smiles the moment we see each other. We talk a bit abt the test we had, and then ask her if we could meet up in the library at lunch. She readily agreed (to my surprise), but unfortunatly a teacher called us; she had something to discuss.\n\nTurns out we have a program to be scheduled on March 1st, and she wanted us, and a bunch of others to organize it, so we met up in the afternoon with the others. It was bog standard, but she kept glancing at me (idk if thats my imagination or not). At the end, and she approaches me. Turns out, she did read the poem. She didnt seem pissed or freaked out; she seemed more flattered than anything. We talked a bit more, she says dosnt know what to do, and then we leave (more detailed update on that day [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/aqrv8k/help_with_an_infp/))\n\n.\n\n(21/02/19) We couldnt really meet each other for most of the whole day; I had a bunch of exams and we both were busy organizing the whole thing. We did meet in the evening tho, albeit for a short while. She says she didnt know what she felt and thus we agreed to stay friends till then. She kept asking me "what did i expect from this?" (not in a condescending manner, she seemed shy and if my biased views to be trusted; she blushed). And what i told her was the truth "idk cuz honestly, my brain didnt think we'd get this far and is like "Now what?" ".\n\n.\n\nSo, now that we're all caught up, I ask ye: what do I do? Like I know what I want; I want to be in a relationship with her (Disclaimer: Not the stereotypical kind; my idea of a relationship is more intellectual, but Id take 2000 more words just to explain that), but how do I tell her that without making it sound like she has an obligation or something? I dont want to put her into an uncomfortable spot.
5	She already knows you dig her. Ask her on a date and full send your thoughts and ask her about hers. Good luck my man 
5	High school romance. Something I never had when I was a teenager.
55	Do you give off a serious, unemotional, and/or "robotic" vibe?	It seems that way for me on the outside, but I have a rich, vivid emotional world inside.  One person even asked half-jokingly: "did you ever cry at all?"...if only they knew my inner world
20	Yes.  I guess I just don't express my feelings.  I've been called a robot in the past...but I'm a writer, a poet, and a deep "feeler."  I guess none of that comes across, or I hide it.\n\nThe ironic thing is that when that person called me a robot, it hurt my feelings deeply and I almost cried on the spot.
11	Yep. Combined with resting bitch face. A lot of people tell me that they thought I hated them at first.
7	Yep. It's fun to say off the wall and creepy things to see how people react. 
7	That's a hard oof from me dawg.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho else here tends to almost soley provide emotional support to others but when pressed for details on your emotional state you provide them with a blank stare and some lint?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe amount of insight into my emotional state that I've provided friends and family over the past year is less than what some people provide in an hour.
6	[deleted]
6	Yep, a lot. I know for a fact that many INFPs are confused with INTPs at first glance.
3	Good people who I‚Äôve become friends with due to mutual interests, common values, and closer to my mbti type have said they got a good vibe from me when first meeting and wanted to pursue a friendship. Others such as work colleagues who are on another level and completely different mbti types have told me I seem autistic due to my monotone voice and lack of expression, I know I‚Äôm very apathetic but could be slightly autistic too. I don‚Äôt believe thats the case though, I just don‚Äôt have much interest in mundane topics like celebrities and Instagram ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù which is a ridiculously common topic in the office i work at, I think most people just really don‚Äôt ‚Äúget us‚Äù
2	yeah get that alot but i think its due to my schizoid personality disorder 
2	I used to be appear more robotic before I got on antidepressants. Now, I can go from stoic expression to laughing like a maniac under 5 seconds, but it depends on the situation that is being presented at the moment.
2	Serious, arrogant, mysterious, impossible to read. I got those a lot when I was younger. Esp arrogant always cracked me up and wounded me at the same time, I was perfectly aware of all my insecurities and lack of self esteem. And if someone bothered to ask, I‚Äôd usually give a sincere and open answer. I didn‚Äôt feel like an enigma.\n\nNowadays people describe me as warm, kind, considerate and outgoing. When I say I‚Äôm an introvert these days people think I‚Äôm joking. It simply makes social interaction easier, and I‚Äôm less reserved and shy about sharing who I am within. \n\nIn that sense it all seems a bit like a trick. And in the end most people still don‚Äôt bother with what‚Äôs underneath. That‚Äôs fine tho, I have a few who do and I love figuring it out in others :). A lot of me still flies under the radar. Which is kind of peaceful, even if a bit lonely at times.
2	Work people and acquaintances likely find me remote and dry witted. I definitely chat a little but tend to stay on the fringe more often than not.\n\nI know some people like my family see me as...dour and self-serious? It brings out a teasing side I don't enjoy, I think I must have repressed a lot of my emotional reactions growing up with them.\n\nBut my closest friends know me as someone more vibrant and remarkable than I'd have ever dreamed. My boyfriend told me he most associates me with joy and wonder which is so lovely I could cry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for emotions and all that - I've never had a hard time crying over just about everything but mostly only a few people get to be in on that. I joke a lot and like to make just about everyone laugh.\n\nBut rage and frustration just gets pushed down to build up. Reacting to something with anger feels like being naked. I'll go to every length to avoid whatever is causing it. The really twisted part is that I only know how to be recognizably mad at people I'm most comfortable with because I'm not afraid to be that kind of naked with them and am motivated not to go the avoidance route. 
2	Oh absolutely. I've been told so many times that I'm cold or that it looks like I'm going to murder someone. I might if they keep telling me that. I'm kidding. Or maybe not. I'm kidding.\nAnyway, those who go past that usually realize that I open up a little more after a while and that it's just a facade. 
2	I feel I am much more cold, shallow, stupid, and loud than people think. In a way, it must be nice to give the impression you're a robot. You get to surprise people with a depth of feeling and a poet's heart.
1	I have had people telling me that I seem intense and serious. But that was rather a more professional setting. Not sure why that should be a problem. \n\nBut my friends from college have told me that I‚Äôm an intense person. I perceive myself as trying to figure life out and passionate/serious about what I pursue, etc. although I have chilled out more though, or at least I hope. 
1	i give off a pothead vibe, so I've been told.
1	A lot of people think I'm logical, but I'm pretty sure that's just a facade that I put up, I don't really give thought to other people's feelings if they were originally complaining about their situation, I don't care about your life if you complain often.\n\nbut if you come to me one on one and just casually talk about it, I will be more empathic about it.\n\nI most certainly have feelings but I often feel that people aren't on a strong enough emotional "level" for me to talk about it with them, and as such, I only tell my most trusted friends about my true feelings and thoughts, for fear that the trust will be betrayed if I don't have enough of that emotional "level"
1	Yes! According to Socionics, introverted thinking is the function INFPs use as a mask to interact with the world. This is why we seem a lot like INTPs especially to people who don't know us well
1	Yes, but not so much for closer friends. An exception was when I went to a concert with some closer friends and they asked me if I was really enjoying it because I wasn't really moving to the music but in fact I was crying for some parts of it 
11	The summer haze, beach balls, bouncy puppies, melting ice pops, sandal slaps, damp towels, moist decks, sweltering sands, bucket castles, tan babes, megaphone birds, roller coaster lines, chilli cheese fries, hookah nights, 4 head cyphs, and the classic nathan's hotdogs! Oh how I miss summer!	
1	A sense of wonder. Contemplation on Infinity, Eclecticism and Self-realization.	This is a short animation of a casual conversation between two friends where both get a moment of rapture. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Dd55N\_mg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Dd55N_mg0)
4	I got some awesome responses when I last posted... here is a funny video I (INFP) made with my friend (ENFP), hope you like it! :)	
0	This was great! 
31	I love this place.	I used to be a depressed, shut-in teenager. Online communities once made up all of my socializing. Then I got better. Online communities lost their charm. I started hating them because they reminded me of my dark days.\n\nNow I see clear. Online communities have their virtues. In real life, it is not possible for like-minded people to share their minds in this way.\n\nThe Internet shouldn‚Äôt be all of your interaction with humans but it is beautiful that we will always have a place like this. It feels like a secret shelter. \n\nLet‚Äôs be excellent to each other.
4	Well said :)
4	Anyone else have friends/family who are surprised that you are INFP?	Whenever I mention to folks who know about the MBTI that I am INFP, they are always so surprised. I come off as quite friendly and extroverted when you meet me; I have no trouble public speaking in front of large crowds (I'm talking 6,000+ audience) or making conversation; I'm charismatic; and I have held a lot of leadership positions where I managed teams of people in my undergrad & professional career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I see it is this: making friends isn't hard for me -- but I just don't particularly have an interest in doing it that much. *Especially* if it's a situation where there are 10+ people in a room. Give me 2 people to have a solid and meaningful conversation with and I'm completely extroverted and engaged in the convo.... But if you put any more than 4 people, I freeze up and pretty much don't talk for the rest of the night. I enjoy going to parties on occasion but if had the choice to be alone, I'd gladly do that instead. I can have a good time at the pub with friends but the best part of my night (or at least, the part I look forward to) is walking home alone, listening to music and jamming with myself. I enjoy spending time with my friends and I'll entertain what they have to say or the dumb jokes they make, but I'm mostly very introspective and think very deeply and intensely about life when I'm alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm asking because I see a lot of posts about INFPs being really shy and needing to be coerced into meeting others/having a good time/letting loose. I'm wondering if there are any INFPs on this forum who don't really fit into that category and their friends have reacted with surprise that you are INFP?
2	My mom is a true believer that I am an extrovert. I think it's a common misunderstanding among people around me, actually. I'm great at presentations, I like to perform (not alone but as a group), I don't mind speaking up in class, and I'm great with meeting new people (those who I'm probably never going to see again). But. I hate small talk and group chats - both online and offline. I just can't handle multiple ideas and jokes flying around! I get really lost, especially in group convos. And I desperately need time to recharge after whenever I've met anyone who's not me. So people mistaken me as an extrovert until they see me in a group of other people. Then they go, "Ohhhh you are an introvert". 
1	Yeah haha, my mom said I should retake the test because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt see it‚Äù then after I did she just went ‚Äúhmmm‚Äù 
15	I want to take a bath in lotion. Just a big fuckin tub full of lotion heated to an acceptable temperature. That‚Äôs all.	
4	sounds nice 
5	When will you do it?
1	It puts the lotion on it's skin..
1	http://www.bulkskincare.com has lotion for $26 a gallon. Or get bulk mineral oil ( 12-15$ a gallon) and mix it about 5 parts water to 4 parts oil, with some surfactant (maybe 5$ for a gallon). Assuming you can get it mixed, you're talking about 300$. That still sounds high. 
29	The only place i can feel to fit in is here in this group ‚ù§ Thank you!	
10	Im loosing my patience and my interest in people. (I wasnt like this before)	Since the beggining of the new year i noticed that i keep loosing my need to meet people, and human contact in general. I have never been a very outgoing person, but i liked to hang out with my friends, and liked people in general.\n\nNow if someone speaks unnecessarily, i try to escape the situation as fast as i can, cause i feel like this meaningless shit is eating me alive.\n\nToday i sent best friend home from my house. (He always spoke a lot, and always been in my ass - he wants to meet at least 2-3 times a week - but now i just cant take it. You cant have a menaingful coversation if you meet avary fucking minute so mostly he speaks and i try to listen)\n\nThan my gradparents came, and they kept asking me to tell them whats going on with me. I almost lost my shit. I go to work, come home, and sleep. Thats whats up. What should i tell them? Im a smalltalk master really, but with people on the street it is just a few minutes, than i dissapear, but with my loved ones I just cant get involved in smalltalk anymore. They get angry or upset if i leave the coversation. (I just realized how much a smalltalk it is what we try to call meaningfull coversation)\n\nI need a cabin in a small town near the see, with no tourists, locals only, a fishing boat and thats all. Id fish and write my music all day. Would never return.\n\nSorry for the spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.
5	Hey bro, I think you just need to recharge yourself. A quick trip to the beach or the mountains probably will help you :D
2	Im almost the same way. Sometimes I just cant continuously talk/actively listen to close ones and I would feel annoyed/exhausted if I try to force myself, even to loved ones. I find it easier to be in a group of friends/family so they could talk amongst each other and have alot of the social burden lifted off of me. \n\nI would also have moments where I could not stand people talking to me whatsoever, and go into my "hermit" mode where I dont talk to anyone unless absolutely necessary. It usually subsides after a few weeks, and I feel energized to socialize again. Just take some time to yourself and charge your batteries!
1	holy shit this is me, and only since a couple of months just like you. Lately, even talking to people online or text is boring to me now, I'm just sick of people and their lives. 
1	Yup. Same here. I'm realizing more and more that I don't want to be around people. I work full time, but outside of that- it's all me time. And it's beautiful :)
9	Dealing with emotions? I can't be the only one who'll think about things so much it ruins my day. Or showing too much emotion towards someone who needs space?	So I rambled a bit yesterday or the day before, I dunno, days just kinda blend together. But I suppose what I really wanted to know is how you guys deal with this kind of stuff. I don't do it super often but there's times where I'll just assume the worst, like in my previous post that I was boring and not entertaining on this vacation and it'd feel like the other person had wasted their time spending it with me. Like I care about her a lot, I'd say my feelings are definitely far past just *liking* the person and could be bordering on another L word but I'm still unsure. Not that it really matters, she knows how I feel and that while I'd be thrilled if something happened she's been a great friend and has helped me deal with a lot of things since we've met, and it's funny because one of my other friends said "I like her cause she's made you a better person." Anyway that's not even kind of the point I don't think. I just know I worry so much about actually talking to them about things that bother me or why I assumed that because I don't want them to be upset. So what do you guys do about this, do you go distract yourself with something? Do you have some specific thing you do to clear your head? What about if you can't and it gets to you while you're at work or something and can't really get away to find some place to clear your head?\n\nThe second part I guess is, I think I'm either not emotional or too emotional, there doesn't really seem to be an inbetween. I come off as an asshole or as someone who'll do anything for you and in all honesty I like I think it's mostly the former but I'm certain it's probably more the second. I think one of the first things she told me was I sounded just like a big teddy bear, or one of those caramel M&Ms, hard on the outside but gooey on the inside and I think that fits. But I have trouble giving space, because I worry a lot and when I care about someone knowing they hurt feels awful and I end up repeating myself saying I'm there or whatever if things are needed at all. So, I guess it kinda ties back into the first thing and how do you keep your thoughts from running away with you? \n\nAlthough, it could just be worrying that things are being kept and pent up because I don't know how to deal with them myself very well and figure an outlet for them would be good or maybe that's dumb. I dunno. If any of you lovely people have any words of wisdom I'd love to hear them because I'm worried I'll just keep doing this same dumb stuff and push this person I care so much about away entirely.
2	i can't offer you any advice but i saw no one replied and i felt bad. so just wanted to say i read your post and i can relate very strongly. i hope things get better for you soon.
54	Happiness = Twosome	When alone (1): üò¥üôÑüôÅ\nIn a group (3+): ü§êüòíüò§\nWith someone (2): üòÄü§óüòá\n\nIf there's one thing I've understood as a 26yo INFP male, it's this - nothing makes my mind more relaxed as being in a "twosome" (1+1=2).\n\nIt can be me and my parent, friend, teacher, colleague etc. as long as he/she is the only one.\nOnce there's a 3rd party (2+X=group), it gets competitive and the conversations are no longer deep. It's like everyone suddenly has a social mask on.\n\nWhen I understood this, I began looking for such opportunities everywhere. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\n- instead of going to a crowded gym, I invite a friend for a 10km walk;\n- instead of asking questions during a lecture, I schedule a private meeting with the professor;\n- instead of joining the team at work, I look for a colleague who's usually eating lunch alone and ask if I can join him/her today.\n\nIt works like a charm. It's better than games, food, books, movies, alcohol or any other eacapism substance/method. \n\nThere's only one thing to remember - ask & listen more than talk.\n\nYou'll be surprised how many people crave someone who's willing to listen to their thoughts and stories. If you do so, you'll make the day better for someone else and, as a result, you'll feel meaningful (translation for INFPs: happy).\n\nIn short, I truly believe "a twosome a day keeps the sadness away". Maybe you should give it a try too üôÇ
8	I also love the opportunity for deep, meaningful conversation 1 on 1. \n\nBut, I hate being trapped with a person I didn‚Äôt choose. Which seems to happen to me regularly. 
3	Nah. I agree but the ‚Äútwosome‚Äù for me also includes three and foursome ü§™. When it gets bigger than a small group it I have the same as you\nBut with 2/3 friends I can also have meaningful conversations etc
3	Honestly, yes. I really like just 1-on-1 socialization. It's the easiest for me to do, and the most rewarding, imo.
2	This is pretty accurate to what I do subconsciously - especially the work lunches. I can remember being as young as 10 and hating having a third friend invited for playdates because it always made me jealous that they seemed to like each other more when really I was just losing the thread of conversation on that level. \n\nThat said I think we infp's have great capacity to work well in small groups of people with connection and/or shared interest but...maybe not to that same level of relaxed-mind as in a good duo. \n\nAnd just thinking back now to some of the better two-person hang outs I've had recently .. those turned into really great, energetic days :O I cleaned, answered texts, and was generally a more functional-than-usual kind of human.  \n\nGreat post, I'm going to make more of a point of this now. 
1	So true. 
1	out of interest, are there any personality types you feel you particulary bond well with in a twosome? if not, then intro/extrovert preference?
7	DAE find it difficult to downvote?	I notice that whenever I go to downvote poor content, I immediately scroll down for about 2 seconds before rushing to scroll back up and un-downvote. I justify to myself that they won't get my upvote for their content, but I can't feel comfortable with leaving my downvote there.\n\nI often imagine them being someone I know, who might not be internet savvy and may not know it's a repost, and I imagine them excited to share with other people - I often imagine them as my Dad or something, and feel guilty about making them feel negative about sharing.\n\nAnyone else?
5	I almost always post earnestly, and get hurt when downvoted especially when there's no explanation, so I never downvote.
3	I only downvote when someone is terrible. Like if they‚Äôre racist or rude. So in that case, I don‚Äôt feel bad, they know what they did. 
1	A lot of them are bots.
0	no I'm a reddit user, it's in my DNA to downvote for no reason and with little care how the original poster might feel!
110	Man, this resonates.	
3	Yesssss!
2	I should be good at that then
2	Persona.
5	Just got rejected	My first time to ask a girl, my first rejection.\n\nIt was polite, civil, and calm. But still painful and hard.\n\nShe's a coworker, I want to move my desk for a while so that I don't see her and get feelings again.
15	Bro you should be proud of yourself, you had the guts and the bravery to ask her; now your mind is in peace.
3	It doesn‚Äôt have to be awkward. Be proud of yourself! You actually said something, and that‚Äôs a good thing!! 
3	Relish in the negative. 
3	You now know that you will be okay after rejection. So you will have more confidence in the future. Good luck. :)\n
2	 Awesome job finding the courage to do that. I‚Äôm sure you will feel better about the rejection soon. You‚Äôre a champion just for trying. 
2	Proud of you for sending it. But the meme is real, sometimes it be like that. 
2	I'm proud of you, you had the guts to find out. I have no worries for your future, you can take risks when it's worth it and somehow it will pay off, don't ever blame yourself for "failing". High five !
1	It's fine. In fact, I've been to the same situation. I've been hurting for months (probably until now). I've realized when she turned me down, I already lost the idea of us and then things get slowly back to normal. She even uses the situation that she knew that someone can support her emotionally and now I'm giving advices to her like nothing happened. 
151	I had a Viking burial for this little bumble bee I named Boderik, it was a majestic farewell üåªüêù

1	Its not in the water tho
7	I am thinking of sending this message to my best friend who is upset at me but I‚Äôm not sure if I come off crazy	Please give me your honest thoughts. Is this too long winded and intense? My best friend is upset at me due to complicate reasons. We were long distance but had somewhat of an intimate component to our ‚Äòfriendship‚Äô that felt romantic at times. However my main motive is just for him to feel comfortable being my best friend again because he truly was mine. \n\nAlso if it helps, I think he is an ENTJ.\n\nThe message is as follows:\n\nNo matter how physically far you were, you always felt so close. Human emotions are volatile, but human bonds are hard to break. We are more than our emotional reactions. I don‚Äôt want to lose something I know is real to such fleeting forces. \n\nI know I hurt you and it has become ingrained in my soul‚Äôs purpose never to hurt you again, nor to expend energy on those who don‚Äôt deserve it. I‚Äôm hurting because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve lost my best friend. Lately I‚Äôve been looking at the bigger picture. We are so much more than two physical bodies, a brief fling, or a complicated friendship. We are souls that are here to learn from each other, grow, and heal the world through our inner healing. We have both helped each other in different ways and I know we can continue being that for each other despite this hiccup. I know this isn‚Äôt a comfortable discussion but no growth can occur from a place of comfort. We can get past this. I just need you to believe in me like I believe in us. 
6	Lol this sounds exactly like something I would write. I say send it! Don‚Äôt hide how you genuinely feel. I know I‚Äôve made that mistake before. I used to be afraid of coming off too intense, but then I realized, where‚Äôs the shame in feeling so deeply? :) You got this.
6	It's beautiful. If he loves you for your true self he won't read it as crazy or dramatic. Send it.
4	Trying to figure out a career I would like.	Hi, I'm and INFP and kinda just stuck right now in life. Everyone's like "ohhhhh, you'll be fine, you have plenty of time to decide your career" but I don't really want to have to wait any longer. I wanna figure it out. Therefore, I am enlisting you guys to help me out. I'm not really artsy like most INFP's and can't sing, draw, or play instruments. I like playing video games, animals, and baking. Strangely enough, I love working with a small amount of co-workers that I'm close enough to be social too. I've always wanted to help people, although sometimes I see people being mean to each other and all the hate in the world and I kinda wonder if I can even do anything. I'm kinda worn out of helping people lately though, because I usually get used, drained, or something goes wrong. I keep looking at all these jobs and nothing catches my attention. I used to want to join the military and work my way towards being an 18 delta but I'm just too sensitive and not "together" enough for that. I miss knowing what to do, and having a purpose though. Right now I just feel almost empty inside. In conclusion, what do you guys think I would like, what do you guys do that you like, and do you guys have any advice. Thanks a lot! All advice welcome!
3	Nobody can tell you what to like. \n\nDo what you‚Äôre interested in. Get good at what you‚Äôre doing. If you don‚Äôt see it working out for you in the future, then pursue another interest and repeat. Choosing one career path is not necessarily a must. \n\nI‚Äôve been an audio engineer, videographer, photographer, coffee roaster and now pursuing a degree in psychology and teaching myself programming.  I‚Äôm Literally jumping around all over the board. But I‚Äôm following my interest and allowing it to take me to wherever it takes me. \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: I also wanted to join the military but I knew I would be too rebellious to survive in that environment. 
2	Why not work in a bakery? Usually small # of employees, helping people by bringing the temporary joy of eating desserts to every customer changing their day from bad to good, and you already enjoy it.
1	Take a holland career code test. You'll get a 3 letter code with applicable jobs :)
2	School Never Ceases to Kill my Productivity (somewhat of a rant)	Even just doing 2 college courses currently and that's it... Whenever I have to do school work it drains my energy way faster than working on my own projects. 4 hours of school work in a day will leave me with no energy and no motivation while when I work on things I actually care about and WANT to do I can go for 10+ hours a day no problem. (At least I have my bff named caffiene LMAO) My issue is since I am only doing 2 classes at a time it'll take me 2ish more years to graduate. If i did full time I could make it out in 1. But to do that, I would have to give up on every dream I've been working toward making reality, but fvck that I'd rather go through 2 years of something I hate and that absolutely drains me and be able to somewhat keep working towards my dreams than give up everything I am to be able to get a piece of paper in one year. Not gonna give up or give in for anything time to fvcking do this üí™ Not gonna let a few unsupportive people in my life hold me back no more, I don't need anyones permission to go make the world a better place. And to anyone who doesn't have anyone or very many people supporting them... I am here and this subreddit of likeminded people are here. Go do your thing!\n\nP.S wow my purpose of writing this completely morphed halfway thru xD It is nice to let my thoughts and feelings out sometimes and this subreddit is one of my fav places for this :)
2	I feel your pain, only I can't blame college alone because I had so much going on when I started.  Too long of a story for now and my phone is not cooperating. .  . .but I do need to share some similar frustration in hopes of some good feedback.\n\n
6	Communication and conflict	Hi r/INFP! INFJ here, looking for some advice/insight. My long-distance boyfriend of 2 years usually classifies himself as an INFP/INFJ. For the most part, we get along fantastically. One wa in which we differ is how to communicate when we are upset. I understand that people may need time to process their feelings/thoughts after a relationally significant event (I hesitate to say fight because we don't fight or even argue in the traditional sense; if I express even the slightest bit of hurt/anger/annoyance towards him, I get silence.) Afterwards, I usually take anywhere from an hour to a day or so to process my feelings/thoughts before I'm ready to talk about the issue and move on. My boyfriend processes differently - he takes days, sometimes an entire week, before he's ready to talk to me again. He ignores any attempt I have to contact him (1-2 phone calls or texts/day), even if I'm the one apologizing. As we are in a long-distance relationship, a week of silence, especially when I'm not ready or anticipating it, is bordering on ridiculous. I feel like a single person in a relationship and it's really draining and hurtful. But I can't express that, or else he'll just hide from me again.\n\nI know that MBTI can only help so much in a situation like this. I guess what I'm trying to ask is how to approach talking about topics of conflict with INFPs. Thus far, any time I've tried to engage with him with open-ended questions, I'm met with "I don't know" or stonewalling. (I've sent him a couple articles on stonewalling before and he agreed that we needed couples therapy or mentoring of some sort but nothing on that has moved.) I have a rule that once I break up with someone, I will never again get into a relationship with that person. I'm trying to avoid taking such drastic measures with him, but the lack of communication is really stressing me out. \n\nThanks for listening and for any advice you might have.
1	This really helped me understand my INFJ husband. https://youtu.be/08tc-PMhZMY\n\nSorry if the link doesn't work, I'm on mobile. 
1	I'll be the first to say that this is me to a T\n\nif my SO ever shouts or anything like that, I'll simply just be quiet, I don't really know how to respond or even how to make sense, like it makes sense, but I always feel like something has been lost in translation or perhaps something that I have misunderstood, and I'm always scared to ask if there was something if I misunderstood, because often the SO will be angrier that I misunderstood. \n\nSo he may be viewing it like that, my default thing to do if a personal issue is to occur is that I will bury my head in the sand (metaphorically) and ignore the situation until I feel I have gathered enough mental & emotional energy to deal with the situation.\n\nThe "I don't know" is definitely him trying to give you a response, but he isn't ready to deal with the issue yet.\n\nIn this situation, I would still care about my SO, but me saying "I don't know" and not replying much, is a call to be left alone to think and process (without actually saying that).\n\nI hope I have helped\n\n
1	Hi there. INFP male here. In my previous relationship, we got the same issue. I tend to avoid the issue like not talking to her for days. I feel like dealing the issue in the moment would just make it worse. It also doesn't help when I starting to throwing that doesn't make sense to her and sometimes I could overwhelm her with all of the problems I can bring up from the pst. After everything had settled down, I'll be back and apologize for whatever reason it was. 
7	Serial Experiments Lain	I just finished this anime and holy crap is it good. I remember seeing a few episodes 20 years ago and loved it - finally hunted down the rest of them. It hits all the right notes for me. It's on YT and Funimation. It also has the best opening track.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9kYAEyVjEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9kYAEyVjEY)
6	No matter where you go, everyones connected.
4	Yeah, Lain OP is quite good. Lets all love Lain
372	Here we go..	
6	This is pretty true :) INFPs should stick together and guide each other through :)
3	Ok I actually lol'd at this one :D
3	This is my reaction whenever I see a person struggling. Most accurate, well memed sir or madam. 
2	 not really; i just freak out a lot
1	Hahahaha.. this one got me.
1	Are you me?
1	So far it's been every winter in college for me, we'll see where it goes from here. 
1	Everyday of my life bruh
3	Empathic frequencies, follow and read news with caution	Reading Google news and now I'm over overwhelmed with sadness, despair, and low energy...its as if the disgusting within the stpries shared by the news media has rubbed onto me. I dont read the news or watch news often becausr of this.a\nAnyone, experience Hi- Fi over the written word?
2	I've very carefully curated my front page here on Reddit for this very reason. Some subs seem to thrive on tragedy and horror. I get infected with it so quickly.
36	Went on a date with another INFP	We went for coffee during a huge snow storm and it felt so cozy, just being around her was warmth enough for me. \nWe ended up talking for what felt like hours, but it was only about 45mins.\n\nI invited her to my work, which is a cocktail bar.\nI had to do a photoshoot for my coworker, and after a few drinks we ended up kissing and getting more in depth about our interests and what she was most looking forward to if this progresses.\nThe future is bright.\n\nAll I have to say about tonight is that it was worth the leap of faith I took. Being so vulnerable yet so comfortable.\nI know it‚Äôs a rare feeling with our types but the fact we felt so passionate about one another made me incredibly hopeful for a new and meaningful relationship.\n
7	Wish I had the balls you have.. been in love with this girl but don‚Äôt know how to ask her and where and what.. 
8	I‚Äôve been involved a little over a month with a girl now who tested as INFP on the free tests. The more time I‚Äôm with her the more certain I am that she is INFP. we‚Äôre incredible together. We‚Äôre thinking the same weird and cute things all the time, have so many things we both really enjoy doing and we‚Äôre so comfortable in each other‚Äôs presence that all insecurities disappear and we can just feel each other without words. It‚Äôs magic. I‚Äôve wanted to find another INFP for a while and kind of lucked out with her.\n\nYou have to be diligent with communication though. Because it‚Äôs instinct for both of you to bottle things up and not say what‚Äôs on your mind. Don‚Äôt do this. Address things quickly, you‚Äôll both understand. And if you feel it say it. You‚Äôll fall for each other fast.
571	Aahhhh...	
33	This is me right now actually 
35	*when you take the headphones out and the music starts playing out of the speaker and you have a panic attack thinking people will hear it and silently judge you*
15	Just know the grimy "reality" is mostly the vibe of the place and the emotions of the people around you - what you can call the matrix. As a sensitive person you can be in a public restroom, look in the mirror, and feel like shit, thinking it's all you... when it's more the reflection of the limitations mainstream society is steeped in.\n\nIt's not about escaping reality, but realizing what most consider reality is actually a limited and incomplete version - and not buy into it. So put your headphones on if necessary, and learn to derive your sense of self, the "reality", from within. \n
8	TOO REAL. I also almost feel the same way when I see intimate moments ^(that fuel if not restore my hope/faith in the world/humanity) in some of my favorite TV shows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(P.S. I cracked at this when I saw at at 2:32 am where I'm from. Reminds me of why I love this sub so much. Thank you, fellow INFPs! :))
7	Fucking ouch........Though at the same time this is why this sub is so great.
6	Oh dang, there are others? Maybe I'm not such an oddling.
5	I relate to this so much. I constantly wear headphones when I‚Äôm out in public because I can‚Äôt deal with it, I need to be in my own head. 
3	Thought I was in r/emo for a sec 
3	how can I upvote this more??

2	Hello yes I love it mann

1	Are INFPs just naturally inclined to being maladaptive daydreamers?! 
1	 ‚úÖ  I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
1	Can INFP and INFJ relationship really work?	I am an INFP female but super analyze things which probably made my SO --- INFJ male confused. He's probably the greatest person I've met in years but we're both avoidant in nature I presume. \n\nIf you'd had any experience with one, would love to hear your take on it and what can be improved for future conflicts.\n\n
4	I‚Äôve been married to an infp, ai‚Äôm and infj, almost 15 years so i think that just that proves this i can work.
6	Any artists here who have successfully sold work?	I could use some advice/tips. I'm in my 30's and I do oil paintings, I have been told I have talent and could make money by selling. However, I'm very introverted, I'm not business minded and I absolutely hate hustling/being a salesperson. \n\nIs there any hope for me? How do I even get started?
5	start an instagram for your art, go to trade shows 
3	I‚Äôm an INFP and I started a little art/woodworking shop on Etsy! It‚Äôs a nice little side gig I started after graduating high school. I know absolutely nothing business related or marketing related, but Etsy does all the work for you! You should definitely look into it.
2	IxTP here and I really enjoy surreal pencil sketching. I got involved with my local EDM community on fb and started posting some of my work to my personal page. One of the DJ's of the community contacted me one day and asked if I could do a piece of his children. That was my very first commission, and I've now done a few other commissions since then :)
2	I met someone who organizes expositions a few years ago (I actively looked for it), we clicked (because I pissed her off and she liked that) and she had me expose my art. I didn't need to be here and she did the selling, so that was great. And it was free for me since I was a "new talent" as she put it. Amazing woman!\n\nNow I'm a graphic designer and I launched my website last month. My clients count has skyrocketed, just by having people share the link on facebook (I didn't even ask for it, which is great). \n\nSo yeah, post your art online, personal website, instagram or both (I would go for a website) and share the link! \n\nQuick tip since you're not a salesperson, think about your prices beforehand (don't undersale!!) and stick to it.

4	INFP Themed Story	Surrealism I wrote for creative writing 2. Its supposed to be a reference to the darker aspects of an INFP when things go wrong for them. Lmk what y'all think!\n\n\n                                   ¬†The Cell\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Awaking once more, the man noted what he's known his life to be. The name tag on his shirt, though faded and nearly unintelligible after all the years spent in this cell, read Seamus. Seamus felt this name to be disused and tasteless though. He only truly knew himself as the jumble of characters ‚ÄúINFP-013‚Äù. This was what he had been christened by the facility, as the characters were neatly engraved into his door. He assumed they were engraved on the outside too, as the guards referred to him this way as well. ‚ÄúINFP-013‚Äù. Just another set of data in the system, of no particular importance. He lost his name, not just his name, but himself during this eternity. This eternity spent in an endless cycle. Waking, breathing, sleeping. Blinking the exhaustion from his eyes, he drew in a long breath, tasting the heavy, stale, metallic air. The mornings were his favorite. At least, what he thought was morning. They were the only time when he was too senseless and deaf to the constant screams of madness, the dull thuds of heavy guard boots upon hard concrete. He studied his surrounding, as is routine. He examined the padded walls, the drawings upon them which he was creator of, and yet tortured him more than anything the others could do to him. He drew out everything he longed for, hoping that the images alone could distract him from his misery. All of the images meant something to him, but none more than the radiant sun. Oh, how he longed for the light to grace his life. "They're only pictures." He said, turning away. "The world is not such a beatiful place." As he turned, he noticed, today is not like other days. Today is different. \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two foot iron door started to slowly open, with a drawn out creak, like an old gate opening to unwelcome guests. Stepping forward tentatively, he pushed it lightly, this gate, widening the aperture to an unknown world. However, he was fearful. He hasn't been outside his cage in this life he's living over and over again. He was fearful of the screams of the others, the dull thuds of the heavy guard boots upon hard concrete. His cage means safety, comfort. However, mustering all his will and courage, he stepped outside. \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As soon as he cleared the door, the fault in this masterful trap, it slammed shut with a thunderous boom. He left his comfort for curiosity, and in doing so took away his chance to stay in. Away from whatever awaits him outside. At the sound of the door slamming shut, the screams started again. Oh God, the screams. They pierced the very air, quickly growing louder and more constant as others exponentially joined the maddening chorus until they were just a jumble of high pitched notes, searing into the mans very soul. His breathing grew rapid, and he collapsed to the ground, rolling into a ball, covering his ears, anything to block out the dreadful noise. Why did he step out of his safety, his comfort? If he hadn't stepped out, this wouldn't be happening! He should've just stayed inside, where he knew what's meant to be, and what his life consists of... Listening to the screams, but not being a part of them... Hearing, but not feeling, or engaging, just listening... Standing up, he yelled into the echoing hall, "Shut up! Shut up, God damn it! Just let me be myself and do what I want!" Hearing his voice echo through the lengthy tunnel, he was pleased when the screams ceased all together, leaving him alone with the silence. He traveled on.\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Walking down the sterile hallway, he noted the blankness of it all. It wasn't the colorful, sunny world he thought was outside his cell. It was a sterile smelling tunnel, white everywhere with tiled ceilings and floors. The only light was emitted by flickering yellow ceiling lights, hanging from the ceiling, each ten feet apart from the last, leaving the hall light, but also dark. Doors led to worlds of other men, trapped with themselves like he was. He wanted to help them out, but knew that even if they wanted to come out because he thought it was good for them, he still wouldn't be able to. He didn't know how to open the door to their worlds. \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† His surroundings began to change. Finally, he was almost out of the daunting hallway. He saw a larger room ahead of him. However, just as he opened the door to this new land, alarms sounded. Others knew that he was starting to come out of the shell he made for himself. Thinking fast, he threw himself into what looked like a broom closet. This new world he created, where only he exists, and only he matters. No ones else needs to know him, and thats how he wants it to be. He doesn't want the others to see him, to interrogate him again. Listening, he heard the heavy guard boots upon hard concrete rush past the closet, and stepping out of the shell he created once more,INFP-013 opened up the door.\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Walking through the door to the great room, he noted how much nicer it looks than his old world. It had flowers, beautiful pictures lining the walls, the beauty an assault on his sight, and he reveled in it. At that moment however, his eyes began to burn. As they adjusted, he saw what he always wanted. Sunlight. The sheer, beautiful, sunlight, offering it's warmth and protection in exchange for his love. As he stumbled to the exit of his nightmare, he began to realize it was worth it, leaving his shell. The screams couldn't harm him, the men in their cells had to find themselves their own ways out, and the guards couldn't lock him up again. He was free. Stumbling through the light, he cried at the beauty in front of him. However, it was too much for him to handle. Too bright. The sheer pressure of being out in the open like that crushed Seamus, and he crumpled to the ground. His tears of happiness turned to tears of fear as he was hit by the anxiety of being outside. After what felt like hours, though it most likely was only a couple minutes, his consciousness fled. \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Once more, he awoke in his cell. He knew he hadn't dreamt the light though. The light was just as real as the pain of it's rejection. He knew the light could never truly love him, for he was never truly free. He built his cell, and only he can free himself from his cell. This shell he made inside himself, around his heart. This heart that felt so much pain, that it couldn't have anymore. So, it locked itself away from the others. They, who hurt it over and over, unrelentlessly. He couldn't trust them. He could only keep his heart away from them, not letting them see who he is, how much he hurts, how much he longs for love without pain. This, this is the cell INFP made for himself. The cell he stays in so he doesn't have to feel love or friendship. This is the cell he locked himself away in, longing for the key he hid from himself.\n

14	Wanting to fly away	Never liked the idea of being confined to generally one area, and spending the rest of my life with an S.O / corporate job / house. Never have I moved *once* in my entire life, and neither have I traveled around extensively, though, I believe my chance to fly will present itself in the near future.\n\nI'm feeling like a bird with it's wings having been removed from birth; cursed to waddle around. To only imagine what it might be like to soar through the free skies.\n\nAfter I regrow my wings, and set out for adventure, I don't plan on settling down...... at least until I'm physically unable to do so.  I will not volitionally return to that place of mud and muck (stagnation).\n\nThe next frontier is outer space, and sadly,  I'm not sure we'll live to see the day where spaceships or comparable vehicular machines will be issued out like cars are to this day. If that were the case..... I would be long gone from here; probably hopping from planet to planet until I die or until the spaceship breaks down.\n\nThere's so many mysteries to be solved, many questions to be answered, many areas to be seen, but it just doesn't seem very accessible; at least currently. The only thing I can do here is daydream about such adventures, or visualize how I might go about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	I like how you think. I always daydream about what it would feel like to walk on mars or the moon. Be so cool to see earth getting smaller and smaller as the space ship goes deeper out into outer space. And just leave all my worries and fears on earth
2	Damn, this reads like something that I could have written! \n\nAnyways, regarding moving around: I highly recommend it! I caught the travel bug after I enlisted, and have been moving fairly regularly for almost a decade now, even moreso after my contract ended. It's now rare for me to be somewhere for more than six months, and I've seen basically all of the US at this point (still need to get the Great Lakes, though). \n\nThe best way I've found to keep moving is through seasonal work by using sites like Coolworks and just applying like crazy until someone bites. I'll be returning to Alaska this summer to an entirely new place running day-long tours. There's all kinds of work too, whether you want to try being a ranch hand, tour guide, cook, deckhand on a cruise ship, receptionist, office assistant, pilot, whatever‚Äîit's all out there! Hopefully after this guide season I'll be getting an English teaching certificate so I can teach overseas and start bouncing from country to country, or at least move to different schools within the same country so I can see more parts of wherever I have my Visa for.\n\nKinda got long, but I hope this helps! Feel free to shoot me a message if you have specific questions :)

17	Mixing up dreams and reality?	Anyone else have dreams (day dream or sleep dream) and when you come back think it's totally real or like you had a conversation and bring it up later but it turns out it was just one of your dreams and then there's like a shattering moment where reality hits you\n???
3	There are very many experiences and memories I‚Äôve had in my life where I can‚Äôt figure out if they were dreams or not. Mostly when I was a kid for sure, everything is really hazy. 
2	This definitely happened a lot more in high school for me!  That ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù moment was so surreal and awful. I remember feeling like I was somehow lying to myself. And conversations with friends would get all jumbled up. I still have really vivid dreams, but I‚Äôm not confusing it nearly as much with reality. 
1	I have that from my childhood, not sure if some memories are dreams and vise versa. Also on rare occasion I will wake up from a dreadful dream (where I killed someone for example) and be so grateful that it was just a dream, because it felt so so real.

All I ask is that you don‚Äôt make it to where it‚Äôs alllllll your songs. \n\nSo far it‚Äôs really random and interesting to hear for me :)\n\nThese are my contributions:\nLady lamb-Crane your neck\nThe shins- caring is creepy\nFleet foxes- blue spotted tail\nJohnny cash- Sunday morning coming down\nModest mouse- bankrupt on selling \nLed Zeppelin- no quarter\nPink Floyd-shine on you crazy diamond \nMr. Gnome- vampires\nNeutral milk hotel- gardenhead/leave me alone\nPortugal.

1	Also filled it a bit :)
1	Gonna add some songs, enjoy ! 
1	Cool! Added some songs I think you guys would like :)
1	Admittedly, I put off responding to this because it overwhelmed me for some reason earlier. I just love so much music, and I'm not good with spotify. Instead over continuing to overthink it, I'm just going to link the last song I listened to:\n\nThem Bones - Alice in Chains [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTuD8k3JvxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTuD8k3JvxQ)
1	This is a great idea definitely gonna have to give it a listen! 
1	I love this! I added a couple of songs as well :) excited to listen to all of your additions as well.  Hope you guys like them. Ahhh
1	Love this. Thanks for sharing. I think instead of adding allllll the INFP music I've found over the years, I'll just share this old thing again. Here's a similar thing I made and posted a few years ago for any who may be interested: [https://open.spotify.com/user/1248294346/playlist/3C6MjlTPCyeP4XotKkEeVI?si=yv3uMIkpQ5-ayNn9x58XYQ](https://open.spotify.com/user/1248294346/playlist/3C6MjlTPCyeP4XotKkEeVI?si=yv3uMIkpQ5-ayNn9x58XYQ)
1	Car Radio by Twenty One Pilots
1	Neck Deep - Dont wait\n\nADTR - end of me
1	I know it‚Äôs kind of late, but I just added some songs! Hopefully I didn‚Äôt add too many lol
1	finally got around to adding some songs! i love sharing music with people! üòÑ
8	Can you tell I‚Äôm an INFP by looking at my instagram?	
3	Yeah, I can tell by the name.
3	Totally. You seem awesome üåü
3	You are a great photographer! So many beautiful pictures of nature. 
2	Yes I‚Äôd say so
5	Positivity problem?	So I am a positive and happy person but lots of my friends act like the world is ending when I am genuinely happy?? But other friends freak out when I show my sad because they always see the Happy face or when I express my sad they tell me to stop because the normies will get upset and I'm annoying and complain too much but I'm just saying the things that my brain relate to the situation?!?
22	Fantasizing about death	So I know this is a little depressing/morbid but does anybody think about dying and all the possible ways you'll go? It's always something I've thought about myself and didn't know if it was common with others similar to me. \n
12	YES! I don't remember a day when i didn't think about my own death or just death in general. It always freaks me out how it can literally just happen at any given moment. Is life just some kind of weird simulation and when you die you're actually just waking up in the "real" world? 
4	From time to time I‚Äôll romanticize death, I usually don‚Äôt talk about it because I don‚Äôt want anyone thinking I‚Äôm suicidal and I don‚Äôt want to scare them. But I think about people that have died as heros or martyrs and think about how cool it would be to die in some grand and meaningful way like that. 
4	I usually do this in front of some of my closer friends actually, they'll start talking about something that could kill you (e.g. electrocution) and I'll just say something like "oh yeah, that's how I wanna go really", which usually gets a a funny reaction, but I do actually consider it every now and again as to how it would be to die like that
3	No. For most of my life I've had a strong existential anxiety and particularly a very strong fear of death after a very unfortunate experiment i did, when i was 8 years ago. I tried to imagine/feel how being dead would feel like. I closed my eyes, covered my ears and focused on this silent darkness and that i can't do nothing to escape or end this feeling. This "experiment" ended with a very intense panic attack, from which I then concluded, that this is what death would feel like - an endless panic attack. For almost almost 20 years this crippling fear of death (and panic attacks) haunted and restricted my life, eventually resulting in a complete burnout and sort-of a nervous breakdown. But thankfully, with the help of therapy i was able to work with these fears and eventually change my perception of death and accept it as a normal part of life. And the "key" factor, that has helped me to accept death is, that i am (hopefully) not gonna be feeling/experiencing it. Like, for example, world has been populated by people for thousands of years before i was born, and yet all that time has not have any impression on me, because i didn't experienced it. Or every time i go to sleep, i "switch off" for 7 or 8 hours and i have almost no experience of that time.  I used to spend so much time fearing death and trying to keep myself safe, that once i accepted death and the uncertainty of when it will come, i choose solely focus on life. 
3	Fantasizing about dying of a terminal illness and all the sad and fun things I would do while still alive ‚úîÔ∏è\n\nFantasizing about taking my own life and how it would or would not  affect people I care about ‚úîÔ∏è\n\nFantasizing about dying too soon before I accomplish something great in life but not even remotely trying to accomplish anything great  ‚úîÔ∏è\n
2	yes often
2	Absolutely. I've fantasized about my own death many times. Usually, its when I'm very depressed but sometimes even when I'm not. How people would react, what my funeral would be like, etc. 
1	I used to, when I was more dark and depressed. Now life's just better and I like living. Death is just what it is. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1	Yes, a sweet temptation of death that allow one to escape from this world. The temptations is never too far from my thoughts.
4	Based on what I've seen here so far, this seems like the kind of humor a lot of you would also appreciate	
3	Thanks I gotta clear my YouTube history now
3	3 dudes and a dog running all together on the grass cause they're not gay
9	As a male(45) infp, I can totally relate to this song. One of my absolute favorites	
29	When people fake their feelings (Slytherin INFP here)	
7	Also a Slytherin INFP. The sound of ingenuine tears makes my skin crawl. 
7	I'm a Ravenclaw INFP, even if Hufflepuff has a good percentage
5	Another Slytherin INFP. I feel like I have found my tribe.
3	I've been called a Hufflepuff, but I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan so I don't know. 
3	Slytherin INFP! I used to be Gryffindor for many years, until a few years ago when I switched sides. Heh. 
2	Hahahhhh love thisss! So many infp Slytherins woow! I would never assume that combination..griffindor entj here‚úåüèª
42	I just want to thank you all. I haven't felt this "normal" and accepted in God knows how long	I've always felt so weird and isolated. Talking to you all and hearing about our shared experiences just really is uplifting to me. If makes me feel less alone and on a different wavelength than everyone. I normally don't get to be so authentically me without getting some weird comments or looks. 
9	Welcome to the circle, friend. You're still fucked up, but you're not fucked up alone
5	Cool. I feel ya. People give me weird looks too. It's good to know I'm not the only one.
3	We‚Äôre all weird together here. And no ones alone.
9	INFP Homes - Creating a Comforting Haven	Tell me the things you keep around in your home that make you feel cozy and safe. I‚Äôm moving back home with my husband after a year separation and I‚Äôve loved having my own place. I‚Äôve been recovering from PTSD and MDD and having a safe place *just for me* is indispensable to my sanity. We agreed to transform our unutilized dining room to be my space. I‚Äôve got a single closet sized pantry for storage and a small corner bar area and one standard sized window. I‚Äôd love to use it for relaxing with a book or my crochet/knitting, artwork, etc. \n\nI‚Äôm pretty lost when starting projects these days. My emotional and mental health issues cause everything to become terribly overwhelming so help from fellow INFPs would be greatly appreciated during this time :-)
3	Do not make a safe space specifically for a safe space. When you are feeling bad you need to talk to people you trust.  Creating that safe space will just worsen the underlying problems you have because you will just run to them whenever any adversity hits you. I recommend being outside somewhere where there is a lot of nature whenever extra stress hits you. I believe in you.
2	I like to have a little place to curl up with pillows and blankets, like a comfy chair or couch/futon. I have a diffuser in my room, and also a night light that projects aurora patterns on the ceiling. These make a nice atmosphere. Candles, strings of lights. Lighting makes all the difference. Having colors that make me happy is great. Plants are lovely! Being surrounded by hobby stuff where I can see and grab it is nice. Books, knitting stuff, art supplies. A good little desk to do things at is good. Playing music to put in the mood you want to be in helps. Also, I think it's important to keep your space at a level of tidiness/messiness that you are comfortable with. I get too overwhelmed if it's messy, but if it's overly tidy it's not as fun. I may have gotten carried away here, but I love daydreaming about cozy spaces! :)
2	One of the things I have in my room that helps give me a peace of mind is a sunset on a beach tapestry. It's so beautiful! \nIf you're interested in buying one i got mine from this website https://www.dresslily.com/tag/nature-tapestry.html?lkid=1559746&gclid=CjwKCAiAkrTjBRAoEiwAXpf9Cc7Ry1WlKZ7QZJQRSKNrwv6iNFM23yhYCoXuifOLCH6V0f-6I2eTbxoCqkYQAvD_BwE \n\nGood quality. Good prices. Shipping is kinda slow tho. I promise you won't regret getting one! 
0	Ahh, I've been away from home for a while and have been fantasizing about all the things I'll do next time I have my own apartment to make it cozy and special. First thing for me is lots and lots of green plants! My surroundings are coziest when I feel like I'm in an indoor jungle. Colorful decor items (each with its own story or significance, of course, lol) and string lights. As much natural light as possible. Blankets everywhere because there's nothing more cozy-destroying than being cold. And art prints! If you find ones that speak to you, you get a happiness boost every time you see them. And art supplies readily accessible, so a creative outlet is always there whenever I need it. A playlist with a good calming chill tempo. And finally, this isn't applicable for everyone, but no sanctuary of mine feels complete without a pet :)
21	Thoughts on this?	
3	I meditate every day. It does wonders for my mental health, but takes practice. 
3	I used to meditate but not so much anymore. \n\nDifferent perceptions are like dimensions or world's to the awareness. I notice when I go to sleep or if I study a topic or religion intensively my awareness will get caught up in that specific dimension / perception for awhile. \n\nI think there is no wrong or right perception but it's hard to be open minded because the awareness gets stuck in perceptions and experience points. \n\nI tried focusing on being pure awareness but you can't control when the peace comes. It comes randomly or not at all. And being open to perceptions and ideas sounds great but it makes the mind and heart very lonely. \n\nThis is just my opinion / experience with awareness and perception. \n\nHope that helps. Good luck. 
3	Probably simultaneously the words INFP live by while needing others to remind them of at times.
3	Yes. 
2	I struggle with meditation, I don't want to focus on my own thoughts, that's what gets me down in the first place! It works for some but for me I just end up thinking about all the justifiable ressons why I feel awful. I do enjoy the spiritual aspect and reflection of life Buddhism and Thich talks about. He has a very relaxing voice.
0	Uhh it's got fucked up grammar?
63	I got so caught up in my own thoughts this morning I got ready for work on auto pilot and didn't notice it was 4:45 am until I got to the car	Now I'm listening to Frank Zappa music until I'm SUPPOSED to leave at 6:30 am. 
16	I feel like I‚Äôm zoned out for the majority of every day lol.
3	Done it when i was a teen, just noticed the time while at the door waiting for my mother to take me to school, and she was still asleep.  \n\n\nBack to bed in school clothing.
3	Ain't dissociation great?????
3	I've had couple of moments where i intended to brush my teeth, but ended up putting water to boil for coffee. And other way around :D
2	I try to control zoning out when on my own by checking the time periodically and keeping close track of what I'm currently doing. It's hard.
2	‚ÄúWhy Does it Hurt When I Pee?‚Äù is a classic.
852	Haha üòÇ	
30	there are no comments so here is one
22	I laughed and became socially exhausted.
8	Yes! Anyone else go in these cycles of a couple months of doing as little as possible after a couple weeks of doing stuff with people involved lol?
7	Can I steal this and put it on r/INTP?
2	Pretty much lol
2	Ahh the best feeling ever üòç
2	‚ù§
2	lol more like ‚Äúme, recharging for one Thursday night after going out for six months‚Äù for me
2	Me after running a small errand in the city. Or after the full moon. Or after eating a red beet forgetting I'm sensitive to it.
1	WHERE IS THE BODY!!!???
0	This stuffs fake
20	Do you do this too?	I have to touch every soft-looking and/or fuzzy thing I see at the store. I have no impulse control for this lol 
3	SAME. It's so hard when someone I don't know is wearing something that seems amazing to touch. Don't wanna be creepy. Must. Control. Urge.
3	I used to be like this real bad as a kid. Not so much anymore. Probably because I was scolded to not touch stuff so much haha.
3	Yes, me too. Loving all the sequins on things lately too! 
2	No fuzzy soft things. However... i have this habit of fiddling something small with my fingers. For last couple of years i have few plastic sport bottle opener's, that i like to play with. I put them on their back on the table and then cradle them with my fingers :D
1	Buttons on electronics. I HAVE TO.
1	Fabric stores are the best !!! Touch all of the textures 
1	The weird thing is that I just read this thread while I was touching a fluffy pillow xD
1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 21	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	Always thought I was very odd in the way I was thinking and going about things. I was never truly bothered by it, but felt that lonelyness because of my conviction that I was the only one who had these traits that no one really understood. Not in a way in which I felt better than other people but just different. And somehow I always have this returning depression phase (where I think I lost the essence of myself and that I am an absolute failure in everything I do and did) in which I revisit every moment when I was not happy abour my actions. This can really turn into a rabbithole that you fall into. (But generally I am a happy person)\n\nAnyways it was kind of therapeutic to learn that generally there is a described charactertype like this that not only I seem to have. It is nice to just have the possibility, that somehow, around the world, there are people who understand you deeply. Thats very comforting.\n\nHow did you feel when you discovered you were this type and were you able to understand youself better because of it?\n(Well...that got a bit long.)
2	Had awesome date yesterday with Infp.  It's just so comfortable. 
1	Reminder to myself: this feeling, too, shall pass. \n\nI hope whoever is reading this is being reminded of the temporary nature of everything - but in a good way, if it makes sense. 
1	Thank goodness I don't display percentage of upvotes to downvotes on posts. The anxiety of seeing my own posts and their percentages would crush me.
1	So I've been binging some Parks and Recreation and I'm at S06E13 where Chris and Ann moved out of Pawnee to start with their new life as a family.\n\nI'M CRYING. üò≠
1	I have the opposite of a writer's block.. I have a few ideas for a story but too am too lazy. *The spirit is willing but the body is weak..*
9	Historic photos are amazing	Do you also love seeing photos/paintings of how a city- or landscape used to look like? I love old photos and comparing them to how it looks now. I also love seeing traces of were a road was or where a wall used to stand. Often I also miss how it looked bc I‚Äôm not very fond of the boring architecture nowadays, only me??
3	I especially love seeing videos from the early 1900s and seeing how much people have changed since then. Everyone looked so elegant and had a completely different way of speaking. It‚Äôs so cool that old photographs and videos exist so that we‚Äôre able to experience times before we were even alive. 
3	I‚Äôd recommend following r/historyporn it‚Äôs one of my favorite subreddits and I think you‚Äôd enjoy it as well. I really enjoy looking at how things have changed 
3	Nice, i also really enjoy going to historical places in the local area, especially industrial stuff as i find it the coolest. I think i romanticize history a bit too much, even weird mundane stuff i keep hold of and marvel at. I found a coca-cola can from the 1970's and kept it even though its just trash, just find it amazing though that a can of coke has outlived me by several decades. As you said, i can spend hours going researching and pouring over historical photos of my area, just find it interesting really. Glad to know this is an infp thing and not just a me thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease don't think i'm crazy :)
8	Where do INFP‚Äôs find happiness?	Where do you find your happiness? 
15	I simply find happiness in music and nice conversations. How about you?
9	I find mine in music, being alone and playing video games that I find inspiring.
5	I like trees and when my cat shows me her belly and pictures of my family.
3	Deep relationships with people, music, breaking rules and thrill seeking. 
2	[deleted]
2	In freedom of choosing, how i want to perceive/live my life. Choosing to be happy.
2	In the opportunities I have and the people in my life. \n\nSometimes when I‚Äôm driving down the highway by myself with all the windows down and my music blasting I get this pure, deep feeling of being completely and utterly at peace and content. I also feel like that in open fields. Can you tell I‚Äôm an English lit person? Lol. 
2	1. Food. Oh to have endless stomach and endless food!\n2. Affection with a loved one\n3. Experiencing flow while doing meaningful work\n4. Happy music\n5. Connecting with a random stranger
1	If I can be somewhere scenic or looking at photographs I've taken which hold memories, put on a little bit of Debussy's Nocturne.. I drift off into a daydream trance. Find beauty where it's to be found, you know? 
1	Music, namely film score and orchestra
1	Spending time with my dog outside 
1	Being in love and feeling loved and spending time with that person. Also enjoy time in nature observing everything. And being creative. Visiting a new place and exploring it. 
1	I'm extremely close with what few friends I have. I want to pour all of myself into them. 
1	Inside oneself.
1	Cute animal videos. Specifically whales, sloths and bats. 
1	Being content in the moment. Like enjoying the sun, walking the dogs and them being obedient and sweet, the joy of being alive and feeling all there is to feel. 
14	Documenting your life	Don't you guys have the feeling that you want to document your life? I always am so interested in my ancestors and what it looked like back then. Hearing about my grandpa and his stories of when he was a kid in the 1930's and 1940's I want to be able to have more personal experience of the past. I think I'm gonna start vlogging, taking pictures, saving music playlists and write about my life a lot more. Saving pictures of my childhood, sports, school, college, best friends and more will be included. When I am old I will want to show my loved ones a lot more of my life that they couldn't see. I also just started a daily journal.
3	yeah but then I realize I am no one of importance and no one would care about it.
2	I personally think social media is a great way to document your daily life. I'm certain historians in the future will see our posts and create a large catalog of everything and link it up to each person. However, I do I have personal recordings where I just ramble about life. Might not be of any interest towards my decendants, but idc.
2	I have done this in perhaps a slightly more abstract way, by writing music. Even though all of my stuff is instrumental it documents how/what/why I was feeling and thinking at various points in my life. For me the things I created are like little snapshots back to my previous self. It may not be as literal as a photograph but it‚Äôs no less potent. 
2	when i was a kid i loved the idea that when youre dead you will one more time watch your life like a movie in realtime.
52	Anyone else feel like they romanticize sadness too much?	
15	i only feel like i'm toughly me when i'm sad..   \ni think way more and understand who i am  \nlike happy me is a fake me 
12	Sadness is when we're most reflective on life I think. I have poetry in my head when I'm sad, it disappears when I'm feeling better and I miss it a little. 
7	>  **romanticize suicide**\n\nFTFY :\^)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	This is definitely an INFP thing. Even when everything is fine and I'm happy I need to find something to be sad about haha. Not in the 'woe is me' sense, but that feeling of melancholy that kinda makes me who I am. It fuels my creativity and inner world. 
1	I love anything that is in angst/melodrama genre. I'm generally a happy person but I need something to make me feel really sad.\n\n
1	I just realized how unhealthy it is to ruminate on my emotions lately. It's been a habit to listen to sad music all the time since high school, but every since my worsened mood, I decided to make a happy playlist for the first time.
1	I think this comic artist (Christine Marie Comics) recently summed it up pretty succinctly: https://www.instagram.com/p/BtclDZBF0wg/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1n4yzuza8tkes\n\nTl:dr - saddens itself is not beautiful, but opens you up to beautiful things 
1	maybe
1	Too much? Sadness is awesome.
1	I don‚Äôt get sad.
146	maladaptive daydreaming anyone?	
7	Me. But it isn't nice, i'm doing it, because real life is shitty, thats real addiction and makes me totally asocial.
5	I like this, have a orange arrow
4	I know this place, I spent my whole teenage life there.
10	Dangerous, unhealthy, addictive and not to be encouraged. You will lose years of your life to it.
4	Yes, extremely familiar with this. It‚Äôs such an awful way to live and it really sneaks into your life in such an innocuous way at first. Once you know it‚Äôs a problem it‚Äôs far too easy to slip away into fantasy to avoid that truth. I haven‚Äôt had a significant problem with this in several years but I remember the large chunks of days I‚Äôd miss because of it. It also led to me having a crippling avoidance coping method which has led to some life altering, terrible mental and emotional health problems. What a nightmare.
3	Props for the song reference
2	There must be a reason we‚Äôre all dreamers think it makes the best poets,novelists,filmmakers,artists etc.\n\nGlad to be a daydreamer,we the people of spirit.
1	ME :(
1	i dont know what any of you are talking about
2	any infps with the same issue?	are there any INFPs in a relationship with an INTP and know how to help me out?\n\nhey guys!! i‚Äôm an INFP female and my INTP male seems closed off. yesterday he asked me about my past intimate experiences with men before him, and he seemed fine then. it was like nothing. but i talked today with him and he actually brought it up again out of nowhere. he said ‚Äújust so you know, please don‚Äôt ever talk about the other people you‚Äôve had sex with again. it was like the worse thing to hear‚Äù and i can‚Äôt even explain how badly i felt. i had NO IDEA he cared that much and i know you guys hide your feelings so much so i should‚Äôve just assumed instead of just cold reading what i thought he was feeling. please help, how do i get through to him that none of the other guys mean anything to me because i‚Äôve never loved anyone before him? how do i make sure that fully resonates with him? thank you guys!!! 
4	Here's what I think happened:\n\nI think he regrets asking the question, but wasn't quite sure how to say that. Like maybe he thought he could handle it at first but it turns out he can't. \n\nI would say that all you can really do is just tell him that the past doesn't matter, because he's more important to you than any of that. Maybe let him know that you would never intentionally hurt him, and say that you'll be sure not to bring it up again. That being said, if he asks for info. like this again and back-tracks, you'll need to have a conversation about that behavior. It isn't healthy when repeated regularly. 
1	is she being inconsistent?	i have this friend who drinks often, smokes cigarettes occasionally... and yet she's afraid to take any medication, even natural pills.\n\nI don't drink or do any drugs, so I don't know what it's like.. but isn't it inconsistent to be afraid to take pills due to the loss of control and side effects etc, yet be okay with getting drunk?
1	i have the same thing as she and for me it's the fear of the level of dependency that something will impact my life, except for cigarette because i dont care and its makes me feel good. i will never be addicted to alcohol. but im afraid of pharmaceuticals, they can make you really dependent, i see people swallowing pills for every occasion, for me its disgusting. let your body do the thing. bonus for antidepressings but i know maybe i can change my mind on this one. of course there is exceptions. 
1	Yes it's inconsistent but they are trying to deal with some sort of pain by coping with those vices. And that is their choice. 
35	Me and my bf (both INFPs) made a sock puppet music video for a love song he wrote	
5	I wish I had a socket puppet, I mean boyfriend, I mean girlfriend. D: \n\nVery cool, made me smile.
5	Cuteness overload, brain about to melt, must go kill a critter to rebalance the universe out lol joking. This's amazing!*üòÅ
3	All in one take! Very impressive. \nJk. This is the cutest, I love it. Also I love this language so much. Reminded me to take a course next semester. Wish you two all the best.
3	Great song! üíúü¶ÑüêØüíúü¶ÑüêØ
3	I LOVE IT, SO CUTE! And the song is adorable too even if I don't know what the words mean. Hope you have a wonderful day üòä
10	Someone ground me please	My imagination and fantasy way of thinking is in overdrive at the moment. The only freedom I have from it is when I‚Äôm feeling melancholic instead. \n\nI‚Äôve just started dating and find myself fantasizing over people. I get carried away and read into things far too deeply, imagining all the possibilities with said person. This way of thinking is also applying itself to ideas around employment and my future too. \n\nAnyone got any advice to help stay grounded when this way of thinking takes over? 
8	Get ducking rejected, you will never want to fantasize again.\nI have an automatic. NO - voice in my head each time I'm dreaming about that shit.
6	There‚Äôs nothing wrong with dreaming, as long as you recognize that you‚Äôre dreaming. The problems will arise when you start finding disappointment where things don‚Äôt work out as you have dreamt them to. \nLet your head be in the clouds, shoot for the stars, if you will. But remember that real people come with real problems, and real circumstances come with real difficulties.\nOn the flip side, don‚Äôt let the problems throw you to the other end of your dreaming. Where you only see the worst of everything and everyone.\n\nBe real, be happy, and never stop dreaming. 
2	Same problem. I'm happy with my choices but I keep imagining other possibilities out of the ones I've made.\nI bet we INFPs would be the best movie directorsüòÇ\n\nIn some cases we should force us to use our inferior function (extraverted thinking) if it doesn't come by itself
7	I feel worthless	My life is a mess. My parents are abusive. My social anxiety is ruining my life and I have no friends.\n\n I feel worthless. Any self help books that's gonna help figure my self out and change my life please?
2	If your parents are abusive then you need to escape somehow. Start to devise a plan. Find someone who can help you.
2	My parents aren't really abusive but they aren't great either. I feel the same on everything else though. You aren't worthless for realizing things aren't going well. That only makes you aware. I'm planning on doing a self help book haul and hoping to find a path towards a fulfilling life.\n\nMy list:\n-The subtle art of not giving a f*ck \n-Emotional first aid: healing, rejection, guilt, failure and other everyday hurts\n-101 secrets for your twenties\n\nI hope you perservere through this, it's tough but something needs to be done.
2	Check out Thus Spoke Zarathustra
5	I mean this sincerely, I would read the Bible. As an INFP all too aware of life's disappointments, I've found its the only system of belief that can explain why life is both so difficult but such a gift. Knowing that God knows the purpose of my life-- and that it has one--is the greatest source of peace for me. \n\n1st Peter is a good, short place to start. Would love to talk to you more about it if you want! 
1	I don't know if it will help but Introvert Power by Laurie Hilgoe PhD helped me a lot. Even so, I feel wiped out today. Some days are just like that. 
1	I binge paranormal docs and do cooking experiments. Self help doesn't help me, I find it keeps my mindset in the same place.\n
1	I‚Äôm guessing a good place to start is with attachment styles. I used to feel/be similar to you, and learning about how I attach to others helped me create healthy relationships and deal with the childhood abuse. Here‚Äôs a [book](https://www.amazon.ca/Attached-Science-Attachment-Find-Keep/dp/1585429139) to consider. Hugs... you are definitely not worthless.
1	It's easy to entrap yourself in the thoughts you're not worth much because of others. Take time for yourself. What is it you like to do or get out of life? As an INFP you must have some longing desire or interest. I didn't think I had any until one day (with the help of prescriptions) I decided I won't allow my doubts to win over me. It's a beautiful but short life, nobody will remember the stuff you  think holds you back. 
1	If you want to talk with someone... feel free I guess. 
1	Self-help books? Lord knows I've perused plenty, but none come to mind. Sorry to hear that snippet of your situation. Can I offer some suggestions? (I'mma do it anyway)\n\nJournal everyday. Map out your emotional state. Lay out as many perspectives as you can imagine on the why's, what's, and how's of your life. \n\nGo out and explore your town/ city. Be by yourself in nature and wander as you wonder. Try a new hiking route every week or every other week or every month, whatever you can manage.\n\nTreat yourself and talk to yourself like you would another person (who you love, respect, and admire). \n\nPractice being mindful of all the beauty and joy there is in the world. Doing so does not detract from being aware and conscientious of the injustice and ugliness there is. Practice letting the awareness of both coexist.\n\nGood luck and cheers!
1	I am currently 30, and have loving parents, a great job and good friends, yet it seems like there is something missing. It's feels like drowning and I just can't feel happy no matter what I do. I now believe that some people are just born sad and I am one of them....
3	Maybe...	...world isn't this perfect, complete, simple, efficient and optimal place in which i could never really find my place and always felt lacking and falling behind it with my countless faults, oddities and imperfections and with this strong fear, that i could "ruin, broke it"? But instead world is a flawed, faulty, f*cked up sh*thole with injustice, inequity, deceit, contradictions, narrow-mindedness and  countless lack-off's. And i am just trying to preserve myself and resist from being sucked into this wasteful, gear-grinding madness. Trying to survive, which i think is pretty normal and adequate thing to do?
3	I am literally you. I speak to a therapist and he was showing me these two different yin-yang type of symbols and telling me I‚Äôm trying to be right in a world that is so wrong.. and he told me I need to learn to navigate this world with the way it is. 
2	I think no one else can understand  the things that we have to undergo just to survive in this world.... 
9	After doing this and actually reading about INFP I feel like I'm not just crazy, maybe just a little crazy.	So I recently got back from a vacation, a week spent with my best friend who I realized I have much more than a crush on but that's not exactly the point. Or maybe it is because this is kind of about how I have zero idea what I'm feeling and why. I'm not even sure if this is just me ranting to get it out or trying to get some feedback on exactly why I feel this way.\n\nI realized I can talk much easier through messages/texts than in person even there being comfortable with them it didn't come all that easily. Sure conversation seemed fine and it was exciting to hear about all the things they had to say and explaining everything we saw or went to do. I also loved listening to them talk or vent or whatever, it made me feel like I was doing something good because I don't care much for most people but with them I'd do whatever I could to help. Though being as independent as they are I've got a hard time just stepping back and leaving things at "If you need anything I'm here for you," and find myself worrying quite a bit. \n\nI also found myself worried about being boring, there are obviously other people in the world but I just seemed to want all the attention because I guess it's not something I'm used to getting and loved the times I got it. Which lead to over thinking and daydreaming about what could be and what could've been. Then realizing over the last couple of days that it's all in my head and I would in fact have to go home after one of the most fun weeks I've had despite occasionally trying to hide away cause emotions were taking over and I knew nothing was happening going into things but between being a dreamer like I seem to understand is what this whole personality type thing is and genuinely enjoying time with someone I care about I couldn't help myself. \n\nI ended up getting down at times because I was overthinking and in my head about whether or not any of this was enjoyable for them and if I was just a pain being there. Withdrawing and not knowing what to say or do and have an awful hard time saying anything about it. Though I suppose I'm not really sure of being moody at times is common. Though I suppose it did get brought up and talked about some, though through messages rather than words cause they for some reason put up with me being dumb and unable to actually speak but at least able to write.\n\nBeing spontaneous and just kind of going with the flow of what we'd be doing day to day was fun, or maybe it was because I was just really happy to get to just unwind for a while and just being around her made me smile. Not that they don't make me laugh plenty or smile when I see something from them but still. I suppose I know what I want, or what I would really like to happen but know it's just a pipe dream it's awful hard to get out of my head. \n\nSo I suppose if I really need to ask a question is how do you guys deal with all these emotions? And is it really common to get in your own head and screw up your evening and stuff, and if so is there a way to get out of it? I'm bad at vocalizing and worry saying things just makes stuff worse but if there's any way to help deal with that kind of stuff I'm all ears. I'm sick of worrying. Also sorry for the rant and rambling, but getting it out was nice. Also thank god they doesn't know my actual reddit username, or come here since her personality type is different and I know she visits that one so I'll just guess I'm safe although I told her I just took it and was infp, so if not um, hi and you're the best!
2	I always find it funny that we all just rant post about how we feel then realize that we‚Äôre just ranting. \nBe in touch with your feelings, enjoy your life, think about things but try not to just live only in your head, and tell your friend how you feel. Speaking from experience, you‚Äôll regret it if you don‚Äôt. \nHave a good one friend :) 
10	Regreting having guts.	Thing aren't going well since i moved back at mom and grandma's place.  \n\n\nsince i could not get a job, i am supposed to "help" at home. Help is my entire mornings and when they want it afternoons doing home stuff, and cooking.  \nI already have trouble focusing on my stuff, and sometimes i wake up excited,  thinking about some project and can't do shit since i have to help. Or when i am focused doing something in the nighttime and can't give myself fully to it because the dishes should be clean by 8:30 or i'll listen my mother talking endlessly.  \n\n\nOver time their requests are becoming more stressfull, and i am getting close to a bloiling point. At home me and grandma try to keep on our own because mom's got "the nerves", but i also have to keep myself at check at all times since my grandmother is really conservative.   \n\n\nThing is, came to mom asking if they could forget my existence for a week. Got too anxious to say the rest of it, and just got a crude "okay". She only do that when pissed.  \n\n\nNow i am afraid of having hurt her. Crying a bit since i was supposed to be the one who helps them. But when i am at their chores, i am afraid of losing my future one clean dish at a time. Fuck, i have a degree, just need to focus on my shit for some time and get my portfolio ready, but i have to spend too long time chewing my emotions of all the little things that happen at home.  \n\n\nShit, i don't even know what i want by posting this. Advices? Blurping it all out? IDK. Don't even need to reply.
5	I just moved out of a situation like that! \nIt is really trying. I did eventually loose my shit! \n\nIt's going to be better later! Just right now it's going to be hard. 
3	Keep applying for work. \n\nRemember that you would have to do these chores for yourself if you were living alone anyway. Dishes, cooking, cleaning, so just remember that.\n\nContinue to apply for work. It‚Äôs a numbers game.
2	You are not indebted to someone else beyond what you think you owe them.\n\nIf the situation is life and death, then it could be better to go along with it. Otherwise, you can afford to take some time to yourself at least once in a while.\n\nIt's easy to be taken advantage of by anyone if they make you think you owe them favors. The only real favors you owe to anyone are the ones you know will have the most dire consequences.

5	Does anyone else ever think they'd be great at standup comedy?	
7	Yes, I know I would, my crippling fear of public speaking says otherwise, but other than that, yes, I'd be really good.
4	Yes, but only to the right crowd. I think my humor can be a little too out there and weird for some people. 
3	I can't watch a comedy show without spending the rest of the day fantasizing about what my comedy routine would be (without writing it all down, of course lol)
1	Yeet have though about that a little.
1	Me! I have always fantasized about doing stand up comedy one day. I‚Äôm kinda funny, I got jokes, but I‚Äôm not always a jokerster. I‚Äôm pretty witty, I can think of good come backs, and I have good comedic timing. I just have a unique perspective that I can use material from.
1	I'll spend hours in front of a mirror working on a routine that will never have an audience. I'd crumple before criticism.
23	Learning to start less sentences with "I / me" has helped with social anxiety	I don't know if there are many other infp's here who are babbles (despite being obviously introverts) - I often speak a lot and don't always think what I'm saying. It often gives me so much anxiety. Especially because a lot of times I'm in a hurry to explain or validate myself or my actions, or just plain please. By constantly defining myself to others I'll build up expectations. Am I trying to control how they see me or brag or something? Isn't that stuff usually just counter productive?\n\nSo like if I was looking at the stars and wanted to say how I think this, I do that, I always do that, I learned/know that...\n\nIt felt much better. More present, more harmonious. Better conversation, better friend. I ended up being silent quite a lot.
3	I don't understand exactly but it sounds like a good idea. How do you start sentences if not with an I? LOL. Honestly want to understand. Sounds like a novel idea to me!
2	Great idea, I‚Äôve noticed lately my use of ‚ÄúI‚Äù and stating my opinions has grown exponentially and it sucks, it‚Äôs great to hear you feel better after stopping, hopefully I get the same results!

5	Tips for dating another INFP?	I suspected for the while now but just confirmed that my girlfriend is an INFP as well. Anyone got any tips on relationships between two INFPs? 
4	As an INFP female married to an INFP male, we're pretty compatible. We tend to like those who have the same values and ideals as us, so it's common for INFP's to end up together.
1	Infp females are very sensitive creatures. Zero practical skills. Live in La la land. Give great head tho üëå
3	IN F/T P	I have seen at least a half dozen times over my few months on this subreddit, people ask if they are INFP or INTP. The first time I ever did the MBTI test, I was INTP (forgot about this until today xD). Then the next half dozen+ tests I have always been INFP, including today. Today I got INFP-A w 51% feeling and 49% thinking, but the other 3 traits are firmly in one direction. So I decided to read about INTP, and much of that resonated w me as well, although INFP resonates w me more, so I suppose I am INF(t)P-A if you want to get technical. For those of you who are on the fence about 2 types... That could be a way to potentially describe your type. I don't think human beings can be stuck into 16 boxes accurately, but w that said I have learned a lot about myself from MBTI and this subreddit as well, thank you all for being awesome! ‚ù§
3	Until a few months ago, I was convinced that I was an INTP.  However, after more research and some internal observations, I realized that I was actually more of an INFP than INTP.  Looking at the 8 cognitive functions helped me distinguish which one I am, because I use Fi more than I use Ti.
2	The difference between an INFP and INTP is more than just f/t . Check Fe (as in INTP ) vs Fi (As in INFP) to see to which you relate more.  
601	When you‚Äôre INFP but 40% extroverted so you want to go out and be social and make friends because everyone is perfect and amazing but also it tires tf out of you and you don‚Äôt like big crowds and don‚Äôt like socializing and are just a big hypocrite.	
100	When you like to be in the spotlights but also not like to be in the spotlights so you just stand there alone thinking you like to be in the spotlights.
47	Ugh, I feel this so hard.\n\nI get excited whenever I get invited to things/events by people because I finally feel included and not invisible as usual. I start getting this adrenaline rush (aka the energy to socialize) resulting from the anticipation several hours before the event. \n\nHowever, once I leave the house I immediately start feeling a pang of regret and I start thinking about how nice it would be if I were to be curled up in bed reading a book or watching a film.
16	You are not supposed to stay out all day! I like seeing other people, but not stay with them for more than 3 or 4 hours (in extreme occasions). That is completely normal.
13	Lol I can‚Äôt relate. I‚Äôm as introverted as you can be. 
8	I routinely put the mask on for meetings. I force myself to stop, gather myself, and put on the pleasant persona I need to make sure things go well. \n\nIt's not being a hypocrite. It's shoring up your defenses so you can engage in an efficient war. 
7	When you're an INFP but n% extraverted, where n is any positive integer.
8	Im like 49% extrovert and 51% introvert. So life is a big wtf should i do most of the time
7	One year I decided to put together a little get together for my birthday. Because I‚Äôm INFP and I love people, I quickly started to invite everyone. I invited about 100 people, hyped up my party for a week, and got other people excited. On the day of my own birthday party, I would of been content to just take a nap.
35	*When you base your personality on percentages*
7	facts. I‚Äôm literally a contradiction. I don‚Äôt like going out to socialize but I really want to go out and socialize ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6	Hitting the infp-a crowd I see. I'm pretty damn close to 50/50 introvert/extrovert and I love having plans but sometimes it feels like I am incapable of making them.
3	Ugh, this is me exactly. I actually socialize really well, when I can drag myself out of my room. I just got a new job and am really liking  my coworkers and my boss is impressed with me too. It's not easy - but sometimes you simply have to fake it to make it. That's what I've been doing for years. Feign confidence. 
3	they only look perfect and amazing because you like to see the best in others. it works best if you get paid and the people need you.
3	Mood
3	When everyone you used to associate with is too busy for you and your life outside of work becomes nonexistent you start wishing you could find big crowds, no matter how much you love alone time 
2	Tests are all telling me I'm super introverted but I know I'm almost 50/50 from experience
2	WHY IS DIS ME üôÉ
2	Oof yeah I reeeallly walk the line between introvert and extrovert so it‚Äôs this constant catch-22 of wanting to be around people but not having the energy to acquire people to be around :/
2	Socializing is painful.
2	Lol I got these results too, the struggle is real
2	I like about 5 people out of every 100 but those 5 are so awesome that I keep socializing in hopes of finding such people. And then I stop for a while because it exhausts me 
2	I'm in this picture and I don't like it
2	Yep and I think I was about 40% extroverted too
2	This is incredibly specific who are you and how did you know about my forty percent I feel attacked
2	I like being included, I hate being left out. I hate being included.
2	I relate, but like in a different way.... Its more like, when you are 40% extroverted and you want to go out and make friends! So you do and it's great but then you realize friendships require keeping in contact over the phone and that takes away from your precious recharge time. And you cant keep adding in new people or you will never have time for you. So then you have to learn how to demand your space and then you watch as friends and family leave. (Because your the only person who ever reaches out.) 
2	maybe

10	Do you feel stressed and/or anxious because of daily life and responsibilities? If so, how do you deal with that stress?	I get stressed out really easily, especially when I think about what I have to get done, and I was wondering if other INFPs share this feeling. Recently, I've been a bit better at being organized, so I think part of being less stressed is making sure you're organized whether it's using a planner or putting reminders into your phone. For me, I found that using a Google doc to write a list of everything I need to do really relaxes me. Idk why, maybe it's because I like the format of Google docs. Anyway, I know I went off on a tangent there, but basically, I'm open to discussing anything stress/anxiety related. Or really anything that's one your mind at all because this sub is great and I love discussing stuff with you all :D
3	I make a list of the things that are bugging me and need to get done, and I try to get them done the soonest I can. Sometimes I pick some of those errands and place them somewhere in my daily schedule. Maybe lunch break or after work... \n\nIf I get a burst of productivity, I tend to knock out as much as I can. I used to procrastinate a lot, but realizing how much better I enjoy life without much of the stress has led me to be a little more disciplined.\n\nThat being said, I have a very high tolerance for stress which sometimes can really backfire because I forget about responsibilities or postpone them to the very very last moment. 
3	I get stressed out so easily!! I feel overwhelmed with all the responsibilities that come with being an adult. Making lists and being organized helps for sure, but I still feel anxious and stressed out most of the time. I think that since we feel things so deeply, it makes things way more stressful than they need to be.
2	I can completely relate in everything!\nBut sometimes even planning doesn't help me. I mean, I often get distracted anyway and have to plan again because I didn't do what I had to. Lol\n\nAnxiety can be either good or bad: if I have time it will just remain anxiety because I will procrastinate anyway, if the deadline is near it helps a lot
2	Yes because of random events.\n\nDeep breaths, let the emotion passes.\n\nResponsibilities? No. I do stuff, I write things down, evaluate, I terminate activities that indicate to have little to no yield, I break the problem into steps... I tell people when I'm overburdened and cannot do the tasks on time. I put an effort to correct my mistakes.\n\nI do forget and make mistakes and there certainly is a time when the fear tries to overtake me but I will not let any of that define me. 
2	I absolutely get super stressed. Maybe part of me doesn‚Äôt care about doing the stuff I need to do, even though I know I will *have* to do it. Idk, it‚Äôs just a problem I‚Äôve always had and a habit I‚Äôve never been able to shake. How do I deal with it? Poorly. And whenever people give me tips on organization and time management, I just don‚Äôt even listen anymore. I‚Äôve heard it all (making lists, taking things a step at a time, scheduling stuff, including breaks) and it doesn‚Äôt help whenever I‚Äôve tried them. I just figure stuff out as I go along. What I really want in stressful times is for people to say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if you get this stuff done at all, I still love you, and you‚Äôre still a wonderful person,‚Äù but everybody wants to be a problem solver, (which doesn‚Äôt help me, as I said), so I‚Äôve never heard that. And it just makes me feel worse because I know I can‚Äôt do that stuff. I don‚Äôt know. I like to think there‚Äôs something beyond just trying harder, getting more organized, staying focused. All of that just feels like treating the symptoms rather than getting to the root of the issue. Maybe it‚Äôs a deficiency of love, from myself to myself, and not being loved the way I really need to be (having people make sure I know they still love me). So I feel you friend. Stay strong, and you are always loved.
4	In danger of developing a crush	Another embarrassing relationship post... I might delete it (as always) when my brain isn't fried from being super tired.\n\nHas anyone sensed the danger of a developing crush? On someone it's a bad idea to crush on... Not going to go too specific into specific circumstances, but let it be known it is the case.\n\nFunnily enough, I thought she hated me, or at least was indifferent for a while. Turned out it was just my anxiety talking, because of course she didn't. I was so delighted to finally connect with her (a fellow infp... I hope she is not reading this) and develop our friendship through shared interests, tastes in books, etc. She is such a sweet, wonderful, lovely beam of sunshine and I just really enjoy being around her and talking to her. As friends, of course. When she laughs, my heart is filled with warmth. \n\nSo why am I so perverse? Why am I developing feelings for her? I started with denial. I repressed these feelings, but they're growing stronger. I wanted to get nearer to her, to cuddle her, I wanted to see her smile... Oh god that was so embarrassing to type. But I don't have a crush yet. That's a terrible idea. Partly, I refuse to date anyone because I have too many problems of my own and I think it's just a bad idea to date me in general. Partly, it's also because of other circumstances I shan't go into.\n\nIs it possible to repress my disgusting developing crush while continuing to build our friendship? I want to be with her... But... not in that way, yknow... I think....
1	I feel that same way all the time friend. But I have no answer for you. I found that regardless of how hard I try to not fall for someone, it will happen anyway sooner or later. If that‚Äôs the same for you then I‚Äôd recommend telling her. Especially if you have to be around her frequently. It really wrecks my mental health to repress feelings like that for too long. Good luck friend 
72	After a really long time, I decided to draw something again, and this is my first 'original' piece with no references used. I call it "It's up to me now, turn on the bright lights"

8	The one that got away; please share your stories	I saw an older post asking about stories for those of us INFPs who have a ‚Äúone that got away‚Äù what i wrote was way too long to comment reply but I wanted to share it. Thanks for the idea; writing this was therapeutic. I feel like other INFPs will relate to this..\n\n4 years ago in early summer 2015 i was about to turn 23...\n\nI had been talking to a guy and he was into me but i wasnt sure how i felt(platonic or romantic?), since i was still torn up from a short but tumultuous relationship I had a few months prior [at the beginning of 2015]. But he convinced me to go on a casual date after hanging out a few times. We had dinner which was good and then we went to the bar to meet up with his best friend and his best friend‚Äôs boyfriend; so it turned into like a double date thing. \n\nWhen we were walking to the bar my date says something to the effect of ‚Äúoh my god youre gonna meet my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend, he is so hot.‚Äù \n\nPart of me was like ew dont say another person is hot when ur on a date with me, but then i realized he was just trying to be funny and make conversation. This still made me extra nervous though, as i already was anxious just being out in public and now about to meet several new people. \n\nSo we get to the bar and my date introduces me. I realize that i actually know my date‚Äôs best friend by association. My date‚Äôs best friend is not someone who is traditionally attractive but he has one of those personalities that he lands people who are attractive/very attractive; & well then of course his boyfriend was super charming and attractive, as my date had told me earlier. This made me feel super insecure. I immediately thought to myself ‚Äúwow ill never be good enough or attractive enough to date someone like him‚Äù. But I continued on just trying to get past my negative thoughts. \n\nAfter we all kinda did our introductions, i took a passive role in the group convo and i kinda just listened to them talk. Eventually my date and his best friend went to go get drinks or something so i was left alone with his best friend‚Äôs boyfriend. \n\nWe randomly started talking about something we had in common (we had both lost a lot of weight semi recently) and started actually hitting it off, i was pleasantly surprised, i didn‚Äôt expect him to be so nice and actually a decent human. \n\nAfter a bit we went to a different bar for a while then last call came around and my date offered to drive us all back to our places. \n\nOnce we dropped them off and we were on our way to my place i told my date that he could stay at my place if he needed to because he looked super tired and his place was a farther drive. My date asked me what i thought of everyone and i said they were fun and that he wasnt kidding about his best friends boyfriend being very attractive. We got to my place and went to bed and he was very respectful and didnt try to make a move which was refreshing because some dudes (especially gay dudes) are promiscuous af and i dont do hookups so it would have been... not a good time. \n\nA week or so later... i hung out with my date again and he says that his best friend‚Äôs boyfriend broke up with his best friend the next day after we all went out together and completely stopped talking to him. I was really surprised because i thought his best friend‚Äôs boyfriend was a really nice guy when i met him but then i was like well i guess he‚Äôs really not that nice?\n\nAfter talking for another week or so and hanging out again i realized that i just didnt have feelings for my date the way he had feelings for me so i knew that i needed to end it to avoid leading him on. He wasnt happy but i think he understood. \n\nAfter 2 weeks of feeling bad about it, i felt super lonely so it was back to grindr. I chatted with several new people but only with one person consistently-who i came across when I was back in my home town for fathers day weekend. \n\nAfter chatting for a few weeks the guy from back home asked to meet me/hang out on the 4th of july. I had plans to go home again for the 4th already so i said i might be able to. When the weekend of the 4th came around i got day drunk with my family and friends but then really sad after. So that night i hung out with him and stayed the night. We ended up getting along really well he also was respectful and didnt try to get me to hookup with him. I immediately had a big crush on him, but we were a two hour drive apart so i would only be able to see him when i came to visit my family; also he was only 19yo going back to college in a few months so neither one of us wanted to make a commitment. A few days after we hung out he asked if we can again the following weekend and since i worked that friday and sunday i said it would work if he could come to me this time and we can spend tome together saturday, which he agreed to do. So on like july 10 he made the drive to visit me i told him he could stay at my place; and after spending the weekend together he asked me to be his boyfriend. since we just met and he wasnt even out to his family yet i said i would have to think about it(i didnt even know if i wanted a relationship in general let alone a long distance one and there was someone else that i was even more interested in) But before he left i said yes because i did like him and i felt way too guilty to say no after he was so nice and drove to see me.\n\nConcurrently right before meeting up with the 19yo from home on july 4th weekend i also came across my previous date‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs super hot ex-boyfriend on grindr; so i decided to message him just to chat and he was very nice just like he was when i met him the first time. Eventually we ended up exchanging phone numbers. To my surprise he actually was super into me when we met (but we were both on a date with different ppl so..) and he said he was also nervous around me which i thought was adorable. According to him there was a reason that he broke up with his ex so suddenly. I still didnt trust him completely because I was still so messed up from the relationship i had at the beginning of 2015 however I was totally infatuated with him and i wanted to date him so so bad but he said he was only looking for friends when i asked why he was on grindr. Additionally he cohosted a radio show (yes of course i listened to it every morning) and I was working 2 jobs so we were both super busy with our careers and nothing really could happen besides texting occasionally over a couple weeks.. until i invited him to my birthday party. When i invited him he asked me when my birthdate was and gave me a super cute shout out on the radio (i still have the recording i took of it; yes i know thats prolly psycho of me) He ended up being able to come to my party where he got to meet my friends and they all loved him. (They were like ‚Äúoh you should date him!‚Äù) At this point i was getting mixed messages because he said he was only looking for friends but technically never said that directly to me but saying it more so as an answer for what are you looking for on grindr?(i didnt realize this at first). Actually my friends were confused at my party becuz i had also told them about the 19yo that i was technically dating but he couldnt come to my party because he had plans with his friends and was only 19 so he wouldnt be able to get in anyway. I explained that i had a crush on this (radio host) guy who actually could make it to my party and who i originally met when out on a date with someone else but he since he was apparently only looking for friends (aka what i mistook for what he actually meant) so im not going to pursue it. \n\nWe had a fucking ball at my party... i was already pretty infatuated with radio host guy BEFORE the party... but i really fell HARD for radio host guy AT my party. I knew i couldnt pursue it tho because i had my brand new 19yo bf who i had only known for 2 weeks and had been officially dating for a week at this point so i figured i should try and see how that works out and i just didnt know if i could trust radio host guy because he seemed too perfect. I felt really guilty for not telling radio host guy about my brand new 19yo boyfriend at the party but there was literally no appropriate time to bring it up. The next day he said he had a lot of fun and i told him we need to party again soon. A few days later i got put into a position where radio host dude saw new 19yo bf in my snaps and asked who he was and obvi i wasnt going to lie so thats how i told him that i had a boyfriend now and that was pretty much the end of my and radio host guy‚Äôs budding relationship/friendship aside from chatting occasionally on snapchat. \n\nI felt super guilty towards my new 19yo bf too; that i didnt tell him immediately that me and radio host guy were kinda talkingish when he and I started dating. But i explained everything and it ended up going over ok-ish. Except a month later my new 19yo bf ended up confessing to me that he was dating someone else when we first met 4th of july weekend. And that he ghosted his bf right before he came to visit me the next weekend so he could start dating me instead. Which was like actually shitty! \n\nSo i ended up missing out on a chance with a genuinely good guy that was my age, to date a 19yo piece of trash, our relationship went on for two years before we broke up because he tried to cheat on me and was an actual psychopath. I still feel tricked and manipulated. I wouldnt have chose to date the 19yo and not pursue radio host dude if he would have told me that he had a boyfriend when i met him. I would never date someone who is capable of doing what he did to his ex.\n\nMeanwhile cool awesome hot Radio host guy started dating someone else a few months after he and i stopped talking in 2015. They are still together to this day. I still have feelings for him to this day :(\n\nBut whatever i guess you live and you learn. One good take away is that this whole mess of a situation helped me realize i had serious self esteem issues and that i am worthy/good enough to date anyone if i so choose. It also taught me that i really need to start living for myself and start making decisions based on what i wanna do and not be guilted into doing things.\n\nSo yeah thats the story about how the one who got away was my date‚Äôs bestfriend‚Äôs boyfriend when i met him.\n\n(I also just have to make clear that my actions were genuinely transparent and innocent; more so than what it may seem. I was not trying to play anyone nor did i ever attempt cheat on anyone. My whole life up until summer of 2015 i looked down on people who would casually date multiple people at the same time. The experience I had summer 2015 was the first time i learned that anyone, including me, can actually have strong feelings for two different people at the same time and that doesnt make you a bad person, its more so how you handle those feelings. Part of me wishes i could have done things different and tried to date both of them/and not been so honest like other ppl do all the time but thats just not something i could bring myself to do, and i dont think i would have been able to live with myself if i tried.)
6	Something I've noticed with NFPs	It's like there's an avoidance to conflict in relationships because "it's too sad/depressing" that there is a conflict in the first place. Really it makes me think that NFPs actually just see a difference in values that can't be met in the middle and therefore don't want to talk about it.\n\nI think in reality by not talking about it ever and leaving their partner in the dark that there even is a conflict, they are actually making the decision FOR their partner rather than letting them make it for themselves whether they can live with the disagreement. It comes off manipulative, like the NFP wants to preserve their partner's fantasy of them so that the current happiness levels of the relationship sustain. Those happiness levels don't sustain though and there is always an undercurrent of anxiety about the topic and I feel its unfair to do this to a partner. If they can live with it then say your speal and live with it, if they can't let them move on and find someone who doesn't cause an undercurrent of conflict and anxiety.
5	Personally, if I truly care about someone *and* trust them enough to know that I won't eventually be abandoned and/or rejected, I will not avoid conflict nor will I be afraid to voice out my thoughts, views and opinions. I will try to find middle ground as soon as possible because I really can not stand fighting. (But if I can't imagine that middle ground being able to be found I guess there would be no point in bringing it up at all...?)\n\nHowever if I don't feel secure I will always and absolutely hide my true feelings just to protect myself and will 100% be an unsure, awkward mess around you. \nIf you know an NFP (or anyone I guess) who acts like this, maybe they *do* want you to only see their ideal, flawless self because they don't quite trust you to stay otherwise. Or that's how I function at least. 
2	This whole post seems skewed and pretty blame-y, not all "NFPs" act a certain way, and you're responsible for your own involvement with people and your own feelings. If someone causes you anxiety, realize that anxiety comes from you, not them. I think if you phrased more of this as an open question instead of a definitive judgment, that would yield you more positive results. But, on the other hand, I think that very action illuminates why you have this issue. Communication is a dynamic and you're really just pointing the finger here instead of looking at where you come into play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike the other poster mentioned, the person you're upset about and now projecting onto an entire type (or uh, two types, lol) probably doesn't really trust you enough to be open with you. This post doesn't really ooze of acceptance or of trying to be understanding, it more comes across as needing to assign blame to someone for an uncomfortable feeling you experienced with communication, as if every type besides NFPs were flawless in that regard; communication is extremely difficult regardless of type. Not looking at your own methods of communication and simply picking apart other's will just compound how difficult it already is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally have very little issue talking about conflict with those I'm really close to. If I'm not close to them or I simply don't trust them, I'm not gonna waste my time. There's no middle ground with people who very clearly aren't going to be receptive to what you'd actually say, there's just a very blatant lack of understanding, and there are plenty of hints that I pick up on that are very strong indicators about that outcome. I personally don't bother getting that close to them in the first place, and so honest communication tends not to happen.
1	You just weren't the one, get over it and move on. You obviously did not get it, and it was not compatible, that person more than likely did not feel safe to go deeper with you, you were tested and you did not pass. You have your own criteria too, and that person did not meet yours. 
1	I think middle ground can be met if INFPs use their Fe? Because being an INFP,there's been recently some issues in my friendship,I uses to be more avoidant but the reason of being avoidant is that I just didn't want any conflict but I think INFPs should really try opening up,although it can be hard because we can't really open up till there's a emotional bond but it's good to just open up to notify the person what's been going wrong so that they might help making the situation better,also whenever I go through a conflict with someone,I give myself time to think about it and bring out my Fe by first sustaining my Fi so we.can discuss about the conflict in a much more respectful manner,I hope everything's making sense 
2	INFP-INTJ RELATIONSHIP	I've already made a post about this, but basically my boyfriend (m/intj) and I (f/infp) are having troubles with the dynamic. \n\nAny tips? 
2	It's tough. I'm INTJ (woman) and my boyfriend is INFP. It took a long time for me to realize that he is just like he is, and even if I enjoy the differences between us, it's very hard to not see some of his behaviour as crazy and irrational. I still think it actually is crazy and irrational, but I've learned to assign it meaning thinking more about his point of view. And this is very, very hard for an INTJ, so he has to care a lot, or he won't accept the struggle.\nAnyway, you should understand that if he spends time with you, value your ideas and enjoy your presence, this means a lot more, for him, than a bladant act of romanticism.\nIf both sides can understand the other, it will be ok. But if one side keeps asking for something that is absurd for the other, it won't.\nFor example: I hate surprises and I prefer to tell him what I would like for my birthday, as a gift. I can't see why this could be a problem. But he feels like surprises are sweet and romantic, more than just buying for me something I ask. I explained my point and he explained his. We agreed that he'll be surprised, and I will ask for what I prefer.

31	I‚Äôm hungry	I‚Äôm an INFP and I have an insatiable appetite for learning, I love psychology, music theory, history, literature, and ect. I‚Äôm always interested in learning more, so what are you guys experts in or learning about? I‚Äôd love to learn (:
5	I love music and movies, poetry, books, and video games. The sharing of stories across all possible mediums really
3	I love learning in topics for my education job in areas like social emotional learning, behavioral stuff (helping kids with behavior), special ed topics..... but I also love learning things on my own time like lucid dreaming, astral projection, languages, environmental stuff.... so many things.  Soon I'm going to start studying to become a doula as well.
3	Have you ventured down the rabbit hole of musical temperament and tuning yet? That's a fun one that will blow your mind.\n\nI've been reading about the Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania, just on wikipedia but it's interesting and I was curious. It's a state that was formally formed in 1569 and marked by its proto-constitutional monarchy, which made it relatively progressive for Europe at the time, and low urban population, powerful nobility, and fledgeling bourgeoisie compared to other European nations. It was a powerhouse throughout the 16th and 17th centuries until falling into decline as it couldn't compete with the imperial expansion of the other major European powers, it suffered in a war with Sweden and an uprising in Ukraine, and its political system, which required consensus amongst the nobility on decisions, made it vulnerable to influence by foreign powers as bribing a single noble could grind decision-making to a halt. The Commonwealth was forced to cede territory to Austria, Prussia, and Russia in a series of partitions in the late 1700s until finally being fully absorbed by said countries in 1795. Neither Poland nor Lithuania would have statehood again until after WWI.
3	I've yet to come across an infp that isn't into psychology..
2	 I've got far too many interests and hobbies. Basically anything other than learning more for my IT job is very intriguing. Lately I've been reading about architecture.
2	Nice! I like learning about a wide array of topics too. Philosophy, novels, and cinema are my favorite topics. I also like sociology, psychology, and medicine. 
1	It takes a lot of time, but if you enjoy poetry and language. Try reading through some of the book of Psalms with assistance from a commentary. For instance, Psalm 119 is beautiful as is, but becomes even more interesting when you learn that it‚Äôs also a abecedarian poem in its original Hebrew format. 
1	omg! me too. I'm currently TAing a class on art theory, and it's the best thing in the world. \n\nwhat are you learning about?
1	Yes I can't get enough of history either! What time period/subject interests you most?

4	I‚Äôve been there sir or miss. It‚Äôs never easy, there‚Äôs no one anyone can say. It‚Äôs like someone died. The hurt, the betrayal, the confusion, the heartbreak. Just know, things change. Crazy things happen. You might get back together with them next week, next month, next year. You could be thankful that you are no longer with them when you find out how they change. This might be a blessing in disguise. Chances are you‚Äôre a great person and it probably has little to do with you ultimately. Just their own mind, own insecurities, own weirdness. Learn to be content in your own life first, then your love will come and want to stay forever.
5	I switched to investing heavily in a few friends, that and rocket league, I got really good at rocket league. 
3	If i knew id be inclined to tell you.\n\nTruthfully I have no answer, as many things in life have no answer, but i can only reccommend things. I find confiding in writing and journaling or talking to others about it help a lot. Other than that, time can do much to heal your scars.\n\nThat is what I've found at least, i hope it can help

2	i loved that movie so much! normally not the type of movie i would watch at all (i normally watch thrillers), but i love musicals and lady gaga so i felt inclined. it was one of the best movies i've seen in recent years. i've seen it twice now. it was devastating but i enjoyed having such a strong emotional reaction to a film.

3	Nice üòÄ when I go for a walk I like to pick up a piece of nature, grass, flower, twig to twiddle with, prob sounds a bit hippy dippy but feels like I'm getting energy from it as well as the relaxation of the twiddle!
4	Am I as good at reading people as I think I am?	I've told people that one of my strengths is being able to read people and their motivations. I've always been perceptive of how other people feel and the reasons behind their actions. I truly believe this to be a strength of mine and (I believe) I'm usually correct. \n\nHowever, I've been made fun of several times for being proud of this; people see me as overconfident and stupid. My roommate and I were just in an argument and she told me that I'm not as good at reading people as I think I am. It actually hurt me a lot when she said that and now I've been questioning whether I'm good at it at all. \n\nKinda just wanted to rant, but also wanted to know if any of you have experience with this.
8	Why do you need to tell other people? I've no doubt that you are perceptive about people, isn't that enough? Why does anyone else need to know that? If they spend enough time with you and get to know you, they will find out for themselves. You weaken yourself when you need to verbally announce to somebody what your strengths or good qualities are. You make yourself vulnerable and of course people are going to tell you that you're not as good as you think! You set yourself up for that. Power comes from allowing your strengths to display themselves. Telling other people about what you are capable of just makes you appear needy.
7	It can be quite dangerous to consider yourself to be so good at reading people, because you can fall into the trap of believing you are always right about someone and getting blinded by your bias. It's great when our intuition can help us and shield us from others' bad intentions, but if *several* people have pointed out to you that you're going overboard with this, there's probably a reason behind it. Perhaps you jump to conclusions about someone too quickly, or you're simply being obnoxious in the way you judge others.\n\n I understand this is something you're proud of, and that's great, but some self-reflection on this topic can't hurt you. 
4	Yes, I feel the same way about myself and this has been proven over and over again. When I fight with my gf she has attacked what I consider strengths as an infp, but that‚Äôs because she knows I‚Äôm not confident in much and this is something I‚Äôm confident of (kinda f-upped that she goes that low lol). You are more than likely very perceptive and intuitive and do read people well. There is nothing wrong with being proud of that because it‚Äôs a unique thing. I imagine the fight started over something else or if that was the issue then maybe there is something else that she is not saying that really caused her to lash out. We may be able to read people but it doesn‚Äôt mean we know every thought and feeling they have. Especially if they are not even sure themselves. Hopefully you guys can work it out. Don‚Äôt let her statement take away your confidence but be humble of your gifts at the same time. 
5	Well I've noticed INFPs tend to project a lot so that's something to watch out for. Basically don't make huge assumptions. You can't know all there is to a person. Basically you can inquire about them, just don't convince yourself you know the truth.
3	I think questioning your own "reading abilities" is the best way to keep them at an above average level. Once you gain too much confidence in it you trust it too much and completely forget about your possible biases.
2	You are confident in it, but you can't be sure about things like this. Also, many people have an urge to criticize others when they see shortcomings, or feel complelled to put someone's confidence down if they show too much of it.

8	INFP Soldier	(20 M)\nFor as long as I can remember I‚Äôve wanted to be a marine. Almost every man in my family has been in the USMC and fighting for what‚Äôs right in the world is an idea that really interests me. \n\nI have done a few things in my life that have made my friends and family proud of me. But I have never done anything that has really made me feel like I made a difference or has given me a sense of accomplishment. I‚Äôm not looking for bragging rights or to boast to anyone else. I just want to be able to look back on my life and know that I did something that mattered and made a difference for the better.\n\nI was wondering if any of you have had any military experience and I wanted to know how it made you feel (accomplished, a sense of pride or duty) as well as if you‚Äôd recommend it. \n
7	I'm in the military and a infp. It just feels like a normal job after a while. When you first join your sense of pride and belonging sores to new heights but after a few years that wanes. With that being said it is a small brotherhood that will always accept even though we make fun of each other mercilessly.
3	My husband is an INFP and he is in the Air Force. He didn't join for any real altruistic reasons though ‚Äîit was a job for him and a way out. \n\nOne thing I admire about his outlook is his sense that he can make a difference even in small ways. For example, he is going to be deployed to a location this summer which neither of us agree with (the US is in many morally-objectionable wars right now). But his outlook on it is that he can do a lot of good even in a bad situation, and in fact, the world needs more good people to be in bad situations. So even if, for example, he befriended a few locals on the ground, listened to them, and tried to do right by them, etc, that would be a lot of good that would not have happened otherwise. In this sense, INFP's, who tend to have loads of empathy for others, are a great fit for the military.\n\nTwo other things to consider are 1) the intense structure/bureaucracy and 2) the authority.  If you can handle crushing bureaucracy and don't mind that you belong to the military in almost every sense‚Äîthey own you‚Äî you'll fare well. My husband appreciates the structure because he has little naturally, so that's a good balance. He accepts but doesn't love the authority piece. It becomes complicated at times because they really do own him. If I get pregnant, for example, they don't care at all. They can and will still order him anywhere on earth, and there's a good chance he can miss the birth. He's missed funerals too. About half the military folks we've met have missed the birth of a child. You're young, so that may not matter now, but it might someday. Hope this helps!
2	My brother just graduated from marine corps boot camp. I have wanted to be a navy seal since I was 7 and will definitely be joining a branch after highschool. I probably won‚Äôt fit in that well as an infp but I really want to be disciplined and change for the better 
2	I did ROTC for only my freshman year in college. I chose not to continue since my reasons for joining were weak. I had no specific reason that would bring me into the military. I wanted to help people, but that can also be accomplished outside of the military. I never saw myself as working long-term (renewing contracts) in the military, and instead, I was viewing it more as a way to pass the time and learn more about myself. I wanted to travel, but I can do that outside of the military. Also, I just felt like I didn't belong. Nothing I wanted to do needed the military behind me to support me to do it. I had no absolute ties to the military, so I had nothing to keep me in. \n\nI believe that if you choose to join, you need a grounded reason. I just couldn't find a reason that got me interested enough to join.

What am I saying, every single moment!\n\nThey refill me with energy, but it's also difficult to have true deep relationships to share a real, genuine, deep hug with. \nNot counting that some people don't like that much body contact and end it too soon! üò≠\n\nLuckily my INFJ boyfriend enjoys cuddles too‚ù§ (even if not so much like I do, but he is okay with me being a love-seeking koala all the time)\n\nAnyway I still need hugs from someone else, but I haven't such a deep relationship with any friend yet. *sigh*\n\nWhat are your experiences/feelings about hugs?
3	YESSS!! I CRAAAAVE THEM
3	I really like hugs as well. I always thought I got it from my grandmother, because she always gets hugs whenever family members walk into her house. I also like hugs from friends, but it doesn't happen often, as most of my friends have a personal space bubble they don't usually like being breached. That said, a couple of my (female) friends reckon I'm a great hugger, one even coming to the drunk conclusion that a way I could get a girlfriend would be to wear a shirt that said "free hugs" to the nightclubs.\n\nThere is something energizing about them, but I wouldn't call myself dependant exactly, I just know that when I do finally get a girlfriend, she'll probably end up getting a lot of hugs from me.
3	I really don‚Äôt like being touched at all. Because of this I really appreciate the hugs I get from the people I do let touch me. My older brother gives the best hugs in the world. 
3	I must admit I'm rather hug dependant, a few people I know have told me that I give brilliant hugs, \n\nI'm not necessarily sure what gave me the need for hugs, but ever since I left home 3 years ago, I pretty much run off them, It gives me a massive burst in energy, or even just makes the worst day, slightly better. The SO doesn't enjoy hugs but does give hugs when I ask for them, and will often give hugs if he can see I'm not doing the best.\n\nI'd like to hug more people, but I have massive trust issues and as such, feel like hugging someone is sorta "showing the vulnerable side" of my life
40	Music is just the best thing this world has to offer	I feel like music just hits me at such a fundamental level. I've been listening to an Alice in Chains pandora station at work and I forgot how much I love some of the better 90s music.\n\nOne of these days I'll learn to use Spotify. Tried it once and got fed-up with how not user friendly it was.
4	I must disagree, I prefer buttered toast.  Brings a smile and warm contentment every time.
5	Anything is the best with caffeine. 
3	music is literally the reason I'm alive right now! highly suggest learning spotify asap! it's worth it- there's SO much music on it. soundcloud too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwho are your favorite bands?
2	I apologize because this has nothing to do with your post but I saw RuPaul in your username and I totally started fangirling. For some reason I felt the need to tell you this haha. RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race is the best thing ever invented and I don‚Äôt know you internet stranger, but I have gained a ton of respect for you and your existence. :) 
2	Music is the gate to my inner world, and thats why I decided to study and make it. Also we can never stop discovering new kinds of music and be amazed. Have you ever listened to Robert Rich s sleep concerts? Amazing trips/meditation. 
2	I like the sound of engines
2	Omg same here! I love music and also I like better pandora....I tried to use Spotify but I don't really like it/get it. Pandora is way better or YouTube!
2	I'm very passionate about music as well, I feel you.\n\nSpotify doesn't really seem that bad. Maybe frustrating with it's frequent ads, otherwise pretty okay.
37	What do you think about this?	
4	Cool, but giving me anxiety right away. üòÇ
5	Reminds me of something demonic
3	Really intense, and yet the figure in the picture is being so calm. 
2	Calm evil waiting in silence

3	Dream interpretation? [Long]	Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt remember a small beginning portion of my dream but the dream had a mysterious orange tint to it. So, this is how it went. I am not the best writer so please bear with me.\n\nI am sitting on the couch at my house watching tv and I notice that there is this small bump on the corner of my house. I go and check it out to see what‚Äôs causing it. I lift the carpet and realize it‚Äôs underground and not the carpet. I grab a shovel and start digging. I‚Äôm digging for a bit and I suddenly hit something. I see it‚Äôs a small package. I open it up and there is things in it. \nFirst package: * I can‚Äôt remember this part unfortunately * I do remember that there as a candy wrapper in this package that has a heart drawing on it. I have never seen this candy before in my life. \nI‚Äôm curious if there is anything more so I continue digging. \n\n\nAfter a while I once again hit something else. This second package contains a pair of old jeans, a single dirty converse shoe and a small shoe box full of random things. In this box, there is this small book which looks like a travel book but from a place I had never heard of before. It looked like a small forested island with a beach side town. I even looked it up in an atlas and there was no mention of it. But the book was so well detailed and had so many pictures of all the locations that it was hard to believe it was a made-up place. Among the book was a picture of this chubby young man in flip flops and shorts at the beach with his family smiling and posing for the picture. Along with all these other things, there is the similar candy wrapper with the heart drawing in this package too. \n\n\nI get more curious and I continue digging.  After a while I once again hit another package. This package contains random clothes, a notebook with notes on it but were no longer readable due to washed out ink, an old camera with a little power still in it and once again there was this wrapper for a heart shaped candy that I‚Äôve never seen before. I turned on the camera to see if I could find any more information to all this and saw that she had taken regular pictures of sun set, her playing with her dogs on this rolling hill as the sun was setting and of a family football party she was attending earlier that day. Weird thing about one of the pictures was that one of the pictures showed her celebrating the final score of the game but on looking back I remembered the other team winning the game that year. Confused I double check on google to make sure if I was right and google showed that I was right. I get even more curious now and am wondering what this all means. So I continue digging. \n\n\nI am digging for a while but nothing this time. Just as I am about to give up, I hit an opening. It looks to me like there is a hole in the ground that leads to a small room. I continue digging until the hole is big enough for me to put my head and my arms in. I take my flashlight and stick my head in. On turning the torch on, I discover it‚Äôs a room full of old travel books from all over the world with a yellow cover. There were piles and piles of these travel books stacked all over. I jump into it and start exploring but there was nothing other than these books. After I was done looking around, I go back to the spot where I was digging earlier and start digging again but this time the ground is much harder. I‚Äôm using all my strength but am making no progress at all. After digging for what seems like forever, I see that I have made a small hole in the ground but accept the fact that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go any further. As I am about to give up, I catch a glimpse of this plastic bag coming out of the ground. I dig a little more and grab its side and pull it out. The plastic bag had the same heart shaped candy that I found in all the previous packages. While the package was open, there was still a few more left in it. \n\n**** Unfortunately I woke up after this and don‚Äôt know what happened further.

4	Riding and Writing	Riding because that's all I have when I'm upset. \n\nRiding because its fast moment in one direction with a racing heart that wants nothing more than to love and gets stopped every. single. time. it tries to.\n\nTwice in one year, damn\n.\nMy track record is fantastic. \nNo pun intended. \n\nRiding because the tears fall backwards when you are doing laps around the park. \n\nRiding because eventually these laps become all I think about and you will fade. \n\nNow. \n\nWriting.. \n\nWriting because seeing my feelings in words scares the shit out of me...\n\nWriting so I don't feel alone like I currently do. \n\nWriting because I'm so embarrassed I opened up the little bit I did. \n\nWriting because I cannot talk to you\n\nWriting because I'm over all these thoughts in my head that get tangled with my heart while my soul sits on the sidelines and just stares into the dark. \n\n\nI'm fine, \n\nExcuse me while I drown these feelings out with miles.\n\n\nINFP thoughts \nSeptember 7, 2018\n
1	What is trust?	Is it a willingness to believe, or something else entirely? I've thought about this a lot today and found that I don't really know how to describe trust very well. \n\nHow does it show in your behavior and thoughts when you trust someone? And how does it show in others' behavior that they trust you? What is trust like to you guys?
4	Trust can be a lot of things I guess. For me it's mostly feeling safe to be myself around the people I trust. I don't have to fear that I'm being judged for being me.\n\nAnd so trust for me is hard to give someone, it developes over time.\n\nBut what trust means for others... I do not know.\n
9	INFP's and Relationships	Im starting to get confused as to if i just have a bunch of sexual hangups that prevent me from casually hooking up or dating or if like its just not for me. Maybe its cuz i never really dated throughout my life and now everyone's already gone through hella dates and shit and im just worried due to inexperience and just being a ball of worry or do i just not even want to do that in the first place. like is there a point if im just gonna get myself hurt ya know, Kinda feel like i care too much about this sort of thing and it just keeps me in my house all day on reddit as opposed to making some "real" friends. of course im sure i couldn't make any real friends anyways, knowing enough about the weird artsy shit im into and the fact nobody gives a fuck about it. maybe i should just stop caring so much, but then again i really don't think i can. Good job if you can decipher this wall of emotion, I need a therapist bad, fuck insurance.
5	I also keep myself in the house all day and don‚Äôt have friends. No one has the same interests in me I always feel like no one likes what I like. So I just stay hidden. I feel this 
5	I‚Äôve found that having a few friends that are really close to you helps tremendously. If you can find just two or three people in your life to really trust as friends then they will help you out a lot. For me it‚Äôs my brother, and my best friend who lives across the hall in my dorm.  My brother constantly encourages me to talk to girls I‚Äôm interested in and they both keep my head above water when it doesn‚Äôt work out. I use to just bottle up inside and when things didn‚Äôt go my way I would just hide somewhere alone listening to music, but because of the trust I‚Äôve found in them, I‚Äôm able to tell them about the crazy stuff I think about and they help me work through it all. Regardless of how things turn out, having a few people to trust with everything I have is the most rewarding risk I‚Äôve ever taken. 
2	Me too. Im terrified of getting hurt so i never put myself out there but really im lonely and i want so badly to love
10	INFP males bad at getting dates.	I feel like an INFP male does not have the qualities that women typically want and it makes it hard for me to get a date. Being romantically involved with someone would be wonderful but after 26 years of being alive I feel like it is becoming less and less possible. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship nobody has ever called me their boyfriend. I just want to be in love and I want a healthy relationship. It hurts my self esteem and I don‚Äôt feel masculine. Getting girls is seen as a masculine thing and I am just horrible at it. I wish that I could become extroverted but it is really tough. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I think I am probably going to be alone forever.
13	You don't have that quality and that's okay. \n\nNot all women are Into forward men. I certainly am not. \n\nI believe if it's hooking up, women want forward men, if it's meeting someone to date, I personally like a more reserved man that let's me chip away at getting to know him. \n\nI don't think you'd meet someone through environments that require a lot of social bravery and pressure, like tinder, one on one outings or blind dates.\n\nYou'll most likely meet someone amongst a group activity or through mutual friends in a low pressure environment. \n\nI'd reccommend taking up a hobby. That's how my SO and I met.\n\nHe's the INFP im an ENFP and when he joined our hobby group, I instantly felt attraction to him and thought he was so sweet, adorable and hella good looking. He vibed well of my social leadership and bubbly nature. \n\nWe got chatting when our hobby group went out drinking and to see a band and flirted a little when we had a couple of drinks. He stuck to the corners, but I made an effort to connect with him when I was free. \n\nWe both hung out with different people throughout the night, but we'd gaze across the room and share eye contact and a smile.\n\nWe flirted more, he made me laugh a lot and from there I was done, I fell for him. We hung out again in the same group the week after, then proceeded to hangout one on one after everyone had left.\n\nWe've now been dating for 9 months and crazy for eachother. We're head over heels in love. It's the most beautiful, deepest, unique relationship I've ever had. 
3	It is okay not to be masculine. You just need a girl that is not so shallow that she only has to be with a masculine guy. Also it is okay to not be an extravert. Half the world is not an extravert, so it would be pretty lame if that half wasn't able to find someone.\n\nI am an INFP and I have had some success in relationships. My longest relationship was 7 years. My advice is to just be yourself. Be open, honest, and fearless. Be independent, wise, and kind. But just be yourself, that is number one. Also confidence can go a long way. So if you can learn to become confident that will probably help immensely. :)
3	I will give you my advice. This works for me it may or may not work for you.\n\nSo having confidence is important , so is charm, and having a honest compassionate mentality. \n\nTry not to look for someone with good looks. Just be positive, be kind, be honest, and make her feel cared for with compassion and honesty. \n\nIf you can drive and have a independence , that is also very good and a boost to self esteem and self confidence. \n\nLike I said earlier - don't go after women who look attractive. Go after a women who has a good heart, good charm, friendly nature, fun and caring, and a women who is more about good personality not looks. \n\nThe biggest bad thing for women is lying and Selfishness. Just be good to her and show a lot of love and you will be alright. \n\nIf you have emotions like I do, then you prefer probably get super horny. Passion romance charm and being a kind sweety is really great. \n\nAll in all - depending on where you located - women with ugly expectations can exists. \n\nHope you find true love and have lots of pleasure and happiness. \n\nGoodluck. 
2	Start saying yes to things you wouldn‚Äôt normally say yes to. It will get you out and around people more and you may find something that you didn‚Äôt know you enjoyed. \nThe second part is the hard part, when you find someone you like, ask them for coffee and just let them into you head and try to not think of how big of a risk it is. Even if it doesn‚Äôt work out (which for me it rarely does) having genuine conversation with someone feels good. I‚Äôve learned a lot about people and myself by just risking letting someone in for a few minutes. It also gets a little easier each time you do it.  \nGood luck and stay positive my friend 
2	Move to a big city where masculine and feminine don‚Äôt mean anything. Sell yourself with your best qualities and be real. Don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúget girls‚Äù  do your own thing. Date another introvert that you meet on the internet. Order takeout every night and never leave your home, happily ever after 
1	I'm an INFP female and bad at getting dates! I assume because I'm too afraid to ever pursue anyone myself. They have to come to me or not at all. Are you the same way? I personally feel that masculinity is way more dynamic than getting girls, being strong, and all the other stereotypical things. What qualities do you wish to have in your best self? How do you want to feel as a man? What does authenticity mean to you? Follow that.  I feel you on the introversion problem. Someone told me to seek discomfort when it comes to social situations and I think it's good advice. Even if it seems stupid, start with a small risk you know? Ask someone what they're reading at a coffee shop or give someone a compliment. At the end of the day, we can't predict the future so it's best to not torture ourselves with the thought of being alone forever. I know, easier said than done. 
1	You gotta just boss up and go get what you want. This may include trying lots of things, but you can‚Äôt give up! If you consistently are trying your best, you will eventually find the perfect girl. I‚Äôm saying this and I haven‚Äôt even found her yet! In fact I‚Äôm just as bad at getting dates... trust me. I have learned however that we INFP males just have to try a lot harder, but the reward will be so much better after all the effort. 
1	I wouldn't worry about it too much‚Äîbut try to put yourself in situations where you will meet potential relationships! Start saying yes more often to social gatherings, especially if cute girls will be there.\n\nI'm an ENFP and I fell for an INFP, and I had to make ALL the first moves. Now we're married and we laugh about it.
1	This looks like a bunch of assumptions that you let society impose on you.\n\nThe stereotypical masculinity is probably not what you should strive for. Men and women are just humans and are very diverse. Some women will desire extroverted and very confident guys, some will be the opposite. Also, getting girls? Most girls don't want to be 'gotten', they want to start from genuine and respectful interactions. For a healthy relationship, what's important is acceptance of yourself, of your situation, and going into socializing with a positive outlook.\n\nYou can find girls that have things in common with you. Try asking them about themselves, focus on the pleasure of interaction, show that you're a trustworthy guy. If you try (with moderate effort to not get burned), eventually things will happen.\n\nSorry about the way I worded the comment. I'm writing from a female standpoint and I would rather befriend a guy like you than a stereotypical 'alpha male'. Many of us girls feel lonely and desire relationships too. Both parts just need to reach out to each other.
1	Finding a good female specimen can be hard even for the most masculine male now-a-days. Your pool of possible specimens is much smaller than usually so yeah, good luck! I would watch some MGTOW content, maybe that can easy your pain a bit.
9	Pretty much, I guess..

Turned out the girl was a coke addict and an alcoholic and kept trying to get me to go home with her later so there was that. \n\nI guess what I‚Äôm saying is... do coke and drink alcohol so u have the courage to ask out anyone that smiles at you. \n\n

16	still avoiding potential meaningful connections yaaay	Growing up I always thought my ‚Äúweirdness‚Äù would go away as I got older but, now at 24 I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs never going to go away. This is just the way I am.\nInstead of feeling bad for myself though, i have made the decision to get out of my comfort zone more often and try new things bc i understand now that almost all of the worry exists only in my head.\n\ni have never had a real boyfriend so my sisters had a talk with me this weekend and made me get a bumble. i‚Äôve chatted with some guys on there but every time we try to meet up i flake and make up an excuse.\n\nyesterday i was going to meet up with a really cute guy that i was really excited about! i told myself i had to go NO EXCUSES bc he was so cute and so far we had had good conversation but instead my dumbass decided to meet up with a different guy  i‚Äôve been hanging out with that i already know i don‚Äôt like (let‚Äôs call him roger)\nhe‚Äôs so different from me and kinda bad?\nbeing around him is a little scary sometimes but i like it??\nbut i don‚Äôt like him? it‚Äôs so weird. i just like being around him and he‚Äôs kind of obsessed with the fact that i‚Äôm ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúsooo unlike him‚Äù and all of that makes me feel good in a way.\nlike for the most random things he‚Äôll get so excited about like somewhere in a conversation i told him i cared about deer that get hit on the road and how my mom and i feed them sometimes when they come to our backyard and he‚Äôs just like ??????? how are u the nicest person ever??\nbut i dont say it to seem like i care SOOOo much about the environment or to seem like the nicest, most caring person in the world. i just like to feed deer w my mom bc they‚Äôre cute but he‚Äôs so shocked bc i feel like he‚Äôd never do anything like that.   i also made a paper star with a receipt one day when we went out to eat and he was like ‚Äú??? OKAY HOOW TF are u so creative i don‚Äôt understand!??!‚Äù   and to me it‚Äôs just something that i do every time when there‚Äôs paper scraps like at school or when u get a straw wrapper but he‚Äôs like shook bc it‚Äôs too girly for him and has kept the paper star in his car since then.\n\nalso the other day were talking about using my moms makeup and i said ‚Äúoh yeah but that‚Äôs not sanitary‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúomg hell yeah SANITARY YOURE ALL SMART N SHIII‚Äù \nim like ???? do u not know what sanitary means? and in my head im like HOW TF AM I HANGING OUT WITJ A GUY THAT FLIPS OUT BC OF THE WORD SANITARY?! but at the same time i thought it was so funny!!! \n\ni met roger through my mom‚Äôs friend, he‚Äôs like her nephew or something. \nsooo spent the whole day smoking in his apt and abandoned the opportunity of meeting a new person who could have been great.\nalso now i‚Äôm scared that roger is going to get bored of me, even though i would never introduce him to my family i know i would feel so hurt if he didn‚Äôt want to see me anymore lmfao this sucks cause i don‚Äôt care for him but i like him and i want him to want me!! \n\ni don‚Äôt know why i keep investing in these relationships with men i know i don‚Äôt see a future with but it seems less scary than meeting someone new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: was supposed to meet a cute boy for a date, flaked and spent the entire day smoking with a guy i don‚Äôt want instead.\n\n*ps: so sorry for the terrible grammar. this phone has the automatic punctuation turned off and i was too lazy to do it manually.
6	 I guess is it maybe somewhere in your heart you feel like you‚Äôre not ready for the commitment of a serious relationship yet so I guess it could‚Äôve been for the best?
5	I‚Äôm a guy but I do that same kind of thing, not online. But I constantly avoid people (especially girls I think are pretty or cool) I know I want to talk to. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same for you, but I realized that I avoid them because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll get hurt again if I let them in.

5	ISTJ-Probably the next worst thing for an INFP	I dated an ISTJ and she recently broke up with me despite me begging her to stay. She was very religious and expected me to do the same things she did. I made compromises but unless it's exactly her way, she doesn't see them. All in all, an ISTJ would never understand you. Don't bother explaining, just won't work.\nI think INFPs should seek out Ntypes. Stypes especially with a J function are the worst.
7	ENFP here who was MARRIED to and ISTJ.\nCan confirm, not the best combo. \n\nThey just don't get your emotional brain and have not much of a sensitive, creative or intuitive side.\n\nI think the Extraversion and Intraversion can work together, and the judgement and Perceiver can work provided, there's good communication and respect.\n\nBut I think feelers should stick with other feelers and Intuitives should stick with other intuitives.\nOr both. 
3	My father is an ISTJ. \nI try to avoid discussions with him because they won't lead to anything anyway, except for me getting angry and him not understanding my point of view.\nWe love each other anyway (just because we're relatedüòÇ)
2	Same feeling with an ISTP and ISFP. \n\nENFJ might think our imagination is cute over realistic, they're continually supportive
2	That is rough. Breakups are never easy. I don't know though if it is fair to judge a whole group of people based on your interaction with 1 ISTJ. I am sure there are lots of INFPs who are in happy and healthy relationships with an ISTJ. According to socionics, INFPs and ISTJs make great activity partners, meaning they have fun doing activities together. There always has to be some form of compatibility too though. Meaning not all INFPs and ISTJs are compatible, but that does not mean all INFPs and all ISTJs are incompatible. 
2	xNxP is the best combo for me imo
2	I dated an ISTJ for a few months years back and things ended on good terms (though I'll admit it was still frusturating) when we continually failed to get on the same wavelength. We've stayed friends though and still enjoy eachothers company. I check in on him when I know there are things going that will cause him stress (Having to find a new apartment most recently, so much worry over such tiny details) and he checks in on me every three weeks on the dot then, in response to whatever panic-induced babbling I serve him, offers kind words with which are usually so fantastically off the mark and yet so consistant and warm that I've come to value them as much as the back and fourth of other friends who actually "get" me.   \n\n\nIt's like we're two very different people who have both taken the time to read the manual on how the other works and even though it's not natural in the slightest it feels nice to know that someone cares enough to go through the trouble.   \n\n\nI don't think it would have but I find myself wishing it had worked out sometimes. He's got some annoying politcal views I can't get past and I'm pretty sure my ~~occasional~~ constant dingy-ness drives him mad but there's just such a warmth there even if I have to squint a bit to recognize it. 
2	vision is not an attribute that is restricted to N types.  \nITSJ is a profile for someone with a perceived context of urgency / emergency. The priorities are survival and shortcuts toward results.  \nu cannot expect growth from them if you do not first resolve the context and all the unmet needs.
2	I mean, sorry that it didn't work out BUUUT. I couldn't disagree more. ISTJs are great.\n\nI think it's easy for people in subreddits like this to dismiss SJ types for dumb ass reasons because they don't really care to know more about them than what some uneducated generalization gives. *They can't understand my MIND~~~~ * The top post right now is a meme that's literally titled "haha üòÇ" and that's it. How deep can you really be here? \n\nAnd then I'm supposed to be with N/NF types? Theoretically, that's not true. TJs and FPs are our best match. And PERSONALLY, why would I ever choose an NFJ or NTP over an ISTJ? Big yikes from meI feel like they are the ones that could never understand me.\n
2	I'm dating a guy who I think is ISTJ, though he hasn't taken the test so I'm not 100% sure. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but I think we work really well together so far. Maybe this is because we share many of the same core values? \n\nDoes anyone (INFPs) have a positive experience being in a relationship with an ISTJ? This thread is really scaring me üòÖ

1	Good talk. You're certainly a well developed INFP
134	In case someone needed to read this	
8	Thank you. 
1	I'm scrolling through reddit trying to avoid thinking about how soon the doctor is going to do that nose thing to see if I have the flu \*cries\* tell me that is not worse than being sick......  I know it won't kill me but omg
1	I needed this. Or something like it. Trying not to think of a recent bad breakup. Should be looking for a new job and getting my life back together. All I'm doing is drinking and trying not to think of her.
1	Thank you for this.
3	Do you ever struggle with no will to invest into/build your life?	My BF (22M) who's an INFP role me last night that he struggles with a will to live.\n\nHe isn't financially responsible, he doesn't take care of his health, doesn't eat well, doesn't have any interest in pursuing further study, doesn't take care of his home. \n\nHe said it's not out of not knowing how to or being lazy. He said he simply just has no will to live and that what's the point if he does all this. \n\nConfirming: THIS IS NOT SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. \n\nYet on the flip side, he can be incredibly driven and obsessive over his work ethic, self image, career, travelling, being independant, being successful. \n\nIt's like the depression conflicts with his self-pride.\n\nAny insight for his girlfriend? We're pretty serious and I'm concerned he won't ever have a desire to build a life with me. 
4	I‚Äôm a 22F INFP and I can definitely relate to this. I have trouble eating everyday and tidying up and things most people just do. My fianc√© will remind me to eat and will usually eat with me so that I eat enough everyday. We will usually set out days to clean together and we just jam to music. He reminds me to put half my paycheck into savings. He pretty much just helps motivate me in areas I need help in. And this is something we‚Äôve had to work on and talk about. I help him with letting go and relaxing and he helps me be serious and get things done. I do suffer from depression but I‚Äôm doing everything to overcome it. I think you should talk to him and see how you can help each other grow and build together. I never had any money saved up at all and would always be broke before my fianc√©. We just sat down one day and I was like okay you gotta help me here. 
2	Yeah I asked him to help but he was already mentioning I was bad with money and I couldn‚Äôt argue with him because it was definitely true haha. But yes if you want to help him with it sooner rather than later I‚Äôd ask him if he wanted to be better with money and then ask him if he wanted help with it. The reason I‚Äôm not good with money is because i honestly don‚Äôt care much for it it doesn‚Äôt motivate me but realizing I need it to get a house have a family etc it made me want to get better about it with some help. All the enfps I know are so sweet so I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be upset even if he didn‚Äôt want the help. We just suck at valuing money don‚Äôt hate us haha
1	My only 2 friends are enfp I love them! I think if you try to approach it nicely he will take it the right way. I know my enfp best friend is super independent and great with money and everything. I know you‚Äôll be able to help in a caring way! I think it‚Äôll work out for you! 
1	I don‚Äôt care for materialistic things. I just can‚Äôt make myself buy that stuff because I don‚Äôt care about it. Money in general isn‚Äôt what is important to me. I value my experiences and people way more. Money can‚Äôt buy happiness for me. I do buy things and get happy about it but usually I regret a lot I buy because I don‚Äôt even know why I bought it. I don‚Äôt enjoy being broke but there‚Äôs worse things to me. Right now I have a couple thousand and that‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever had in my life. I impulsively buy things but I don‚Äôt care because money has no value to me. It‚Äôs so weird and I never know how to explain it to people haha 
1	Yes. I make sure all my bills are paid first before anything. I‚Äôve always had a job since I was 16 and I just don‚Äôt like to stress over that stuff even though I usually do a little anyway 
3	Find myself stressing before meetings.	It's like this: I can prepare before hand. That's fine, but if I try to de-stress after that, what I really want to do is isolate myself and keep to myself until the meeting. But this creates a lot of guilt, because it feels like I should be somehow pumping up for it, getting into it. Breath exercises don't seem to work.  
6	INFP books	This week I picked up the book CIRCE written by Madeline Miller. And although I have only read 20% -  holy cow does she remind me of me (I am turbulent too). Circe is totally an INFP.  \nWhat are some books you have enjoyed that you can completely relate to the main character? 
4	Jane Eyre. At the start of the book, she's totally INFP, and when she grows up she's described more as an INFJ. Nevertheless, a great book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSong of Ice and Fire has some good INFP characters - Samwell and possibly even Daenerys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia - one of my favourites, I relate to Lucy a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Great Gatsby - I never saw anyone type Gatsby as INFP but I relate to him sooo much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHarry Potter - everyone always says Luna, but I've always related more to Hermione (nerdy, kind of an outcast) and even Ginny (very shy at first but secretly a badass).

6	The Paper Kites: The Perfect ENFP Band (x-post /r/ENFP)	Thought that you lovely INFPs might like this post, too! ;)\n\nDiscovered them a couple of months ago through Spotify, and went on one of their concerts in Vienna this month. The videos and music itself just describe the feeling of being an ENFP perfectly.\n\n[Revelator Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fi4T-yR8tM) (have just recently discovered a similar vinyl bar in my own city, love it!)\n\n[Electric Indigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWF5_wdqQj0) ("I don't like people, but I do love dancing!" lol)\n\n[Give Me Your Fire, Give Me Your Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybparFEZf2I)\n\nAnd many more!

2	Relationship search for infp expat	Hello all, I'm feeling a bit confused so thought I'd share my situation. I'm working abroad on a contract, in a country I don't think I want to settle long term. I think I would like to teach in Africa for a few years. I have two years left on my contract. I'm reluctant to start dating where I am now  as I'm not sure about settling here or taking somebody with me when I move. But two years is a long time to be single so not sure what to do. I don't really want to get involved with someone and then to leave them as it hurts. I'm 40 and had the same dilemma in the last place I worked and the pain of the separation was tough to bear. I have real wanderlust but it can be lonely! Any thoughts welcome, thanks
2	I guess its a tricky one...
1	Might have to be celibate for a few years :)
1	I guess it involves letting someone know early on what are some of your life plans such as relocating and discussing hypothetical situations and choices relating to it should things progress?
11	The Secret to a Good Life	Is understanding yourself.\n\nAnd understanding the world around you.\n\nThere's ups and downs and all kinds of confusing sh*t going on. The more you understand yourself, the better you are equipped to deal with this.\n\nI'm a fairly happy guy and I attribute this to the fact that Ive gotten to know myself.\n\nIf you understand yourself you can think more clearly, since you know your own biases. Sometimes I should to things but I hesitate. Earlier I might not have done these things but nowadays I do because I know and have accepted the fact that Im a slacker, and therefore I know there are somethings that Ill thank myself for doing later, despite hesitating.\n\nSimilarly there are things nowadays that I DONT do because I know that it isnt my style, and it saves me energy and time.\n\nIt helps in all sorts of situations. I know what to avoid and what to indulge because I know myself.\n\nI'm introverted, i dont care about status, I value freedom and empathy. This helped me choose a profession which I enjoy these days.\n\nI think we understand ourselves better by reflecting on our life, whether through writing or just simply by thinking, and by being honest with ourselves.\n\nSo get out (or in?) there and reflect and enjoy yourself. You are a truly unique being and you deserve to know and accept yourself :)\n\nhttps://professormofasa.wordpress.com
3	I agree wholeheartedly. Great and inspirational observations. Thank you!

5	Told my bff intj the truth	and it's likely I inadvertently activated her doorslam. :(\n\nI (infp, m) have a really close intj (f) friend. We've hung out as friends at least twice a month for some three years now, had great, long, random conversations (online and offline), shared ridiculous and dark-humor as well as gripes about life, and generally had a great time. \n\nI really liked her as a friend, gave her books I knew she wanted (that's proof, right?), listened when she needed to get things off her chest, and was happy as her go-to emotional sponge.\n\nShe was (surprisingly for me) really great to me on my birthday, treated me really special. Fell for her, simply because she was all physical and transparent with her feelings (an INTJ!) that day. Told her I loved her, a few days later. She loves me as BFF. Now on radio silence.\n\nFearful of the typical INTJ consequences when it comes to this. Really hoping against hope that I can be friends again.\n\nFML. I thought I was brave, saying so. With this new reality, I'm not sure I am. :(
5	Based on my similar experience with a male infj, she probably will be detached for a while to let you forget her. Maybe she will write you some brief and cold answers...Anyway she still cares a lot for you as a BFF. She's doing this for you.\n\nI know it will be so difficult to forget her, but the sooner you do, the better will be for both of you. I'm sure she suffers too in seeing you suffering for her.\n\nWhen this happened to me, I convinced him and myself I didn't see him in that way anymore, even if deep down I knew I still liked him (I did for months).\nI had to do this because I didn't want to lose him at least as a friend.\n\nI suggest you to meet new people, do something new and to keep watching around yourself... don't let this crush stop your life!\n\nAnyway, if you want to know how my story ended (but please don't think it will happen the same to you, I were just so lucky):\nAfter about one year we were still bffs and I was beginning to get interested in other guys around (even if I still liked him) and I was getting attentions by others as well...\nthen SUDDENLY he realised he liked me too!üòÇ\n4 years have passed and we are still together now *blushes*
3	INTJs can be weird about feelings. She probably just needs time to process this and she's feeling really awkward right now. Let some time pass, then try to rekindle the relationship in a friendly way. Try extra hard not to mention any feelings for a while. 
1	Easy. You are already talking about her as a friend in past tense. Don't.\n\nNegative emotions associated with a relationship with someone don't mean it's over. I know I often don't contact people, because inside I believe we aren't on good terms. That they don't like me for some reason. It's just a side effect of the need for harmony in relationships, which I believe is a very INFP thing to do, but it's taken too far. Sometimes things simply aren't as good as they were. But it doesn't mean this won't change.\n\nThey sky isn't falling and you aren't bad for being brave - that's actually pretty cool that you can be so vulnerable. What did you learn?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a female INTJ friend I fell for once. Lately we meet maybe once in two months. We have a strange friendship, mostly because I have very chaotic lifestyle and she has a "boring" one. And I don't talk much through text or phone. I worry a lot about why I am the one initiating the contact, about if I wasn't focused too much on myself when we last spoke, or if I wasn't too serious, too focused on my problems. But regardless of that I know we are friends and we will meet and talk and if there's an issue, we will work something out.

29	Is it normal for INFPs to be extremely picky about the writing in TV shows/movies?	Not so much about the overall plot, but the dialog between characters. Maybe it's the INFP superpower of detecting authenticity, but the moment a character says something thats just a little off for their character. I'm out!\n\nThis has become very problematic especially for TV series, where there are usually different writers for every episode and seasons.\n
8	I‚Äôm kind of the same. I have to either be invested because of something external or completely enthralled by the show or movie. My boyfriend likes to make fun of me for only liking fast-paced stuff but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
7	I find it easy to watch trash shows but bad acting/ overacting throws me off. 
4	I'm so picky with dialogue in movies. A good example was when I saw the last fast and furious movie in theatres cause my friends took me and I had to physically cover my mouth to keep from screaming at the dialogue and a lot of other parts.
3	I absolutely agree! I find it very cringy and almost unbearable if the dialogue and behaviour is not well-made, inconsistent with the character or simply irrational for that person. Very interesting for you to point that out!
3	I'm picky with the plots overall. Fake deaths, unrealistic or broken characters, everything that puts crowd pleasing ahead of quality, it all drives me mad.\n\nI've been trained to be critical by artistic hobbies, that obviously affects. But I think infp's also have a Sensitive eye to details and as Feeling we are more driven by art. Creative idealist, we are prone to perfection(ism) too.
2	i hate when the characters in the movie are just archetypal clich√©s
2	Watching terrible shows on tv makes my skin crawl and makes me feel nauseous. So yes. I can relate.\nI was in film school and had to watch other people's amateur movies. I have never felt so sick a couple of times. \nIt was something about the acting and writing. It was an awful experience and I felt terrible about it. I'm just too sensitive though. Swore I would never do that to myself again.
2	Yup, i kinda get called out on it too. I actually love slow movies and tv shows. I get its not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. \n\nAlso bollywood omg, i dont understand how people can go and watch those meaningless movies with meaningless characters (not all the movies but most of it is usually crap) so i was talking to a friend about how its like people want to be stupid by choice and he got mad at me saying maybe its entertaining for them. He is probably right but yeah i find it insulting to watch something that assumes i am dumb (i mean this in the best sense possible) \n\nI cannot just pick a movie/show at random and watch it without reading reviews so to answer your question yes i am quite picky. \n\n
1	Kind of, but i also do theatre so acting + bad dialogue is very clear to me. Even though I watch it, riverdale is one example (but this time it‚Äôs bad acting+bad dialogue). I also easily pick up on weird tones, which words they mark. I can sit and re-say the lines like I think they should sound when watching tv
1	Same here..
1	Yes.  Also the acting.  I love trying to figure out what is going through the actors minds irl. 
1	Yes, realistic dialogue makes me feel so satisfied.
37	Greetings! From the Macedon Ranges, Australia	
3	Jealous. Reminds me of pics I used to take when I lived in Kentucky 
2	Beautiful! I‚Äôm jealous, here in Northeast USA is quite dreary. I like snow, but we haven‚Äôt had enough to make it pretty yet. It‚Äôs all been muck, and I miss the summertime.
20	Fellow INFPs, what are your thoughts on romantic love/relationships?	I'm not looking for advice here, just a discussion about love because it's such and abstract concept, especially when I've never even really experienced it. \n\nI've never been in a serious relationship and that doesn't really bother me, because I believe that one day I could find "true love" as it were. However, I believe that to have that kind of relationship I personally have to find a someone that I connect with on a deeper level, like (as cheesy as it sounds) a soul mate. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that anyone is perfect. I know that relationships take work, and I love and embrace that our flaws are what make us human. But, I feel like my friends don't understand why it upsets me so much when they try to set me up with someone, or why I don't spend my time actively seeking out a romantic partner. I can't stand the thought of wasting my time trying to make something work when it was never what I wanted in the first place. SO--\n\nDo yall believe in soul mates and do you believe that your lover absolutely has to be one? \n\nIs love just an animal,chemical reaction that inevitably fades after time? Or does being a self aware creature drive us to break free from our instincts in search of a new path?\n\nAny thoughts you want to vent about love and romance in general? I'd love to hear them!! \n\nI just discovered this forum and I'm so happy that I could find a community of people who think similarly to me, like other INFPs I feel quite isolated in my real life so with topics like these I only have my own brain to bounce ideas off of,  when these are things I enjoy discussing with others and hearing new perspectives. 
19	I have the same perspective on love as you do. If it isn't permanent true love with one of "the ones" it makes no sense to me to have a relationship. I don't need someone who can balance me out, I need someone who is able to understand and connect with me on the deepest level possible.
9	>I believe that to have that kind of relationship I personally have to find a someone that I connect with on a deeper level\n\nYes! This is exactly how I feel too. I've grown to hate dating, and I'm sick and tired of using dating apps, and trying to meet people casually for the sole purpose of them being a potential romantic partner.\n\nI've been on many dates, but I've never been in a serious relationship. I don't think it's possible for me to end up in a relationship with someone who I don't already connect with and feel comfortable with. Also, I know that people always talk about "having butterflies" as a way of determining how they feel about a person, but I don't think such a feeling means anything but nervousness and excitement. Once the "honeymoon phase" is over, those feelings will fade away. It's just a dopamine rush, a cocktail of lust and adrenaline that goes when things settle.\n\nI think true love only has the capacity to grow, and is instead filled with a deep sense of contentment and comfort from the very start. Knowing that your soul truly connects with another person and you'll never have to question how you feel about them. Everything should just make sense. \*That's\* what I want. So I understand how it feels when you're trying to date when ultimately, you know it's not and is never going to end up being anything like what we've described. I just see it as a waste of time. However, I will admit, having some shitty experiences has made me trust and respect myself more. I know the kind of love that I require and deserve, and I know that trying to experience anything less than will leave me inadequate.\n\n&#x200B;
5	Love your questions!  Interesting that you use the term ‚Äòsoul mate‚Äô. Have you looked into twin flames at all?\n\nI think we all have the capacity to love any being deeply. If we tried long and hard enough, we could find something to bond over, which would result in love. But that tends not to be the case in our larger, more fast paced society these days, where not everyone wants to open up to that level. \n\nI believe we have many soul mates and then on top of that; the true (often underrated) magic is finding someone who commits to your relationship daily by choosing to be in your life while simultaneously challenging you to be the best version of yourself. While it would be nice, I Romanticise everything in my head anyway so there‚Äôs less pressure for my SO to provide sweeping gestures of romance. \n\nBut perhaps that‚Äôs because commitment & reliability are key components in love for me? ü§î Are they for any of you? Sometimes I find it difficult finding the difference between my own emotional mapping and fact (I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs an INFP thing too). \n\nRegardless I totally agree with peanutbuttereverday in that you should live in your authenticity and then love will come to you. 
3	>Do y'all believe in soul mates and do you believe that your lover absolutely has to be one?\n\nI think of soulmates as another word for kindred spirits but with a more exclusive and (not always) romantic connotation. I used to think my lovers didn't have to be soulmates or kindred spirits (which was why I have loved and dated sensors in the past), but after meeting an INTJ man, and experiencing what it feels like to be deeply understood and being able to communicate so easily with him, I just don't think I could ever go back to dating someone who couldn't see or appreciate me fully in that way again.   \n\n\n>Is love just an animal, chemical reaction that inevitably fades after time? \n\nI think lust and infatuation can fade (or more fluctuate) over time, but that love can grow forever the longer you know someone. Think of the attachment you have with friends from school days compared to people you've only known for a short time. I guess the word for that is more bond than love. So bonds can grow stronger over time. Love is more of a choice one makes and a disposition one takes every day to see their SO in a loving light and be the best one could be for them.  \n
3	I don‚Äôt necessarily believe in a ‚Äúsoul mate‚Äù but I do believe that there are people out there who go fantastic together. The idea that two people can be better together than they are apart fascinates me. But I also believe that that kind of connection would take an immense amount of effort from both parties, love is a choice my friend. If you bank on a soul mate, one day you might wake up and feel differently about them. \nI‚Äôm not in a relationship and I‚Äôm only 20 so I‚Äôm by no means an expert. But when you find that person, make sure that YOU choose them to be ‚Äúthe one‚Äù.  Wake up everyday and choose to fall in love with them again. 
5	Idk if this is relevant, but I‚Äôve always loved the saying ‚Äòseek the life you want, and the love you desire will find you.‚Äô I‚Äôm not sure if anyone says that, but it sounds right in my head haha.   \n\nI believe in soulmates-the few and far between people who you just click with. I have no idea if everyone has only one absolute soulmate though. Maybe we have romantic soulmates and platonic ones, too? \n\nI think love can be forever, but perhaps the essence or experience of it changes over time. Maybe initially it feels enthralling, but eventually it‚Äôll lull into a reassuring warmth that‚Äôs always there and welcome. 
2	I believe in soul mates and in true love. \nMy point of view on love is sooo complicated but I really like how Fromm thinks about it even if it's very psychoanalytic. If you're interested you can read his book called "the art of loving", I really like it!
2	I think love with another being is something that's impossible for me. 
2	I love the idea of a relationship in my head more than the painstaking effort and all the time that it takes to build one up in real life. \n\nI don't think I am capable of being in love with anyone either.\n\n
2	i love everyone who loves me
2	I believe in soul mates because I found one and we felt a connection almost immediately!\n\nBut I also think love is too big a concept to fit into one word. There are many different kinds of love. Some are purely in the moment and fade after a while. Some are deeper and only grow stronger over time, and stay even when you're mad at that person. Some you feel by yourself and some you feel only when together. Some live in memories and some live in objects. None of them can accurately be put into words.
1	Don't think too hard about. I believe that those who overthink love are the ones who are always unsatisfied by it when they have it. It's a best friend you can do extra stuff with, but the friend part is important. We like our space, so it's got to be like a long distance same house relationship. That is my ideal. To wife me a gal that likes to do simple stuff and knows I'll be there to quietly hug her to sleep. (Memes here.) If you're looking for huge drama or action fight scenes, take your high expectations with you as I help you find your ideal guy as a wing man. I can not pilot that kind of ship.
10	I heard you like poems	Seeking shelter in your love;\n\nLonging for your warm embrace.\n\nWho I was, was not enough;\n\nNever-ending fall from grace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTouching what has closed my heart,\n\nWith all strength that still remains.\n\nGoing deeper into dark,\n\nI have found a man in chains.
1	A simple piece that manages to say a lot with few words. Admirable work!\n\nIf you'll allow me, i have one critique: watch your syllables, perhaps make them more consistent\n\nOther than that, its fantastic and instantly reaches to the heart
1	this is gorgeous. what does it mean to you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso could be reworked into a villanelle; those couplets are amazing.
30	I want to adopt you! [ENFP/M/21]	Ciao dear introverted soul! My name is Wes, and I'm conducting an experiment to determine if the MBTI world really makes sense. So far I've learnt quite some bit, and as I have understood by the help of fellow redditors, YOU might be the one I'm looking for! Alrighty, now that I have gotten you hooked, I'll tell you a bit about myself. I am Latvian, yet I study in Denmark. My dream is to travel the world, taste the world to be specific. I speak somewhat 5 languages, English being my second one. I write and I'm very creative. One day I will be working in the field of international  relations, as I have trouble staying in one place for too long. Gets too dull for me. I am very adventurous and I just love when a person supports me throughout my crazy schemes. I am not looking for anything specific, I just want a INFP test subject to understand if we truly click as great as I think we should. A quick chat,friendship, romance, love, marriage, sky is the limit!!! Age is also not something I care about. I'll add a picture of myself to encourage you to message me a bit more. https://imgur.com/a/C4Z4kRy
29	*Laughs in 86% introverted*
10	You sure do sound like a typical ENFP haha, but I don't really get what you're saying. What is it that you're asking of us?\n\nEDIT Ok I guess I'm too tired because now I saw that you're looking for a chat. Well, good luck with INFPs contacting you first haha. But you seem really nice and I wish you luck! 
6	You expect infps to message first huh good luck friend
14	This is friggin adorable
8	The combo really does work wonders, my brother is an ENFP and he is easily my best friend. We complement each other well. 
5	Definitely would like to read updates on how this goes. Sounds like an interesting penpal experiment. 
3	Aw, this is so charming. 
2	The person I'm closest to/most comfortable with is an Enfp who is also 21(me being 25). So I'm just gonna biasedly say that im sure you'll be pleased with whatever result you get 
2	I love this! I‚Äôm openly always seeking ENFPs; best friend / brother / mum. I love those connections deeply, so would love to chat...except, excuse me, I‚Äôm new to reddit and can‚Äôt find the right button ??
2	Oh, I‚Äôve seen you before! Hello again
2	Hey Wes! üëãüòÅ
2	The term "adopt" is giving me some really weird mental images so I'm just going to scroll past that one...\n\nHello Wes (Hi Dr. Nick!), I'm not necessarily sure what you are wishing to chat about, but I do sorta 50/50 in online conversations, Generally the other person messages first and I'll respond, generally the best way to get a response out of me (with opinions and thoughts), is to mentally interest me, (not sure if this relates to other INFP). Talk about a topic that both you and the INFP are passionate about (if it isn't passionate then a conversation will fizz out / be boring / not worth responding to). and just engage the person like crazy.\n\nIf we wish to talk about someone like me, you gotta get on my level, you gotta talk about things we both like, because someone like me, prospers in a response that shows equal (or more) interest in the subject that I'm passionate about.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making sense or not, but if anyone else understands, please feel free to continue on what I meant
2	My boyfriend is an ENFP <3. He is such a light. 
2	Damn.. I would never put myself out like this. The balls you have to do so. I'm impressed.
2	It feels like I finally have someone who can keep up with my Ideas and put them into purpose. We work really well as a team, and remind eachother about things we often forget about on our own. He can run circles around me, but I always catch up and I am able to pick out the details! 
2	Dating an ENFP, oh boy seriously the best thing that's happened. \n\nI've dated lots of types, but this is by far what my soul has been needing. \n\nBest of luck to you!
1	My only two friends are ENFP! 
1	I made an online enfp friend recently (through reddit) and he's awesome. He's not as happy as you though. You look very happy... Are you ok?
4	Suggestions for coping strategies when you feel emotionally overwhelmed?	I really like meditation and there are a few monks I like to listen to give talks on YouTube, but yesterday at work was just the worst.\n\nThere were a lot of people having personal crises and I hadn't been able to sleep at all the night previous. I got to a point where I could physically feel the tension in my body. Even stepping out to the sunshine for a bit didn't help much
3	I withdraw and let them deal with their own drama. 
2	I usually don't deal with it *---*
2	1- Think about random stuff like spaghetti\nor\n2- Breathe through the mouth, hold your breath for a while (focusing on the belly button helps) and exhale slowly from the nose. Sounds weird but it works (thanks, daniel!)
2	Lack of sleep can ruin a day. Anything you can do to keep that in check will help greatly.\n\nBeyond that, some sort of meditation is great. Maybe have something you can repeat to yourself to calm yourself when you need to. Find a corner, close your eyes, breathe deep, and remind yourself that you get to go home at some point, the annoyances / tension may be gone tomorrow or you'll be feeling better and able to deal with them better. Breathing deep and focusing on good things.\n\nAlways remember (as hard as I know it can be) that you can't control others, but you can control yourself and how you respond to others. At my old retail job I semi-mastered the ability to roll with the punches. When something annoying or angering comes at you just pause for a second. Tell yourself "This is happening / going to happen, I feel this way about it, but I have to deal with it regardless of how I feel. What can I say or do and how can I act to provide the best possible outcome given the circumstances that are out of my control?" I would think like this in that pause after being presented with a stressful situation, and I'd do it in the form of a big sigh. That big breath and the pause to think are greatly beneficial. It's almost like saying "Please hold a moment while I consult with myself" and retreating into the safety of your mind to analyze a situation and decide what you can do.
2	Interesting that other INFPs (including myself) seem to withdraw if the issues aren't their own.\n\nI generally just drown the world out either by excessively sleeping, playing music or playing an immersive game.
54	His name is Dumpling!	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/q59qdwmmmeh21.jpg
7	He is so cuteeeeeee. <3 Give him a hug for me :)
9	And his thoughts and feelings are valid.
2	Such a pretty boy‚ò∫Ô∏è
2	this post made me very happy
1	He is so adorable!!! <3 Does he like cuddles?
1	Ahhh so cute! Hello Dumpling! :D
23	Worn aesthetics?	Do you guys find yourselves attracted to the more 'worn' look. I mean legit usage, not $150 jeans that someone cut and bleached. There is just something about a leather bag that's been passed down and has thinned out around the corners. A lighter that has worn down to the shiny metal. A pen with ink stained near the nib. A bag with patches sown on to keep its utility. A coin that's oxidized. \n\nI mean. New and modern is beautiful, don't get me wrong. But there is just something about an item that someone's used so thoroughly that even though it probably should be replaced, you just can't. \n\nSo...what do you have that's beautifully used? Mine is an old 360 controller. The rubber's worn off the analog sticks and the grey matte backing is shiny now. But it's perfect. 
6	I have a pair of Nikes I've had for about 10 years. The treads are rubbed down to nothing, the soles flattened out, their black now a dark gray, laces still in alright shape. I've repaired them with superglue dozens of times and they're still hanging in there, or only just coming into their own I'd say. They're easily the lightest and comfiest shoes I've ever worn, plus I've gotten my money's worth several times over by now. Looking forward to another 10 years!\n\nGive me something that looks lived-in any day. I'm tired of the modern aesthetic: everything bare, minimalistic, sharp edges, bright lights, solid colors and chrome. Especially if it's a coffee shop or a restaurant, it's not a relaxing or inviting look.
6	Yes,Japanese call this wabi sabi.
5	For me, I love old clothes. I like shopping at the thrift shop, it makes me happy to know that an item has had a whole life before I saw it, and a purpose and story for someone else like a hidden wonder that I can never know. I like that I can give it more stories, attach more memories, etc. And I love that I can give my clothes away to live a new life and bring happiness to a new person when i'm finished with them. Is that cheesy? lol. 
3	Not me. I mean I sorta like things to look slightly worn. Too new feels too weird and fragile to me. And too worn is like... eh... I wish I knew how to repair the thing.\n\nThat said, I think expertly and artfully repaired and modified things look neat as long as they fit or complement the original look.
3	Yes, I love thrift shops for this reason.
5	This is how I like my automobiles...used and worn....because I can ‚Äúuse‚Äù them and not worry about a perfect paint job, immaculate carpet...or a detail cleaning after every rain shower.  Low stress, lower cost and each one is unique in its own way when I get it. \n\nAnd other than cars. I love almost all things used. Each object has its own identity and life so to speak...üëçüèª
87	Found something from last summer going through my Google Drive	
2	Appalachians?
2	i felt my shoulders relax seeing this 
57	I love you all and I love this sub	I am moved to tears of how how amazing it is to have found this community. :') In the middle of a cafe and I don't even care (crying a bit) , can you imagine. I feel much less misunderstood and much less "wrong" when I know I have all you who are the same, that I'm not the only one or alone.
7	That's precisely how I felt when I discovered this sub too!
6	Same here!
5	Cheers...you beautiful soul!
2	Love and snugs :) :)
2	I just found this sub! Everyone here seems so kind, and lovely, and calm üò≠ It feels a bit like home
1	Yes. It's nice here. üíú
8	What do you think of death?	Been thinking about the end and what it means and all... Just wanted to know what you all thought.
8	It doesn't scare me that I will die someday, sometimes the thought is comfortable. But it terrifies me that the people I love will leave me and I can't stop it. I try to remember that death is as natural as life, and that truly I believe that our souls/energies live on somehow, in a way that cannot be seen with the naked eye. 
6	I wouldn't care. \n\nAt all\n\nAlmost\n\nNot suicidal or anything 
5	i not afraid of dying, just afraid that in the afterlife i‚Äôll never see the people i love again. if i don‚Äôt, then i guess it makes our time together more meaningful, but the thought of never seeing them again terrifies me
3	Where can I sign up
3	I thought about death to the point where i put myself into psychosis. It was scary because of the thought that earths life span is finite. We will be converted into different energies and masses after we pass. I got to the point where i just straight up picked a religion to make myself sane again. The idea of non existence freaks me out sometimes. Now i have belief in heaven and the like.\n\nJust gotta enjoy life because its so short when you start thinking about it. Time flies so fast. I found that keeping a journal saved my sanity. Now i can look back on memories in detail and think about all that ive done. Its still scary sometimes but death has become the least of my worries.
2	The old Hymn ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fly away‚Äù brings me peace when I think about it. One of my all time favorite songs. 
1	I believe life is just the way back home and death is the entrance. Or if im wrong it doesnt matter i think it would be like sleep. Im sometimes a little bit tired of live, of the ups and downs, emotions, helplessnes, happiness. So i like the thought of falling asleep and never wake up. 
1	Death brings comfort knowing that there is an end. Eventually none of this really matters. Makes things less stressful. 
1	My dog died years ago and I frequently think of us reuniting when I die.\n\nNot afraid of death but afraid of how I‚Äôll die and how my family would feel.
1	For the most part, no one has died and came back to tell us what‚Äôs on the other side. It‚Äôs a huge mystery I will have to experience. I don‚Äôt want to die anytime soon but it is something I‚Äôm vary curious to know what‚Äôs on the other side.
1	I dont fear my own demise. But i hate the idea that the people around me will leave me someday. 
14	The War of Life	In a world where our brains are meant to triumph over our hearts and souls, we are among those most vulnerable to failure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that is also our greatest strength. While we may lose the battle of careers, money, and status, we can still win the games of meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. And those are the battles that win the war. 
4	We are the Medics, Nurses, and Doctors on the Battlefield of Life....everyone is trying to kill each other at every moment on the frontline. All the while, we wait for them all to fall and give them back their most precious gift and demonstrate to them that all the things they may have been fighting for were actually pointless and of insignificant value. ‚úåüèª
2	beautiful
1	Maybe our instincts know which battle are worth fighting\nI wish i could interpret the mechanisms that measure worthiness.
3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 19	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
9	Yay, hit another depressive arc in my cycle. Time to release the demons.  \n  \nFear? Yep. Anxiety? Right here. Hopelessness? Mhmm. Lack of motivation, unable to see anything good happening as the result of my action? Got it all right here in me. And for the topper, I no longer want to do anything for a while despite having something to look forward to.
5	Is there anything wrong with saying or having the 'philosophy' of telling people "you'll see how you feel when the day/time arrives" or "ask me when it's closer" to events? Other than I guess.. events that require pre-planning or early registration.\n\nI ask because I feel like a lot of the time I may say I want to do something today but when the day actually arrives my mood might be in a totally different place and I don't wanna go anymore.
3	Did giving up, voluntarily, something you held dear initiate productiveness development?
3	when you write out a huge response and by the time you're done, the post is locked. cool, cool, cool. totally not a waste of my time or anything üëå
2	Hi all! I'm new here. Anything I should know? \n\nAlso, I was idly wondering if anyone ever downvotes anyone on this subreddit. Is that a thing that happens?
1	I know everyone has a different approach to things but I just don‚Äôt get angry, explosive people. 
1	People confuse me so much, I suggest something that I believe is correct and people just stare at me like I've grown a second head...\n\nWhy is my opinion any less valid than the other's opinions around me?
1	just got diagnosed with ADD aND EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW
15	How to stop being upset about not being the best	I swear I suck the fun out of everything. It just seems as though every time I have a hobby or something that I‚Äôm supposed to be good at, I can‚Äôt help but feel envious when someone is better than me. These feelings ruin almost every activity because no matter what I tell myself I‚Äôm constantly comparing myself with others and I can‚Äôt help it. 
5	Jealousy stems from insecurity.  It's not about the other person it's about your insecurities.  Why do you feel insecure?
3	I have this problem, too. I've been drawing my whole life. I'm damn good, too, but there is always someone who's better. It's literally the reason why I changed majors and opted to be a teacher instead of a concept artist.\n\nThose who can, do. Those who can't-
2	Just ask yourself questions whenever you feel insecure about anything. I learned this particularly after going out during my party days and being slammed with anxiety the next day.\n\nThe only thing that stopped it would be to ask myself ‚Äúare other people doing similar things? Do other people notice these same flaws in myself? If they do, will they remember it in a week? Are these people I care about? Am I feeling inseure about something I did or said that was silly/funny/something that will be a funny story? Etc.‚Äù\n\nAnd then I started applying this methods to any intrusive thoughts. If I start really getting down on my art for example, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcan a random person off the street do this? Was I doing this for pleasure or to sell it (I don‚Äôt sell)? Do I recognize what is off? (Then it‚Äôs a learning experience) if I showed this to a random person, will the odds say that they‚Äôll think it‚Äôs neat at least a novelty level that I can create something like this? Do I like parts of the whole at a bare minimum (experience of creating, color, character, linework, medium, etc)? ‚Äú etc\n\nThen it‚Äôs not a waste and it‚Äôs easier to see the value in an experience that my intrusive thoughts are hellbent on ruining 
2	I try to divide my goals of interest in small little pieces and attempt to be in love with the process
2	I want to tell you that you shouldn‚Äôt compare yourself to anyone else since you don‚Äôt know what they had to get through to get there. Only compare yourself to your past self. That being said I‚Äôm guilty of doing the same thing as you. I just hate knowing I will probably never be good as other people.
2	Classic judism INFP	I was wondering if anyone is what I would call a "classic Judism INFP". \n\nBasically you believe in God Buddha Jesus angels and saints. You think with your heart and not your logic or intelligence. \n\nYou have a messy room. You do things based on spontaneous direction and you don't really plan ahead. \n\nAlso I think people relate their emotions as an Empath like - positive negative. In psychology positive emotions are happiness joy and love peace while negative is anger sadness hate and stuff. \n\nIt can be taken a step further and said that - positive emotions are good and negative emotions are evil. In terms of an Empath as they judge label their emotions as positive negative or good evil. \nFurthermore ....\n\nI was just wondering if any INFPs feel like an idealists but also feel kind of Empath and classic Judism. \n\nI was just wondering. \n\nLastly - I don't know why people say INFP are introverts - I feel as an INFP ( a classic Judism one at that) I treat everybody with kindness and talk too much or like to be in large crowds. \n\nAnyone else like this ? 
2	is this what people hear when we talk? :)))))\n\n(just kidding; but what do you mean infps arent introverts? isnt the I from introverted? aka getting tired from people& socializing as opposed to getting energized by it?) 
2	I don‚Äôt believe in buddha but this post def sounds like it‚Äôs describing me 
503	üå∑	
8	Amazing!  Where is this??
5	This is incredible. I love the sea behind the flowers, it just captures the picture.... it‚Äôs like someone did it on purpose to show that random\nbeauty can exist within the world........ and I like oceans
3	That contrast between tulipans and snow, stunning.
2	This is very aesthetically pleasing ‚ú® 
1	Bootiful, fank ewe!  üòÇ
9	Needed somewhere to vent.	Hey all, I hope someone can relate because I feel so alone lately.. To be honest probably for the last 2-3 years. Nothing keeps my attention long because I get bored so fast I can literally be extremely excited about learning something knew or doing something new and within 10 minutes I'll be staring into nothingness thinking about god knows what, probably something I did when I was 8 years old or dreaming some new exciting scenario about my future life which will never come to fruition. I struggle to make and keep relationships with people because I always feel pressured to constantly be talking or entertaining and for some reason I seriously struggle opening up to anyone which causes people I care about to slowly drift away so I've found myself purposely cutting myself off from the world even my family to protect myself? I think.. God that sounds pathetic. This is making me incredibly lonely which in turn is making me irritable and I really hate the person I'm becoming.. I spend all my time alone. I'm never satisfied with anything and I've always got this sense of 'there must be something more, this can't be it.' I'm 26 years old and I truly have no idea what I'm doing with my life or what I want to do with it.. I'm just really feeling lost at the minute and was just wondering if anyone here has felt the same and if they've managed to shake it all off? Sorry to ruin your day with my sadness! 
3	I feel the same way fairly often. I especially feel like I have to entertain people or else they won‚Äôt like me anymore. What I would say to you is to try new things (yes, I know everyone says it, but it‚Äôs true). You don‚Äôt have to do major things just see if there is something small which you can get into and really focus on. This will bring some of the excitement back to your life. I‚Äôve recently started training for a new entry level job and it has made a huge difference. Don‚Äôt allow yourself to settle into the normal groove of daily life. You have to just try new things even though it is super hard sometimes. I hope this helped in some way. Just know that we can relate to how you feel. I‚Äôm here if you ever went to talk or anything like that. Don‚Äôt be a stranger! 
2	Do you have someone you can talk to about your feelings?\n\nThe INFP traits say we are hard to get to know and difficult to understand. We hide our true selves for fear of being misunderstood - I know I do. That can leave us feeling particularly lonely. Those that do get to know us tend to be lifelong friends. There are two people I consider to be close friends. \n\nDo not feel guilty for taking time to yourself. Sometimes it is much needed. Recharge your batteries and try again another day.\n\nMy thoughts run around in circles as well. Negative memories haunt me much more frequently than positive ones and can plague me for days if not much longer. These thoughts have made me feel depressed and very alone. \n\nA big thing for me was finding my outlet. Writing worked wonders for me. I started as a young buck in a journal. I moved on through life, changing to poetry and dabbling in other projects. Ultimately, I found poetry worked best. Just putting my feelings on paper always helped me to sort out what I was feeling and helped me to find the source of it. It takes a while to get to the bottom of it, but it‚Äôs so worth it when you get there. An ounce of clarity goes a long way. \n\nFind your coping mechanism whether it be writing, exercise (whether it be going for a walk or yoga), meditation etc. \n\nThere are some coping mechanisms in this article that help to deal with stress and better your emotional health. I hope one or more of them works for you. \n\nI am personally guilty of a few maladaptive mechanisms here. Thank you for reminding me to better myself. \n\nhttps://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/coping-mechanisms
2	I do have a couple of close friends I've known for a lot of years but I still don't think I could talk to them about stuff like this I feel like they would just make fun of me and then I'd laugh it off like I always do while feeling absolutely terrible inside. I did use to read a lot of books when I was younger and get lost in the world's I'd created for myself relating to the book.. Maybe that's something I should revisit. Thanks a lot for taking the time to reply I really appreciate it, do you ever post your poetry anywhere? I'd love to take a look. 
1	I'm in the same boat. I have a huge fear of talking about how I really feel. People drift away because I never talk to them or put any effort into the relationship. I'm also hesitant to make friends because it seems like it would take so much effort... and then I feel like a horrible person for not wanting to do normal things. I've been getting increasingly isolated. It's lonely, but seems less painful than trying to relearn how to be human. I just pretend to be normal when I'm around people. I have good days, but some days it feels like everything hurts. You're not the only one! I hope you find your way to a happy life :)
1	It seems like our souls lack affinity with simplicity. Our font of joy always needs to be intertwined on a multi dimensional level so we can bear the overwhelming, as contradictory as that sounds.\n\nMy advice is:\n\n divide your goal into molecular level size pieces and explore thoroughly their inner mechanisms. You might find something unheard of which ignites desire, motivation in the form of novelty. \n\nThe human brain was designed to engage in positive emotion as we further our horizons. That can happen internally also, maybe that's what people mean when they say: learn to love the process. \n\n_Journey more important than destination and all that crap._
3	Who else struggles with ‚Äúintensity‚Äù in relationships?	Okay so I feel like I‚Äôve absolutely had bad habits instilled in me due to hookup culture. I‚Äôve literally self sabotaged every good thing I‚Äôve had because I try not to ‚Äútry too hard‚Äù which makes me seem uninterested to those that like me because I‚Äôm trying really hard not to be needy and/or annoying. \n\nI‚Äôve recently stopped doing that and just decided to express positive emotions because like... obviously it‚Äôs worse to make people feel like they‚Äôre not enough than to make them feel like you can be too much at times. But yeah, now my needy side is out, and omg... cannot find a proper balance.\n\nIt‚Äôs always intense. One end of the spectrum or the other. Why is dating so hard üòÇ
3	I am right there with you. Its so difficult. You care for them and either you are true to that and freak them out or you end up pushing them away. Dating sucks. Its terrible. I wish the person you are meant to be with would just show up like heyyyyy.\n\nDo you happen to also attract confusing people? 
7	INFJs and faking it??	I'm an INFP and my best friend is an INFJ. I'm always kind of scared that she's lying to me about whether she's okay because I feel like I can't tell. She'll tell me that I only tell when she's lying when she lets me. Reading about how INFJs can fake it really easily only makes me more worried. I always feel like I can't tell what she's feeling and I'm scared that I'm not a very good friend. I'm worried she thinks I'm a horrible person or I'm really violating her values or something and she just doesn't tell me. She's the nicest person I know and super amazing, I just had to let out some of my worries for a bit. 
6	Can confirm. INFJs do hide their true feelings even with a close friend. Because they think their inner world is too complicated and not worth discussing. You can try and make them open up more but it might get awkward. I tried that with a close INFJ friend of mine when I was feeling extra helpful and he ended up crying and shutting down more. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to just let people be. 
2	My bestfriend is also INFJ and he can do this as well. He is kinda self-sustaining in general and likes to handle things on his own. Best thing I can do is just give advice on the side or emtional support.
2	I used to feel the same for my infj best friend. honestly, you cant control what she wishes to tell you or not tell you. and although worrying is like second nature to us infps esp wen it comes to the well being of our loved ones, all you can do is ask them if they're doing okay often or wen u even see the smallest signs of distress. just let them know that wen they need you, they can come to you without a thought. I think the biggest thing for infjs is to know that someone is looking out for their well being while they are out looking after everyone else.
1	Tbh opening the floodgates is a huge risk. It‚Äôs really difficult to regulate what happens once we decide to say the truth and alienating even our closest friends is a big possibility.
1	You can placebo yourself into INFJ pretty easy...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(I might of done it myself..)
141	Dang it, I keep finding them	
2	Thanks for the post, how is your week going?\n\nI've certainly resolved to be that change! It's hard because I'm afraid of everyone and subconsciously think they'll treat me poorly. Trying out some advice to treat strangers as if they're already your friends, which I hope will bring out the best in them as well as me.
2	Traders Joes is the only place I am cool with small talk to a degree, every other place I can't stand when they ask if I need help, or all of that. 
1	OMG I‚Äôve literally had so many panic attacks in the Trader Joe‚Äôs parking lot just trying to prepare myself for small talk with the staff. 
9	Anyone else really struggle with organization? Does anyone have any tips?	My room is a mess. Everytime I attempt to clean it I just get overwhelmed. I know it's dumb. Any tips?
6	I have an huge exam next week and I procrastinated sooo much for months. The only thing that helps me is the anxiety for the deadline, but I easily get distracted anyway.\n\nHow nice is not feeling alone anymore!\n\nAnyway, another good thing is forcing ourselves to use a bullet journal, especially when we have so much to do. \nPersonally, I divide big tasks in many small ones and set a deadline for each (like by 2 hours, for example).\n\nGood luck!\n____\nOh sorry, didn't read about your room.\nYou can use the "do one thing at a time" method for that too! \n\nThe real struggle is seeing all of the stuff to do (like my exam and me) but if you just see one little thing first you will do it easily!
6	Typically I just live in the mess. Then every once in awhile, when things in my life get really bad, I clean and organize everything I see to keep my mind off of things. The irony is that when my room is clean, it‚Äôs because the mess has moved to my mind. Poetic I suppose, but also accurate. 
5	I let my clutter pile up like the problems in my life, and then when I reach peak levels of anxiety, I stress clean to procrastinate on all the important things I need to do *cries*
7	Song lyrics I‚Äôm working on about a difficult time I went through when I was younger.	No one wants to talk to me\n\nI guess I bring them down\n\nNo one wants to talk to me\n\nIt‚Äôs really bringing me down\n\nI‚Äôm trying, to believe that, I‚Äôm worth it\n\nAn inconvenience to everyone around me\n\nDifficult to even speak to\n\nI‚Äôm not \n\nmaking any sense\n\nat all, at all, at all\n\nJust give me a chance \n\nI can fake a smile until tomorrow\n\nI‚Äôll laugh and tell jokes, I won‚Äôt even let you know, that\n\nI‚Äôm burning inside, and your making worse\n\nI was struck, unsuspecting, with a exponential curse.\n\nI‚Äôm doing my best\n\nRight now it‚Äôs barely getting me anywhere\n\nChange up my hair\n\nMaybe somebody will gift me with a conversation\n\nNo \n\nNot today \n\nIn three days it‚Äôs my birthday \n\nThanks for checking the calendar for it Mr.Evens\n\nThanks for completely ignoring it Mr.Stebbins \n\nIt‚Äôll all change in high school said the fool\n\n\n\n\nI spent a whole summer wide awake \n\nAte like a pig and I turned into one\n\nLost touch with many friends that didn‚Äôt care anyway\n\nCan I blame them\n\nI died that day\n\n\n\nEverything following felt like the after-party\n\nIn the morning I would go to sleep\n\nNobody wanted to visit me\n\nAnd I forgot, how to speak\n\nI‚Äôm still working on that one\n\nOh, how the days have gone \n\nWork hard play hard I have yet to either,\nCatch a glance at myself gaze locked in the mirror,\nI‚Äôm disappointed cause of this and that just marking mistakes a heavy map \nI‚Äôm tired all the time knock me down with just a tap.\nmy hand are shaking I‚Äôm queasy,\nHow do you do it for me it‚Äôs not so easy,\nNot a single person makes sense to me,\nNot a single person makes sense of me,\nI look in the mirror in my head I scream all is well. the other voices drowned is why I cast this magic spell. It only kinda, only sometimes, works really well.\n
1	"ate like a pig and i turned into one" \n\nBrilliant lyric my dude, and i hope you learn how "to speak again".

24	Why are INFPs seen as the softies of the MBTI?	All I see online are flowers, hearts and bunnies when describing INFPs, really ticks me off that.\n\n
22	Because INFPs who have had the privilege of being coddled in life usually are pretty soft.  I had an extremely hard time until I learned how to hide my hypersensitivity.\n\nAlso, flowers, hearts and bunnies are soul rejuvenating.  
16	We're not aggressive with pushing ideas and we're fairly open-minded.
13	Hard on the inside, soft on the outside.  We get called crybaby a lot, and I kinda don't mind, its like whatever's, I gotta express myself. 
8	Because so many of us insist on it. 
7	What symbol would you choose, OP? \n\nI am certain there are better ways to represent this group than flowers etc. However, the freedom and spirit of nature is probably the closest thing to represent me, personally. Maybe a starry night sky with a few thinly veiled clouds barely hiding a bright crescent moon. I know of nothing man-made except maybe poetry/art that describes my inner turmoils and other likenesses. I realize though we are all similar, we are also different.\n\nOutwardly, I am a ball of sunshine and optimism. But also a huge crier.. No matter the emotion, it seems to surface without much control. However, I am still embarrassed by it and adjusting to it. Unfortunately the embarrassment only amplifies my tears. Especially at work. I have a high stress job, and I would utterly implode if the tears were not allowed to escape. \n\nI wish there were a way to turn off the faucet without changing the structure of who I am, but I have not yet succeeded in finding this avenue. My coworkers just say I ‚Äúcare too much.‚Äù Which isn‚Äôt wrong, but it‚Äôs also far too simple an answer for my liking. 
6	Probably because underneath my hardass front I am a softy... haha 
1	We act cold and aloof on the outside when in fact we're very sensitive on the inside
1	Not lyrical but will do for the time being	Talking about yourself don't sound much like an INFP but bear it with me\n\nI'm at a turbulent period and also on my early twenties, feels like a wise Fox trying to make partnership with adventurous bunnies\n\nMy source of fun is so close yet unnacessible, without a piece of that pragmatic living, life seems insurmountable.\n\nBeing an aimless contributor to society seems too plain, my mindframe is one to blame, full of stained principles to set aflame\n\nWhat I most desire is to be satisfied with simplicity, what to do if contradictions rule my city, what must be done to subtract disappointment yet maintain the mistery\n\nThrough indulgence I feel my taste for novelty getting ruined, a void filled with emptiness expands inside. I knew it all this time, to let go of what I love most, is what I must abide\n\n_Notes from a noble enterprise._
5	A few positive thoughts on using Tinder	I've (23f) been using Tinder for a few weeks now and just wanted to share a few thoughts on my experience - particularly as it relates to my introversion - since a lot of people here seem to hate it.\n\n**\[TL;DR at the end\]**\n\nA bit of background: I've always had difficulty talking to people in large groups like parties, work mixers, networking events, and I've never gone out to a bar or club with the express aim of meeting people. Any time I've had a crush on anyone I knew through school or work, I'd retreat far away and just observe them at a distance, grasping for hints that they might even think of me a little bit. This has obviously been very counterproductive, and to this day I've never been in a relationship because a) I'm not gorgeous (although I've been told I'm cute) and b) everyone, including friends, think I'm uninterested in other people until they get to know me well. I've never been good at navigating tricky social situations - finding out whether someone is single or not, feeling out whether they're interested in you, etc. I'm also very quiet in person, which leads to a lot of people not hearing me when I talk and assuming that I have no personality.\n\nA few months ago, however, I got sick of feeling unloved and undesirable because of my inability to show interest (which is something I'm trying to change), so I made a tinder account just to try things out. Since then, I've managed to get quite a few good conversations going with interesting people who are willing to talk about things we like, and I even went on a date - the first one in my life (and did other things, although that's a different story). The reason it's worked well for me is that there's very little emotional risk to texting strangers as long as you put yourself in the right mindset - I went in with zero expectations and consciously reminding myself to not take rejection personally. Sometimes people don't reply to messages, and that's fine - maybe they found someone else more suited to them, or they're looking for a hookup, or they're just not interested in a serious conversation - in which case you wouldn't want to talk to them anyway. Not everyone is interested in having a meaningful conversation in the same way as you, and that's perfectly natural. But the fact that I can text people without having to pay attention to how I look, or dress, or sound, or my posture, or whether I can follow along with the conversation etc - all of the things that I'm self-conscious about - has done wonders for me being able to show people more of my personality without the social awkwardness. It's less draining than having to go out to social events, especially because I am MUCH better at expressing myself on paper (or screen) than on the spot in person. I'm still trying to work on my self-confidence in person, but it helps. Another benefit is that when you're having a conversation on text (and if you manage to go on a date) is that it's solely between you and the other person - you get more of a chance to express what you're thinking and the other person's attention is focused on you, which is great if you struggle to make yourself heard in larger groups (like me).\n\nA few things that have helped me so far:\n\n* **Be yourself, and be honest about your introversion.** That's the best filter for people who can't handle weirdness/awkwardness/quiet/whatever your quirks might be. It might suck to be rejected or ghosted based on your personal qualities, but at least you know that it wouldn't have worked out anyways.\n* **Quality, not quantity.** Even if you have only one good conversation with a match, and even if you don't have a lot of matches, it's better than having many meaningless conversations, hoping that at least one of them will evolve into something more. Take your time, and get to know what you like. It's much less tiring to focus on one person than ten people.\n* **Read the bios!!!** I automatically swipe left on people without anything in their bio, or something really vague and non-descript (although that is a personal preference), no matter how attractive they are. How am I supposed to talk to someone if they don't write anything about themself?\n* **Interesting pictures.** If you're not conventionally attractive, as in my case, maybe try to make your pictures interesting - weird faces, memes, whatever (although you should include at least one picture of yourself). It adds personality into your bio, if that's what you're looking for.\n* **Patience!** If you don't get any matches or if people ghost after a few lines of conversation, that doesn't mean it's the end - just keep trying.\n* **That said, don't invest TOO much of your attention into the app.** Keep trying, but don't let it take over your life. There's a life to be lived off the app, and if you focus on it too much, the rejection or the burnout from endless swiping through unappealing profiles will get to you, and it'll weigh down on you unnecessarily. I generally only answer messages twice a day (if people have a problem with this, explain, and if they still don't like it, good riddance) and only go through different profiles once a day or sometimes a few days apart, if I'm not feeling it.\n\nOf course, this won't work for everyone. I've noticed a lot of INFPs here don't like texting, and in that case, I don't have a solution. But as someone who writes much better than I speak (at least in initial stages), it's been a breakthrough once I abandoned all of my hangups and prejudices against Tinder. I'm still learning how to navigate first dates and afterwards, but I do feel like I've gotten a leg up because of the app.\n\nSorry that this got so long, and thanks if you've read it all! I just wanted to share because I think a lot of INFPs dismiss the app for being shallow (which it definitely can be), but you just have to know how to use it in a way that benefits you.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tinder works for me and my specific preferences because I have a pretty good idea of what I want, and actively trying to manage my feelings and anxieties when things don't work out the way I want.
1	http://gotinder.com/@pepacioretrasovich\n\nMy account is not serious, but if I ever saw this on tinder I'd give that person my entire existence
3	What kind of job do you have?	Im curious to know what kind of professions/jobs you INFPs have currently or would like in the future. Are you content with it? How does your INFP traits help you with your work? I currently work as a line cook. An extremely grueling and stressful job. Very long and hard hours. But its also very rewarding at the end of the day. Im proud to have created something for the public to enjoy and consume. Maybe making their day just a little brighter with the food i prepared for them, even if it is just for a moment. In a weird way i feel that my infp brain being filled with chaos and constant rumination helps a lot with the stress of his job. Especially when it gets really busy and the tickets on the line are just endless. I almost feel like im in a state of flow, total distraction from my usual self loathing and ruminating thoughts. Its amazing really, Id compare it to a meditation practice. My chaotic brain fits into the chaotic environment of the kitchen very well. 
2	I‚Äôm currently going to school for a Christian ministry degree. I really enjoy helping people even though I have a hard time talking with new people, I‚Äôll probably end up doing some kind of overseas mission work. I like looking back on each day and thinking that I‚Äôve made some kind of positive impact on someone‚Äôs life, regardless of how small. I‚Äôve found helping the big man further his plan is a good way for me to do that. 
1	I work in an office, it's a really easy job that I don't have to think about once I'm off work. Leaves my evenings and weekends free for whatever I want. And it's a stable career building towards retirement eventually. But I'm not really happy with it. There's no real "purpose" to it, so it's not really fulfilling. 
1	Music as a Tool to Connect w/ Distant Loved Ones?	TL;DR: Left home due to abusive situation and hurt my brother. We were very close. I looked up to him. I listen to music he introduced me to in order to still feel connected, but i‚Äôm makes me sad simultaneously . \n\nMy brother and I have recently been torn apart by family drama and his battle with addiction. He chose to side with my abusive family, but i‚Äôm sure his substance abuse plays a role in this. I don‚Äôt blame him, he‚Äôs young and still finding himself. My brother has always been my best friend through the ups and down. He‚Äôs always understood me and just let me be without trying to make me into someone i‚Äôm not. I notice I look for him in friends and romantic partners but always come up short. \n\nHe‚Äôs an intp and we have that sweet soulful connection. I definitely feel a past life connection with him. The T and F differences can be obvious at times. He can be insensitive when he doesn‚Äôt understand something. But he makes it up with his actions. He‚Äôs always kind of been an emotional caretaker/protector for me, even through our dealings with our fucked up family. \n\nI was struggling really hard towards the end of last hear and was fighting my own battles with addiction and suicidal ideation. I got alcohol poisoning and was hospitalized and kind of spiraled after that. Once he found out, he tried his best to be more attentive. Would always take me out to hang out with him and his friends and would smoke me up. I struggled with paranoia and weed in the past, so he was patient and helped me find a strain that worked like it was supposed to (Sativa). He introduced me to my favorite artist (Jhene Aiko) and he trip sat me through my first dance with Psychedelics. \n\nHe‚Äôs a Pisces and I‚Äôm a Virgo, so astrologically we are known as Sister Signs. A lot of my development has a lot to do with this kid even though he‚Äôs two years younger than me. We both are children at heart but he‚Äôs a little bit better at adulting xD \n\nI miss him terribly... I feel like there‚Äôs a hole in my heart. But he can‚Äôt understand my perspective because he was the golden child. I‚Äôve been having withdrawals from being in a safe house because I can‚Äôt drink or smoke and so i‚Äôve been relying on music to help me through this rough patch.\n\nI just realized that half of my playlist is composed of songs that he‚Äôs introduced to me and idk... it‚Äôs weird. I can‚Äôt stop playing the songs but it‚Äôs also too painful. I want to feel connected to him so i‚Äôll play the songs. But I can‚Äôt help but break down when I hear certain songs.\n\nWhen we were on our way to pick up the LSD for my first trip, he set the mood with a Kid Cudi Album. I remember feeling so free and just so happy to be with him and finally enjoying life for once. I remember him teasing me to ‚ÄúDance 4 Eternity‚Äù and we had this really silly sing along. It was my favorite moment with him. \n\nSorry for the really long rant. I just don‚Äôt know what to do with this hurt right now \n\n
34	I talked to her today	Well rather she talked to me, that girl I had opened up to and had been slowly falling for asked me to talk today. She said she could tell that I had feelings for her and she said she didn‚Äôt want to lead me on. I guess her telling me that is better than me continuing down that path and getting hurt worse. \nI wish I wouldn‚Äôt fall so easily, because I honestly shouldn‚Äôt be hurting as bad as I am. I opened up to her one time, which for most people isn‚Äôt a big deal but for me it was. \nAnyway, I suppose getting hurt so many times will only make me appreciate my future wife more when I find her. But that doesn‚Äôt make it hurts any less right now 
14	That‚Äôs a nice way of her though
7	Yeah she did what few have the matzy to do. Which is AWESOME! I wish more people would do that.\n\nBut I'd say that you might wanna practice being more open.\nIts the very same reason you get attached so easily and get hurt so much.\n\nBecause if you keep things bottled up inside you are giving it exactly what it needs to build and build into something much bigger and more able plus likely to hurt you.\n\nIf however you are more open this sort of thing doesn't greatly affect you. Give it a shot üòÅ\nJust picture how you're currently doing thing like a pressure pot with the seal locked shut.\n\nSlowly but surely the pressure builds and builds and builds until the casing it creaking and bending and unless the valve is released very lightly the pressure pot is gonna blow. Give yourself a safety valve to relieve the pressure.
3	As disappointing as these things are, I'm glad she was courteous and honest. Sending lots of love your way today. 
2	Bathe in the suffering, you are truly alive
2	Something similar happened to me last year. I had a crush on this girl I was in a volunteering project with. The thing is, she was 24 while I was 21. We were together for what I though was a date, when she asked me if I had feelings for her. \n\nEven if I had tried there's no way I could have denied it. I'm glad she was so respecful in the way she said it wasn't mutual though. I was heartbroken, but now I feel lucky because, it could have been way worst and I've been able to get over it much quicker.
16	There is nothing more infuriating than over-the-top, obviously phony praise.	There's praise, and then there's this. You all probably know what I'm talking about. Its just so off-putting when it happens and you spot it straight away. It comes off as manipulation to me. Like the person doing it is just trying to get their way and will say whatever it takes.\n\nReminds me of when I used to work at Starbucks. That job forever ruined the phrase "you rock" for me. Trainers were told to use that phrase as part of their "encouragement" to employees. They all said it, and somehow never connected the dots that because they all said it it was so obvious what they were doing.\n\nAnyways, you all rock!!! Keep up the good work!!!! You're the best!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!1!!!!! /S
6	Yeah. I hate it too. Most praise makes me uncomfortable but especially so when it's phoney. Ick.
5	Phony. Yes. Correct word
4	Same here. It's extremely irritating. And that was really cheesy, what they did at Starbucks .\n\nMy social circle already knows that I'm really quiet, introverted, bookish and a little strange. One day, a co-worker comes and tells me "You're a ladies man, you just don't know it yet". Sorry, but to me that reeks of pure mockery.
2	They're trying to get you to do your job for free.
4	What do you score on the DISC assessment?	https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/\n\nI scored C on this version and others. I'm curious about y'all?
1	A: Compliance - 44%\n\nB: Steadiness - 37%\n\nC: Influence - 18%\n\nD: Dominance - 2%

1	.08% C, 84.1 S, 78.8 I, 75.8 D 
1	D 45%, I 7%, S 34%, C 15%

8	Life Being a Struggle For Us?	As I read more and more on this page which I love doing because I feel so connected and that I'm not the only one to feel and think some of these very same things everyone posts about on here. The question comes to mind though just as I have struggled in life pretty since day one it feels like, and so many others on here. Is that just the normal life for an INFP? a life of struggle? The only time I don't feel like everything is a struggle is when I have a day off with nothing that needs to be done, and can just do whatever I want. Which those days are pretty much turned into a few hours here and there as I get older. While most people would call this a form of depression and probably two or three more things, but is this just the way we are? With so many people with the exact same feelings and thoughts about life to the point of having the exact same scenario play out in real life for a totally different person but with the same outcome just really gets me thinking. If we as INFP's were able to do exactly what we wanted in life be that art or anything else would that make our lives not a struggle or would we always struggle no matter what? I would love to hear your input on this, sorry if its all over the place just a random thought.
6	Totally, I am currently in school (post grad diploma) and I absolutely hate it. Its like forcing myself to like something that I loathe. I chose it out of convenience and to force myself to do something practical. I am without a doubt the least motivated and poorest student in the entire group, and I couldn't care less. Its shameful, but I have come to realize that I may never have my passions translate into the workplace. 
5	I‚Äôm just glad that it‚Äôs going to get warm out again soon. Adventuring through nature, longboarding And graffitiing are my outs to my normal mundane life. I think we just think so much about things that when we can‚Äôt act on them they eat away at us. I just try to do things I enjoy, talk with my close friend and brother and break the rules to feel like I‚Äôm not just a machine.  
4	This is an interesting thought, thank you for posting it.\n\n\nI thought about it for a bit, but I can't really say that I have struggled in my life. Sure, some things weren't great and there are some things that are semi-great at the moment, but overall 'struggle' is not a word I would have used to describe my life. If anything, I should have struggled a bit more in times when I was too quick to let go. Unfortunately I don't really have any answers why this is the case, maybe I have been lucky so far, and you have been unlucky, or maybe it is nothing like that, it ist most likely infinitely more intricate than that. I know that changing the world is pretty difficult, for some people it is as difficult as changing themselves - especially their perception and outlook on it. But for some it can be easier to try to shift their perception just a tiny bit, than to change the world a lot. I have no clue about your life, so reading about someone telling you to just look at everything again with your tilted slightly to the left might be annoying, sound pretentious and not applicable to your situation at all - but it has helped others, so I am willing to take the gamble.\n\n\nP.S: I would, however also like to mention that this subreddit is maybe not an accurate representation of the average INFP, it is more akin to an something like the average representation of INFP problems.
3	Dealing with leaving home	So I'm 22 (F), and  I've never lived away from home before. This fall I started a full time program at a college that's a three hour drive from home, and I'm living on campus. My mom and I have always been very close. I try to come home whenever I can, which is almost every weekend. Sometimes she comes and visits me. Still, she misses me very much when I go. The parting is the hardest part, then we do ok most of the time. I think I do better than her being on my own. I'm busy with my program, have plenty to distract me, and I'm much more introverted than she is. She does pretty good too though. She's always busy and takes good care of herself. It's the leaving part that's really awful. I can feel that she is sad the day I leave and it kills me. It hurts so bad that sometimes it kind of makes me angry. I try to show as little as possible though, and be positive to make her feel better. It's not super healthy to bottle up my feelings, but I don't want to make her more upset because that would make me more upset. She has a more dramatic way of expressing her emotions than me, which kind of makes it hard too. She keeps her composure when I'm leaving but when I'm gone she gets really anxious and upset sometimes. She says she doesn't like feeling that way and wants to get better but she can't help it. I probably just have to wait until we get used to this, but in the meantime it hurts every weekend. I just wanted to get it off my chest, since I don't talk to anyone much about my emotions. Thanks for listening.
1	Good job with expressing your emotions! I think it's important. üòä I believe you'll manage, both of you. üå∑
1	Be happy you dint get screwed over and get put the other side of the country.
15	First post !	Ok so long time lurker, first time poster (both to this sub and to reddit!). I made an account just to keep up with my favorite subs but I always get so anxious/start over-thinking when I start typing up a comment or a post that I just stop. But idk I don‚Äôt want to live like that anymore! And I don‚Äôt have to! So....hi! \n\nThis is one of my favorite communities because of how nice and totally not alone you guys make me feel so that‚Äôs why I decided to do my first post here :) \n\nAnyways, I can feel that good ol‚Äô anxiety creeping up and so I‚Äôm gonna post this right away before I chicken out !
6	Hi üòÅ, I'm kinda new to Reddit in general and just found this today.
3	Welcome to the fam! I had a similar experience when I first found this community. It's crazy its like the only people that understand or care to understand INFP's are INFP's and this place has been amazing for that. Keep on posting:)
6	INFP (f) relationship with ISTJ (m)	What are your experiences of this relationship dynamic? \n\nI'm in a LTR with and ISTJ and we are struggling. I LOVE change, he hates it. It's really affecting how we progress in our relationship. I have never had a relationship that is as reliable as this one, which brings me a sense of peace, but I feel so stifled and my emotions and mood swings are giving him whiplash. \n\nHelp! 
3	You know your relationship best, and you know yourself. If the fundamental parts of each of you are too different for you both to be happy long term, then it may be time to face that.\nI say this as an infp who spent too many years trying to make it work with an intj partner. Everything felt like a struggle, I was incredibly unhappy, felt unloved, and like a hollowed out version of myself. \nI am currently in a much more fulfilling and emotionally supportive relationship with someone who gives love, support, and listens even if he can't understand my emotional volatility. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best. 
3	i know one ISTJ male and i am a female INFP. as much as i tried to make things work, it never did. he comes off as incredibly cold and logical to a fault. bad at expressing emotions and comforting me. was very manipulative in the end. i hope your istj is not like this. 
3	I just came out of s 2 year relationship with ISTJ.\n\nI loved his stability, gentleness, and honesty.\n\nHowever, my soul withered because he could not feed it. \n\nWe ended things for many reasons, but ultimately because it wasn't "logical " to love me.\n\n
122	I know I've posted a lot today, but I couldn't pass this one up. True enough to hurt a little bit.	
11	Once had the cyberskills to make friends online, now i am a failure at both
6	That's because you can't use MEMES to communicate in real life.
3	Yeah cus in person you think differently about your response, on the internet it's much less about the person liking you by coming up with something amazing to say to them(we all suffer the need to be liked) and we're relaxed ourselves just focusing on what the content is that the person you're speaking to is saying.\nThe moment you focus on what the individual is saying only then good things happen.\nTry this üòÅ
3	This is why I love INFP‚Äôs. You like having friends enough to occasionally invite me to do things so I don‚Äôt sit in the dark long enough to fully mummify.
6	You guys do sometimes spend way too much time in your heads when conversing in person due to often overthinking things that don't require the overthinking.
6	Why am I the opposite tho
2	Honestly fucking same. But I‚Äôve been working on it. Today I went to get a drink with a friend and she mentioned how I‚Äôm a good people person. She thinks that because I socialize a lot but I explained to her that it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs part of my job, I have to be engaging and network a lot. I explained to her how lonely it makes me feel and that I value genuine relationships over just going out and talking to anyone. And I‚Äôm happy because I felt I was able to share things about my life I had never told her and was too scared to tell her.  I think our friendship became that much stronger today.
2	It's actually alot easier and more fulfilling to make friends irl given the right setting, but starting a approaching someone to start a conversation, hell nawh
1	Acc. 
8	PLS: Send me your book recommendations!!	I used to really love reading, but for the past couple years, video games, social media and the internet in general has taken up a lot of my free time. I miss the enlightenment that reading used to bring me and how I developed different aspects of my own character when I‚Äôm exposed to the different perspectives. \n\nSo I‚Äôm taking a very long cleanse from my video games and social media platforms (except for reddit) and in the meantime I‚Äôll get back with some books :‚Äô) \n\nSo please send me your recommendations on what to read! I‚Äôm very lost and there‚Äôs just so much to choose from.\n\nI‚Äôm open to ANYTHING. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be a ‚Äúbook that resonates with INFPs specifically‚Äù either. Just comment your favourite books, or recent reads that just opened your mind. I like the kind of books that leave me paralyzed for the next 20 minutes after I finish reading it and keep me thinking about it for the next week or so. You know what I‚Äôm talking about? \n\nThanks in advance! Also if there‚Äôs any book club on this subreddit let me know... maybe I should look into that too! If not, we should start one üòä have a lovely day (or night)!\n\n\n
2	My 2 favorite books are Catcher in the Rye by Salinger and End of the Affair by Graham Green\n\nI have more recommendations if you already read that ^
2	The Mountain Man book series. There's a short story intro to it (31 pages) called The Hospital. It's free digitally on Amazon. Got me hooked and there were 5 more books to follow it. Lone guy in Nova Scotia after zombie virus outbreak. Gets very interesting.
2	All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. I‚Äôm a better writer because of this book, it‚Äôs beautiful
2	New York Stories(Auster), The Secret History(Tartt), White Noise(Delillo, Shogun(Clavell), The Pearl(Steinbeck), Beartown(Backman), Turtles All the Way Down (Green), all very different. 
2	I zipped right through Ham and Rye by Charles Bukowski. It was recommended to me by a philosophy professor when I asked for books about making sense of life.\n\nI also love Amy Tan, who has a very distinct INFP writing style. Saving Fish From Drowning about a bunch of tourists in politically unstable Burma has stuck with me for almost a decade, because it was so personal and even humorous in the center of it all.\n
2	I always find myself coming back to I capture The Castle, Never Let Me Go, A Confederacy of Dunces, and Everything Is Illuminated.
2	I'm currently reading Repetition by Peter Handke, which is a INFP masterpeice imo. 
2	If you want some weird shit you should check out the ‚ÄúJohn dies in the end‚Äù series. David Wong has a truly unique sense of humor and a mind that‚Äôs possibly too creative. The first book in the series (it‚Äôs just called John dies in the end) is a little rough, but the story is worth it. If it‚Äôs too hard to follow, the second book doesn‚Äôt have those problems and it‚Äôll catch you up to speed. It‚Äôs very similar to hitchhiker‚Äôs guide to the galaxy (also really good) in many ways. Also features hotdog cellphones, shadow people, and evil trans-dimensional gods made outa meat. If that doesn‚Äôt intrigue you nothing will.
2	*Britt-Marie Was Here* by Fredrik Backman\n\nRead it during the spiraling-down of my last relationship. Finished it about a week after he broke up with me. Really made an impact on me and helped me see the light. One of the few books I can only describe as "soul food".
1	Something I just read and thoroughly enjoyed, not too long either\n\nCannery Row by John Steinbeck
1	It's a popular one but if you haven't read the Book Thief, that'd be my recommendation. I think I cried for a good hour after finishing it and I just couldn't stop for the life of me. \nI also read kokoro by natsume soseki and it's quite slow in the first half but after finishing it, I thought about it for a good week and still do at times. I had to lay down the second I finished it too.
1	- Madeline Dare series by Cornelia Read  \n- How to Talk to a Widower by Jonathan Tropper  \n- Beach Music by Pat Conroy  \n- Love Will Tear Us Apart by Sarah Rainone  \n- So Much for That by Lionel Shriver  \n- Spin by Catherine McKenzie  \n- Stupid and Contagious by Caprice Crane  \n- Miriam Black series by Chuck Wendig  \n- Newsflesh trilogy by Mira Grant  \n- Red Sparrow trilogy by Jason Matthews
56	Treat for you lot	
3	Now  I see where purple rain comes from.
3	Wow, i love it! Very original in my opinion!
1	Love it! Great job!
55	Starlord diabetes	
5	LOL I'm so conflicted
8	I laughed lmao
10	People are rude about this kind of thing and really it just comes across as someone so stuck up their own ass and happy with the smell. 
2	ü§≠üòÇ
4	Lol thats wild. On another note, that‚Äôs my soulmate right there. Totally matches my Sag sun/cancer moon
1	Lmao
1	Hahaha people are dicks. It makes a lot of sense actually to have a cancer moon and be an infp. If I was talking to you and you told me those two things, I'd be in heaven. Meyers Briggs and natal chart shit is like my fav thing. 
20	Have you been told that you seem apathetic?	A close friend told me that I seemed apathetic now and then. She said it looked like I did not feel joy or happiness , no emotions. I know that it is not how I feel. Do INFPs often struggle to show emotions?\n\nIf that is the case, It have definitely have hurt my relationships with other people.
9	To people who just met me, I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm apathetic. Which is partially true because, you know, I have no real relationship with a stranger, why should I care? Of course I‚Äôm courteous, and a overall empathetic person to pretty much everyone. But I‚Äôm most empathetic to friends. 
4	I didn't realize until a few months ago, but i tend to speak more with a more monotone voice than others do, most of the time but especially when i'm with people i'm less comfortable with, and i think that can give people the impression that you have less emotion/care less about things (which is totally absolutely not the case for me). my friend who's also an infp says that it's a common infp thing... i just thought it was funny because i really didn't notice i did it until someone pointed it out to me lol
6	I hate being called this - especially when people say I have no emotions or something. Oh I have a whole lot of emotions, I just hide it well most of the time, or I'm just tired. Just because I'm not that expressive doesn't mean I don't feel anything.
3	I have a tendency to hid my emotions really well. I actually only have one friend who can tell when I‚Äôm hiding something. 
3	I've definitely been told this, and have been making an effort lately to adjust the appearance. INFPs are often described as seeming "aloof" to others, since our primary function is introverted feeling. We can be too busy sorting out how information fits into the bigger picture of the world around us to externalize what gears are turning in our heads.\n\nWe are, however, idealists, and we're great at "what ifs." I've found that externalizing my thoughts by expressing those "what if" ideas, connecting less-related things in a way other people may not think to, or even just relating to other people through metaphors can be helpful to break through the "aloof" appearance, since that's a natural way for me to express what I otherwise might not acknowledge externally.
2	i personally feel like i don‚Äôt show emotional expression on my face very well. sometimes i purposefully don‚Äôt want to show when i‚Äôm excited because i want to portray myself as a really mellow person. idk why. 
2	Me, I beat down my emotions when I was younger and they haven‚Äôt resurfaced. So I don‚Äôt know.
2	Yes, people often ask me if I'm bored or tired
2	This drives me nuts. People are always telling me to smile more. Just because I don't go around constantly with a smile on like some extroverted idiot, doesn't mean I'm not happy or am apathetic. \n\nWe are focused on our internal world so it makes total sense we aren't expressing things outwardly as much. If people make assumptions about me based on that they probably don't have a deeper understanding of introvert nature, so to hell with them.
2	My coworker has told me I look like Eeyore. Like I have resting sad face. Others tell me I look tired or depressed. This is not the case when I'm around people I'm comfortable with. My wife says that if you capture those small moments, you would think that I was an extrovert. 
2	Sometimes I can be apathetic, but I‚Äôm usually very emotional. Like I cry a ton, sometimes in front of people. 
1	I reserve my attention only to those who I think deserves it
9	Can pick up on internal judgement	One girl in the classes clearly does not like me. She loves to talk about body language. Has an look on judgement whenever I talk, with flared nostrils and a hand on her hip. Is it normal to pick up on this kind of thing? I feel like judging personalities have that obvious tell in that. She is also really extroverted and she does that kind of relational bullying kind of stuff with me. She is just a young punk. She thinks she is funny but really she is just insensitive and probably intimidated of me. Not a fan. 
4	She's probably ESTJ. Just my opinion. Regardless I avoid people like that like the plague. And yeah, I pick up manipulative judgey stuff like that from a mile away. It frequently makes me a target, because I see through these kinds of people and that threatens them, because many people, surprisingly, buy into their game. INFPs, like a lot of empaths, have the ability to reflect back to people their shadow and some people absolutely cannot stand it.
1	Yeah. Maybe it's the J.  Of course people can be jerks in every category but that would makes sense from the way you described her.
44	Took this few years ago in my home town :)	
2	Great shot 
1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
20	My best friend just got married, and didn't invite me, or tell me	I  had to move a couple of years ago for university, but at the time, I had this  best friend, and we lived together with her mum. We would even stay up at night talking about what our weddings would be like and stuff. We were super close and said we were like sisters.  When I moved, university really got on top of me, and I suffered with severe depression the whole time which made it super difficult for me to  be a good friend, and I felt incredibly guilty for it because we didn't  talk enough. But, when I saw her, it felt like nothing had changed, and  we were still best friends. I even spent last Christmas with her and  her partner, before the one just gone. She got engaged while I was away,  and I was so happy for them you know, and her and him were doing super cool things with their lives like travelling a load and that, and I didn't have the money to do those things, I was bogged down with my studies, and I think that made us at odds. She was living her best life, and I felt like I was living my worst at the time. I know I haven't been the bestest  friend in the world, and to be honest, I couldn't have been, I was  barely keeping it together being miles away from my friends and family  and the isolation and heaviness at uni. I didn't think that made us not  friends.... but I guess maybe she felt different. I was supposed to do  her wedding make up too, because she wanted to save money. I texted  her over a week ago to tell her that I was sorry, sorry for not being a  better friend and I explained why, and that I wished I could have been  there for her. I offered to take her out for coffee and bought her a couple of surprise gifts, including a home planner for when they're married. I didn't get a reply.\n\nI just found out they got married two weeks ago, and so it explains why I just heard radio silence.\n\nI don't know. I'm truly heartbroken right now. I don't know what to say... I get it, obviously, but it hurts so much to think of us both as super close and to realise that actually, we aren't at all. It just helps to get this off my chest right now. I really saw like a sister. I just keep crying, and I think I'll be tender over this for a while, because I feel like I'm grieving a loss that I can't put my finger on. This sucks. I was so eager to move back home to pick up where my life left off, but it's so fragmented now.
9	There's a lot of stuff that goes into wedding planning and guest lists and it often has less to do with you and more to do with planning and family logistics.  Don't beat yourself up over it.  My college best friend didn't tell me she'd gotten married beforehand either, and when I got the details it turned out to be a very very small wedding to avoid social drama that had nothing to do with me.  My current best friend had a "just family" wedding because her mother was fussing her about sleeping with her boyfriend, and my friend didn't invite any personal friends because she thought the whole thing was stupid.\n\nIt's still sad though.  I'd cry and be hurt if it was me, but if you think she's worth it I'd try to gently inquire into details so you can understand why it happened.
6	*hugs from miles away* \u.u/
1	I feel this. It‚Äôs sad :( I‚Äôve seen people post about their weddings and I thought I was their friend but I wasn‚Äôt even invited but a bunch of our other friends are there. I don‚Äôt even know who I would invite to my own wedding let alone bridesmaids. Like all my friends are online and live far away and my friends from college don‚Äôt invite me to things
29	Do you still feel awkward even after resolving an issue with someone?	Even if we talk things out and fix things, things still feel weird. I still remember that whole ordeal in the back of my mind, and I assume they feel it too. Because no matter the outcome there is still that tension between us. It's why I avoid conflicts at all cost. \n\nAny of you feel this way after a conflict? Any tips to get past the awkwardness?
5	Yes!! I end up just not contacting that person again unless they contact me but only if it doesn't happen again. If it's a repeated thing of them causing conflict with me then I just leave and never speak to that person again. IDK if that the best thing to do but its what feel the most natural for me to do. 
1	same... v.v/
1	Yup.
1	Yeah for a few days :/ 
0	I made this prank for you <3	https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/as6vjx/im_sorry_i_foold_you_like_this_twice_heres_my\n\n\nINFJ AMA
-2	Please love me now /s?
28	Any guitar players in here? Love me some Rex	
2	Omg you're so cute!
2	yeeesssss his music is glow
1	Awesome ! I play guitar too but I‚Äôm way too shy to play in-front of another human. 
5	Tidying up	Anybody else here feel like watching Marie Kondo, but scared that you'll find out that you're actually a hoarder?
2	I've been meaning to watch it. Seems satisfying.
1	Watch it ! I just folded everything and it looks so nice 
0	How do INFP's feel about putting structure into typically non structured things like dating, romance and sex?	Things like a dating bucketlist, the mojo upgrade sex preference quiz, taking the MTBI etc... \n\nMe and my BF have been together a while.\nThings like our dates, adventures, and romance are still pretty spontaneous.\n\nBut mainly in the bedroom, I want to try some new things. I want to get my INFP BF to do mojo upgrade with me (a sex preference quiz) but I'm hesitant if he will feel awkward or offended that something typically spontaneous has a structure.\n\nI say this because he doesn't seem to get excited over plans and structure in life in general. Which I get! I'm generally the same (ENFP here) but I guess I also see the value of applying it to certain areas.\n\nHow do y'all feel about it? 
2	I‚Äôd be cool with it 
2	Just go with the moment. Or plan it and do it. He probably is very comfortable with the spontaneity.\n. \n
2	I‚Äôd feel excited about being able to improve my life with structure, but it‚Äôs not realistic. When someone tells me to do something, I‚Äôd feel like it‚Äôs a chore and super not want to do it.  \n\nExample: my partner wrote me a schedule for how I should spend a day to get back on track. (Recovering from depression). And I tried to follow it and hated it so much. I even hated things I usually enjoy, like reading. I couldn‚Äôt stay on track and then felt guilty about not being able to do it. 
51	Tell me how you romanticize a day. I can‚Äôt be the only one!	Hi everyone! My name is Jessica and I am so happy to have found you all! I created a reddit account today just to subscribe to this group. Reading some of your posts has already warmed my heart with feelings of recognition and deep understanding. \n\nI‚Äôm in a romantic mood today, and for me romance has a dream-like quality where each thing/action has feeling, weight, sound and a day dream feel attached to it. \nFor example:  Today I have a Barbra Streisand special playing in the background but I‚Äôve already rewound one part over and over again because the intro is so pure and powerful. I‚Äôm drinking hot coffee in my favorite rotund, green coffee mug. I‚Äôve brushed my hair out so that my curls are messy and big which makes me feel more connected to being a woman and natural. I have been burning two candles that are pine and fireside scented, and even though it is cold outside I have cracked my kitchen window so I can feel a breeze and hear the birds and cars go by. All this while perched on my couch wrapped up in soft blankets and surrounded by velvet pillows. \n\nI‚Äôm sure many of you get these days where you feel romantic and dreamy. What do yours consist of? I‚Äôm so curious!
9	Welcome to this sub! Can't help smiling reading your post, you sure are having a good time. My dreamy days would involve me letting down my hair (my hair is pulled into a bun most of the time) and let the scent from the shampoo tickles my nose. I would listen to good music too, sometimes classical piano piece, looking out at the trees swaying and clouds drifting in the sky. The day would be full of gentleness and smiles.. :) 
8	I don't have the capability of putting my hair down since I'm a guy and It's pretty short. I think a good day for me is one where I can either spend all day:  A. Drawing or B. binge-ing some random rom-com anime I found on crunchyroll or netflix. Show's like that make my heart happy and drawing is a good escapism if I've got anything stressful going on. I'm glad your day is going well. Remember to drink plenty of water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso u/Dreamsawait28 I rate your username 8/8. It's pretty great.
6	This is very wholesome and it makes me happy right now. Whenever I'm having a good day like that, I tend to laugh at the little things and sort of jump around everywhere haha. I also dance a little to music in front of people like if I'm doing the dishes. Just like the other person above, if I'm really in a good mood I'll put my hair down and shake it while listening to music (I usually have my hair up in a bun as well because it's really long). I'm glad you're having such a fantastic day! 
4	Well I like rainy days. Especially ones when I get to stay home and really focus on reading a book. Or stay in bed next to a window and listen to a podcast with my eyes closed. It helps if I‚Äôm drinking something hot like chocolate and milk. But your day sounds awesome 
3	I love having days like that! Whenever I get that warm, bright feeling like I think you're describing, where everything feels right, I write out a nice description of exactly what's happening, just like this! It's so nice to be able to recall those moments in detail when times are less wonderful.
3	Oh my, that is a powerfully cozy picture you paint! Sounds absolutely perfect, I love every bit of that. This is exactly how I am, I romanticize everything. I love how you describe what romantic feels like to you. I definitely relate :)
3	As strange as it sounds, a leisure drive around nice areas where the open sky is especially beautiful. It can be broad daylight, dawn, or sunset. Even gloomy weather can have a sense of nostalgia. Accompanied with the appropriate music to my taste with the windows rolled down occasionally to enhance the sounds and atmosphere and it's perfect. I also love night drives. I romanticize the heck out of that. They're like very personally special moments that I tend to dream of sharing with that special someone (which thankfully I've already found ‚ò∫Ô∏è). Also, this car freshener I've been trying out is super pleasant. It's tea-like with hints of sweetness.
2	Making time to do morning pages (even though I wake up after noon). Making a big ass rice bowl, ideally with an avocado or jackfruit. Opening curtains to get some sunlight, saying hey to my plants. Stitching some embroidery or drawing in my notebook. Going for a walk. 
2	This is honestly such an adorable post. I have nothing to offer myself, but hopefully I can learn from everyone else in this thread. <3
2	I somehow revert to my childhood and remember when I imagined as a child about the things I am now doing as an adult. For example, now when I‚Äôm home alone I romanticize the moment because I often fantasized about it when I was younger and remember that. It happens in bursts all the time. I‚Äôll stand somewhere and suddenly everything about that moment will feel magical and warm. 
2	Leaving New York on the train looking out the window as the world rushes past. I listen to John Coltrane, A Love Supreme, and wonder where she is
1	When I'm in the mood you describe, I like to sit out on my porch and listen to funny reddit narrations all the while feeling the deck under my bare feet and sipping my favorite coffee. I feel this way most when a chill is in the air on a cloudy day. There is just a true sense of wonder that I feel seeing the world gray. I love to get lost in that wonder and feel as though I am on a million journeys simaltaniously\n\nFor that fleeting moment nothing but that moment truly matters and I am whole. \n\nHope that made sense. 
27	How does an INFP make friends as an adult?	I always feel happy when i‚Äôm around people I can connect with. As I get older, friendships dwindle, people get busier, and I just feel more disconnected from the world. It seems like I am always the person who puts in the effort to maintain friendships, but i‚Äôm so...tired.\n\nI wish I had a close group of friends here, but I don‚Äôt even have anyone I connect with. If I weren‚Äôt so socially awkward, life would‚Äôve been easier :(\n\nHow do you all make new friends? 
13	From my experience the best way to make friends is to leave your house and get involved in clubs, events, bands, whatever it is that you are passionate about that you can share with other people as you engage in that passion. If you are in college, you can join an extracurricular club. If you have a job, you could try to arrange a social event with your coworkers. Expose yourself to the world and the friends with inevitably come :)
5	Welcome to my life. I have never felt so bleh about people.. In my mind I try not to think about how they look at me let alone wonder if they even notice the significant difference in effort to maintain a friendship (or care at all).. I know what you're doing wrong and it's just you being you. Probably would have more friends if I had qualities worth paying attention to I guess, maybe it's the same case for you? Isolating yourself at home because lack of friends would definitely feed the never ending loop. I started doing volunteer work at a charter school which.. doesn't help with the friends situation, but it fills some of the void- you know?\n\nI even tried going to a club for a bit a while back but that slowly grew to be cumbersome- it's all we did and to be honest I felt no synergy... And nobody was my age. I had better results with another group perhaps merely on the topic it was covering, but it didn't lead to anybody interested in being friends. Either everyone else is also awkward, it's now a new taboo in our society, me, or people suck too much.\n\nI only have one strong friend via internet at this point from university as roommates for a little while where we talked about life, philosophy, personal values..etc. He still values me as a true friend and I the same for him.. So I don't know other than him. Was it because our similar interests or that we got to know each other merely living in the same room for about a month? I don't know. Only other friends I have are through my wife which again isn't the same.
4	Thanks for asking this, I wish I knew the answer myself. I'm only just about to turn 19 but the few friends I have are all just friends of friends of friends since I was a kid. Slowly drifting away from the friend I had originally (who basically just came up to me as young kids) and then befriending their friends and so on. Everyone I know was friends with a past one and it feels like I've never actually made my own friend before.\n\nI'm moving for the first time in my life and I know it will be more difficult to see the friends I have right now, but I have no idea how to meet people in a town even further away from anything than I am right now :/
3	Friends come and go for us my dude. Ride the vibes of your life and the choices you make will naturally lead you to the friends you are meant for. I'm willing to bet most of us here have relationship problems. We have enough energy in our lives for a SO and maybe one more person at a time. The rest is dedicated to internal thought and processing. We don't make good lifelong friends, but we make great situational friends when someone needs something (or vice versa.) \n\nAlso, look for those who you can turn to without guilt even if you don't talk to them for two years. My best friends are those that I could call up tomorrow and have a conversation with, as if we just did it yesterday. And I haven't seen/heard from them in years. \n\nThis is a really shitty r/narcicism thing to say but I feel like many people want us in their lives because our presence is really different, calming, and thought-provoking. We naturally want to be a presence in people's lives, but we can't do this for everyone and everything we want to. I think the solution is to do things that allow you to get your presence out, but in ways that don't require intense commitment. This is why I comment on Reddit and this sub even lol. \n
3	Volunteer, be it a clean up campaign or canything. I joined the Leo club (it's a volunteer organisation and it's worlwide), most of my new friends come from voluntering prjexts with Leo.
3	I agree with others. The best way to meet people is to join a club or social group of some kind. Especially those that are recurring on a regular basis. Just meeting someone once and trying to be friends puts a lot of pressure on both parties. But getting to know people gradually things unfold more naturally, which is why clubs or ongoing group activities with the same groups of people work so well. \n\nIt may take a few times of seeing someone to even feel comfortable conversing and that's actually pretty normal human behavior across the board I believe. People who come on too strong often have an agenda or come across as needy and awkward.
2	This may sound cliche but I think the method is being 100% your self. I don‚Äôt think Fi doms are good at initiating much. Most of my friends initiated the first few conversations. But I think something about Fi makes people want to approach us. Perhaps it‚Äôs the passion combined with the authenticity? Idk dude, but it seems to work 
2	Same.
2	Pretend to be an alcoholic and go to AA meetings! Or really be an alcoholic and go to AA meetings!\n\n(ps. they have to accept you)
2	I've made a few unexpected new friendships from just engaging in casual chat with people who work at places I usually go.\n\nIt's hard to get a real line of conversation started, but once you get used to talking to people under conditions like that you start to warm up to them.
395	Decided to study outside yesterday:)	
14	This is a nice shot!\n\nOn an unrelated note, this picture reminds me a lot of the opening scene in Donnie Darko. That movie is nearly incomprehensible, but I‚Äôve always watched it with friends, so it makes me happy to think about. Thanks for the weird nostalgia smile. :)
9	Looks like the Netherlands
3	What if somebody wonders why you are there? It must be really peaceful to study there.
3	username is üî•
2	Looks like a park I know in nj 
2	Where is that place? Looks nice.
2	I would love to be at a place like that perhaps not for study but just sitting there
2	Were you sitting in that spot you took the picture?
2	It looks a lot like my village in one area
2	:D 
2	I don't see snow.\n\nI envy you.
6	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 18	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
3	Ok so I really want to ask a friend of mine (ENFP, 16) to move in with me after she graduates next year (I'm 17). She has BPD and we've joked about this before but I legitimately want to do it. Should I man up and tell her? I'm a bit confused.
1	ENTP here, how do i cheer up my INFP friend when he is feeling down? any trade secrets?
49	Deepest depths of despair, highest heights of joy. Both were done in the same 4 hour painting session.	
2	There is a song called Peach by a band called Broods and it is basically about this feeling.\n\nOne of the lines is: \n\nI know it's hard to see me down\nI cry and cry upon the ground\nA simple price I pay for all the love I feel when I'm okay\n\nIt makes sense to meee . Thank you for sharing too ‚ù§Ô∏è
2	Nice that doge makes me very happy.
2	Despair is sooo dope!
1	Cats or Dogs, which is better?	You can say neither if you really can't decide ;P\n\nedit: Tell us whether you've had both before, I'd love to know your opinion.
5	i like both\n\n&#x200B;
3	Dogs.
3	Currently have both and definitely dogs
3	Caaaats
2	I‚Äôm a cat person 
1	They're both wonderful creatures
1	Prefer cats. They are more open minded. 
1	Cats
10	Have you ever dated another INFP and if so how did it go?	I did because he was so much like me. As if he was the male version of me. He really liked me but I wasn‚Äôt so sure about him. In the end it didn‚Äôt last long and it ended kinda badly but we‚Äôre friends now (and yes I know that might be bad). So what was you guys experience?
11	I dated one. It was okay. I want to try another.\n\nWhat I love about the infp-infp dynamic is the nonstop romanticism. Everyday I woke up to a heartfelt good morning and every night I went to sleep feeling reassured and confident about his feelings for me.  I think what was difficult was that we both were stuck in our ways to an extent and no one wanted to budge. So there were certain differences that were very difficult to work through due to a lack of compromise 
7	Am 'dating' an infp right now. We met only 7 months ago and since October we've been in a long distance relationship you could say. Unfortunately we didn't had the opportunity to meet yet, but we're gonna meet soon.\n\nThis is my experience so far. So we're 19yo and 18yo, and so far it has been absolute magical. We're both hopeless romantics, and super loving towards each other. Every day starts with a goodmorning message, and every day ends with a goodnight message (ik, cringeüòÖ). We also have a lot in common. Personally, I share my 3 biggest interest with her. Yet we still differ in certain things. F.e. , I'm super talkative to her. But she is super listening towards me. So, for now I can say that I never met someone even close as amazing as her. This relationship is exactly as the one I always fantasized aboutüòä
4	I did...Two dates and they were amazing. He brought out the manic pixie dream girl part of me. I thought everything was going well, he even talked about going on a tropical vacation together and told me the sex was amazing. He would tell me that "I get him"  and that "I'm the best" ....And then boom. Ghosted me. Never answered back a text or following texts. I still have no closure about why or what happened to this day and it drives me crazy and I get sad about it.  \n\nIt's weird BC I thought that him being an INFP would be a good thing....Like, "oh he'll be a good person like me"....Was not expecting the ghosting and consequent heartbreak with that. 
6	You know how you think about and idealise what the love of your life would be..?\n\nImagine that dream coming true.. and better than you ever thought.\n\n*sigh*
3	"dated" really short time. Lol I got really into him and then it stopped. He wasn't ready and wasn't that into me. Lol he might have low-key used me but not on purpose. Was about month ago. He still on my mind a lot. He was awesome!!!  And I hope life goes well for him. Sad that didn't get to know him more. I going on date with a new Infp person soon maybe. Want that deep sweet connection again. üòä\n\nBut I have Infp male friend and he is younger than me and we are really good friends. Never have I thought about him in other way.\n\n
3	We got married after meeting on r/exmormon. 
13	ENFP here dating an INFP. Need relationship advice.	My BF (22M) has a lot of the classic traits of the INFP. Creative, smart, writer, introvert.\nHe has the same struggles of loneliness, pessimism and depression.\n\nI noticed he was a bit flat for a couple of days and when I asked him what was wrong he said, "I feel dead inside" then giggled.\n\nHe has these depressive moments occassionally where life seems meaningless. I know this probably won't ever change. That's okay.\n\nI just want to know what to do in those moments.\n\nI try to give him some affection and assurance that I'm here for him. I do this by scratching his head, booping his nose or giving him a heartfelt  compliment.\n\nWhat would you appreciate in these moments? 
10	I‚Äôd say make your SO feel safe and loved. I know, it sounds kinda obvious and super cheesy, but in those moments we actually need that reassurance. It‚Äôs better to have simple plans, nothing too elaborate. Even tucking us in bed is something extremely nurturing in times of need. I hope this helps!
9	i would appreciate lots of cuddles and maybe food, depends tho. maybe talk about one of his latest projects with him, it helps to take your mind off the nothingness of depression and focus on lets say... one of your characters.  
7	i think you‚Äôre already doing the right thing! \n\ni think.. for me being around someone who makes me feel safe/reassured/loved/appreciated/like they believe in you/understood is the best thing! \n\ni would be a little bit careful with feeling too responsible for his moods, it could you make you feel frustrated or forget about the things you want, and it could make him feel too emotionally dependent or feel guilty when these moods don‚Äôt go away. though that‚Äôs a little bit of experience i have and it doesn‚Äôt have to be like that in every situation! \n\ni think you‚Äôre really sweet for wanting to help him like this!
3	Honestly distraction. I've dealt with stuff like that for a while now and the one thing I know is I'm very prone to getting into these destructive thought loops. Anything that could break the pattern, shift my perspective, basically get me away from the black hole that sucks me in. It's not always easy pulling myself out of it. Sometimes I'm too far gone before I realize I'm doing it again.
3	Hi, INFP here who is in a relationship with an ENFP. If this were me who was feeling a bit flat something that would help would be just talking about it. INFPs can be rather secretive at times and bottle things up but encouraging them to open up and talk about their feelings always helps. We're not always looking for advice or a solution to our problems, just for someone to listen and support us through them. Hope this helps:)
2	Very nice that you want to be there for him. Just give him love and support. As an INFP male all I‚Äôm looking for from a girl is emotional support and evidence that she cares about me. The depressive thoughts come and go, but the strength of love and support stays with us. 
2	Be like an ENFJ. That is probably what he needs to break out of his shell. He needs someone to push him to grow and become his best self.
2	"stop being a cringy nihilist"\n\n"you're not you when you're hungry"\n\n"give it a hundred and ten percent, bobby"\n\nEH?..... any of these? I feel like sometimes you need to be hard on someone (wife is to me),\n\nbut I don't want to make you to make it worse :s\n\nOh and...\n\n"I think I'm pregnant" Don't do this. Not... good.. trust me... people can be unpredictable and "unaware" in some sense. I mean maybe it can be funny but don't let the silence take over, maybe a "gotcha!" after a good long second before he speaks.
1	Ask him what helps.    \n\n\nFor me, just being around someone I care about helps tremendously.  
17	Does anyone else ever feel lonely when spending time with other people?	Not really sure if this makes sense, but does anyone else in this sub feel lonely, even when they‚Äôre spending time with friends? I can be doing something fun with them, but still feel a sense that I‚Äôm missing something, and feel left out sometimes. 4/5 times I hang out with friends I feel this way.\n\n
8	Yes. Absolutely. This was my entire high school / uni experience. I‚Äôve learned now that I am no good in groups. Better 1:1 or 2:1. And usually only if that‚Äôs deep, connected conversations / growth focused. 
3	Yeah I feel that, too, sometimes. It happens most when I‚Äôm with a group of people rather than if it‚Äôs just a one on one situation. \n\nI think it depends on the people as well. I can think of a few friends where I tend to feel lonely around them, even if we‚Äôre supposedly having fun. \n\nOn the other hand, there are a special few who truly make every moment spent with them worth living for. I wouldn‚Äôt trade them for the world. Ngl,  I think these people are few and far between, I can only think of two in my life. \n\nI know it‚Äôs hard to be lonely. I struggled with it pretty much my whole life. Just remember there are people in this world who dream of having a friend like you, and you still have the rest of your life to find them. \n\nHere‚Äôs a video you might want to watch https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA\n\n\n\n
1	Loneliness and being alone are not the same thing. Here's a great video about loneliness\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv\_g3g-mA&t=653s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA&t=653s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Almost all the time. I‚Äôm coming to accept that i‚Äôm more of a lone wolf 
14	Any INFP love doing housework? Or has anyone learned to ‚Äúnot hate‚Äù keeping a clean and tidy home? I‚Äôm looking for tips to change my attitude towards the monotony of housework...	
16	We make it a jam session.  Crank up some hoppy music and make it fun.
8	I have to keep reminding myself that future me will thank me. \n\nMentally I always feel better after it‚Äôs done. And doing a little bit each day eliminates the need for the painstaking tackle of it taking your whole day. \n\nMusic ALWAYS helps. 
3	Omg! I‚Äôve been thinking about this for years now. Part of the reason I‚Äôve wondered if i‚Äôm an infj. I really like to clean, it‚Äôs therapeutic. But the thing is, when i‚Äôm creating, I don‚Äôt like to restrict myself. So I really don‚Äôt care how much mess I make at that point 
2	If it‚Äôs financially an option, hire someone to clean. I have struggled for decades with cleaning. In part because I have strong issues with the redundancy of it, in part because I‚Äôm so apathetic about how clean something needs to be that I have no internal motivation for it, and in part because my awareness of my surroundings is low and I only notice clutter not so much that something needs to be cleaned. I‚Äôve tried schedules (last for a short time and then forgotten), turning it into a mindfulness activity (worked for a while and then didn‚Äôt), music, spacing over a week, burst mass cleaning, etc. Whenever possible I hire someone to clean and my overall well being is increased many times over by doing so. The time that would have been spent on soul crushing mundane life things gets rerouted to things I value and my house does not look like it it‚Äôs a few months away from a Hoarders episode. It is by far the best solution I have found that sticks. 
2	I like doing housework when:\n\n1) I am stressed.\n\n2) I am having company over and I want the place to look nice.\n\n3) When it is doing the dishes. I don't know why but doing the dishes is very meditative for me.
70	Already do.	
2	Happiness is found in the struggle to getting what you want.  Not in actuality having it. 
81	Thanks fellow infp u/wizardflurryhome for the beautiful Valentine's exchange postcard!	
1	How pretty!.. Is that a water color?
38	All INFPs need to watch this.	
8	Honestly, I feel called out by this video. I‚Äôm a senior in high school. I moved to this school sophomore year and I was very depressed at the time. I actively withdrew from people at times, then wondered why I wasn‚Äôt close to anyone. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm disliked, but at this point I have forgotten how to make connections and become close to other people. I‚Äôm definitely the type of lonely in this video, as hard as it is to admit. It‚Äôs not like people hate me or I‚Äôm an outcast, but I have no close friends in this town and I have prevented myself from being close to anyone on purpose. 
3	This video and the ones by School of Life (their videos in general, not just about loneliness) spoke to me tbh
1	I saw this in my reccomended
1	Good vid. 
1	No thanks I don‚Äôt need a reminder of my life
25	Give your darkness some light and hug it.	Laugh and the world laughs with you.\nCry and you cry alone. Be the difference.
18	Snuck out onto the roof of our hotel in Ithaca w my friends last night	
1	Holy shit. Beautiful! 
7	Hey all. What artists, authors, bands resonate with you?	
3	Tool is definitely one of my favorite bands. 
2	Novo Amor.. (birthplace album holy)\nBon Iver \nBen Howard\nDermot Kennedy\n\n\nGraham Greene\nThe author of the book Catcher in the Rye\n\nyeah 
1	Radiohead
1	Owl city
1	Bands: Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Sigur R√≥s, Radiohead, etc\n\nArtists: I'm not too much into art, but I like impressionism like Monet\n\nAuthors: my favourite is the German author Hermann Hesse. I also like GRR Martin and older stuff such as Goethe or Dostoevsky
1	Curtis mayfield, his song move on up is so inspiring :D also there‚Äôs something about him, he seems to be like me. also jefferson airplane, janis joplin, quincy jones (summer in the city! 00:43-00:54)\nLa femme d‚Äôargent by air (it sounds like a blue sky with clouds) \nForge your own chains by D.R hooker (that doozy sax part after ‚Äúdrown your sorrows, in a drink‚Äù) 
88	This spoke to me! Saw this during a hospital visit.	
8	What does it speak to you, OP?
6	It my brain
9	Boundaries	Is anyone else just horrible at setting them, or having confrontation of any kind? 
2	It literally makes my stomach turn.
2	I can set them but I have a hard time holding myself to them. This is something I'm constantly working on. 
2	Yes and no? It seriously depends on my mood. There are times where I want someone to invade my space and flood me with an endless supply of love because i‚Äôm needy like that xD \n\nBut there are also times where I need to know that I can take space/time for myself without the threat of losing a persons respect/appreciation. And that‚Äôs when it becomes more difficult to set those boundaries 
1	I have trouble with them as well, it also makes me physically ill to try to say no to someone. I have wound up doing things or in situations that I didn't want because I was too afraid of disappointing someone or making them mad. But I'm not sure if that's just due to being a people pleaser or if that's actually an INFP thing. \n\nOnce I've had enough though, and I feel like they're not reciprocating, just taking advantage of me and I don't care if they get mad, then they can just fuck right off. 
1	There are boundaries; they are meant to keep other people away me and my close ones.
7	How would INFPs have manifested themselves if they lived in a world where slavery was common?	Scenario 1: Ancient Rome, so kinda "equal opportunity" slavery \n\nScenario 2: Confederate State of America, where slavery was based on race. \n\nHow do you think an INFP, providing that he/she's not a slave, would react to slavery while living in societies like these? 
7	As of right now, there‚Äôs currently more slavery in the world today than there has ever been in history. Check out the A21.org and other anti-human trafficking organizations to read more up on the topic. \n\nBut to answer your question, living in that type of world currently, I‚Äôve personally made it my life‚Äôs passion to raise awareness and do whatever I can in my power to help bring slavery to an end. I‚Äôm even enrolled in school currently to become a licensed social worker because I believe that‚Äôs how I can best serve the victims of this modern day slavery known as human trafficking. \n\nFinding out how common slavery was in the world today while I was in high school is what fueled my passion to do something about it and has set the course for my own life and personal career. It‚Äôs an injustice I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to turn my head to. 
1	I‚Äôm gunna directly answer your question rather than be a smart ass about it xD \n\nI honestly believe that I would be one of the first ones killed because it would be very hard for me to put my head down and obey dysfunctional authority figures. Even if I bite my tongue, my eyes have a heard time masking what I truly feel 
1	I've thought about this a lot. \n\nGoing off of how I have reacted to other types of discrimination against other people in the current day and age, I think I would've been against it but not out protesting alone and speaking out every chance I got if I lived in the slavery era. I think any thing I would've done would've been subtle, as in being kind to/helping out an individual, one on one. Saving up money and buying relatives/families to keep them together and treating them as part of the household - Give them everything they need and allow them to leave forever if they wanted to. Or to help slaves escape and be part of the underground railroad so I could play that double agent vibe. It's a little disappointing to think I wouldn't be all "SLAVERY IS WRONG!" to every person on the street, but I know that isn't me and wouldn't be a fair assessment of what I would actually do. \n\n If I go to what I would be like in segregation era America, depending on my age, I think that a younger me might have been indoctrinated for a while until I grew up and saw what was being done to protesters/the violence surrounding that. Then I would've joined the marches, protests, and sit-ins and spoken out when the opportunity presented itself, but probably never on my own.\n\nI think the reason is that drive in me to "root for the underdog" in most any situation which I believe is very INFP... And it sounds very flippant of me to equate slaves as "underdogs". Not my intent... but I mean it as I tend to gravitate toward wanting to help the disenfranchised in my own way when I see it. 
8	It took me seven years to figure out I am INFP.	I have been wondering what my MBTI type is for a loooong time. \n\nI've gone through phases of believing I was INTP, INFP, maybe INTJ and maybe even ENTP. When I first took the MBTI, I was typed as INTJ. When I took it again four years later, I was typed as INTP. I read into the descriptions of types, the cognitive functions, and interacted with other people of many different types. I tried all types on for size and INTP seemed to fit the best. I felt fairly secure about it until just a couple months ago when I fully realized how emotional I actually am. \n\n* I start crying when I get into real arguments. I *hate* arguments because I believe people should be able to solve problems without waging war against one another. \n\n* A small part of me takes little things personally when I know I shouldn't. I am a rational person yet I feel my rationality acts more as a filter over my sensitive core than as my default mode of processing.\n\n* I love to dream about future events. I love imagining romantic scenarios with my SO and imagining living out my dream as an entertainer. \n\n* I love brainstorming new solutions to problems. I love making poetry and writing songs. Using words to express my emotions is very cathartic for me.\n\n* I can relate to ANYONE. I feel sympathy for everyone, even if they've wronged me. I always consider what life must be like for other people and how it manifests into their actions. Most conflicts are actually misunderstandings. If we'd all *genuinely* try to understand what each other is going through, we'd be much more cooperative.\n\n* I always want to make myself a better person. I feel like a bad person deep down, which motivates me to make myself more compassionate, earnest, and productive. I feel like it is my duty to give something back to the world for all I've received from it.\n\nI think I'm INFP now. What do you guys think? \n\nI guess it is also possible that one's type could change over the course of their life. Many MBTI enthusiasts seem certain it cannot, but I'm not entirely sure. Though I think in my case, I just haven't fully bloomed because I've been acting out a persona and haven't embraced my genuine self.\n\nSo what has your self-discovery process been, INFPs? (and other types, if you're out there)
3	I have debated which of those 4 types I am for a while too. (Not as much for INTJ but still a bit)
2	Exactly the same, even the order in which you were typed lmao. 
2	Wow, I think we should be best friends, I agree with everything you described. I originally thought I was INTJ, because I wasn't an emotional person, until I learned that I did have emotions, I was just unsure of how to express them and hid behind a cloak of rationality. Once I left the bad relationship that made me question if my personality was broken, I did some reading through the types and embraced INFP. I'm happy to be who I am.
134	"But I did everything right!"	
10	Yes, I absolutely agree!\n\nI think INFPs desperately need strong friendships, but we can get in over our heads very quickly when the extrovert mask is involved. For example:\n\nLet's pretend we've just started running for exercise. We can go a couple of miles without dropping dead, and we're proud of our accomplishment. We meet someone new who starts running with us, and it's great. They're helping us stay motivated and pushing us to go a little farther each day...but we don't realize our new exercise partner is a fanatic. Before we know it, the other person is asking us to run a marathon with them and discussing which way to attach the band-aids to avoid the dreaded nipple bleeding. We know a choice must be made. We can (1) admit we're not that into running, which might ruin the budding friendship, (2) we can die of a heart attack during a marathon, or (3) we can give a non-committal answer that gives us time to figure out a way to save a friendship we've exhausted ourselves cultivating. We INFPs don't like confrontation, so #3 is often the best choice. The other person sees us as a flake, and there goes the friendship. (An extrovert would choose #1 or #2.) Yes, it is possible to have solid introvert-extrovert relationships, and they can be very rewarding. It's just that we can't seem to tell right away whether a seemingly-compatible extrovert will be a lifelong friend or not.\n\nWhen it comes to starting friendships with other introverts, the problem seems to be more a matter of true compatibility than a misunderstanding. Introverts often know their MBTI types, so asking personality type questions may save us from investing time in an ill-advised friendship. Of course, it's not a foolproof system, as true compatibility cannot be predicted from a chart. If, like me, you live in a heavily extroverted area (eg, the suburbs), fellow introverts might be too exhausted from daily interactions to cultivate a friendship.\n\nFunny story: I once met an INFP at the toy store while shopping for Christmas. We hit it off right away and began asking each other questions only INFPs would dare to ask a total stranger, like "What are the most important implications of subpar parenting in today's society?" and "How many times per day do you experience an existential crisis?" She gave me her phone number, which I entered into my phone. I promised to send her a text ASAP. When I tried to send the text, I realized that I hadn't saved the contact, and it disappeared. Sadness.
5	But what are the ‚Äòright‚Äô things tho?
2	Oh my word, exactly! So glad this sub exists. It's so accurate it hurts.
1	Why is this so true?! 
1	Here's the kicker. It doesn't actually matter what you do or don't do. Say or don't say. With the way we human beings have built our society it's a surprise if people can stay friends for more than a couple of days.
1	oof
527	Been trying to come out of my shell more lately and I drew this to help me visualize it	
28	Cool!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHands are hard to draw. This looks good.
14	It's beautiful and I can feel what you're trying to convey. I can feel it within me too. Great job, you're really a great artist.
11	Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn son. 
9	I‚Äôve never felt so understood...
6	This is really cool.
5	I love how palpable the force, the energy in the piece is. Thank for sharing. Great job!
4	Very nice
3	Literally me these past few days, super relatable\n
3	Hell yeah!
3	Oooooh!!!!!!! Yes!!!!! That perfectly describes how I've been thinking and feeling! I've been trying for years to come up wit a way to draw it out. You nailed it!
3	This is great. I love the imagery
3	This is so awesome, it says so much!
3	Love. 
3	This is so amazingly expressive...i can feel it
3	God I love INFPs. They get stuff! I can feel it too. I love that you're expressing it like this. üòç
3	Fantastic  
3	The coolest thing I‚Äôve seen all day
3	I love this!!
3	I feel this
3	I would love to have this drawn or painted on my snare drum head. 
2	At first I saw a triceratops head outline. Lol
2	Outstanding\n
2	Yes 
2	wow, you're incredibly talented it looks great!
2	This is amazing I wish I had even an inkling of artistic talent 
2	I get a little claustrophobic around people i think i should know but feel i don't know well enough yet. and this art piece has brought that air of panic to me. Crazy the emotions art carries. I hope your exit into shell-lessness goes well. Remember to carry a temporary mask to hide behide when avoiding awkward situations, even extroverts have them #wink
21	Kurzgesagt ‚Äì In a Nutshell's video on Loneliness	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv\_g3g-mA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA)
3	So according to this video,I should be dead a long time ago,damn
3	Yeah, it bummed me out too.
2	I felt the urge to contact people whom I've lost contact. 
1	While watching this video I started to feel verry lonely but on the end I felt better because I made contact with an INFP friend. Don't know why INFP is improtant here but ok\n\n&#x200B;
1	Wow how many people that feel it doe
8	Stealing a thread idea from the ISFPs: Want to create a list of "INFP" vibe music, or just your favorite music	This seemed like something that would also be popular here, and I'd love to hear what you all listen to.\n\nI'll start with a classic that's still one of my favorite songs: Riders on the Storm by The Doors - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8GW1GaoIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8GW1GaoIc)\n\nDefinitely doesn't have INFP vibes, but I highly recommend Primus for you all too. Les Claypool is just so unique. Southbound Pachyderm has a great music video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xb898sQtu8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xb898sQtu8)\n\nEdit: How could I forget my all-time favorite solo artist Stevie Nicks. Landslide is one of the best songs ever written, and the Smashing Pumpkins cover is surprisingly good. I think Landslide might summarize the INFP experience in one fell swoop.\n\nVery different sound from these others, but I recently discovered Bazanji and really like him. Highly recommend "Fed Up" for those who like Hip-Hop/Rap: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYAUU5kDuYE&list=RDxYAUU5kDuYE&start\_radio=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYAUU5kDuYE&list=RDxYAUU5kDuYE&start_radio=1)\n\nAdding a new one to this post I mentioned in the comments. I love Matt and Kim. They always make me happy when I'm feeling down. Daylight is a favorite for sure: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgBeu3FVi60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgBeu3FVi60)\n\nNo one's brought up Frank Zappa yet. I love Frank Zappa. Black Napkins is my favorite instrumental only song: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNkl1avYXRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNkl1avYXRM)\n\nDefinitely NSFW: This one has a solidly anti-INFP vibe but I adore it: "Baby's On Fire" by Die Antwoord. Sticking to MBTI, seems like an ESTP/ENTP poster boy song: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcXNPI-IPPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcXNPI-IPPM)\n\nAnother one no one's mentioned yet: Tame Impala - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7mia9UMG4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7mia9UMG4Y)\n\nNSFW warning on this one: Neon Hitch did a great remake of No Hands by Waka Flocka. No INFP feel, but I think the music video is so funny and I love the directing style. Seems very ESTP/ESFP to me. - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y9rRkwzeio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y9rRkwzeio)\n\nAnother NSFW one: For those of you who are also obsessed with Ru Paul's Drag Race, I love following the queens' music. #SueList by Detox is one of my faves. Again, no INFP feeling but so awesome. If anything, maybe some ESTJ/ENTJ feels - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjE1nJLz-Zs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjE1nJLz-Zs)\n\nLately I've been obsessed with Better by Kahlid as a love song. Give me very ISFP vibes. It is such a good love song on so many levels - [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3bfa3DZ8JM**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3bfa3DZ8JM)

2	Check out Omar Apollo.
2	Nice! I still haven't seen the Doors movie. It looks interesting.\n\nI am not sure what music is INFP vibe music, and I honestly do not think I can pick a favorite song. That is hard! Perhaps the favorite thing for me to listen to is the _Lord of the Rings_ soundtrack.\n\nEdit: Maybe my favorite song is John Lennon's "Imagine." Once that song came on my phone and I started crying. There is something about his murder and that song looking for peace that really hits home for me.\n\nYeah I just relistened to the song and I think "Imagine" is the most beautiful song ever written.
2	I have a playlist of all the music i enjoy.\n\nIts mixed genres and moods, but i know all the pictures so its easy to pick for me :p\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ1v3XnfHmseWV0vvhCq7RpkFY9ms-NHK\n\nSome music that is not on here, but i really enjoy for the darkness of it is the album, Music for the quiet hour. By Shackleton.
2	Landed into a phase where I'm only listening to rolling stones 
2	George Ezra - Shotgun\n\nI heard this [song](https://youtube.com/watch?v=v_B3qkp4nO4)  at a bakery yesterday.  \n\n
2	It‚Äôs almost 10 years since this was posted.  https://youtu.be/5ky6vgQfU24\n\nINFP‚Äôs want to take personal growth journeys, but overthink/overanalyze the risks and get caught in a decision-making loop.  Great choice of music and inspirational songs in this video.

6	NF's in Science	Hey guys - I'm technically an ENFP but test really near the middle of the E-I spectrum, so thought I'd ask you guys as well - do any of you work in the hard sciences?  If so, what has been your experience?  Do you feel like you can be imaginative and creative enough?  Do you spend a lot of time working alone, or do you get to work with other people?  What are the best and worst parts of your job?  Thanks for your input!
3	I do research in mathematics / computer science and I actually find it to be very creative. In the end, learning to do exact science is just like learning any other skill, just like learning how to hold a paintbrush (to make a very INFP comparison). I think many -NF- people get discouraged learning these skills and never get to the interesting part. I was never extraordinarily good in school, never the best at taking exams in hard sciences, but the further I got along, the less important these things became, and imagination and curiosity became more important.\n\n\nI like to discuss my work with others, but I also work in solitude for long stretches of time, just me and my ideas. I work in a nice office on top of a hill where I can watch the sunset with a cup of coffee and get some work done.
3	I‚Äôm INFP and I‚Äôm a scientist! I majored in Environmental Physics in school but now I work in a material testing lab. I find it therapeutic to zone out and do detail oriented work like checking calculations or entering data and in my free time I like to write stories. I don‚Äôt have any huge career aspirations as most of my driving factors are at home, but I enjoy what I do at least. 
3	I‚Äôm in chemistry, and have been in science since before I learned infps are supposed to be ‚Äúbad at science.‚Äù I actually love the hands on work because every chemist has their own style, it‚Äôs almost an art like cooking! I did and still struggle to excel at having an encyclopedic knowledge of reactions, but with time things are starting to stick, almost like learning a language. 
2	I'm still in school but I'm an engineering major. I love brainstorming new ideas to problems but I'm concerned that when I find a job after I graduate I won't allow me to be creative enough to feel satisfied with my work. I hate procedural work. I don't like following lists and doing everything as it should be done by the book. That can be left to the NTJs, who do very well in jobs that require that. My roommate is an INTJ and he really is the living stereotype of an engineer. Nevertheless, I think that NFP's can find a place in science if given enough room to give their ideas flight.
1	I'm in human genetics. A first year undergrad so I don't do much lab work but I want to get at it soon!
5	Do you ever get jealous of your friends‚Äô other friends?	Wondering if this is an INFP thing. 
6	I don't think so. Maybe I was jealous once because my best friend said that this other girl was her best friend. I still think of her as my best friend though even if I am not hers.
3	I do, even though it's ridiculous. I don't know if it's an infp thing but I've accepted that I feel that way. Of course, I don't tell them!
3	the classic i didn‚Äôt really want to come but i still wanted to be invited sometimes happens to me.\n\nother than that i feel like the bonds i have with my best friends are unbreakable. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø don‚Äôt think about what they do w their other friends \n\nBUT i do get jealous when i‚Äôm left out and they don‚Äôt confide in me, and i only find out later. *shaking fist ‚ÄòIM the listener friend!!!!!! ME!!! I help!!!!‚Äô 
1	I do, it seems like all my friends are closer to each other than they are to me, even if they've done things that really hurt each other. Especially when they make a new friend and I see them getting close to each other :(. Like they can have to same level of trust with someone they've known for 3 months as they do with me after knowing me for 3 years. 
1	Yes but not because the have friends other than me.. I get jelly because I wish I had more friends and want what they have.
1	It only happened with one specific friend to me... then I realised I was in love with her ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ) _/¬Ø in my specific case I guess it was more a gay thing than an INFP thing, lol
10	What colors do you like to wear? And which colors do you feel uncomfortable wearing?	For most of my life I have stayed inside the greyscale. And the idea of wearing the color red has always made my physically ill. HOWEVER, I have been tempted lately to just go for it and wear red to see what kind of energy it brings out in me. Has anyone else tried something like this? 
8	My favorite colors to wear are black and red. I mostly wear maroon jeans with black / grey shirt and / it jacket. Or the opposite with maroon shirt and black pants. 
6	shades of black
2	I mostly wear black, blue, purple, teal and red. I dislike yellow, pink and olive. 
2	My wardrobe includes a vast range of colors from grey all the way to black. Sometimes I like to spice it up and wear darker shades of other colors, but that‚Äôs only when I‚Äôm feeling a little wild 
4	I love wearing color!  Usually tied to my mood of the day.  I am a rare person who actually looks good in orange.  I like sunshiny yellow.  For around two years recently, I wore blue very often.  I will wear white, but almost never black or gray.  I also have various greens, a red, and a purple shirt, too.
3	My staples are: Black. Blue. Army green. Grey. Mustard yellow. Brown. \n\nI have a few coloured items that I sometimes wear. People complement me in yellow, but I feel the most insecure in it. 
2	I like a lot of grey, black. blue, purple and green.  I stay away from red and yellow.
2	My wardrobe is mostly made up of black and gray. I love wearing the rare pop of yellow and pink because I feel I look really good on them and basically any other cute pastelish colors. I hate maroons but navy is okay.
2	I do love grey
2	I'm dark skinned and I usually wear just Blue, Grey, Green/Olive and white mostly, along with  a little pink and one maroon T-shirt. I've always wanted to try yellow tho, a very light yellow.
2	I really like white or complete black hoodies, for t-shirts, orange and pink sometimes
2	I prefer dark colors. I like wearing navy blue or black the most. I don't like wearing yellow, light green, or pink. My skin tone looks best in eggplant, tomato red, black, or white. I had a guy tell me what my colors were. He had a book that will look up your skin tone and tell you what colors you should wear.
2	Black, grey, white, blue, green. I dislike yellow, red and orange.
2	I like black, grey, and blue. I hate yellow or orange because I think they‚Äôre  ugly colors to wear.
2	I normally wear dark colors (black, grey, dark blue)  but my favorite thing to wear is my thrifted baby blue sweater, I wear it on days where I wake up feeling happy. 
2	Black, blues, sea greens and a splash of red here or there. I don‚Äôt typically wear anything too bright. And I absolutely hate wearing yellows or oranges. Red is as bright as I‚Äôm willing to go and it‚Äôs almost always as an accent. 
2	I don't have any specific colors I hate wearing. With the exception of yellow. I don't know why.
2	I like earth tones and jewel tones mostly
2	My staple is black, I really don't like wearing grey. I occasionally add in a dark red, bottle green or deep purple. Sometimes I like gold if I'm feeling shimmery. 
1	Grey mostly, with everything else a mix of colors but mostly toned down (nothing vibrant). \n\nI've thought lately about trying to be more creative with what I wear, but it would probably have to mean something to me, like its from someone, or the colors remind me of something. Otherwise I usually don't take what I wear too seriously
1	Black, grey and blue. Most of the time it's black and grey but if I'm feeling happy it's blue
1	I‚Äôm happiest in white or nudes.
4	33 single dad. A little lonely.	I always test out as infp..even when I try and answer things differently to see what happens. \n \n Anyway, I got married young (20),had 2 kids (8) and (13), and now have been divorced for almost a year. We divorced because of her cheating multiple times over the marriage.\n\n So now I have my kids two times a week and every other weekend. I secluded myself in the happiness of my family so much that I have almost 0 social life.\n\n I had a girlfriend for a few months but things just didn't work out. \n \n A part of me loves this opportunity to grow into what I want to be (my ex was very negative and it affected my confidence for years), but I want someone to love. I want someone to experience life with some times. \n\n I've read so many books on how to treat people and the right things to do and say and what not but I talk to maybe 1 person a day.... I do go to the gym 3 to 4 times a week and live a healthy life but I'm really missing the deeper love life I need. \n\n End rant. \n From an infp who thinks he would hate other infps lol
2	Haha... yeah I'm getting a Siamese in May!!
2	Hey there. From one INFP to another... loneliness is always there. No matter if you‚Äôre single or with a partner. So I wouldn‚Äôt focus on finding someone to love. It looks like you spent many years trying to make things work with your SO and maybe now it‚Äôs time to focus on yourself. Going to the gym is good but it can be a bit monotonous. Perhaps you can try a new hobby of pick up an old one. Also, leaning towards something spiritual can be beneficial, regardless what your beliefs are. \nDating is kinda tough for us INFPs so I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd recommend that. I think is great to have knowledge on how to treat others but it‚Äôs also important give yourself some time to heal from what happened in the past. Sometimes we try too hard to make other ones feel good and we tend to forget we need that ourselves.\nOh and definitely find podcasts you like, watch stand up comedy on Netflix or YouTube or try to go out and catch a good movie or show.
2	Suggestion: if you can afford the time and money, work on your hobby(s) and/or do volunteer work.
1	It sounds like you have more freedom now being single. Like you can do all the things you wanted to do, but could do when you were married. At least that is how I look at it. I have been in relationships where my partner stopped me from pursuing my goals. Like I wanted to go back to school and he said it would be too expensive. But we broke up and now I am back in school. I suppose everything happens for a reason.
1	Why do you think you‚Äôd hate other INFPs?
1	I can't stand all the pictures everyone post even though I know in a few months I will post one of my own. Just me being stupid infp lol
1	This might not be helpful, but at least you're not a cuck. Good for you god dammit.\n\nThere are actual degenerates out there who live the "open marriage" bs like it's all good.\n\nKeeping doing good- good will follow. Don't let people take advantage.\n\nAnd seriously. Good for you on not being a cuck. Scum of the earth... End of my rant :-)
3	Should I say sorry in a fight even though I was hurt?	Like, let's say I've had a really bad fight about a really stupid thing with my friend, I wasn't rude and they were but I really miss them. Should I say sorry just to get our friendship back together even if I don't truly mean it? \n\nI'm still in school so even if I don't say sorry, we'll still see each other and it may be awkward. I already know I'll cry a lot because I won't be able to go the whole day without looking behind me and seeing them, knowing I won't be able to say anything. 
3	Only if it was your fault and only if u caused the fight, but that's only my opinion, you'll look needy if you say sorry that for sure 
3	Moreover if you say sorry and it wasnt your fault your behavior is hurting the others, because you affirm them in their bad behavior. 
2	Omg, please take some more time for yourself to sit with your feelings. Please do not apologize if you don‚Äôt really mean it. That‚Äôs not a very kind thing to do to yourself
1	An extreme metaphor, but that's like sending a text message to a murderer and telling them your address and times you'll be alone.\n\nIf you're feeling lonely go somewhere that allows you to make other friends.\nIf she was rude then it's on her to apologise.\nUnless you want her to know that you're a walking bulls eye for her rudeness.\n\n(If secretly you had a part to play in offences being given on her side also but don't want to admit it that might be worth talking to your ego about.)
16	"When Being 'Nice' Hurts You More Than It Helps" interesting article by a fellow INFP	
3	Serious question, because this topic has been on my mind for a while:\n\nIsn't being a "nice" person, and a people-pleaser (as described in the article) associated with Fe? Especially since it seems to directly contradict Fi (authenticity, personal values, etc). Wouldn't that more likely make the writer an Fe user?\n\nSo in other words, can you be an INFP and struggle with being too much of a people-pleaser? 
16	Literally dreamt this.	We met in a museum. She was some scientist and we went on a trip in a rowboat in the ocean for her work. Then she fell overboard and I dove in after her, and she died on a box with me holding her. Then I wake up and I got the sensation of her hand wafting away like smoke or a ghost in mine. Probably one of my most vivid dreams. Pretty cool but it did really feel like losing someone you really care for. :/
1	I hope you don't mind if I share my most recent dream as well.. so here goes. \n\nMy old teacher was complimenting me for doing an excellent job, helping hang an old schoolmate's laundry. He tells me, I must really be trusted if he was able to bring me around his family's property. It seems a little bizarre because I don't really like those people and I usually go out of my way to avoid them. The former schoolmate never really liked me either.. but hey, maybe they must have made a huge impression on me.
1	Woah. How strange is it that we can dream these profound moments, in this case a loved one dying by your side, and then we just wake up and we're like "oh that didn't actually happen" and then we go to work or whatever.
33	An Arizona sunset	
2	Was Layne Staley an INFP?	Hi there. I'm a fan of Alice In Chains and I'd like to know if Layne was an INFP or not. I have seen him typed as an ISFP as well. \nHis lyrics, altough simple, are of such a brooding nature that makes me think he is intuitive. I mean, if Kurt Cobain is considered almost unanimously an INFP, why not Layne?
4	i‚Äôd say one of these two as well....\n\nunplugged helped me survive high school, the entire first two years i‚Äôd listen to it daily, and even now i sometimes go back to it and admire the absolute beauty.\n\nsomehow i‚Äôd rather say infp. just a guesstimation + intuition \n\nsomeone w more knowledge of the cognitive functions should share an opinion 
23	META observation: I kinda wish groups into MBTI focused more on how to improve yourself as a person before thinking of any other MBTI as a "perfect match", "optimal friend", "not compatible", etc.	My family's been visiting the last few days but in my downtime I've been getting back into MBTI as a concept. Its interesting to me. \n\nI've noticed, though, that there's a lot of focus on people being fundamentally good or bad for each other in MBTI discussions. Like, people either inherently or not inherently jiving. \n\nI don't think the world is that rigid. I think, if anything, MBTI is just a great starting point for maybe figuring out your weaknesses and how to improve your life and peace of mind. \n\nThoughts?
6	This is exactly why I love mbti-tests. It gave me a better understanding on what I need to work on.\nPeople treat it like some astrology-shit
2	gonna slap a solid SAME on this one 
35	My wife (INFJ) and I (INFP) are splitting up and it's my fault.	I've made mistakes in this 7 year relationship. I wasn't the perfect husband. But I loved her with all of my heart. And at the beginning, she loved me too. All I ever wanted to do was to care for her and to make her happy, but I always managed to fuck things up. I hurt her in the past, and I betrayed her trust. I always tried to be a better person but I didn't feel like I deserved her anymore. I let myself become so passive in this relationship and life in general. As a result, I wasn't there for her when she needed me. \n\n2018 was rough. It started out with a miscarriage, followed by depression on both sides. Traumatizing stuff from her past came up that was never properly addressed or handled. We had some pretty big fights and had nearly stopped having sex. During the summer our bedroom got so hot that we slept on separate sofas in the living room. \n\nThat's around the time she met David.\n\nHer and David met on an MBTI group and instantly connected. They messaged each other daily for multiple months. They shared each other's passions and interests. He was there for her when I wasn't. He was her shoulder to cry on. She shared her intimate side with him. She was happy with him. She told him she loved him....\n\nShe told me this last Monday.\n\nNeedless to say I broke down. Our last big fight was in November. After that fight I went out and got her the biggest bouquet of red tulips (her favorite) i could find. It was at that point I had made a clear point to her that I wanted to save this relationship. We had a wonderful Christmas together. I was planning a weekend vacation for our anniversary next month. We had just spent the night in Chicago eating pizza and dancing. I even had a beautiful gift I bought her for valentines day that I never got to give her. I was really trying to get our love back because I still love her with all of my heart.\n\nThen she tells me all of this on Monday. Abour her 3 month romantic affair with David. I cannot describe the amount of mental and emotional pain I have been in since I found that out. And the fact that she hid it from me for 8 months. I asked if she is still talking to him and she said no. She said he wanted to meet her in person, she was nervous and didn't want to, they ended up fighting, and stopped talking to each other last fall. But then she told me she wanted to split up. She said she thinks we are no longer compatible and there are better people out there for us. She wanted a divorce.\n\nI don't know how to handle this. I picked up divorce papers from the courthouse. We're sleeping in separate rooms for now until we figure out living arrangements. It's been 6 days and still each day I hurt worse. We used to have something amazing together. How could I fuck this up so badly. I feel like there's just something wrong with me.\n\nAnd if she was unhappy why didn't she just leave...
10	I followed everything until the last sentence. Leaving a marriage seems like huge, scary decision and usually people want to avoid such an extreme measure. You obviously don't want her to leave but then said she should've left if she truly felt unhappy? This puts her in a difficult situation. I guess the biggest problem on your end is how you perceive your self-worth. Sorry but tell me if I'm reading this correctly... 
7	Try not to blame yourself too much, OP. You‚Äôre already going through a hard time. Please take care of yourself.
7	I'm was in the same situation but 10 years 2 kids. It hurts, its tough, but you'll manage. Took me along time to realize she was putting in 110% and i was barely giving it 30%. It's amicable now, she ended up cheating physically. I wasn't there for her. I'm 34 and still trying to piece myself together. Each day I learn more about myself. It's gonna hurt for a while, learn from this and time will heal the pain inside your heart. It's a lonely path we walk, but it doesn't have to be. 
6	In the meantime keep yourself busy. Find a hobby or something. Just stay away from the house as much as you can.
5	Everyone makes mistakes, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel the need to carry 100% of the blame for this.  A marriage is a partnership, or at least ‚Äî it‚Äôs supposed to be.  I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this.\n\nI‚Äôm actually going through something similar with my husband of 7 years.  We love each other, but I can‚Äôt help feeling like we‚Äôd be happier with other people.  Neither one of us seems to put in any effort to make the other happy, and any attempts to remedy the situation last for mere days, before we‚Äôre back to our regular routine.  We don‚Äôt love the same way, and we often talk past each other.  We‚Äôre both incredibly lonely, and longing for a connection that we‚Äôre just not getting from each other.\n\nNow, in your situation (and mine, actually) the trust has been broken on both sides.  I think this makes it difficult to work toward a resolution, because that requires truly believing in yourself and your partner.  We may want to be the kind of people who put in every effort to make our relationships last, but because of past mistakes, we don‚Äôt really believe we‚Äôre capable of doing so.  Plus, we may have trouble trusting our partners to keep up their side of the relationship, too.  We‚Äôve let each other down before, so who‚Äôs to say it won‚Äôt happen again and again and again?  It‚Äôs almost expected now.  Also, that causes every little argument to thrust us back into that negative thought pattern.    I don‚Äôt know how to escape it.  \n\nChildren complicate things further, because while they‚Äôre innocent in all of this, the decision to stay or leave will have a huge impact on them ‚Äî there‚Äôs no way around it.  I‚Äôd guess that‚Äôs a big part of the reason she didn‚Äôt ‚Äújust leave‚Äù.  That impact can be a positive one, though ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to sound too negative, here.  I think it‚Äôs actually preferable for children to have separated parents than parents who are together, but modeling an unhealthy relationship.\n\nYou‚Äôre not alone in this, though, and it sounds like you have a good enough relationship with your wife to separate amicably ‚Äî if that‚Äôs ultimately what you both decide to do.  I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be easy, but who knows what the future holds?  Give it time.  
4	Have you guys tried couples counseling? If you find a good counselor I know of many people who say it saved their marriage. As long as your efforts are sincere and not an act just to rope someone back in, people usually appreciate the sincerity of effort.\n\nEven if you ultimately decide to split up it could be really healing for BOTH of you. \nFrom my experience, it's really the healthiest gift you could give one another. It offers the opportunity to learn and grow, whereas without support you two could be angry and disappointed in each other for years to come. \n\nI would tell her you need help understanding what went wrong and how to make things better for your relationships going forward. \n\nGood luck. I hope things get better for you. It may take time, but have faith, eventually you will overcome this trial.
3	If she‚Äôs totally set on divorce, you can only learn from the painful experience. But if she‚Äôs got part of her that wants to try, I recommend the book my husband of 36 year marriage and I are using along with counseling. Sue Johnson‚Äôs Hold Me Tight. Very useful. 
4	You are trying to find errors in yourself while you have been suffering from infidelity for a few months. She didn't even tell you enough. And she stayed. You said that she doesn't love you anymore. Why blame yourself? Please don't be harsh on yourself. You did nothing wrong existentially, you've only been a victim to someone's change of """standards""".\n\nLook, INTJ's and J's in general spend a lot of time thinking about what they have Vs what they could have. What is a person's worth (often can mislead them and people in their lives to lose their self esteem because the values they judge by are a big ugh). And so on... It's not like we don't think like that ourselves but she turned her eyes to other values than the amazing thing you want so much.\n\nLove is a beautiful thing. But make sure that she loves you for you, not for the husband you make her seem you are. I'd never compromise on this as an INFP. Yes, I know, fantasy world. No problem. This is your life. 
3	How is her cheating on you your fault. I don't think you are thinking clearly. Is it even worth saving the relationship or will it cause even more pain in the long run? 
1	I would not get a divorce. I would maybe take 1-2 years living separately and see how you feel from there. Maybe 1 year apart, you will realize how much you miss each other. I think it is never a good idea to make such a huge decision without taking the time to process it.\n\nIf you haven't read it already, I recommend you read the book _Getting the Love You Want_ by Harville Hendrix.
1	Relationships take two people to work. This isn't on your shoulders alone. 
1	I hope you find healing soon:)
1	The way you wrote this alone broke my heart. Don't be so hard on yourself, it sounds like you really did try to me. Maybe you were more available than you thought, and are just having a hard time seeing it now because of all of the pain.
1	It isn‚Äôt your fault, it just isn‚Äôt working out. INFPs are great at blaming themselves but some relationships just don‚Äôt last till death. You probably made this persons life amazing for the whole time you were together, it‚Äôs gonna hurt but you are strong and worth every second. You sound so genuine and loving, someone else is out there for you when you are ready. 
11	How to spot an INFP and make friends with them in real life?	I've never met an INFP in real life besides myself and ironically, there are supposed to be more INFPs than others personality types where I live (10% according to 16personalities.com ). I really want to meet other people who think like me. And also, probably try to date one. How to spot an INFP, especially a guy?
12	First of all, even if the site thinks so, there's no way that a country has more than 6% infp's, from my observation.\n\nSecond of all, here are 3 things: \n1. Look for the disenchanted. Tricky because they don't get out much but yeah. \n2. Nature parties! More INFP's there. \n3. Music and art scenes in the closest big city. 
1	Question of the year. I‚Äôm not buying these percentages. I‚Äôve only ever mer like two. Ironically, i‚Äôve met too many infj‚Äôs and they‚Äôre supposed to be the rarest type. I would give anything to have an infp best friend irl 
80	Heard y‚Äôall liked sunsets	
6	You know, when you're feeling very sad, sunsets are wonderful... 
2	Stay Gold
2	Great photo.
6	Poll: MBTI relationship matches. Best and worst.	If you‚Äôre in a relationship - what type is your partner? How is it going? How long has it been?\n\nWhat‚Äôs been your best MBTI match?\n\nWhat‚Äôs been your worst MBTI match?
8	I dated an ENTP for 4.5 years. He was intellectually stimulating and creative. That kept me entertained. But, his insatiable need to debate, even the most taboo topics, made me feel uncomfortable at times. I felt I was constantly on damage control. \n\nI also dated an ESTJ - who is the complete opposite in every way. At first, I loved it and it worked out so well. When we were good - we were extremely connected, communicative and unstoppable. The things I lacked, he strengthened, and vice versa. But, when we were bad, it was exhausting. Communication broken down. The way we worked through problems was completely different. We both felt misunderstood and misinformed.\n\nI have an INFP friend who I went on a couple dates with many years ago. But I never felt the spark or passion. While we get along on so many levels, share similar interests and are still very good friends, I find myself wondering what dating a similar type would be like. There‚Äôd be the inherent understanding - but would it be boring? 
4	My type has been ENTPs for as long as I can remember. I just find them so attractive even if they annoy me pretty often. They're a challenge, a puzzle to be solved, and we always have amazing chemistry.\n\nMy current bf is an ENTP. It's not always perfect and he can sometimes hurt my feelings with his 'facts and logic' and argumentative attitude but otherwise we're really happy.\n\nI have also been in love with a fellow INFP. It was like a fairytale, insanely passionate, but ultimately too much drama.\n\nMy best friend is an ENFP. I love ENFPs but I wouldn't date most of them. 
4	My husband is an ESTJ, complete opposite of me. Sometimes we struggle to understand each other because I‚Äôm lead by my heart and he‚Äôs lead by his head, but we still work well. He takes initiative and does things when I‚Äôm held back by anxiety or doubt and I help him see things from a different perspective. He genuinely cares and tries to understand how I see things. We balance each other out perfectly :) 
4	Atm I'm talking to a girl I've met online. We already like each other since October 2018 and I think you can say we're in a long distance relationship. She's also an INFP and I couldn't wish myself a better match!!
3	I'm only going to go based on people who've told me what they got for MBTI. \n\nMy most longstanding friends, oddly enough, have been ISTPs. This is why I always encourage people not to focus too much on best MBTI matches listed online because ISTPs are the fucking best and everything I've seen says we shouldn't sinc up. No sexual chemistry at all, but all around amazing buds. Some of my other best friends have been ESFPs, ENTJs. and ESTJs. ESFPs are so much fun and I always felt so supported and accepted by them. They didn't care what my personality was, they just wanted to party and have fun all the time haha. My good friend is an ESTJ and you couldn't find more protective mom type if you tried. She said she loves my sweet attitude, and has tried to set me up on dates. The only thing that bothers me about her is I've seen her be rude to servers. Not cool. Had some great ISTJ friends. They're the only people I've ever met who've been able to give me truly callous criticism and it didn't put me on defensive or make me upset. Something about their tone and the fact that they're usually fucking right and I should listen haha. \n\nMy sister is one of my best friends, and she said she always tests ENFJ. Sometimes I think she thinks I'm self centered, which hurts because I never want to disappoint her, but on the opposite end I often get annoyed by her 'steam-rolling' my opinions/emotions/interests. Like, acting like they are either not important or petty, I dunno. She can be extremely condescending, but that might be because she is my sister. I'll never be able to date one because I'll always think of her haha. \n\nI've dated some ENFPs and either fell instantly in love or felt like they were suffocating me. No in-between. Either straight up wanted to marry them or just wanted some peace and quiet. So, so charming when they're confident and love themselves. In my experience (any reading, please don't take offense) SUPER clingy and needy when they're in an unhealthy part of life. \n\nMet a guy ENTP one time and swooned so hard. I don't think he was as into me, though, since I didn't seem like his type looks-wise. Been wanting to meet another for a long time, and have only run into one person who seems like they might be but they moved. That being said, it was incredibly hard for me to tell if he had sexual interest in me since he seemed to exude sexuality and flirtiness 24/7. He seemed like one of those people who could be flirty and display interest in everyone in the room just in an effort to make friends, so I never wanted to read too much into his actions. We messaged back an forth about a lot of random ideas we had and some debate, and I wish I had the balls to ask him if he liked me, but I was so afraid of how dissapointed I'd be if he rejected me. I admittedly think about him more than I should. I'd never met anyone quite like him before and would have loved to learn more of what was in his brain. Especially now that I've learned that I'm more sensitive than most people and need to learn to tackle my emotions better and express myself healthily, I think we would have gotten along even better if I knew him now. \n\nI've met one INFJ, and we were instant friends. I feel like I wasn't the most healthy person when it knew her, though, which I regret terribly. I deliberately try to make up for it now by taking what she's told me she hates friends doing and doing the opposite. For example, she told me once that she hates when friends move to a new state and ghost. I text her at least once a month just to check in.\n\nBecame fast friends with at least one INTP. If I was more mature then, I wouldn't have been hurt when she went to another job and didn't keep up with me. I always knew she was pretty insensitive to that kinda thing. \n\nAlways got on well with other INFPs and ISFPs, but mostly when we talk it's been during depressive episodes where we just needed someone to understand our emotions. I wish I could meet one outside of that now that I've worked on myself and I'm happy. ISFPs, can you please mind-meld your amazing fashion sense and super cool aura to me? Thanks. \n\nThat's all I can think of now.\n\nEdit: Take this one with a grain of salt, because I'm only 90% positive on the type. My mother, who I believe in an ISFJ, is one of the sweetest and most caring women I've ever met. She put up with my ass through the best and worst of times, and never gave up on me through some of my darker times. I couldn't have asked for a more caring and loving mother if I tried, even if she doesn't quite get my quirks sometimes. Interesting combo of being practical and artistic. The only things I would say that we just don't get eachother on are: She HATES vulgar humor and I love it, she can be a touch too gossipy about her friends for my taste, and she is much more conservative than me. Both of my parents have pretty strong republican values, and we definitely don't see eye to eye most of the time, but they are good people with amazing characters. I think they definitely have me beat as being consistently decent human beings. If I had to guess for my dad, probably ISTJ? I don't know for him, though, that's tougher.  \n
2	I forgot to add the types I don't mesh well with - it's definitely ENFJs (too fake) and INTPs (they're so arrogant, but they're actually so fucking clueless). Of course, this is just from my experience. 
2	Interesting!\n\nA colleague is an INTP and I feel somewhat like kindred spirits. I think I just like the way his mind works. And they are so rational. I respect ration and reason - probably because I have to work hard on those things. 
2	My GF is ESFJ. S and J can make it tough sometimes, but we complement each other most of the time. The shared F helps a lot. 
1	I honestly don‚Äôt know what my best match would be or if I even believe in a best match anymore. I‚Äôve grown so much and I feel like i‚Äôm still growing. I feel like a new person each day I wake up. So my ideal partner would be someone who‚Äôs good at adapting without being too detached about it. Someone who is internally consistent even if they are externally inconsistent. Someone who is willing to explore as much life as possible without losing their passion and connection to me. \n\nI guess I want someone who‚Äôs equally curious, passionate, and loyal. Someone with a child like spirit/soul.\n\nMy worst match would likely be someone who fails to have any of the qualities described above xD 
1	Totally. Our need to keep the peace is smothered by an ENTP‚Äôs constant need to debate (at almost any cost) and an ESTJ‚Äôs need to control. 
1	ENFP - I have dated 3 who I had really comfortable, intense, deep and fun relationships with. But two cheated on me a LOT, the other was better as a friendship. \n\nISFJ - was very lovely and kind, so loyal, but no depth. We had some similar humour but made me feel quite trapped and hated how unconventional I was. As did his family. I think I broke him. \n\nINTP - we really got eachother on an intellectual level, we had an open relationship and lots of exploration. However he could be incredibly arrogant and actually weirdly analytical and rude about my appearance? Ended up as long distance which fizzled out, but we still talk and learn so much from eachother. \n\nENTP - really intense connection, made me laugh more than anybody ever has, the wildest imaginative conversations. The biggest love - but so unreliable and flaky. \n\nISTJ - current and longest relationship. When it's good it is light hearted, so many inside jokes, reliable and affectionate. Balances my weaknesses - brings logic where I bring empathy. But he can be rude to kind people. When it's bad it's like we are from different planets - communication is problematic, we just don't get each other. I feel stifled, he cannot understand my moods and emotions. Right now we are struggling. I crave constant change, he fears it. \n
26	Got a Bad Case of the Galactic Blues (OC)	
2	Damn this is good art, I wish I continued with mine...
2	This is really beautiful. I‚Äôve always had a fascination with space and the colorful galaxies and stuff lol...
780	Is this us?	
28	I have got better over time about letting these things go.\nThe things *I can* influence, on the other hand...
14	Making situations up is my favorite though lol 
10	but it's fun at first...
8	Ouch.. :D
6	Got to learn how to stop doing this. 
7	I‚Äôm in this photo and I don‚Äôt like it 
5	Helpless addiction 
4	Yassssss
4	Yeah, man, keep pouring that shit in.
3	INFP-T maybe
3	+10 points for this happening at 3 am 
3	I over analyze the situations I can change, agonizing over how to possibly push the responsibility elsewhere. 
2	Story of my life. One of the main reasons I relate to my INFP friends though. They understand so well! Love, your friendly neighbourhood ENTP.
2	For me, it's the Elmo crack image. I can't get enough of building up hypotheticals in my head, but it's not good for me.
1	This is INTJ‚Äôs. 
1	Gimme 
1	Yes
1	Could be OCD
1	I hate doing this so much, OCD gives me a headache when this happens :(
1	How do I quit this addiction? Lol
1	I truly feel like this is me 
1	Fuckkkkkkk
18	Any feedback? This new work has become puzzling to me...I don‚Äôt know how to react to it??? Acrylic painting - 24‚Äù x 24‚Äù	
3	I like it!!
3	For me it seems to have a... Not paranoia, but maybe a nervousness (?) about it? Like a being of light that's hiding in gradually darker shadows. The texture reminds me of rain on a window, or of rough terrain ahead for this little dot of light as it takes its first few timid steps from the darkest recesses. 
1	It has become an enigma in my workspace. It is a bastard painting hanging in my workspace. I‚Äôve never really had strong feelings for it and I never thought it was finished but over time it has become such a stranger of a painting to me...like it has formed it‚Äôs own opinion of itself and it‚Äôs telling me to leave it alone...lol. I know I‚Äôm kinda weird about my creations. Just felt like I needed to share. ‚úåüèª
8	How do you guys cope with a loss of relationship?	All I could feel right now is a mix of anger, regret, and sadness, trying to figure out what went wrong with our relationship / friendship. How do you guys try to cope and accept these kinds of pain?
8	Good habits and routines. They‚Äôre called ‚Äògood habits‚Äô for a reason. Habits are something formed by repetition over time.  But they have to be GOOD. Nothing destructive.\nDo all the shit you couldn‚Äôt do when you were shackled. And time. Time heals all wounds. \nAlso. Let your narcissistic side out a little bit. Take time for yourself, do stuff that makes you feel good about yourself. \n
6	It‚Äôs old fashioned advice. But the sun will come up tomorrow. It‚Äôll be all good in the end. You‚Äôll be fine üëçüèª
3	Crying and ice cream for starters
2	Whatever can distract you the most. Reading reddit, watching tv series, playing games. 
1	I feel like i‚Äôm always losing relationships. People are always coming in and out of my life. Partially because I can‚Äôt sit still. Partially because I tend to get bored easily. I have a hard time letting go of the past until something new and exciting comes up. When I know that I need to let go of something or someone, I start spoon feeding my Ne new experiences to help cope through the pain 
127	Every INFP i know	
7	I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever let mine out...I‚Äôm too submissive and afraid of conflict. The closest I‚Äôve ever gotten to releasing my inner bitch is yelling at bad drivers from inside my car with the windows rolled up. 
6	I feel like I‚Äôm being a bitch when I get things done, but my coworkers just remind me that I‚Äôm being a leader. I think we tend to feel like we should let things be and mind our own business, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with speaking up, and it doesn‚Äôt in itself make you a bitch.
5	He'll yes I will let all my inner demons out
3	I just said something similar to my SO today.  He says she‚Äôs a force to be reckoned with....lol 
3	I might seriously injure people 
3	Hell yeah. Reclaim your life, ladies! This is the only one we know that we get!  \n\nAll the assholes of the world feel no shame in using their voices to loudly declare their opinions. Well a few years ago I decided that if good people like me and you are too afraid to do the same then our world is doomed. \n\nNever felt more empowered than by standing firmly behind myself. Best advice I ever got from a therapist was to be as kind to myself as I am to everyone else. And that means allowing yourself your opinions. Because they are probably good and just and desperately needed in this world. And we all have your back.\n\n*climbsdownfromsoapbox*\n
2	This holds soo much truth
3	I don‚Äôt let her out. I just hold her out when I am getting some Reno‚Äôs done.hammering away is way easier :) 
4	I have to disagree, I do not share your opinion.
1	Cringe
12	I am not a smoker, but I‚Äôve always kinda loved the smell of cigarettes. Anyone relate?	
5	I am a smoker who dislikes it's smell. Bizarre.
3	yeah! i like the smell too! sometimes when someone who smokes apologizes for the smell i tell them i like it, but they never believe me lol. 
2	I wouldn't say I like it but to me it reminds me of partying and clubbing. Which I miss from back in the day, it was just a better time in my life.
2	I should of known I was gonna be downvotedüòÇ
2	Not a smoker either, but I like the smell of *fresh* cigarette smoke, but I can't stand stale cigarette smoke smell on my clothes after I leave a place
2	OMG! I legit love this thread. I love the smell of cigarettes just like I love the look of lipstick stains on places they don‚Äôt belong :3 something about living life on the wild side has always been beautiful to me ‚ù§Ô∏è
2	Fresh cigarette smoke, yeah. There's something oddly comforting about it. Even though I don't smoke myself and never have. I feel similarly about bonfires too, it's relaxing. 
1	I don't mind the smell of those solid  black kinds. Cloves or something  like that. But even then I'm  like...nah.
1	Certain types, mainly cigars, smell nice. The smell get more overwhelming and gross when strong, though, and I only like it when they're actively lit--not a fan of the sticky lingering smell they leave on everything.
1	Can't say I do, particularly as it reminds me of  death, BUT I do get similar with weed for an odd reason (never smoked it, just don't mind the smell)
11	Love yo self!	I know I need to practice having better confidence, etc. and I think a lot of us here do. I think it's great to appreciate your own good qualities. It makes you happier and healthier. Being modest is one thing, being self deprecating is another. So, I occasionally try to remind myself of things that I like about me. Today I like my green eyes and my ability to knit (even though I'm not exceptionally good). What's at least one thing you like about yourself? \n\nP.S. Please don't say, there's nothing you like about yourself... Even if you can't think of anything right now, you are valuable. You matter, and the world is a better place because you're in it. Yes you. Really.
1	Thank you for this topic! \n\nI like that I have a knack for making miniature things. 
1	I got into self love kinda a two weeks ago and I am already in love with myself. Low key. I think it's the Infp thing to fall fast üòÉ I hope I don't blow it üòÉ.\n\nI can be good with words.\n
15	Crushes and being in love	Hey,\n\nI don't know if this is  something that happens to me (always) or if it's part of a trait of being introverted or infp, but it's always the same, I tend to have crush and internally obsess about that person (without being invasive or idk intrusive...aka bothering that person in any mean possible) until I get to the point that, that person is never going to consider me even as possible option (and no, not talking about celebrity crushes) I'm talking about the type of person whom you see at work, school or something, and honestly i'm exhausted, I tried not to think about it, or to ignore such feelings because I feel they're partly delusions or daydreams, but I always end up hurt because even if from the beginning I knew the answer my heart is always hopeful, and i'm just tired of always the same, not being good enough or feeling like ¬∑$%&/ because my crushes are never going to set an eye on me, my friends have advised me to act on it, like start talking or you know coy flirting and test the grounds, but it's simply impossibly because in my head I already know (or feel) that i'm not even the kind of person someone would be ever be attracted to. It's basically [this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9b/26/9b/9b269bdeeefe8ca540169036427f209c--joey-friends-hatred-quotes.jpg) from the moment i realize I like someone, I just wish i weren't attracted to anyone sometimes, it'd be easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEver happened to anyone? Did you find a solution or have any advice or any word/perspective to consider on?
6	I do this same kinda thing, I feel like it has to do with INFP's idealizing our romantic partners and wanting perfection which is what we think this partner could be, So we obsess about them, but To be honest I don't know a solution as I am still a young person myself, but this is something I can identify with and honestly struggle with.
3	Yes I obsess over people I barely know. I day dream about a life with them. I think they are the one. Then I realize they probably wouldn't be into me or it's not meant to be. Because if it was meant to be it would have happened. I too don't have a solution, and I kind of don't want one. I like doing this, even if it's unhealthy, doing it just gives me hope that maybe one day it will happen and I will realize why it didn't happen with the other people I was obsessing over. Because part of me wants my future SO to come out of nowhere when I least expect it. And it's not going to happen like that when i'm obsessing over them and expecting it to happen.
3	  \n\nI myself tend to shut my head when it's making noise. I know as an INFP that I sure do idealize the many crushes I‚Äôve had, and I‚Äôve learned to take it as something anomalous that shouldn't be there in my brain, or a disease that I should fight against to center in reality. And what really helped me neutralize those emotions was focusing on personal projects that make me feel good about myself. it worked well for me since entering college last year.\n\nif you want to get to know someone, whether it'd be for friendship as romantic interest, the obvious answer would be "approach to them" but we know how BIG of a deal that would be to go in just like that so that‚Äôs a very true obstacle.\n\nI found purpose and fulfilment in sticking to my plan. To expand my comfort zone and dealing with failure for a bigger reward, which is finding balance between being explosive outwards and reclusive inwards, rather than just the later. discipline to what you wish to obtain.\n\nother thing I say to myself is that as long as I don't intend to hurt someone in the process of my development, I can do anything I want and experiment. I recognize myself as an ignorant who's jumping dive first into real life just a tad late and I sure don't want to stay behind just for being afraid of failing. You can be a little bit crazy uwu\n\nthere, I sprawled some thoughts that I hope makes sense to some. do take care out there.  \n\n\nalso not a native English speaker by the way. Might've screwed something up.
2	I feel this.. although I have a good friend who happens to be an infp too. And our "weirdness" works well together so maybe I do have a chance. \nWho knows.
2	I experience the exact same things! And the worse thing is, I internalise my feelings so even my friends don‚Äôt know about my crush, hence making it even more suffocating.
1	*Always* .
0	Two Questions:	The first question is for both guys and girls but the second one is for guys only. \n\nThe first Question: **Are you able to make people online think you're the obbosite gender?** (Like you're a guy and can make anyone convinced that you're a girl. And the obbosite for girls)\n\nThe second Question (For guys): **How often people confuse your gender online?**\n\nI'm asking this because I get both and can 'catfish' as a girl.  \n\n
4	1: yes\n2: often
2	I'm a boy and have been mistaken to a girl twice. in real life
1	1:  Never tried, but probably could\n\n2:  Happened once in real life
1	1. I think so\n2. didn't happen yet
1	I'm sorry but are you saying that you catfish people?
1	Trying to root out all the male Infp‚Äôs aren‚Äôt you? Smart plan but now that I‚Äôve exposed it you‚Äôll never get them all.
0	This sub this strange... pretty much expected. 
7	Official r/infp Minecraft server?	Is there an official server for this subreddit? I know a lot of us like MC, but from asking around it doesn't seem like there's a dedicated place for the whole gang. Just wanted to check if there's anything :)
2	I want this.
1	We can all have our own little chunk and do our own thing while feeling the comeraderie of each other's presence and leaving random gifts for each other. 
82	Infp man just realized what he wants in a partner	Man here. Have always felt different from other men when I don‚Äôt get attracted to hot women. I mean, yeah, I can see that they‚Äôre physically attractive, but have never wanted to be with them. Was talking with a fellow infp man and realized what I‚Äôm looking for: an adorable woman whom I can cuddle with and can connect with emotionally. Not a spokesperson for all infp men, obviously, but it is very liberating to know what I want. \n\nHere‚Äôs to owning who you truly are! 
36	I‚Äôm a woman but I understand what you‚Äôre saying. Not the same, but somewhat related: I‚Äôve always thought that I was odd because I cannot feel physical chemistry/attraction to someone right away no matter how good looking they are. I have to feel an emotional connection over time, before I feel physical attraction. This makes dating tricky because I move so slowly. But I‚Äôve tried to just accept that it‚Äôs the way I am!
16	Ahhhhh I was just about to post this!!!! I‚Äôm a woman, but I realized my ideal relationship would be with a human that I enjoy where we buy houses so we‚Äôre next door neighbours. We can cuddle whenever we need, but can also retreat to our own safe spaces. I also realized that sex actually isn‚Äôt a necessity, even though I previously thought it was. 
5	I'm glad you figured out that part of your life. It's really relieving when you find out who you are and you can be yourself. keep learning.
5	INFP 32M here, what you are saying here resonates with me a lot, I wish I would have come to the same conclusion years earlier. It is simple, but kinda difficult at the same time, coming to the realization that it is perfectly fine to be different, than most men.
5	Looks don't do anything at all for me as well. I need a lot of runway when it comes to dating which does make it very difficult. 
7	Yes, recognize it!! I mean, I do get attracted to hot woman, but mostly only in a sexual way, where as with cute woman, I just can't get my eyes of them.\n\nWith all the luck of the world I can say that I actually met a girl online who is super adorable, loves to cuddle and love me all the time, and is also an INFP!! Only downside is that she lives in another country and I have to wait a few months to meet her :(
3	I‚Äôve always dated extroverts. No idea why. My current bf is also an introvert and for the first time I understand why I‚Äôve always had to struggle to get enough me time in a relationship. From here on out - ambiverts or introverts only for me. 
3	Sounds like you're demisexual tbh 
2	I'm an ambivert infp lady who has been single for almost 4 years now.  I realised that my ex needed me to be his EVERYTHING.  i was his only friend, his only family, his idea of constant companionship despite having completely different tastes in most things... he EXPECTED  me to be there.  \nNow i know that i can't possibly live like that.  I know that i like sexy intimate times but sex doesn't necessarily have to be daily, just the intimacy. I know that i like to be near someone, but not actually talk.  I have found that I'm quite happy to be aware of my own accomplishments, i don't feel the need to share every little thing i do with a person... but when i do share, it's because i really want to. \n\nI'd love to find a bloke who could accept all that.  
2	The comfort and cuddle-ability aspect is very strong for me too. I think that's why I prefer guys with a slight paunch and a soft hairy chest and belly. No rock-hard Cristiano Ronaldo-smooth abs for me, thank you. 
1	Totally agree. 
19	I don‚Äôt mean to sound so pessimistic, but I am extremely prone to boredom. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself half the time. It‚Äôs a real problem.	
4	Podcasts. Morning, noon and night...podcasts. Also weed.
3	I feel ya bud maybe you should try a new hobby which is something I have thought of doing, but I can't really stick to anything, so that's pretty hard for me. Maybe you could spend your time doing whatever your current hobbies are if any, if you are in school maybe study more, there are infinite possibilities, but honestly I have a hard time actually starting anything.
3	I would personally stay away from weed. Been addicted for 26yrs and now into week 8 of quitting and it‚Äôs hard. r/leaves \n\nMayb join a community group, old ladies knitter club :)  or chess or DnD club. Or even archery.  I love being alone and find so much to do. Late night home Reno‚Äôs, building bonfires, writing in my gratitude journal, learning mandolin, playing video games, painting on my windows, organizing, learning to upholster 
2	Love pod casts 
2	I feel this.. I'm struggling really bad with chronic illness right now and have been bedridden for months. I've done everything I can possibly think to do and the boredom is the worst part.. 
1	Inner work. üòç
1	I got back into Pokemon Go. It's kind of like a video game, but it's more like a hobby for me. I get to meet people, go out driving, collect Pokemon, etc. It's just something I can do whenever i'm bored. And it helps clear my head when i'm out driving.
1	Bucket list ;)

9	I feel like my internet addiction is fueling my introversion and often wonder what it would be like if I quit the internet altogether.	I spend all my free time on reddit, twitter and gmail.  And I've been doing this for so long its just become a way of life. Instead of going out into the world, and trying new things, hell, even trying new things in the comfort of my own home its just constant scrolling of reddit and twitter.\n\nAnd it's gotten to the point where I don't have many friends left because I never bothered to really nourish relationships or try/join new groups of people. Friendships fade, situations change and instead of going out and seeking new experiences I just go down the twitter rabbit hole or the youtube rabbit hole.\n\nI've often wanted to see what it would be like if I just quit the internet even for a day or week and was forced to like call that person I've been thinking of and make the effort to go do something.\n\nI'm alone on another Saturday night because my parents are out of town and it frankly really sucks...  If I had no internet, maybe I would have made an effort to make plans with somebody or do something. I don't know.  It's not good to go through so much of life alone. Something inside of me knows its not ok.\n\nFeeling kinda bummed about it. I fear my internet addiction is too strong. The chains have been locked through years of internet-abuse.\n\nThanks for reading.
2	Go to the local library, register. Browse the books or newspapers, see if anything catches your interest. \n\nBuy a newspaper, take a marker. Read through the article, evaluate what you're being told, highlight what you think it's not correct or requires further elaboration.\n\nGo for a walk.\n\nClean up your room.\n\nTurn the internet off, set yourself a challenge for the evening. Just brainstorm what would you like to do and how you're going to do it.\n\nMeditate.\n\nSet your own exercise, no watching YT or anything like that, do the research make the plan, execute the plan.\n\nJust some recommendations.  
1	You could just try for like a month?
1	1. RescueTime: Install to get a starting point of how much of your time is being spent and where. Moment, is another good one for the phone.\n2. Utilize this information to make changes and slowly try to decrease time spent in categories per week.\n3. Use website blockers to further this goal, such as StayFocused, blocking your "problem" websites at certain times, or limiting overall hour usage to what you desire.\n\nI struggle with spending too much time on the internet in pursuit of "knowledge and research", but tend to be just bouncing around between different websites. My problem isn't so much with phone usage but this can apply there aswell.\n\nYour first step is tracking your usage and seeing just how much time you spend on what websites and at what times of day. Seeing the actual usage is key as it then takes away the unknown of how much time is being spent and where.\n\nIn my own experience, my internet usage isn't just a "habit", but is an information addiction. Its also masking other areas in my life I'm avoiding improving / working on. It can be really hard to break, so I would start slowly. Try to define the true reason you spend so much time on such sites. Then try to replace that feeling with another hobby or activity. You got this!\n\nA quote that resonated with me when making changes in this area: \n\n"Some people die at 25 and aren't buried until 75." - Ben Franklin\n\nEdit: Some activities that have worked for me: Utilizing library for free books and reading more, color drawing books, listening to interesting podcasts, spending more time outside (even just walking around your neighborhood), one screen at a time, working out, etc.
1	What are you still doing here?! Get out of here, now! Go live. Go!
33	Thank you üòä	I just wanted to tell you that I'm really happy with this little corner of the Internet.  I often have trouble with expressing myself and speaking my mind even when am online, be it for fear of regection, judgment or the fact that English is not my language and I don't like making mistakes, that even leads to me not being able to comment on the Internet, but you are one of the most accepting, not judgemental and kind people out there so it's not that hard to express myself.\n\nJust keep being you, and don't let anybody change you. We can often feel like we are not needed but the world wouldn't be the same without someone like you ‚ù§.
6	Thank you bro, i'm not always that expressive either, even on the internet.

2	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 17	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
6	it kinda sucks having a close friend who has other other close friends or like not even having a few close friends. i am starting to feel lonely once again haha
1	i wish i had any confidence in my capabilities. i can't even think to send a care package or gift baked goods for another *without* my overthinking getting in the way. why can't i ever just do something simple without all these thoughts and doubts?
1	My dad is very sick. I think I might lose him soon. He's my everything. \n\nThere are other individuals like him but only one of them is my dad. Only one of them do I both respect and bother and love and argue with because he's such a wonderful enigma - my dad, the man that raised me. Please help.
1	Neon genesis evangelion should be required viewing for all INFPs. I've clicked with the director in a way that makes me feel like I really understand his emotional state. I feel weird liking a cartoon as much as this, but do yourselves a favor and check it out!
1	Well recently made my reddit account and fortunately I found this thread with fellow INFPs.\n\nI have recently finished high-school in a computer oriented one, and when I had to choose a career I   just appointed myself to computer university just as if it was kind of what "I should do" . But one week there made me realise it isn't what I like, that I followed it by pressure (my brother followed that one, plus everyone I knew was following some career that led them to moneymaking stuff) and economic necessity as I am pretty poor. I am very good with computers but I don't see myself studying it. Working? For sure, but no studying it at the same time. I would be so unhappy.\nI am thinking of studying cinema, as it's something I love and kind of a dream to be a filmmaker. Also considering educational psychology and physical therapy, almost anything that involves taking care of others and counseling.\nThis change of focus responded on me in lots of anxiety and stress, so that nowadays I feel a bit too socially anxious, just as I used to be in the past (I could "get over" it, but now its back).\nMy poorness is a bit depressing for me and makes me still reconsider following some career that favors money, but programming is a pretty flexible world, I don't think I need a paper that says I know how to program to be a good coder or smth. As for cinema, I think I will love it. 
19	Generally speaking, are you fascinated by airports, people watching at airports, travel in general?	These are some of my favorite things....curious if this is something that also resonates with other's INFP's sensibilities....
6	Same here :) I love airports, planes, watching people following their dreams and creating new experiences. Sometimes I go to the nearest airport just to see arrivals and departures. It makes me feel so good and relaxed. I always wonder why people travelling from point X to Y - are they changing their lives now? Are they coming back to loved ones? Imagination can reach the highest level here. It's kinda weird I guess, but who cares if I just love this ‚ù§Ô∏è \n\nPS Two days ago I booked weekend flight just to meet my friend and to fly above clouds again! I'm totally excited about it (one month to go)! It will be my first solo trip and I can't wait anymore ü§ó \n\nThank you for the post (little reminder about my beloved flights haha) and have a nice day! 
4	Sure, airports are cool... But what I really love is watching the workers do their thing at the local port. Watching the ships come and go, the shipping containers get moved around and stacked, all the buzz is just so fascinating. 
3	Yes! It's so exciting. I still want to get pilot license one day. 
3	Love travel and seeing new places.
3	I love watching people at train stations and imagine their stories, especially when they're saying hello or goodbye to each other when arriving or leaving.üòç
2	I love travelling if you mean that
2	I love airports! Especially when i am travelling alone, i get to actually sit down for a while and just look around. I love how you see people from all over the world, different shapes and sizes and different languages in one place. It‚Äôs so fascinating. \n\nWhenever i am comfortable enough, i try and make conversation with whoever seems willing to. I had met the most interesting guy once who was from saudi arabia but had a canadian passport and he told me ‚Äòi want to make this much money and then...‚Äô the ‚Äòthis‚Äô part he showed holding both his hands up and suggesting a good stack of money. I had never seen anyone say it like that. \n\nI also like train stations. Everybody going about their daily lives some for work, some to visit their loved ones. \n\nThe thing i love most about travelling is watching people say goodbye to each other. It‚Äôs usually got so many emotions in it even if they aren‚Äôt necessarily crying, just beautiful to watch people be people.
1	I dislike airports.. so many rude and anxious passengers. But I like people watching, pref from a cafe.
1	Airports, bus stations, buses and trains, the places in between are beautiful 
1	People watching.
1	Absolutely!
2	How do you guys type other people?	Just curious because I see posts like "I met this INFP" or "this guy is such an ENTJ" and I am wondering how do you know?\n\nDo you just guess based on your knowledge of the different types? Do you get them to take the test? Or do you ask them?\n\nI find a lot of people I speak to have either never heard of it or know very little about it. Is this just to do with it maybe not being as well known where I am from (I live in the UK)?\n\nAnd as much as I would like to know other people's types I sometimes find that people aren't as interested in this stuff as I am and getting them to do the test requires some convincing.\n\nSo how do you come to your conclusions about other people's types?
1	I've still to master it but i use this guide https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/149191973762/type-spotting-guide\nscroll down a bit to see that actual guide on the page 
40	Does anyone else get annoyed by some words?	I was just recently talking to someone and the conversation went like;\n\nMe: what are you up to?\n\nHim: just reading mario puzo‚Äôs godfather\n\nMe: is it nice? \n\nHim: yeah\n\nMe: the movies were awesome \n\nHim: obviously \n\nUgh that ‚Äòobviously‚Äô was just such a turn off. I dont know what was so annoying about it but just... \n\n
10	My body collapses in on itself like a dying star when I see "EEEEK!!!!" typed out\n\nOfc I'm sure there's words I use that irk other people too, I use "literally" a lot.  Sorry, other commenter!
14	I love words and I love to hear them used in surprising combinations
12	[deleted]
5	Words and phrases I loathe:\n\n"Bae"\n\n"The missus (referring to your girlfriend)"\n\n"Literally"\n\n"Long time no see.."\n\n"That's/You're so extra (What does this mean?)"\n\n
6	Yep.  For me, I struggle with words that come across in a slightly insensitive manner.  It's all about context for me.   For example, if someone says "thanks for the help" when I feel as though my contribution was equal to that of the person who thanked me for "helping", I go nuts.  It's not "help" if it's my project too.  "Help" implies that I'm here to be a supporting role.   I'm fine with that IF I am truly in a supporting role.   I am NOT ok though if I feel I have equal ownership of a project.  In that case, I prefer the word "collaboration" over "help".  That's just one example but suffice to say there are many nuances of words that equally make me lose my mind.  I know I know, I'm super sensitive.   
5	Ughhh I hate yummy, tummy, or any baby words
4	I want to stop talking with the person if they do a really fake sarcastic laugh after I laugh for real. Feels like they're mocking me either for thinking it was funny or because I have a weird laugh; either way I hate it
4	Oh fucking green hell!\n\nINFJ perspective....\n\nI take the time to spell out my words. Maybe sometimes they're misspelled. Sometimes it's on purpose because I'm bored with the human language.\n\nMostly I take the time to spell out my words to show that I respect you as a human. My time is valuable and whether you understand those or not doesn't matter. Spelling out all my words is my little way of showing you are valued.\n\nI get frustrated with myself because I don't think there's anything in any human language that can adequately describe exactly what I mean or how I feel by each word. Often times I overcompensate. It annoys the hell out of me. I can't just tell you that I'm proud of you. I have to say that I'm really extremely proud of you. \n\nAnyway......\nMost things other people type or text to me are annoying. Abbreviations weird-ass slang somebody just made up last week. Using words in text that they actually don't use in person. Short one-word replies. \n\nI probably shouldn't post this because it's not specific enough but I'm just in one of those moods and I'm going to let this hang right the fuck right here.
4	I used to hate Likewise, but now I use it all the time. I am also one who dislikes modern slang. it feels fake and shallow and doesn't express anything real. New slang is like a social prop to be accepted or fit in. That bugs me.\n\nThe inflection of voices, especially females, where they're kinda copying that "omg did you see Becky she's like soooooe blaaaaaaah!!!" kinda inflection really irritates me! It's kinda like a voice that's trying to imitate what cool sounds like.
3	Many people get annoyed by certain words, obviously
3	I hate the word "poop." It's like youre trying to make something gross sound cute. Just say shit.
2	Yes I hate so many words!! Lol I really hate obviously too!
2	I just read someone using  "finna" which I'm assuming is variation of "gonna" from "going to". I understand "gonna" which now seems so immature to me but where the hell did "finna" come from?????(I know... I'll google it) but I have to say I hate that word. It's gross and unnecessary. 
2	Yeah, I hate ‚Äûliterally‚Äú too and ‚Äûanyways‚Äú and when people say ‚Äûthe thing is, is that‚Äú (which I hear all the time) and for some reason I hate when people pronounce the t in often.
2	Utilize... \n\n"use" functions exactly the same way.
1	I have a lot of words people say and I‚Äôm totally getting it to the heart and I feel shit about what he said, although maybe he didn‚Äôt even mean it like that. Sometimes things can get really negative for me when someone didn‚Äôt even mean it negative. Yeah. I‚Äôm not that easy to understand hopefully someone can give a explanation if they understand what I mean
1	Yes, especially when used in a derogatory way. 
1	I hate when people say ok and  okay to something I tell them on text. Like I need more reaction please. 
1	I cant stand when someone says "sure". Not in every context but sometimes it sounds so denigrating for example: \n\nTeacher: can someone explain hamlets behaviour in act IV\n\nstudent: [insert an answer that is correct but not in the teachers words]\n\nTeacher:...sure \n\n-_- 
1	The terms yikes or weird flex\n
1	"gotcha" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nomgosh i want to strangle people who say this. it sounds so stupid! 
26	I need to talk to myself everyday	I don‚Äôt know if I am crazy or I am just super lonely but I tend to talk to myself everyday and I cherish my own time a lot as I really want my own personal space and time to do my favorite things and TALK to myself literally. Despite I always want attention and companion outside and always feel lonely. I get extremely frustrated when I am not alone at home so I tend to get really pissed when my parents or others enter my personal space. And tbh, I am starting to talk to myself outside a LOT too especially during the night I take a walk(I do it all the time when there aren‚Äôt many people around or empty). And it feels a lot better also relieves stress a lot. I have no idea what am I becoming.. I feel broken and depressed af but at the same time my mood swing is making it hard to identify how I am actually feeling logically. Since I do get excited easily and anxious..
8	I can be so outrageaos and be laughing and then can get into a depressive sad quiet moment the other time real quick.. 
4	I test as an Entp yet the more i read this thread the more I relate To being an infp.  Because SAME 
4	I'm an ENFP and I talk to myself everyday too. Almost like I am answering an interview question.\n\nI think it's the common intuition and mind-full trait that we share.\n\nAlso. I am an external processor. If I've got a lot going on in my head I need to talk to myself, someone or journal it down. 
2	I do this too. Like exactly this. Like I could have written this post this.  So far not crazy... though sometimes I wonder...
13	Anyone else imagines walking on the street, a random interviewer comes across you and askes you all type of personal questions about things you want to tell people in you're life, but you're to afraid to?	However in this interview you answer all questions and this feels really relieving for a moment, until you realise it isn't real.
7	Haha not that exact scenario. But yeah for some reason i am always being interviewed like a celebrity and i always spew such facts when i answer that i surprise myself. Great moments, those. 
3	I do this all the time haha 
2	I fantasize that I'm a famous musician and I'm getting interviewed. But it's not so much getting things off my chest, just me giving joke answers and subverting the interviewer or throwing in clues or references to my favorite books and movies for my fans to discover.
5	If any INFP here has had success battling alcohol and drug abuse, could I pick your brain maybe?	Any advice for depression, chronic unemployment, fantasy world inhabitation, lack of focus and motivation wouldn't be kicked out of bed. 
3	Not sure how much I can help but I would suggest having faith first.... when things are in context they make more sense generally.  Also a healthy routine... pray daily, eat right, excercise 3x a week at least, get some sunlight, stretch, get out when your feeling down.  Make a routine to get out of bed everyday by say 7am.  Set goals and work towards them.... then don‚Äôt overthink them but make steps towards them daily.  I also find doing something rational (chess) helps.   Also just stop the alcohol and addictive behaviors, they wreak havoc on your neurotransmitters and the rest of your life.       Replace them with something more constructive, easier said than done I know, but also no excuses....   Just start moving....when I‚Äôm depressive I‚Äôm an expert at making excuses....   praying for you mate.  If I can help any please let me know.
2	I was a raging drug addict from my teens to the age of 27, I've been totally sober and happy for over a year now and believe me when i say i fucking loved getting high. \n\nAs INFPs we have an intense passion for at least one thing in this world something we want to change or a cause we want to get behind, for me it is the welfare of animals, always had been deep down. \n\nGetting involved in animal rescue helped save me but it's not that simple, you have to ask yourself why are you using in the first place? \nFor myself, being a male and an INFP, a rather feminine personality type in my opinion, i used drugs to alter my personality, give me confidence, allow me to act more masculine.\n\nWhy are you using? What part of yourself are you ashamed or unhappy with?\n\nI abandoned myself for so many years and i now embrace myself, I'm sensitive, I'm introverted, I'm somewhat feminine but i wouldn't change any of these things now. \n\nIt is so much more satisfying to have people love you for who you really are and i now have an abundance of friends (and animals) and a partner who know and love the real me. \n\nJust over a year ago i never in a million years thought i could be sober AND happy but it's very possible. \n\nMessage me if you like and I'll do whatever i can to help you.\n

Writing is legit the only creative thing I do. \n\nJust took this neat version here tho: [https://www.123test.com/career-test/](https://www.123test.com/career-test/)\n\nScore:  CIASRE\n\nAccording to this test, my top three jobs are Mathematician (80%), Bioinformatics Scientist (78%), and Historian (77%).\n\nI'm average in math and absolutely terrible with science. My grad degree is in history though, so that one makes sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your scores? Jobs? :)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qw562flxq0h21.png
3	ISRACE\n\n100% Immunologist\n\nI didn't even do biology in college.
2	AISRCE\n\nTop jobs were Desktop Publisher(85%) and a bunch tied for 84% such as Stop-Motion Animator, Digital Artist, Writer. I also got Anthropologist at 72% which is cool considering I'm changing my majors from Psych and Music Therapy to Psych and Anthropology. Regardless, it's pretty accurate because I've also been considering going back to community college to get a Graphic Design or a Photography degree(I already have an AA in Music) instead of finishing my BA. I'm honestly still hella confused lol. At least I know I'm going in a somewhat okay direction.
1	My husband (ESTP) took it and got RASECI. His top jobs deal with furniture making and being a Jeweller. Interesting. 
1	ISACRE apparently. Psychologist (91%), Immunologist (89%), Dietitian (85%).\n\nThe results could be worse, I guess.
1	ASIRCE
1	SAICER with 94% Recreational Therapist. Actually, doesn't sound too bad!
1	I got RAISCE with 77% Pharmacologist. I felt so conflicted choosing answers and I kept overthinking everything haha. Because of that, I don‚Äôt feel as if my results match me 
1	A and I are so far consistent within our top 3 types!

273	Cute INFP struggles	
55	Economics and politics are mundane yet magical subjects; that tension clicks profoundly with my personality as an INFP
53	Really? if people are talking about something I don't know I usually feel intrigued and want to know more
15	I've been rated as an INFP and all of my conversations with literally everyone are about Marxism, feminism, and Existentialism.
7	Don't know much about economy. Just that I don't see it to carry on like this way for the next hundred years. Late capitalism is a downward spiral
5	Spot on!
6	This stuff is definitely right up intuitives alley, but the dogmatic partisan shit is a major turn off. I find that I can have a convo with only NTJs on political issues, because they are usually the only ones that can debate on merit and "see-through" political spin and actually talk pure N and T, and sometimes you see the Fi coming through. They also seem to be the only ones that have a "meta" approach, whereby they've investigated their own ideas and can connect them with political philosophy. So many people don't even understand what is fundamentally left or right.   \n\n\nLike... I don't really care about values when it comes to issues... I care about what works. It's pure N & T for me... you know, what could be done, what matters, what is pragmatic, what benefits people, whats cost effective, whats new and innovative etc. Like I am pretty open minded and like to research different approaches, and see what worked and what didn't in the past, rather than just having some strong left vs right ideas that is just so inane and backwards.
4	I love to argue about these subjects, unless everyone has an open mindset towards eacothers opinion. If not, im out before it even starts
13	Oi, I'm an INFP, but I'm a proud economist \n\n\#AustrianSchoolRules
3	This is literally me, so often. I get anxious and paranoid almost to the point of panic about things I have no knowledge of. Just abstract things like corruption of the government and smart people being motivated by greed to exploit others.
3	INFP.  I follow politics and the economy just enough to know what's going on.  Neither fulfill me in any way.  I've gone on media diets, where I stop listening.  I feel there is so much in our world that is anti-human being.  We don't have basic skills or knowledge any more.  
2	soooooooooo true. I just find the economy to be a really dry and boring topic.
2	yikes same. i really want to understand it but it just flies over my head and i have a hard time even memorizing the terminologies sometimes
2	Intps don't like politics and economics too
1	It's actually a very interesting topic if you understand it. We treat the economy as a living, breathing thing. 
1	Maybe this depends if you are a jumper or not. Half of INFPs have Ne savior so maybe they would be more interested in learning new information on economics than an INFP with Si savior who would have more fun talking about past experiences.
0	ENTP* I think you meant, I don‚Äôt know a single INTP that actively cares enough to keep up with such things unless it somehow directly impacted them on a daily basis
1	OOOOOOOOOOOOF BIG MOOD
1	INFP myself. Sorry, but I just can't like this meme... it is not accurate, it is stereotyping at least 3 personality groups, and it kinda indulge in the ignorance of such important topics, economy and politics. Looks like it was made by my teenager brother.

9	"Love is at the root of everything. Love, or the lack of it." -Fred Rogers\n\nThat quote helps keep me grounded in my worldview. Most people are in unbelievable circumstances that you couldn't even wrap your head around if you wanted to. In all reality, their situation probably controls them a lot more than they would think (although one shouldn't necessarily play the victim, either). Their decision making is rooted in years of trauma, learning, and development with just as much emotional depth as your own. \n\nIt's easy to forget that, however, when you're in a heated argument, treated unfairly, etc. In spite of this, the only way to move forward with anyone is to show kindness, respect, and empathy (especially when it's hard to do so).

15	I seriously have problems relating to this sub	Like I know I‚Äôm an INFP but sometimes this sub is just too sensitive and feels for me.
12	I feel like I‚Äôm about 10-15 years older than everyone here. I‚Äôve developed some boundaries/callouses/hardness because I needed to. I think it skews young. Maybe you‚Äôre an old soul. :)
6	Perhaps that's because you're an ambivert. I am, and I get what you're saying. It's why I am in other relatable subs, even though I usually post here. 
2	sometimes communities like this are way too "cute animals and sunsets ahhh" for me. its kind of taking things most people enjoy and labelling it as infp thing...very inauthentic... 
3	Same buddy same. 
1	Yeah, same. I never seem, nor want to resonate with these posts.. 
-3	I'm glad you got this off your chest. Feel better? 
16	Just wrote down my feelings. You can skip.	Hi guys\n\nNow, I'm feeling really suffocated so I wrote this all down hoping it will ease my chest pain a bit.\n\nI don't know if all of you are like me, but these days, my logic and feelings are fighting inside my mind everyday. If I use logic, then everything my boyfriend did or do is right, and I can accept that. But my feelings can't accept that. I feel hurt and suffocated. And it's really hard fighting against myself.i know everything I wish or want is not logical, I know it but I can't accept that, my feelings can't accept that. I'm trying to improve myself by studying, but it doesn't progress much. I made a timetable but I can't stick to it. My mind is delusional, dreaming stuffs, and imagining things which I never do, like "I'm gonna wash these bags" and then i never did. Trying to realise that I'm in dreaming state and call myself back to reality every fucking time is really exhausted too.\n\nI wanted to tell my boyfriend everything what I'm feeling, but I don't think he can understand me, coz I can't even understand myself.\n\nHow do you guys face this kind of situation if this happened to you?\n\nI feel really suffocated now. Sometimes,i even think about suicide. I did well when I was young, now I'm just useless. I feel like I'm useless, want to disappear from this world.\n\nI want to say "help me" but I'm really good at pretending. My parents doesn't even know about my mind state and I plan to keep them in dark till i die. I rather die than my parents finding out about my mental state.\n\nMy feelings are so messed up right now.\n\nI want to improve myself but I'm getting nowhere. I want a better life for my family but then I realised that I'm dreaming too much and then the two states of my mind started fighting again.\n\nAlso, my boyfriend said that he wanted to own a house so that we could live together, so I thought he wanted to marry me. But, one time, we had a fight and asked him about that, and he said he just wanted to live together, not marrying me. I felt so ashamed of myself. I was dreaming by myself, living in imaginary world. I hate that but I can't do anything about that. I'm always in my own world, dreaming about stuffs.\n\nHe also said that why would he marry me when he isn't sure that we will work out. I thought about that and I understand that he was right. It was right thing to do if I think logically. But i feel hurt, ashamed that I was dreaming, hoping and thinking seriously when he's not doing it.\n\nMy mind is so messed up now.\n\nAm I at fault for being too serious?\n\nI can't help but think everything seriously. What should I do?
3	Hey I really don't think you should beat yourself up for dreaming or to be honest any of this. I know exactly what you mean about suffocating. I'm a singer and write my own songs. One song that's going to be on my album has lyrics about suffocating. That's how I feel when everything is on top of me and I feel like people don't understand me. Though I think I'm in a much better state of mind now to when I wrote that song a few months ago. I think what helped me was communicating better with the ones closest to me. I still have bad days and life is tough but it's tough for most people. I think me and my best friend are closer becuase I told her little bits of how I feel and i actually asked her to take the MBTI and turns out she's an ENFP. I think maybe she read a little about INFP'S becuase I just feel like she understands me so much more. My parents have always been pretty understanding and know who I am. I think there's just some things they get confused with and they can't quite get it sometimes when I talk about MBTI etc. But they know me and know everything's not so simple for me. To be honest life is still pretty tough at the moment. My career isn't going so great, I just met a girl I really like and I'm afraid I've scared her off becuase as INFP'S we can be way too intense. I'm just grateful I have my best friend to talk too. \n\nI don't want to give you the wrong advice. I just hope in the end you can take all the info you get from all of us on here and do what feels right in you're heart.\n\nMaybe you need to tell you're boyfriend how you feel? If it's really bothering you. Maybe you should get it off you're chest. I'd say go slow and maybe not say too much at once and overload him with to much information that could confuse him. I don't know you both and I don't know what you're boyfriend is like but it seems to me like he cares about you enough if he wants to get a house with you. Maybe the marriage conversation just scared him a little. I don't think it means necessarily that he doesn't want to be with you. Please remember also people say things in an argument or heat of the moment that they may not mean. He might want to marry you one day but I think that if he wants to live with you and get a house. It could be a good foundation to build on.\n\nI know what you mean about pretending. I'm really good at it too. I perform on stage and have gotten more used to socialising. Sometimes people would probably think I'm more of an ENFP. It's so exhausting and that's why my best friend is so important becuase I can talk to her about things and I don't have to bottle everything  up. \n\nAbout suicide please don't even think about it.\nI know it's not just as simple as that. I'm not someone who has really gone through that kind of feeling. My way of looking at it is I just wouldn't want to let everyone,everything and life itself beat me. You're better than that. I don't know you but I know if you're an INFP you're strong. Please don't give in! \n\nDon't be ashamed for any of these thoughts. They are all completely normal and I included I'm sure along with many many more on here can relate. Be proud of who you are. Maybe try and talk to you're parents you might find that they know more about you than you think. If not I'm sure they will be really glad you talked to them. They are you're parents and if they love you I'm sure they would want to hear the truth and i hope they would. That's what they should be there for to help you. \n\nSo my advice would be to try and clear some of you're feelings up with you're boyfriend and try and talk to you're parents. Let the ones closest to you into you're world. Just not too much at once. Please don't keep everything bottled up. I feel so much lighter not having to carry around so much in my head.\n\nWe are dreamers and I don't think it's something that we will ever be able to stop doing. I think we should actually be proud of it becuase we can see a bigger picture and we see and believe in things that others don't. \n\nLove to all my fellow INFP'S. I hope we all find our path and happiness ‚ù§ x
2	It's normal. I'm also think like you also. There's no need to be worry. Just wrote about to express your feeling in your journal. 
2	There's nothing wrong with the way you think, your dreams, aspirations, etc.\n\nWanting better for your loved ones and yourself is a very honorable trait. You"d be surprised how many people don't think about those things at all.\n\nIt can be overwhelming. It's real easy to feel like a failure because YOU "didn't" or "couldn't" produce the Utopia built up in your imagination.\n\nYou can take solace in the fact, if you knew the answers, and knew the way, you would absolutely make it all happen! All this stems from that deep well of love you have in your heart for your people. That itself is an amazing thing which can never be adequately described to another human.\n\nAs far as that's concerned. Try to understand, that you can only do what's possible in this realm, on this planet, with the limitations imposed, or given at birth. All one really can do is the best they can with what they have. Absolutely strive to do better. At the same time, learn to be content with the outcomes.  There's really only so much you can do at a time and you never know what great things like ahead. Make the best of what you have and can do.\n\nOften times, others expectations of us is far lower than the expectations we have of ourselves. These things can only be learned in time.\n\nAssuming future relationship status is often tough and heart stressing. There is nothing wrong with you assuming you both would marry. It really seems to be the case when talking about buying a house and living together. Though, there really is no fault on this point. It's often times these little miscommunications and assumed expectations that cause problems in relationships.\n\nIt's a good idea to have a talk with each other and clearly state what each person's expectations/I tentions are for the future. Assuming has caused me a hell of a lot of heartache and years and years of wasted time,life, and potential.
1	it‚Äôs logical to listen to your emotions when it comes to relationships or emotional matters
1	You‚Äôre not at fault here. Also a thing that nobody here has mentioned or at least I don‚Äôt think so is that you‚Äôre not irrational to assume that he wants to marry you if he says he wants to buy a house for you. Why would you buy a house with a boyfriend? Buying a house is a manner of commitment and trust and marriage is another one. So you weren‚Äôt wrong to assume that. Also why would he say that he doesn‚Äôt believe you‚Äôll last that long? 
12	Now I get it.	Guys, I haven't felt this sad and happy at the same time.\nI'm an INFP dude, almost 30 and I don't know anything about love. I've always struggled with opening up to girls and people in general and because of that, I've missed a lot even though people seem to like me. When I'm in a good rational mood I know I'm good looking and I have worth but you know how it is... Making this feeling permanent is tough. \n\nOver the years I've had quite a few occasions to be in love. I've always ran away or simply felt nothing. I really need to trust the other person to feel safe. I've been raised in an unhealthy emotional environnement, I've seen so many couples hurting each other, and I wasn't taught how to show emotions. I love my parents and they have great qualities but they're emotionally dumb. I have to learn everything on my own. Do any of you relate to that?\n\nI've been on a few dates. It never went far. Most of the time I felt like I was forcing it. \nSo for years I got very independant, stoic. I honestly thought my heart was kinda fossilized.\n\nLast week, I randomly met this girl online. The funny thing is that we know the same people, we have a lot in common. The date went well. It could have gone better of course but it felt nice. The important thing is that for the first time I really felt something strong. She's beautiful, intelligent and so kind. Kindness is such an attractive quality to me. We spent two hours together and I told her I wanted to see her again. I knew I was in deep shit instantly. I spent the next days miserable. Not knowing what she felt. I wasn't totally able to read her, there was some positive signs but you never know. I was a mess, like Woody Allen on coke.\nAfter 5 days and no news, I started to think she was ghosting me. Ghosting is a cruel thing, just say yes or no but say something. Still, I understand why some women do that, they can be fed up with guys overreacting to rejection. I know it happens a lot. But she was just busy and she finally answered. \n\nShe was not feeling it. \n\nI'm the only guy she met on OKCupid and she stopped using the app after our date. She says dating is too much work. She was nice enough to propose that we stay friends. I'm grateful for that although I don't know if that's a good idea. \n\nI'm doing all I can to fight the ideas that I wasn't manly enough, assertive enough or stuff like that... Dating is awful. For INFPs especially since I think that we show our true potential over time, I don't think we make great first impressions.\n\nI'm feeling a little better now. I know this is infatuation and that I'm idealising. It's an overreaction, people are just people. She wasn't the cure to my problems. I just want to feel safe and I know I have a lot of love to give. \nNow there's still this lingering melancholia... This feeling that I'm missing some essential thing that makes love work on both sides. It looks so easy for other people. I have no idea what makes it work. \n\nBut it finally happened. I guess I'm grateful for that. Learning is painful, and so slow... But we keep trying right? Such warriors!
7	I'm in much the same situation as you. I'm an INFP approaching my 30s but have long been too afraid of rejection to try dating. I can't offer much advice then, but I wanted to comment on a few things you said. \n\nFirst I know it hurts now, but you should be proud of the effort you made. Its more than I can ever say I did. In the long run its better to open yourself up and be rejected than it is to close off your feelings and end up dead inside. Second people can only make dating look easy. It isn't for anyone. Even the greatest relationships I know of required working through sacrifice, arguing, and heartache.\n\nFinally you can learn to be more mainly and assertive if that's what you want for yourself. But don't change yourself just to attract others. If you did that you would have been fake, and in the long run neither of you would be happy for it. I hope you feel better soon and don't give up hope. Best of luck in the future. 
3	You know what‚Äôs worse? Getting really deep into loving them with all that love you have, thinking ‚Äúshe‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm gonna spend my life with! Finally I‚Äôm happy after all these years!‚Äù, and THEN ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not feeling it‚Äù happening. That‚Äôs really something that fucks you up forever. So, always look at the bright side! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm sayin
666	I feel a little like this brick	
60	Embrace it. Now that I'm in my 30s, I've found that so many people enjoy meeting someone who is authentically unique. Key word here being authentically. You can be that person for them. 
22	Current mood: this brick
9	I feel A LOT like that brick lol
7	\*cries\*
5	I‚Äôd feel like that more if the brick was broken.
3	You're not alone my friend. A picture which speaks a thousand words. 
3	The hole looks like a keyhole.  \n  \nBut the brick is not the key. 
3	I look at that photo like the brick is trying to escape the hole but the other bricks/stones are in the way, almost holding it down with their uniform shapes 
2	I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs trying to fit in. I think it‚Äôs trying to fall down the hole. 
2	Hell yeah, down the hole.
2	~~I think I'm not exactly a brick surrounded by different type of bricks, but I appreciate and understand the analogy and symbolism you are applying here.~~\n\nI can relate. \n\n
1	Tho, I rank as an istp, I can relate
1	r/actlikeyoubelong
1	I relate to this sooo hard üòï
2	Something like a Haiku. Any opinions?	fear like air\nevery breath\nsmother without lungs\n\n
3	I like bad Haikus\n\nThey never have to make sense\n\nChocolate onions
6	Am i the only one who's having some difficulty maintaining a daily journal/diary?	
10	Dude, maintaining any type of routine for me and other INFPs I know is a struggle
6	You‚Äôre not alone, i go from writing in mine every day to a week or longer without writing anything. I think i‚Äòd end up feeling like it‚Äôs more of a chore if i tried to keep up with it every day
1	I kept it up for a while in the beginning of this year, but found that the journaling wasn‚Äôt really doing much. I added in journaling prompts, and that helped. It probably also helped that I resolved to do my journal in a simple Word Doc this year, since I can type faster than I can write, and felt free to brain dump all over my word doc.
4	Is anyone childlike?	
2	I have a formal review next month for Aspergers. The signs all point there and have for the majority of my life. I am a single, 44 year old female with two wonderful teens. But I am very much faking adulthood (for them in some aspects). I feel like a child and am scared most of the time, I can‚Äôt read people very well and get hurt a lot. I approach life with innocence and am naive. This is the first time I‚Äôve considered the childhood innocence and it resonates with me. \n\nEdit: if this is you, how do you battle the loneliness of faking adulthood? I literally have to be fake all day to get through my incredibly difficult job in advertising-and the higher ranks I rise to only make it more difficult. 
2	When I feel safe, absolutely 
1	Not everyone is like this or wants to identify like this, but some do.\n\nIn the post it says "I don't know why, but this thread helped me resolve a lot of my issues". That person could have thought "I am a child" by themselves. But they didn't. They only benefited when it was suggested to them. This strikes me as similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXfQuXUQ8X8&t=87) at 1:27 and 4:45, where an unrecognised transgender child needed 14 medications, 17 doses per day for psychological issues. After transitioning all the problems went away.

56	It's so sad to see so many INFPs are going through my same struggles	When I found this sub I was expecting more light-hearted stuff. You know, things like jokes about our quirks, random facts about INFPS etc. It's almost painful to see that so many posts are about people struggling with the same issues I've had to deal with my whole life. And holy shit, nearly everything I read here is so relatable to me it's almost scary.\n\nI can't help but wonder if being INFP automatically raises additional barriers to our happiness compared to other people.\n\n It makes me wish it was easier for us to find each other, it would be nice to have someone in my life who is on the same length-wave as me.
18	In a way, I think that's part of why I've tried to be active here.\n\nI'm by no means all-seeing and all-knowing, but I've dealt with most of the struggles of being an INFP in youth. The feeling of disconnect from other people, wanting to share deep interests and finding others don't care as much, feeling like an outsider/alien on your own planet. At my most depressed, I fell into some of the more dark INFP stereotypes like drug/alcohol abuse and suicidal ideation.\n\nMy life isn't perfect, but I'm still alive. I honestly can't believe I'm still alive sometimes. I made it through times I didn't think I could possibly go on and I've managed to find my happiness in the face of some of those dark emotions. If I could pass that on here, even to one person who feels alone and depressed, it would all be worth it.
7	I get happy from my connections with people. I think it is sad a lot of the time. Like society is a constant overcast day, but sometimes I talk to someone and see a level of trust appear and it's like a break of sunlight. That even in this age of information and detachment, people can find humanity and connect with each other, if only briefly. 
7	I think you caught r/infp in the middle of valentines day/season and winter. Lots of sad vibes. heh..\n\nIt's eerie though, right? I mean we're far from being a monolithic/hive mind, but we can relate to a lot of things. But there are some unique experiences and feelings in there too.\n\nI also wish it was easier for us to find and meet each other.
5	I'm not INFP, yet I do relate to a lot here. This is the most comfortable subreddit I've been to.\n\nJust what seems to be the case for me. These are the things which are hard to express to others. Like, there's a different expectation and things which were allowed as a social norm.
2	It's sad, but I also find it comforting. We all go through shit, we have our own insecurities and troubles, but it's nice to read some of them and know that I am not alone. It reminds me of this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14)
1	I find that it‚Äôs comforting to know that we‚Äôre not alone in what we are going through and feeling.  It makes me feel a bit less sad actually. Or like a happy sad lol 
1	Don't hate me for this, but I do believe that we INFPs have this need to be sad. Like, even when everything is fine, I always feel some sort of melancholy, and to be quite honest, I'm addicted to the feeling. And I'm sure all of us are sort of attracted to sad things. 
17	Was feeling bad about something in me yesterday night, so I drew this digital painting using my iPad (it‚Äôs my first drawing ever). What do you see?	
10	It‚Äôs a giant tornado arm with paws. 
4	It's a tornado that decided to be friendly instead of destructive. Howdy doodly neighbor!
4	At first I saw a fish, then I saw an arm coming out of a triangle/tornado. I like the blues and greens
5	My first thought was an angel underwater. Maybe it‚Äôs an expression of some part of you that may need to reach the surface. 
4	A person disintegrating/morphing/getting sucked into a tornado during a pleasant day in a trance-like state.\n\nHope you‚Äôre feeling better, OP. \n\n
3	It‚Äôs a lady in a dress falling in water on a sunny day
2	It looks like something out of Moana. An arm reaching up from the ocean to lift you back up to face your destiny. 
2	Baby arm tornado!
1	A tornado
1	Plastic waste in the oceans :(
1	I see a hand on something big, like a giant or something.
9	Any INFP in a serious relationship? Who do you think compliments ‚Äúour‚Äù personality well?	I‚Äôve been in a two and a half year relationship with a INTJ/ENTJ. We‚Äôre complete opposites. He‚Äôs very logical and thinks in numbers, meanwhile I think in feelings and sometimes it‚Äôs hard to communicate. I‚Äôm a Pisces and he‚Äôs a Virgo which are also complete opposites but can be a good match. Overall it‚Äôs a happy relationship.\n\nI‚Äôve been browsing this thread and I‚Äôve seen so many sad and lonely posts. I want to talk about INFPs in relationships. \n
7	All depends on what kind of INFP you are. There is defnitely a trend, for example ESTPxINFP is a pretty rare combo and rarely a satisfying one. Personally, I feel like I'm made for ENFPs. Not the full extraverted, overhyped Ne ones (Though I feel most comfortable being around those as friends) but rather the more ambiverted, cuter and chill (at least most of the time) ones.\n\nI've often read about well working INFPxINFJ, INFPxESTJ, INFPxINTJ, INFPxENTJ, also sometimes INFPxENFJ.
4	23f INFP and 23M ISTJ married for almost 2 years now. I believe we compliment each other very well. I keep his sense of wonder going and he keeps me grounded when I become too wild. ISTJ's can be practical, which I think can be great for us. I also help my husband in the emotions sector, he can be a little stoic, but he says with me he's felt more than he ever has in his life. We still have the normal issues and problems, but I think we are exceptionally happy together and have built a love that will last eternity. 
2	Me: INFP Male. Wife: INTP Female.  We are both rare types quite similar to you and your SO.  We like to learn about our mbti differences and bask in the realization that we xan help each other level out our "lacking" skills in everyday life.  Meaning, If i get to negativley emotive she lines up any and all possible factial reasons I have gotten that way, that helps me get control over my emotions instead of them ruling me.\n  One the other hand she has gone through one major emotional and physically changing event after another:  Narc parents rejection, spine damaging car accident, so iopath boss' negligence, migraine fallout from the first accident, a SECOND car accident, wedding planning, giving away her dog because of the first accident having hurt her to much, rapid weight gain, living in shit apartments with poor management, and now learning her best friend is too toxic to contuinue their friendship.  \n    This is all in the last 3yrs of our lives.  And we have kmown each other for that long.  All of those events gave her a lot of confidence in my emotional intelligence to get through the darkness.  INTPs are known to spiral emotionally and she always tells me and others she could not have ever done it without me.  We now have a house in a nice quiet neighborhood, two medium dogs and two cats.\n   I am sayimg all this not to brag but to boast that I am a big fan now and glad you have someone so opposite lol.  I can only speak from personal experience but I recommend looking at the ironies in your relationship if you havemt already.  Where things go dark INFP can turn on the light (we dwell in dark, the damn dwarves we are) good luck to you\n\nAlso side note:  the wife andbnb I enjoy videos on youtube by a group called "the school of life"  they discuss many differences btween behavior types, philosophies, and interpersonal and romantic relationships.  Its excellent and really helped us "decode"  each others actions during harder moments like arguments and such.  And learn where we can shine in the relationship.  Sorry for over sharing and good luck with your SO!
2	The most perfect man for me is an INFJ. We are alike in all of the ways that matter, and our differences compliment each other. Also, he is silly, smart, confident, with a strong sense of integrity. Love him.
2	[deleted]
2	ENFP has always worked best for me. Very similar to us but more extroverted so brings some excitement. Also I‚Äôve noticed they always notice if I am feeling down/sad/anxious and ask about it so I don‚Äôt have to actually divulge much until they press me about it which I honestly need sometimes
1	INFP married to ESTP (married 4 years and counting). We both super love movies, food, and generally being near each other. I have high anxiety whereas he's very sturdy mentally.    He's like a great haven for me whereas I'm a source of comfort for him.  We're both wicked funny in our own way and play off each other like crazy. I love that about us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTJ & INFP Coffee (YouTube channel) has done a few relationship videos and one mentioned that SP types seem to be pretty chill with their partner "being themselves" (which is awesome for any Fi dom, tbh) whereas an FP type will accept you as you are. 100% true in my experience. Both types seem pretty dang chill. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I ask my husband what he DOESN'T want in a partner and/or what ended his past relationships, he says he can't stand people who are "stuck up" and/or people who expect everyone to do their bidding or for others to change for them. That would bother me as well. He also mentions how much he hates "fake af" people all the time and I am 100% in agreeance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently ESTP-INFP is pretty common, actually. Just depends on who you ask. ESTPs are often ambiverted based on their functions, so unlike an extremely extroverted person, they're often chill staying at home or going out. Just depends!
1	I am female infp dating male entp. i feel like we have this deep understanding that we don‚Äôt have to talk about. we just connect, share beliefs. i love that he is also really into learning, that he teaches me about things i know i feel already (politics and history for example). however i know we struggle with our introversion and extroversion. i used to be able to bro out with his friends and i loved that i could share his friends since i struggle at making friends on my own. however, when drama would come up with his friends, he would rather ignore it and forgive them even though it was hurting me and causing issues. i think he just needs to be liked by everyone but when someone causes drama, without apology and with obvious intent to hurt me, i cut them off!! it‚Äôs something we‚Äôre navigating still... and communication isn‚Äôt great. i am an extremely good communicator within a relationship, and he‚Äôs not.
1	What would your spirit animal be?	I have just read the "his dark materials" trilogy and now I can't stop thinking about the ide of spirit animals and what mine would be, it would probably be a bird maybe a sparrow or something similar
3	Cat, fox or raven. 
2	Dolphin
2	Golden Retriever
2	A hedgehog ü¶î
2	Short-sighted owl. 
2	My dad told me to be more like a lion when I was little. Courageous, confident, and always lead by example. It really stook with me. But most realistically, I'm a sloth üòÇlol
32	Is anyone else an expert at being weird and really bad at being normal?	Because I am.
6	I‚Äôm an expert at being a weirdo, but I‚Äôm pretty good at being normal if it‚Äôs really necessary for the situation.
3	me....  v.v/
3	weird > npc robot\n\nany day of the week.
3	Meh, weird is relative to the individual, like I find it weird some people don't brush their teeth while they shower, but apparently that's not "normal". But to answer you question relative to society, yeah, yeah I am, and I wouldn't change a thing about it
2	Absolutely.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I thought I passed for normal but I think the people around me have just accepted who I am 
2	Eh, not such a cool thing when you're trying to make new friends though. 
2	Weird yes, I have just developed a really convincing ‚Äúnormal‚Äô mask when dealing with the humans.
2	Yes. But whatever I love it, even if I leave two minute awkward messages and cry over inscription in my kid‚Äôs copy of Goodnight Moon. Weird>normal.
2	He'll yes I am so much just way way motorcycles better. Any other ones like to yuck up they're gramma and word spelling when talking just so it sound more fun?
2	Ay
1	Has Anyone Taken the Personality Hacker "Genius" Quiz?	I scored INTJ on that. As did my supposedly INFJ friend. Y'all?\n\n[https://personalityhacker.com/genius-personality-test/](https://personalityhacker.com/genius-personality-test/)\n\nIt was strange given most of my answers seemed to be more Feeler-based...she said something similar. 
1	I just took it and got INFP
1	Also took and got INFP!
1	I got INFP yayyy
27	found r/infp for the first time today!	It gives me some sort of relief to know that there are others that feel this way!! Although this isn‚Äôt an excuse for all the relationships i‚Äôve left to die i find comfort reading from all of u üíïüíïüíï
3	Welcome home friend! :)
1	hi im glad you found us
1	Welcome home! It's nice to know you're not alone in your weirdness, right??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that your "infp"-ness is not a prison, it is a home you tend to return to. But it's also a home you are in charge of, and you can make yourself a beautiful, comfortable and functional home if you put in the time and effort, and ask help. And when life demands it, it's a place you can leave for a while and venture out of.
1	hullo\n\nyoure not alone...
1	New'ish here too, it's so great. Welcome! Did you recently discover the MBTI too and your INFP type also?
27	Anyone ever see the movie, "Her"? Its seriously so underrated! I don't know why nobody seems to be talking about it. Its literally a masterpiece!	
6	I love that movie! 
2	I've seen it once and decided to never watch it again. Loved the show but I think the more I watch that, the more I would like to have an AI inside my ear, having meaningful conversations and a great time.
2	Whenever I see a guy with his phone in his breast pocket I think of _Her_. 
1	A beautiful piece of film. Spike jonze and Joaquin Phoenix are such a great duo together. 
1	Great movie!
4	Friends and Connections	I'm not sure if this is an infp thing or more of a personal thing, but I often think about how people view others and friendships. I don't have many people I consider friends but rather acquaintances. And even of my friends sometimes it feels difficult finding a deep connection to them. The other day I was thinking about friends I had many years ago (who I had lost touch with) and was wondering whether people could still be friends if neither party makes any effort to connect.\n\nI was thinking about how lots of  people (including me for a while) had followers on social media who they knew of but didn't contact outside of social media. To some degree, I kept thinking about how others considered people they didn't contact as friends. What are all of your opinions on the subject?\n\nPersonally I only ever considered someone a friend if the two of us remained in contact which I felt was meaningful. I guess I viewed everyone else as acquaintances on the basis that we didn't have any connection to stay into each other's lives. Thoughts?
2	Probably more of a personal thing. Some years back I thought quite like you, that friends had to remain in constant contact and share a "deep bond", eg sharing lots of personal details or feelings.\n\n>And even of my friends sometimes it feels difficult finding a deep connection to them. \n\nBut exactly how deep of a connection do we need in order for people to be deemed as a friend? How do we know what is deep enough? What if someone made the effort to share something with us which in the process, caused them trouble (for example, by describing an experience and their thoughts on it), and we looked past that, because we underestimated how much effort it took for that person to share it with us, and thought that it wasn't meaningful?\n\nRather than prioritising "deep" connections, personally I now try to focus on the effort that both parties are willing to put into maintaining the friendship. After all, maintaining relations between people is really like growing a plant. It needs care and thought.\n\n>was wondering whether people could still be friends if neither party makes any effort to connect \n\nAfter all that, I do sometimes wonder the same thing. It's probably natural to do so. I guess this depends on the situation - are one or both parties truly not making the effort to connect? Or are one (or both) parties too occupied/busy with life (out of necessity)? Are they in a position to connect/converse with others? Something like social anxiety would hinder that.\n\nBut if neither party wants to connect anymore I guess there is no more friendship between them. Perhaps not permanently though. My thoughts are that the friendship might still form again if they start putting in effort to maintain it.
2	I feel like I need consistency in my friendships!\n\nTo me, people who just check in to be my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù when it‚Äôs convenient to them is fake! \nI had a friend who always talked badly about a friend of hers that she had known longer than me. She would tell me she just used her when she was bored or needed something from her. Said it looked good on social media, would use her to make other connections, knew this girl was the type to give christmas presents... etc. it was so fake to me! i disliked it a lot but our friendship seemed genuine, we hung out all the time. for a few months... i noticed she started treating me like that other friend and i told her i wouldn‚Äôt continue a fake friendship like that. \n\nI like to keep my circle small. I don‚Äôt like to call upon random people when I haven‚Äôt seen them in months. It just seems fake to me. I wonder if I‚Äôd be less lonely, but I think the disconnect would feel obvious and I would feel lonely with people, which is uncomfortable. And that‚Äôs how my ex-friend said she felt, she was ENFP. she said she would get lonely or bored and call upon her fake friends and be reminded why she doesn‚Äôt hang with them until a month or two passes and the cycle repeats 
3	infp and being a promoter in retail	So I'm an infp and I ended up as a toy promoter at a toys r us (they still exist in my country) as a temp job. I'm 16 and it's actually my first job.\n\n I spent quite a while being anxious about all the human contact, but I turns out that I actually like the job! \n\nI don't mean to sound conceited, because I understand a lot of us have social anxiety and such a job would be an awful idea, but even though I stuttered quite a lot on my first few days, I ended up being able to function properly. \n\nMaybe it's something about making children happy by demonstrating the toy, or just striving to make people happy in what little way that I can by running a little booth, but I ended up not despising the job :D\n\nSo I realised my social battery only truly starts running low when talking for long periods with friends or acquaintances,  but not with a long string of strangers buying toys. Huh. 
2	[deleted]
2	For me, it wouldn't necessarily be a problem about some kind of anxiety but rather the promoting itself. My outward impression is very cold and rather closed off and not inviting. Voice very dry, unmotivating and monotone without much change in pitch, literally no one would by a product from me.\n\nI admire people who are able to have such "moving" personas because I definitely don't.
2	That is cool! My first job was at an amusement park, and I liked it too. There was something special about making people happy. Keep up the good work. You learn a lot about yourself from your career.
28	Does anyone else feel extremely down, sad and guilty after an argument?	Even if I was in the right. Even if it was with a stranger fighting always makes me feel bad after it‚Äôs gone. Does anyone else feel like this?
9	[deleted]
5	You crushed another soul over something ephemeral. Hugs sibling. 
3	Absolutely\n\n&#x200B;
3	Having an argument with my bf right now. I said something that was slightly hurtful. And now I feel extremely down and guilty. Like he‚Äôs better off without me and we might as well just break up because I‚Äôm not perfect and I can‚Äôt ever be perfect. I know no one is but it doesn‚Äôt stop me from trying to be perfect, so every time there‚Äôs conflict that breaks that illusion of perfection, my spirit is crushed. 
2	Yup.
2	Yes, absolutely. For me, arguing is SO draining. I over think everything that happened. I strongly dislike conflict and dealing with it. I‚Äôm scared to hurt the other person and I‚Äôm scared of what they‚Äôre thinking during/after. The argument stays on loop in my mind for hours, and sometimes days after. What could gone differently? What should I have included? What should I have left out? It definitely makes me upset no matter what the result is and it‚Äôs one of those (many many) times where I can‚Äôt figure out how to turn my brain off after. 
2	Something. Not if I was right, then I‚Äôm just annoyed 
2	When I'm involved in an argument, even if the "argument" consists of speaking up for myself, I notice a huge adrenaline rush. My heart pounds. My face flushes. I could lift a bus off someone or knock them into oblivion, depending on the situation. The effects can last for a couple of hours afterward. \n\nIs it possible that the feelings of depression you mention are simply the result of depleting your stress hormones during an argument? We INFPs really don't like confrontation. If we've been traumatized in the past, we like confrontation even less.\n\nLike other INFPs, I continue to have arguments in my head for days/weeks/months/years afterward, just to see if I should have said something differently (l'esprit d'escalier, for sure!). It's like I want to go over things so many times that I'll produce the best possible comeback during my next episode of verbal sparring. It hasn't worked thus far, but I remain hopeful.
2	Yes. Just had an arguement with a close friend of mine after she had hurt me numerous times. Even though I was right, I kinda feel sadder than what I've felt before I had the arguement with her.
1	Yes.
9	I thought I was the only one who wrote poems to deal with my thoughts. Wrote this one while I was taking a prayer walk.	Within the gravel, trees and stars, I catch a glimpse of all that you are \nThe creator of every nation is the author of my salvation \nSo everyday I pray that someday you‚Äôll pave the way \nEven when there‚Äôs no light in sight, somehow you give me the will to fight \n\nWhatever it is you sent me to do\nSend it hastily so I may come home to you \nI don‚Äôt understand why you need me to stay \nWhen I could just drop dead today \nThis world is just so fucked up\nAnd I‚Äôm just a pup \n\nYou say you need me \nBut for what reason, I can‚Äôt see\nWhen I think of how far we‚Äôve fallen I can hardly choke out a sentence \nWhen all I want is to spend eternity in your presence \n\nI‚Äôve just had enough of being alive \nBy your side I finally want to arrive\n
2	keep at it!
10	Always in my head	I‚Äôve always done this thing where I‚Äôll make up the perfect girl in my head then apply that mental girl to someone I know. I always disappoint myself when I realize that she‚Äôs not the girl in my head. \nBecause of this I‚Äôve recently been trying to see people for who they are, rather than who I want them to be. I‚Äôve been talking to a really sweet girl recently who seems to care for me a lot but I can‚Äôt tell if she just wants to be friends or if I should make a move. \nShe‚Äôs beautiful and really cool but I‚Äôve found myself starting to do the whole ‚Äúhypothetical girl‚Äù thing to her and I don‚Äôt want to fall into that trap again.\nThe question I have is should I just appreciate her as a cool friend or should I nut up and tell her that I have feelings for her? (We both go to college together but she‚Äôs a senior and I‚Äôm a sophomore) 
3	A funny thing: Some ENFPs have this problem of naturally emitting vibes of caring, authenticity and depth to everyone around them. It's kinda funny that they struggle with coming off as super flirty or super compatible. But if anyone's prone to be receptive of that kind of energy, it's an INFP. If that's her, and that's you, it'll be funny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, don't get caught up in what-ifs. Use your self-awareness and tact. Ask her out.\n\nJust remember. You have immense talents in imagination and ideals. But in knowing people, be concrete. Don't assume random things. That tends to sour relationships, or scare you into inaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbtw, check back with us if you did it! We're rooting for you.
46	Infp and sarcasm	Any infps out there who are also sarcastic af?
30	I learned my sarcastic dry wit from my mother. As a result, no one can tell when I'm joking. 
27	No one can tell when im joking. And i just find it funny when they cant tell and i keep going and going until they think im crazy. So many people out there think i believe the earth is flat.
15	Me? Sarcastic? \n\n*Never*.
12	Canadian and hung out with a big group of people and we were talking about pets, and someone made a joke like who has a pet beaver and I deadpanned Yeah I have 2! And half the group believed me smh you gotta ease new people into it LOL.\n\nAnd no having beaver pets in Canada is not normal. No one has beaver pets.
11	I've spent years perfecting a deadpan delivery.
3	Me! 
3	i think i learned a lot of my sarcasm from the 90s Spider-Man cartoon.  my favourite bit while he was fighting a bad guy named Tombstone:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\[Spider-Man\] ::dodges attacks by bouncing off walls and ceiling::\n\n\[Tombstone\] come down here!  AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN!\n\n\[Spider-Man\] i don't suppose i could convince you to come up here... and fight like a spider?\n\n&#x200B;
3	Depends on the crowd.
2	I‚Äôm not sarcastic often, but when I am, it means someone has seriously angered me.
2	Me 100%
2	I am rarely sarcastic. Maybe once or twice a year I will be sarcastic. It is just not in my nature. I also am not a fan of sarcasm. I wish people just said how they really felt. That is just me though. I know people like being sarcastic, but personally I would prefer if people could just speak honestly.
823	Me_IRL	
117	Ouch this hit a LITTLE to close to home
96	If someone is being really nice to me and I find them attractive I basically fall in love with them. If someone is hitting on me and I find them attractive I convince myself they're just being nice. Either way I do nothing and the cycle continues until the end of time.
76	Happened to me today... we now have two children, live somewhere sunny and have a huge yard in surrounding our medium sized house.
42	Oh wow, I'm relieved this isn't just me. I have a crush on literally every moderately attractive girl that is nice to me, and I feel like it's kind of a problem.
25	This is hilarious because it's definitely something I think about but don't ever admit. Then I worry about being too attached etc.
27	this image just ripped out my spinal cord and threw me into a wall
28	My mission as an INFP: To be friends first and foremost before being lovers with my next partner.\n\nThis IS possible being an INFP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nright? \n
10	This was me, now everyone I meet I go - this person prolly ain't the love of my life
9	This is such a pain in the ass.\n\nCan't bloody help it, then have to keep telling myself, no, its not like that!\nbut a wee feeling at the back of my head wont believe me.\nthen we stop talking after a few days and im sad.\n\ndamn.
9	Then sometime into the conversation they name drop their boyfriend or husband.
8	We are all Joel from Eternal Sunshine. 
7	I wish this didn't hit so close to home, lol

3	Yeah this is me...
3	Lol so true
3	I was recently surprised i wasnt in love with one girl who was very nice to me and even went in our talks towards the relationship. Even more surprising that we really clicked,or so I thought.\n\nThen she told me she is not ready for a relationship and from that lovely vulnerable person that writes me all day she basically behaved like I am bothering her and im super annoying by just saying hi and wanting to talk, like a friend.\n\nINFPs are alright. Other people can be weirdos tho. ^^
2	True.
2	We are all Joel from Eternal Sunshine. 
1	üòÇüòÇüòÇ for reals
1	I feel this too much
1	Omfg I-
1	stop shamelessly calling me out like that ._.
1	Ugh, this is me. Friend crushes are real. Somehow I managed to have realistic expectations of people back when I was dating. But making friends? I have no brakes.
1	Oh my God MEEEEE ü§£
1	This happened to me today xD
1	Oof. Ouch that's my heart\n\nA bit unrelated. Recently, I've been trying to befriend this person. So like i really tried to be nice and forward despite my social anxiety (all of the interactions were online). But I only get short, polite one-liners. I knoe i should just move on but it stings, you know?
1	And this is why you think friendzoned is a thing. 
1	I like to say "be nice to me at your own risk."
1	When the barista is really nice to you
1	lmao bianca wherever u are haha
1	üê§
-4	Shut the fuck up with this self-deprecation shit. 
16	I feel very awkward in social situations sometimes, and other times I‚Äôm really confident in my social abilities.	I feel like the awkwardness is really just in my head, and even if I do come off awkward I‚Äôve been told my awkwardness is ‚Äúcharming‚Äù. I started a new job last month and these people are nothing like me but I feel like I can adapt to fit in with any crowd. Does anyone relate? \n\nIt takes me a little while to adapt but once I do people seem to take to me\n\nI hope this doesn‚Äôt sound super conceited lol. I really do feel like an outcast a lot of the time but people‚Äôs actions and the way they act toward me makes me think otherwise

2	I wish my awkwardness was charming\n\ninstead it makes people uncomfortable 
1	It used to be the same for me and I didn't know why I would get up and down like this, turn out i'm very sensitive to lack of sleep and hunger, both make me anxious therefore awkward. Idk if it can help you but it would have helped me and saved me a lot of time so maybe try to notice if it's the same for you 
3	Song suggestions? Something that makes me feel transcendent.

2	Love this song and video. Listened the other day.   
2	Really like this, it's the first time I've actually like any music/video suggestion on here üòâ
6	An interesting and unusual person	If you have seen my last post I‚Äôm talking about the same girl here. \nI‚Äôm sure you guys know how I feel when I say that I don‚Äôt like talking about my thoughts and feelings, the only person I talk to about those things are my brother. But a few days ago after a session of DnD I found myself alone with a really cool friend of mine while we were studying for a Greek test. I don‚Äôt remember exactly how it happened but I just found myself opening up to her a lot, with the things I‚Äôve only told my brother about. And she did the same for me.\nI have never felt so welcomed to open up to someone like that before and it was honestly really nice. \nI was wondering if any of you have ever just found someone that is easy to open up to like that before. She is the first person I‚Äôve ever met that has made me feel that way and I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot since it happened.
3	That's awesome. It is always a breath of fresh air to share your authentic self with someone and receive the same. You're taking Greek? Guessing by your username, are you studying at a Christian college?
13	A poem I wrote!	I love\nWith my whole heart \nI feel \nWith every inch of my being \nPouring my soul into bottles and handing it out like free samples\n\nalone \nCraving the affection I so readily give \nSurrounded by the gleeful masks of my peers\nFilling me with empty praise \nClaiming to care \n\nBut I know \nIf I were to spill the colors of my soul \nAnd paint the pictures in my mind\nIf I were to rip my beating heart from my chest \nAnd hand them me, in my entirety \nThey would run\n\nPomegranate red \nFor the heat that fills my cheeks when I pronounce a word wrong \nMidnight blue \nFor the deep sadness that resides in the darkest corners of my heart \nSunflower yellow \nFor when your laugh so hard your stomach cramps and you have to remind yourself to \nBreathe \n\nI have to remind myself to breathe \nThe world is spinning 1000 miles a minute \nAnd I‚Äôm running \nFighting my way to catch up\nDesperate not to be left behind \nCollecting souvenirs along the way \nonly stopping to take pictures \n\nstop \nAppreciate this moment for what is worth \nA garden of flowers grows in my veins \nThat I can‚Äôt seem to remember to water \nI live in the clouds\nTrapped between reality and a dream\nPushing \nWanting \nNeeding\nto set my feet back on the ground \n
3	I‚Äôve always enjoyed writing and reading poetry. That was beautiful my friend 
1	Any title suggestions???
15	Valentine's day really fucked me up this year. Tremendously sad.	I don't know where to start, and I don't want this to be a pity party or anything but ... I'm just so goddamn sick of this.  I'm sick of it being shoved down our throats, and having to deal with being alone on that day.  \n\n\nThere's no reason I'm not, or wouldn't be, good enough for a woman.  But I knew this would be hard, I knew what I was signing up for.  I knew that if I did college later in life, after serving in the military, that I'd be a 25+ year old undergrad... Approaching 30... And I've hardly accomplished anything at all.  Most people my age already have careers and *children* by now.  I feel like I've been left behind.  I feel like a failure.  I *am* a failure.  \n\n\nBut I have good qualities.  I'm tall... And nurturing, and caring, and quiet and I listen and I'm really, really passionate... If I'm with the right woman.  But every single time I've been able to open up, I end up scaring them away.  They learn I'm fucked up, and I've got some weird opinions about the world, and I'm not gonna apologize for that.  \n\n\nEvery potential girl I meet here is incompatible for the basic major reason that they're just not in the same stage of life as me... And if they are, then they're looking for a guy who can provide, and that's not me, not yet, because I'm still a student, just like them.  It's a catch 22. \n\n\nSo it feels like I don't deserve it.  I don't deserve happiness.  Like... Somehow I've spited the universe and I'm cursed and no matter what I do my efforts won't ever pan out.  I'll continuously get rejected over and over, growing older... Growing more and more bitter with life.  \n\n\nThere's a post over on r/wow right now about a guy who's Valentine's present from his gf was a frame portrait of their wow characters doing a selfie.  That's awesome.  That's the kind of thing that lets you know its real.  That's what I want, damnit, and why couldn't that be me?  I want to be able to be close enough to someone so that I can actually open up to them and share with them my passions and hobbies, like that.  And them to me.  \n\n\nWhen you've been alone this long, you really start to believe there's something fundamentally wrong with you.  And there very well might be.  But I don't know what it is.
6	I‚Äôve been to hell and back so many times in my life, I‚Äôm 29 years old and can‚Äôt tell you how many times I thought there was no coming back for me, in every way. I‚Äôve felt the deepest of depression, the worst of hopelessness and self hatred, etc etc. all you have to do is do what makes you happy. That‚Äôs it. Do what makes you happy and what you need to do to survive as a human in this world. The rest will come, you‚Äôre overthinking it (as I do with everything as well). Just be you, be happy and do your best to do better every day whatever that might mean. I‚Äôm single also, with no kids and no plans to change that and I‚Äôm happy! You can be too : )
3	>Most people my age already have careers and children by now. I feel like I've been left behind. I feel like a failure. I am a failure.\n\nBro I relate to this so much and I‚Äôm about to hit 30. You should be happy you‚Äôre around people you can date. I‚Äôm out of college and the only women I meet are at work who are already married and with kids. You should be able to find someone in college you can relate to even if they are a bit younger. Don‚Äôt worry bro you‚Äôre not a failure, you still have a chance unlike me. Just do you, live an awesome life, and some lucky girl will see that and would want to be part of your awesome life.
3	> I feel like I've been left behind. I feel like a failure. I *am* a failure. \n\nYou are not. You are tricking yourself. Do you know how many people there are (myself included) that thought that by the age of 30 we'd have a house/flat, a partner and a good job? Then life happens, it's a good dream but don't compare yourself to those few that have it or beat yourself that you don't. \n\nYou've been in the military and you're older, you at least have some rough idea what you want out of this life. You're taking steps. You've recognized that there is something is bothering you. That's commendable. \n\nLetting go of things isn't easy, I'm not saying you're not going to meet someone, just that the more focus and work you invest the more bitter you'll become if you don't reach that goal. Do the next thing possible that you can think of and try to enjoy what's been given to you, even if it all seems like a joke.
2	Hey man sorry to hear you feel so down. Although I feel for you as I too have felt the same way, you must realize that this whole ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too old‚Äù thing feeling in your head is completely not true. Sooo many people go to do such wonderful things at 30. Ex: Peter Thiel help found PayPal at 31 sometime after he realized he did not enjoy law. You‚Äôll find a girl man, you just need to try to be more of an extrovert. Put yourself in uncomfortable positions and situations, learn to grow from it. Much love to you my man. 
2	As someone who followed your basic trajectory - military, then college, and who also felt my 20's flying by with no way to put the brakes on, I have been in your shoes. Probably more so than others as a fellow INFP. But as a 47 year old now, who did get married and started a family at 28, I can tell you in retrospect, the notion of the 20's or 30's as being 'late' in terms of marriage is completely a mental construct and, well, a bit laughable. And I don't mean to minimize how you feel one bit. I've been there. The feelings of inadequacy, etc. I would just suggest being patient, there are actually benefits to waiting. I wish I might have waited a few years to be honest. But just hear me now and believe me later, you have loads and loads of time. You should not be fretting over this, whatsoever. I understand you, believe me, but I would take a deep breath, pour a nice beer and exhale. You're good mate. 
2	I‚Äôm 45 and still single.  You have time bro.  It‚Äôs hard to find someone.  Focue on your own happiness first.  And one lesson I‚Äôve learned is to not fall in love too quick.  That scares women.  Don‚Äôt let your heart get involved too quickly.  Keep in light for awhilw until you get to know them.  That‚Äôs my new way of doing things after falling in love too quick and screwing it up over and over again.  Painful lessons are good as long as we learn from them.\n\nGood luck.
2	You sound intelligent hardworking passionate - all good things.  Failure is a state of mind. Hope and openness is a state of mind. You‚Äôre bummed, I get that, triggered by V day. Keep on working toward your goals/dreams, keep on living your life, and you will find that person w whom you want to share your life. It‚Äôs almost impossible for me to believe this won‚Äôt happen for you. \n\nPs I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre from, regionally, but late 20s is not too old! 
15	The sky makes me happy every time... I filmed this like a month ago, but I decided to share it here. Hope you like it!	
2	Wow I love this! Its like the dark taking over or something, but beautifully so üåÑ
102	Treat for your eyes, fellow dreamers!	
2	Gorgeous
2	Wow.
26	How much time do you send listening to music on a daily?	I ran into this survey on 16personalities.com that us, infp, spend the most time listening to music compared to any other personality type. This came to a surprise to me! This made me realize how much music I listen to. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by without me listening to music. I spent about 3/4 hours average, excluding the days I can go from morning to night non-stop in my little world jamming. \n\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/articles/music-preferences-by-personality-type
3	If I‚Äôm not working on something that requires my full attention like homework, always always always. \n\nWhen I‚Äôm cooking, showering, driving to/from work, before the store I work at opens I use headphones, and also when I‚Äôm making music! My life revolves heavily around it.
3	Can you share the survey? This is the second time someone has mentioned this today. \n\nI would guess I am at least 4 hours/day. \n\nLet‚Äôs see...\n\nWeekdays:\n\n-Some mornings while I get ready for work - ~30 mins\n-My commute to and from work (if solo) ~ 1.5-2 hours\n-At least 2 hours while at work. \n-If I am home in the evenings, depending on what I am doing, another ~1-2 hours. \n\nWeekends:\n\nIf I am home all day, I could have music going from breakfast into the evening. \n\nChecks out. 
3	That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs actually essential to our happiness that we learn to play instruments. I feel so much better when I make music
3	Does anyone else notice how listening to music triggers a lot of those fantasy situations/daydreaming that we commonly get into?
2	Listening to music while in the car is probably the closest thing there is to heaven on earth.
2	Too much lol.\n\nI‚Äôve picked up freestyling and painting as little creative hobbies to flex the brain out a bit, and love them so I can see the guy who commented we need to get into music being correct.\n\nIt‚Äôs also turned my closed eye visuals I get on weed into WAY more artistic landscapes that I find myself going a lot more just into my mind for a decent amount of time w some good music. So I feel like that‚Äôs proof it‚Äôs literally improved the artistic part of my brain.\n\nAnd yeah, my car is my happy spot as well. Probably prefer being in it solo over with people, just a 1 man concert.
2	\~2-3 hours during the day, and a compulsory 1-2 hours in bed to unwind ...
2	Any time I don‚Äôt have to talk to someone I have my headphones in, and even then I might keep one ear tuned to music during a conversation. What can I say, music is my vice
4	Idk probably 30 minutes to an hour.  
1	All the time. showering, walking to class, while I‚Äôm working, while I play video games, I‚Äôll even just jam out alone in my room before my roommate gets back from class. 
1	Does it include the soundtrack currently in my head?
1	Lmao yooo the same thing happens to me except with like listening to nostalgic music or reading something that triggers those kinds of feelings
1	I can spend hours listening to music! I also play guitar so I‚Äôll spend another couple hours practicing. Probably average about 4 hours a day easily. 
5	What this INFP guy creates when he has no one to express his love to	
11	Anyone else find a lot of comfort in going out to eat by yourself?	I‚Äôm a very social person. I have friends and make friends easily. But I also feel like I am wired for alone time. I feel like the social side of me is forced and I just happen to be very good at it. My favorite thing to do is go out to have a beer/eat food by myself and play on Reddit or listen to a podcast. I‚Äôm interested in how many INFP‚Äôs feel the same!!
5	I hate eating out alone, it just feels weird for me. BUT I do love eating alone at home, like in my room instead of with my roommate or others in the kitchen. Idk why, I just love eating alone at home. 
2	Yess parks, movies too I've done all kinds of things alone. 
2	Begone, social person! You don't belong here!\n\njk\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm lucky to live somewhere where eating out isn't awfully expensive. So I've been doing that, and more often these days. I save a lot of articles in Pocket and I use the opportunity to catch up on my reading list, but also just enjoy whatever view there is.\n\nI get too absorbed by reddit so I try not open the app when I'm out and about. It sorta ruins the "eating out" experience for me; Like it ends up feeling like "I'm in reddit", rather than "I'm enjoying going out".
2	I do this all the time at coffee shops! It‚Äôs such a great place to be alone but also around people. I can get so productive or just content in the environment. Usually people leave me alone at coffee shops. \n\nI don‚Äôt usually eat at restaurants alone. I‚Äôll get the food to go and eat it in my car so I can‚Äôt listen to my music or audiobook and avoid people trying to talk to me.\n\nI really enjoy just walking around art museums, neighborhood trails, malls, and small towns. It‚Äôs meditative. BUT, being a female, I‚Äôm terrified of being attacked or hit on so I really have to be in a place I trust. I wouldn‚Äôt feel safe walking around downtown by myself. And I wouldn‚Äôt want to walk around a murder trail by myself. Idk, sometimes I listen to true crime podcasts while walking so that probably doesn‚Äôt help my anxiety. 
2	When I lived in SF I went out to eat by myself a lot. :) I like it because you can go whenever you want and you don't have to compromise with someone in what they are in the mood for. I also like going to the movies by myself. I feel like a day I just do whatever I want is a perfect day. I have a saying I like to say when people ask me if I have any plans for the day. I will say, "The day is my oyster." They usually don't know what I mean but to me it means I will do whatever I want. I have the freedom to do so. :)
1	I‚Äôm literally doing that right now. I just saw movie, ate at a restaurant, now I‚Äôm at a coffee shop all by myself. I don‚Äôt technically need to be around people to socialize, I have reddit where I can talk to real people without having to actually be with them.
1	And here I thought that "being more open" was weird! Same! It's nice to see people react to the way I treat them and socialize with them, but it's just too much some times. \n\nI'd then prefer to sit in a corner and stare into the abyss, you know? Write up some short story about people or feel the breeze while watching the sunset, sort of thing. 
1	Like it expect when my paranoia that people will see me as a freaky loner hits 
1	I love doing this! 
1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 16	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
2	I love that I love to create and all but I always get disappointed because what I create is meaningless. Even as an emotional dump, all my art does is exist in stasis in my memory. If it's all I can do and it's meaningless, reality is telling me it wants me to do something else. Gain a new skill and keep gaining skills I like until I find one that it can reward me with. So far, nothing. No mastery, no desirable traits, no resources, just energy going nowhere and walls of people I can't break down.
11	I wish people could understand why I cut them off	I do love my friends a lot but sometimes I feel worthless. I feel like redeeming before talking to them. Anyone else?
1	Yeah that feeling of not being worthy enough to have friends is a constant struggle for me. And then when I retreat from them for long stretches of time they get hurt and think they did something or I got bored of them. It's a never ending loop.
1	Maybe tell them that you need some alone time. I do that. They get hurt, so I sprinkle in some love and reassurance while on break from them. Not always guaranteed to work tho ._.
1	I don‚Äôt really have any consistent ‚Äúfriends‚Äù because I‚Äôm so horrible at constantly putting myself into the loop of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worthless‚Äù or ‚Äúnobody wants me around‚Äù and I shut everyone out. definitely one of my worst qualities 
30	Mood right now	
9	Sports, Athletic INFPS	What up infps...\n\nWhat sports and athletics do you enjoy doing and/or watching? 
3	Yoga, hiking, and despite being pretty atrocious, tennis
2	Swimming is my all-time fave. When I had a lot of time, I swam about 40 minutes a day. Also like yoga and rock climbing.
2	Soccer, volleyball, running 
2	I'm big into olympic weightlifting (snatch & clean + jerk) and on occasion, I dabble in either Bikram or Ashtanga yoga. But seriously though, weightlifting is life.
2	I used to play volleyball a lot, but college got in the way. I would definitely love to get back into it when i have the time. I also enjoy yoga sometimes, but that‚Äôs about it.
2	Running, basketball, volleyball, table tennis and badminton. I like to do try everything. Would love to try rock climbing next.\n
2	It's been decades now, but I used to like running cross-country. I didn't care about winning at all though.
2	Running, biking, weightlifting, hockey, volleyball, racquetball,  tennis.\n\nI don't particularly watch many sports.  I prefer to play them.   I enjoy friendly competition between like minded people.   Many a competition has been completely and utterly ruined by someone that takes it too seriously or is out to crush their opponent.    I stopped playing hockey for this very reason.  
2	I used to play football and lacrosse. If I was more athletic and my ankles weren't made of paper I would have continued playing lacrosse in college. Really hate the lax bro culture but I love how the sport combines finesse, power, and speed.\n\nI also follow my football team religiously and watch the NHL, NBA, and MLB along with college ball.
2	I love doing running/cross country, but I‚Äôve had to drastically cut down my mileage so my knees don‚Äôt give out by the time I‚Äôm 30.\n\nI love watching football (NFL), even though I‚Äôve never played in a league or on a team before, I know a ton about the game.
2	Love to see me some athletic infps! Yeah im big into yoga, particularly hot yoga. Also basketball is great, I think when you watch the greats play like Kyrie Irving it almost looks like a form of dance. 
37	My friend from work	
2	Your friend seems so free spirited!
713	This is true..	
118	the accuracy hurts my heart
89	I see a lot on here that we are the way we are because we are INFP. This is our default setting. Nothing says that we can't overcome these things too. These are just challenges that we face, and we can find fulfillment in developing the character to overcome weaknesses\n
14	One thing though, I don't like people.
31	One graphic just summed up 40+ years of me as infp!  Dang, I need to print it out & hand out like business cards!  
20	What's this 'loves people' stuff?  
16	This is uncanny. Like, 100% me. Wow.
14	[deleted]
7	yeah, it's funny. I want to be with people and I want to be alone.
5	well, at least i am not the only one... 
5	Hardly contradicting. 
10	Well, damn. 
3	I can confirm! One of the truest picture i've ever seen!
3	The INFP‚Äôs shadow side
3	How funny it is to be both an idealist and a pessimist?\n\nAlso, I think we have low self esteem but high/fragile ego that needs a lot of validation.
3	I found a half assed solution to part of this years ago.....\n\nDoesn‚Äôt wanna drink alone, wants to drink alone in a crowd.\nGoes to hole in the wall sports bar.\nBrings iPad with headphones..\nWatches YouTube and ignores every one in the place.\nSucess..üòè
3	The "loves people" part, I take to mean, when we love someone we really, really love them. Friends, family .. "our" people. But who knows what the person who made this had in mind.
3	I'm confused by so many people disagreeing with  "loves people".  I tend to think of loving people as a natural consequence of the empathy that's so important to being an INFP. For me, I can' help but love people because I can't  help but put myself in their shoes and think about their struggles and their perspectives.   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
5	Define "loves people". 
4	How is this contradictory?
4	This is why I thought most INFPs were also Gemini like myself. Lol 
2	You guys have heatd about "healthy" vs "unhealthy" infps?
2	#Triggered
2	All correct except I'm an optimist. How about y'all???
2	accurate !\n*tear rolls down cheek*
2	Disagree with the love people.\nI'd say they love one or two people but with all their heart and are either indifferent or dislike everyone else. 
2	There are times in this subreddit where I feel everything is highly exaggerated and not relatable but yeah this one is dead on
2	So true it hurts...
2	How would you define pessimist? I don't think I am a pessimist, but I do sometimes say things that crushes people's bubbles.\n\nA guy I used to know was having mechanical issues with his car. His mom was lying on the couch moping and worrying about the car. She then said aloud, "I hope that it can be fixed." And then I said, "Well, it is certainly possible that it might not be able to be fixed." Then she became mad at me and she called me a little brat. I felt like she was being a overly dramatic, but I could also see why she was upset because she really wanted the car to be usable since it was the only car in the household.\n\nAnyway, perhaps I can be insensitive, but I just feel like it is better to think about the worst that can happen so that you can prepare for it. To just sit there on your butt, moping and worrying about things and then saying things like "I hope it will be okay" seems unproductive.\n\nThis might sound kind of negative, but I kind of think hope is a destructive force. Hope can prevent people from acting. Hope can also be devastating when it does not come true. I think it is better to not spend time hoping, but spend time planning. Hope is a band-aid. It is a temporary fix. Creating a plan is like giving yourself a tool box that you can use perhaps your entire life.\n\nI know that does not sound very INFPy but that is how I feel at least. Maybe other people can see where I am coming from.
1	That about sums it up!
1	Finally someone said it.
1	Yep accurate as lol haha
1	So infps are centrists. Nice
1	Accurate but I have a huge ego. I am infp a though. 
1	Omg THIS!!!!
1	I‚Äôm on the front page, what would INFP mean?
1	Hurts
1	Everything except my ego is high af and I don't generally like people.
1	I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúlike people‚Äù trait is accurate. Also, not rigid at all. I think we‚Äôre pretty easy going and flexible
17	33yo and finally becoming more self-assured	Ever since high school I had been self-conscious. I was especially self-conscious about my voice. Even just hearing my voice made me cringe. I would also become emotional after any sort of criticism. I absolutely hated being called stupid, and if someone called me gay or an f word it would bring me to tears.\n\nYesterday, I noticed how much I have changed. I was with a work partner yesterday. We were working for about 11 hours non-stop. He is 23. Anyway, a couple of times throughout the day, I noticed he was super sensitive. A mechanic told him he was doing something wrong and he became visibly upset. Then later a nurse got snippy with him and he became incredibly upset too. I tried to help him relax and let it roll off his back, but he hated the idea of sounding stupid.\n\nAs much as this is weird for me to say, but I was exactly him 2 years ago. If any stranger treated me unfairly, or claimed I was doing something wrong I would act like him, mad and sad at the same time. But seeing him react those ways was an eye opening experience of how far I have come. Negative things people say to me do not affect me like they used to.\n\nI still have my issues and I do still care what people think of me and I do feel self-conscious a lot of the time, but I have also realized how far I have come. I can only imagine what 43 will be like.\n\nThank you for reading. Maybe this will even help some people out there.\n\n-Written with much love
5	Hey im INFP 32 male,  I am going through the same.  One of the traits for INFPs are that they are what I would call Long Term Life Bloomers or Long Bloomer for short.  We out of every other personality on the mbti have the capacity for greater change and knowledge of society and interpersonal tendencies over the years.  Think of van goh whom was thought to be an INFP. It took him most of his life and was ridiculed probably alot in his day but what would the entire art world be without him.  In a movie sense we are jedis of star wars or neos of the matrix... it takes Time for us to be who we really are, getting mad like you described seem like a rock in the way.  But soon we will look back and realize they were just bunps in the road.  Kind of like Neo and the bullet he went from geting hit by them to dodging them to literally co trollling them in time and space and eventually stopping them... In time my friend.  In time.
2	You are blessed to know this progress. There are people out there (my INFP dad being one of them) who are still stuck in adolescent over-sensitive "trigger" mode into their late 60s. I mean, to some extent, there will always be things that "trigger" us, but it's how we deal with it, especially in the presence of others, that makes all the difference. 
14	I'm a coconut and people are peaches	I'm a really shy person and I don't share much (time, experiences, my emotion, etc...) unless I really click with the person either with or without romantic interests. But once I do, I'm like I would do anything for him/her. And my problem is I assume the same with others.\n It's not that I'm close minded or unfriendly, but I think it's that have boundaries with other people. I'm like a coconut, which has a hard shell but easy to get into the center. To me people are like peaches, has a soft and thin skin but has big seed inside. They are just so open and friendly, share so easily experience with me  and tell me words I wouldn't give to others unless I deeply care about them. In my experience people have invited me to their lives so easily, had me feel so much affection toward them and assume they would feel the same since they are doing this with me or saying this to me,etc... and they just threw me away and I  find out they didn't care that much. This has been confusing and hurting me. \n I feel like I can't express what I'm feeling well enough with my English, but I hope someone feels the same way...
7	Exactly the feeling I had so many times in my life. But look forward, there are other coconuts :)
4	I think you said it very well. I can definitely relate.
6	If anyone here hasn't heard of cavetown yet, his songs have some of the most infp lyrics I've ever heard	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgmMJJ34k4\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eIhU8wBjtsc
3	Thank you for sharing this, friend 
2	omg that‚Äôs so fucking true!!!
2	I absolutely love Cavetown! üíôüíöüíú
47	Is it an infp thing? I was always that person asking classmates to repeat what the teacher just said	
2	I used to zone out in class when I was younger, but at the age of 33 I am very attentive in class. I think at a young age school was just school and paying attention did not seem important, but as I have gotten older I have realized how precious time is, so I want to make the most of it as I can.
2	I remember this lol. I used to try so hard to pay attention after the exam was passed out, and I would still slip away by accident.
2	I‚Äôm still that way. Especially with instructions on ANYTHING. I have an instruction disability 
2	I‚Äôm the guy who gets handed an essay, zones out for the first 30 minutes, and writes 2 pages in 15 minutes
1	Direct link to [**tweet**](http://twitter.com/spjdermen/status/1087824823470960641) \n***\n^(This is a bot.     Am I a 'Good bot'?     All feedback is appreciated!)
1	Yes still I am at work 
1	Tests gave me so much anxiety/excitement, I don't think I ever zoned out like that.\n\nI was the guy in the back always doodling in my notebook, but sort of hearing what the teacher's saying. I think I never asked my classmates what the teacher said though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, keeping this up means good grades in high school, and terrible grades in college. INFP friends, apply yourself and purposefully build study habits, please. But it's not about discipline for us. It's about finding something you can believe in, and defining yourself as someone who does what's necessary for good things to happen.
1	Learning from other's people mistakes	It's always important being able to learn from our mistakes, but personally since I can remember I've tried to look at other people and learn from them. This may have to do with the fact that I can't handle being wrong, my mind just won't stop remembering that small thing that I messed up. \nBesides the point fear of failing, I truly believe that in many ocations we can prevent those mistakes if we look around us, and learn.\n\nWhat do you guys do more often; learning from your mistakes? Or someone else's?\n\nSorry if there's anything wrong, I'm still working on my English. üòä
3	How to be more "pleasant" at work? (Even though I think I am pleasant enough)	I work as a consultant in a corporate research firm, and as I progress in my career, I'm expected to be a lot more opinionated and vocal, which are just not my natural tendencies. I am keenly aware that a lot of the INFP strengths/traits can be perceived quite negatively by others, and want to hear from others on how they have dealt with them. \n\nTwo examples:\n\n1. Being so open, I am naturally agreeable with most situations, and so am happy to try new things and go with the flow. So then I'm asked what kind of projects I am interested in, "I'm open to anything"omes across as me being disinterested and uncaring\n2. Again, part of being open is that I simply like listening (absorbing information) more than speaking, and so I come across as awfully quiet. This is not as prevalent when it comes to actual work with clients, but when it comes to social event with colleagues (e.g. lunch, happy hour that I have to force myself to partake in every couple of months), I just don't want to be sharing so much of my life with acquaintances. And so I come across as being quiet / aloof / shy. \n\nIn real life, I don't care if people think I am a bore or aloof, but in a corporate world ruled largely by the outspoken and extroverted, I feel the need to fake it for my own good in the long run.\n\nI love my line of work and the company I work for, but how do I get better at this?
3	What Size is Your Mind	Using any known scale of measurement describe and your own beat words, the size of your mind\n\nYou can say an inch or even a death star, however you personally see fit to answer
4	Oceanic.
2	It engulfs the atmosphere.
1	If I remember right, it's a size 8. 
1	Size 0 but bootylicious
28	Anyone kinda hate having a phone? I feel I would be less anxious without it.	
6	I have always hated phones. It took me along time to get a cellphone which I got 2yrs ago. Having a cell gives me so much anxiety. I wish I could get rid of it but need it for emergencies. 
3	Hmm...maybe you should stop carrying it. I can totally get that. I used to date someone that hated phones too. He actually bought a flip phone with no internet and he only gave his number to his mom. Anyone else who wanted to contact him could call him on the landline or maybe call him at work in an emergency. He does not want to feel bothered all day, which makes sense.
2	i have a phone yet no mobile service aside from the Google VOiP number through wiFi.\ni dont go out/hang out, no buddies in the city so it‚Äôs home and work day in day out.\ni save $250/yr!
2	Yes, I am very pro-tech and everything, but just hearing my ringtone gives me that uneasy anxious feeling. I'm scared it might be someone calling with bad news, or even one of my friends interrupting my peaceful introversion.  It's so much pressure to always be available.
2	Thank god I‚Äôm not alone. Sometimes not even just hate having a phone I kind of hate that everyone has one because if I try to go without it I feel that I‚Äôm in the wrong because EVERYONE has one. I‚Äôm thinking about smashing my iPhone into pieces and getting a cheap phone for texting and calling because I‚Äôve been affected by technology in a negative way and have become pretty much addicted(which is my problem) and I feel that will be the only way I‚Äôll stop. I have an actual life and things I wanna do and phones and internet just distracts me dramatically. 
1	I've been planning to make myself contactable by phone only by my immediate family and for emergencies only for a long time. It's difficult since I'm a working adult. Have to do it in phases.
1	Yes, I want to turn it off for a week and tell people if they need me just ring my house's bell.
1	Not really. I kind of get a mini panic attack if I don‚Äôt have my phone near me. I like being able to google an obscure fact that pops into my head and being able to double check. Or knowing how to go places, or know how late things are open, or knowing what the weather is or if the apt complex will be plowing the parking lot and towing cars or if anyone liked sometime I posted or being able to text my boyfriend a weird Bitmoji or looking up how to cook something or reading the news or really everything. \n\nIt‚Äôs really hard for me to be without my phone because I‚Äôm such a hermit right now and I‚Äôd be almost totally alone if I didn‚Äôt have social media to communicate. BUT I went ‚Äúoffline‚Äù for a few weeks once where I disabled my Instagram, and I felt really nice ! I didn‚Äôt realize how much junk I let myself see everyday and how it effected my brain. 
72	I started drawing again	
5	I wonderful hobby to fall back into. Good job! Very impressive hatching. A fun excercise to do to better hone hatching and cross hatching abilities is to draw something round, but not spherical...something like a lemon or an apple, or even a heart, and only use hatching to shade it. It's very fun to me, idk, just a fun suggestion. Keep drawing! :)
34	Anybody else get weird nostalgia?	People say INFPs use Si for comfort. Anyone else get nostalgic for an era from before they were even born? \n\nEx. Sometimes when I play piano, I feel like I'm taken to the 1800s... or if I hear a song from the 90s I'll also get nostalgic. But I actually found out that some of my nostalgia songs were songs my mom used to listen to before I was born... so maybe the passing down of memories through DNA is the cause of my nostalgia? \n\n I heard people say they hate nostalgia but I love it... having all these memories playing back in my head feels so... relaxing üòå
7	Of course man , that's just your creative mind at work. I get those feelings about things too, especially  with music and guitar (:
3	I get nostalgia for places that don't exist. I don't really like it. (I love daydreaming about other places, but I don't like nostalgia's vague wispy sadness.)
3	I bet your room is full of things you can't bear to part with because you're so nostalgic. ;)
2	It happens to many people, but the strength is different. I happen to create scenarios in my head after hearing or seeing something. Then I become emotional, negativity or positivity, as if it were real.
2	I looove nostalgia. And sadness. It might sound weird but crying out of sadness is so pure 
2	Yes! I get so nostalgic while listening to music. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm there in whatever time period. I only really know music from the 1950s- today, but I feel like I can time travel if the volume is high enough. \n\nIt also makes me wonder if I ever lived out those eras in a past life. Or how my parents or grandparents might have felt during that time. Recorded music keeps artists who passed away alive. I miss them, but I feel less alone when I hear them. 
8	I am a frail gardener in a burning garden.	>Context: I have a genetic condition (MTHFR) that causes me a few problems. I had a dysfunctional childhood and disastrous adolescence. I was close to suicide many times. After a lot of effort, my life is becoming manageable. I still suffer from a lot of issues. This is an epiphany I had on the bus back home from work.\n\nI am a frail gardener in a burning garden. \n\nI worked ceaselessly and put out many fires.\n\nStill my garden burns on, distressing many people.\n\nThe infinite fires that rage on, consuming me as fodder, are far too strong for me to overcome. \n\nI throw them a bucket of sanity but the vapor isn‚Äôt sufficient to quench the scorching air.\n\nBut I do not give up.\n\nI am frail yet persistent.\n\nI am weak but tenacious.\n\nI killed many monsters.\n\nI look up at you, my demons and phantoms.\n\nI gaze as you raze my peace and take away my freedom.\n\nBut I am here to banish you one by one.\n\nOne day, I will have peace.\n\nFlowers will bloom in my garden.\n\nI am a frail gardener who does not give up.\n\nI am here. You cannot stop me.
3	I have no idea what that's like; it sounds extremely difficult. I wish you the best and I hope you learn to live with these demons, as challenging as they are, I hope this intensely negative condition you have has helped shape you into a stronger, kinder person. I hope you find the silver lining buried beneath the pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMay you be safe and find peace.
129	But really though, take care of yourselves. You're worth it.	
10	I genuinely wish aliens would come down and scare the piss out of humanity to get them to be better
5	Wow. Love this:)
2	Okay dad, will do. üòã
2	Dang, thanks.
2	How the hell am I supposed to do any of this when I'm trapped in a system that has me making literally *negative* money each month?
2	Awe thanks darlin! <3 I'll do my best, really :) You too mkay?!
2	I need 36 daily hours of sleep, how dare you.
1	Love you guys
13	Post concert reflections.	Currently 1:06am typing this in bed. As an infp, I don't go out much, but when I do, it's to take a break from my old routines. I decided to go to a concert alone tonight because I've done it before once. Still had an amazing time, just wish I had someone to share it with. I felt happy for all the couples though, it'll be the happiest nights of their youth. \n\n\nAnd my ears are still ringing.
2	who did you see
2	Might want to being earplugs for your next concert just in case. Permanent ear damage is not worth it.
1	For me music is much more of an alone in your bedroom activity. They spend hours producing records to make it as polished as possible. I think a lot of people use it as a reason to go out, but I think there are a lot better places to go out that isn't as loud. I still remember my first concert was a Dinosaur Jr concert and my ears were ringing, I couldn't even recognize the songs cause it was so loud. :P
19	Why?	Why do we feel so much pain that sometimes isn't ours? Why do we feel this world is so evil? Why do we feel all alone despite being surrounded by so many people that are smiling and laughing and enjoying the moment? Why is it that we perceive ourselves to be in Syria? Why do we dream so much about something and once we actually get it we feel empty? Why do we jump from one goal to the next when we know deep inside that we're not going to be able to be efficient that way? Why do we stay inside and dream about the world we want to live in instead of actually going outside to create it? Why do we want to be loved by someone that doesn't really appreciate us the way we want them to? Why do we try to see the best in everyone, and attempt to be their friend no matter how poorly they treat us? Why are we so afraid of speaking out and hurting other people's feelings when it is us that stands to feel the most pain out of it all? Why do we hate direct interaction with people so often, yet starve for intimacy nearly every single day? Why does life and the meaning of our existence feel so special yet so insignificant at the same time? Why do we feel so disconnected and unloved by this world?
3	A: introverted feeling
3	Thank you for posting this. It articulates so much of what I feel as an INFP. People tell me to just go out there and do and try, but it hurts. It's exhausting. I say I prefer books to people and get called cold and snobby and lazy but it's just too much. People inflict so much pain on each other and it feels so much safer and easier to burrow in and find happiness in writing and drawing. The world will drive you mad.\n\n::hugs::
2	This really, really hits home today. I need to give this to my bf to read - because that‚Äôs a hard space to put into words. Hugs.
5	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 15	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
1	So a random discussion thread as opposed to random discussions on random threads.\n\nI should put out a random discussion tweet.
1	I made a Teespring account to add to the pile of fail that is Redbubble and my inability to shove links into everyone's faces. I can't force people to look at what I've got (Seeing this as the result instead of spamming links anyway). The spread of my art has been entirely luck-dependent, not because it's half-decent. I can't help but put myself down because I feel everyone sees my less than average ass as unworthy.  \n  \nSomehow Reddit has been the most helpful in getting people to see my stuff (and for free). Even then, it's all fleeting moments of discovery, only to have me dig myself out and give more each time. Self-promotion is super limited and that's understandable because spam is annoying. I have been holding back from going overboard with sharing the whole time, but is that what's holding me back? 
1	[A song I would like to share with everyone](https://youtu.be/PUXzhFP2rag) have a nice day.
6	This channel has got to be the most depressing thing to happen to society since Bambi.	stay cool infp's ;)\n\non a more serious note i sometimes get awfully confused at how or why (or being defined as the function \n\n{x, y}‚Üí{-((x+y)\^2-3x)/2} where x and y occupy a state of mutually exclusive true and false, represented by 0 as false and 1 as true) infp's are generally optimistic about everyone but themselves\n\nan explanation with functions could be helpful

14	HELP WITH AN INFP!	Hey there INFPs! I've (ENFP 16M) recently begun falling for an INFP (16F) and I think its time I tell her that. She's the nicest human I've ever met, so I dont want to ruin our friendship. Any tips? Do you fancy something cliched? Something unexpected? A mixture of both? A pseudo-recreation of a proposal scene from your favourite romance movie? Do I *sing?* (IDK what to do :P)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Im still unsure if she feels the same for me. We've know each other for 3 months and share music and comics a lot \[both of us love Calvin and Hobbes {oh look a brace inside a brace inside a brace}\]. She sometimes stares at me and we both often smile and wave at each other. But I dont wanna scare her off)\n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE (19/02/19): Met her on the pretext of giving her the 'song sheet' (We usually share music and song names on pieces of paper, christened the 'song sheet'). Was supposed to confess her face to face, and the direction of the conversation was going in the right direction... until her friends showed up and didnt leave :/ (Honestly, they REALLY dont get the message when you try and tell 'em to leave via glaring at them). Didnt want to make a scene in front of 'em (she hates that kinda shit) so I just backed away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a saving grace tho;  in the song sheet I wrote a lil poem in a code which we both know (Originally she was supposed to read it AFTER the confession, but to hell with that i guess.) Its not terribly original (Sarcasm 100), and certainly not my best work, but here it goes:\n\n>Roses are red,  \n>  \n>Violets are blue.  \n>  \n>If I wasn't obvious enough:  \n>  \n>I like you.\n\nSo... Am gonna try and tell her, face to face, tomorrow. (We have a test tommo so idk if she'll sit back and ACTUALLY decode it today \[after all she dosnt know theres a poem in there\], but hey, we'll find out tomorrow.)\n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE (20/02/19): First met her during the small recess we had. Nothing was outta the blue, no red flags. She was with a friend, but smiles the moment we see each other. We talk a bit abt the test we had, and then ask her if we could meet up in the library at lunch. She readily agreed (to my surprise), but unfortunatly a teacher called us; she had something to discuss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out we have a program to be scheduled on March 1st, and she wanted us, and a bunch of others to organize it, so we met up in the afternoon with the others (Not gonna lie, was a bit disheartened). It was bog standard, but she kept glancing at me (idk if thats my imagination or not). At the end the bell rang and I was keepin my chair, and she approachs me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Hey" she says.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Hey!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe both begin walking towards our classes; we had like a minute to get there. "So... I read the poem." a small smile\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Really?"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Yeah. The code was simple."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are halfway to our classes. "Well originally you were supposed to read it *after* i told you in person-"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"What?!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"- but ur friends were there so to Kingdom come i guess"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Ah... *X* (Not telling the name)? Oh my god I'm so sorry." she genuinely looked embarrassed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Nah its okay. You have no idea of the shenanigans I did..."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had reached the corridor where our 2 classes branched off. "Can I talk to you abt this later?" she asks. We agreed to talk abt it later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe run into each other again during the second recess, but didnt really talk abt it cuz one of her friends were tagging along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCome evening, and we have 10 mins before our buses are scheduled to leave. Im drinking water from the water cooler, when she materializes next to me from the crowd of teenagers heading home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"So..." she begins "abt that..." a small smile on her face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"yeah. you have no idea. me and *Y* (again name hidden) came with code names and shit" explained the whole things (And i wont do that cuz it involves a lot of inside jokes and percy jackson references; me, she and *Y*  LOVE Percy Jackson)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA short, but (for me atleast) a comfy silence later she says "I really dont know..."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Well, I was just telling the truth."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA short pause. She dosnt break eye contact (not in a serious way, but that cute inquisitive way I keep falling for). "I mean, what do you expect from this?" (Okay it sounds like shes being rude, but it wasnt; her tone was calm and a tad bit flattered/shy. Idk how exactly to place it but I know it wasnt rude.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Nothing, I suppose. Just wanted tell you. No ulterior motives, if you know what I mean."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother comfy silence. She's smiling; so am I.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"I gotta go." she says "Looks like my friends are waiting for me over there." I look over to where she pointing, and sure enough those 3 witches from macbeth are there (Damn, cant they just leave us alone :/ Atleast they maintained like a 20 feet distance; yesterday they were practically glued to her).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Well, bye I guess?" I say to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Bye"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe both wave at each other she joins her friends; i turn and join my squad 30 feet away in the other direction, as they wanted to know all the details. Didnt get a definite answer, but Im willing to take what I got.
4	Hey dude! It sounds like she is interested in you. From my own experience, she‚Äôs probably never gonna make the first move (it‚Äôs not really in our nature) so you gotta kinda be forward with her. Be kind, be interested, be yourself! Good luck :)
2	Oh, if you're an ENFP, just be yourself. It's a natural connection. The only pitfall I can think of (should a romantic relationship develop) is her ability to cope with the eventual realization that all those human, social gifts of yours aren't strictly for her.\n\nBut since we're not there yet, I don't think I'd worry anymore about "ruining" the friendship if you've fallen for her. For you, the damage is done. Now you just gotta take the leap and find out if it's mutual.  \n\nAlso don't worry about "scaring her off". It's never **that** with anyone, I don't think. And you think you're gonna scare off an INFP with a personalized declaration of affection? If she's "scared off", it was that her feelings weren't mutual. And that will suck. But if you've fallen for her, anything's gonna suck that doesn't involve her falling for you. Right?\n\nMy only other tip would be to quickly see that falling for her does not equal love. Love is what you *do* from here on out. Good luck. I think we're all pulling for you.
2	How long have you been friends? I mean especially if it's been a while, go for it, man. I'm sure she'll appreciate anything. Sounds like you got some good advice in the comments too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!!
2	i don't know much about love, i just want to show my support i wish you good luck :)
4	Weird personality	Am I the only one whose personality randomly changes like sometimes you're a ENFP, INTP, INFJ or ISFP? I dunno, I guess I'm just really weird. ;) But when I'm by myself I'm a total INFP.
3	You're not weird. You just don't understand MBTI. 
2	aaaah. same like me. sometimes when i'm happy,i will become ENFP. Buutt when I'm angry,I was become ENTJ suddenly.... xD\n\n&#x200B;
1	I am not sure what you mean. Can you give examples? Also, maybe you are stereotyping types, which may make you think you are acting as other types.\n\nIn my opinion you are one type, but each type is complex and stereotypes may apply in some cases, but on a grander scale do not really fit.
1	That's not how it works. Your cognitive functions can't change. 
11	Thought id share this song with you fellow INFPs	
20	Got this from a friend today. Day complete.

10	Self criticism and self love are two sides of the same coin.	I made this comment on r/INTP, and I feel like sharing it here with you guys. \n\nI think being self critical isn't just about self hate, but self love as well. We don't always know what makes us happy and content, but we all tend to have this idealized version of ourselves in our minds that we wish to become, but cannot. I think we magnify our flaws because they are a huge part of ourselves, yet they also keep us from becoming who we actually want to become; therefore, we become frustrated and bitter about where we stand in life because we cannot set ourselves free from our own self expectations even if everyone else tells us we are doing fine. To me being self critical is like being a harsh and strict parent to yourself, because you won't be suffering so much unless you actually do care. If we think about developing a child, the kid needs both soft and tough love in order to develope in a balanced way; therefore, for our own mental and emotional development, we can't just be overly critical at all time; instead, we should also pat ourselves on the backs sometimes to be self assured and not internalize the things we do not like about ourselves.

25	Do you also think that you avoid people because you love people so much	for me it is like as I love humanity, I don‚Äôt want any of them ruin the hopes about them\n\nI know it sounds confusing af but I do.
5	Yes, been there, done that.
3	Totally. That's totally me. People ruin my fantasy that we are evolving as a species, and that some day we will all get this shit right. üòú
3	The idea of someone often exceeds the reality of the person themselves. If we can start to see people as they are, then this becomes less of a problem. 
3	Nope.  I give a lot of love, when I need time by myself it‚Äôs cause I need it lol
3	You're not "ruining" anyone by talking to them, that sounds like a very unhealthy mentality
14	You might be an INFP if you....	
32	are overthinking about this too much
18	Can easily spend hours in the zone getting things done when you're doing something you're currently fascinated by, but... \n\n...have to muster up all the willpower in every cell of your body to spend half an hour doing your taxes (or that homework you don't like, or cleaning that thing you hate cleaning).

2	Wale uses this in one of his songs on his Album about Nothing. Good quote. Not sure if I want to live by it, but i understand his thought.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I so totally agree with Constanza. I want to at least live in reality when it comes to human nature. The rose colored glasses make me overlook bad behavior and I end up being a door mat. Accepting the reality of human nature, without sugar coating it would save me a lot of time in the long run I think. Then I could be pleasantly surprised by people more, when they do wonderful things occassionally.\n\nHappy Valentines Day!!! Lolol
2	I grew up watching Seinfeld because my dad loved it\n\nI have to say, I agree with this post 100%
1	Why tho, I don't want to be hopeless

7	Is it just me or it's an INFP thing ?	I'm a female INFP in my first 20's. I have this one thing about me. Whenever I ask something to others, I try very hard not to hurt or offend them in any way. For example: "I'm just asking. Is it okay for you ?". When I'm required to do work group, I will ask if the other can do it, or else I will. I was asking to my lecturer about my work the other day. I asked her if I still had to do this part when I have already help the team. "I was just asking. It's not that I didn't want to do the work. Please don't misunderstood". She replied by saying she knows I was just asking. \n\nMy friends and sibling think I look stupid.Some said I am stupidly naive.  Honestly I feel the same sometimes. I think I always embarass myself by saying these kind of things. People might think I just want to appear nice and polite. Or they might think I'm stupid for voicing thoughts like these. I should just ask what I need to without expressing what I feel. I feel very bothered by this.\nAnother thing is, I am very quiet around people I'm not close with. Sometimes I would burst out saying weird and stupid things. I also think this is embarassing. \n\nIs it just me or the other INFP did experience the same thing ?
7	I do the exact same thing. My line is, ‚Äúif that‚Äôs okay with you?‚Äù 
1	Yeah in general I'd say I'm pretty type B when it comes to directing etc. \n\nI've worked on it a bit now since being in management. Delegation is my least developed ability and servant leadership is my strongest attribute..
1	I am the same way.\n\nIf I ask a favor I will put it in a way that they can say no. I feel like it is more polite. Also I feel like I am not here on this planet to make anyone do something they do not want to do. Although I mean this with other adults. When it comes to children I feel like there is an expectation that they need to do things they do not want to do.
1	Yes I am the same. I have difficulty to ask for any kind of help from others, if I have to ask I will be super polite and say weird things. It looks so unnatural my "thank you" to other I can see it in their eyes. \nI feel like I should be self sufficient for everything and don't disturb people. \nBut I am learning to open up...  at first everyone misunderstood me and later they found that I was just being kind. \n
23	I cannot be the only Brash INFP in the world?	I mean, we cannot all be a bunch of mewling kittens and demuring snowflake dolphin prince/ess/es.\n\nGranted, it wasn't always this way.  I did used to try to bond like a swan couple with everyone I slept with, avoid conflict, and feel eternally skin-crawlingly embarassed in social situations.\n\nHowever, at some point I kind of woke up and realized conflict is inevitable (since there are so many people dedicated to self-limiting binary ideologies), and most people hide a lot of goodies in what they call 'evil' or 'bad' or 'selfish.'  Finally, most of the time people are either going to enjoy me or not and I cannot act conforming enough to change their minds.\n\nKind of like, "They're going to love me or hate me and there wasn't much I could do about it from the start."  At that point, I find a lot of freedom to say and do whatever I please.  Anyway, even if I *do* weave a magical fabric of pretty lies that makes someone think I'm cool, I would have to spend a lot of time keeping that up -- I mean like, you can put on a face in an interview, but if you get that job, you better be able to keep it up!\n\nSo now I almost treat everywhere I go as a testbed of whatever celestial or diabolical experimentation strikes my fancy at the moment.  I generally talk louder, say what I please, and yes, occasionally piss people off to no ends.  \n\nBut who cares?  If those people somehow "liked me" before, it's not like they really liked *me*, just whatever they entertained as the idea of me.  What is there to gain through being a wallflower?  If I sacrifice myself to avoid conflict because "conflict is uncomfortable" am I not then also uncomfortable due to the self-sacrifice?\n\nAnyway, did any of you other dead-eyed INFP magical-world-trapped-in-a-person types ever evolve some outgoing qualities?  What about outgoing to the point of brashness and assholery?  I know we're usually willing to *explore a lot of ways of looking at the world*, so I cannot be the only one who came into this....
8	*Piss off*; I'm a demurring snowflake dolphin prince. \n\nüòâ
5	Ha, no your not, I think it gets easier with age, to generally not give a fuck about what certain people think! They think I'm nuts at work, I just say whatever pops into my head which can be very random, rude, sick, offensive! Not always tho. But hey ho, sod em! 
3	There's a difference between being "nice" i.e. people pleasing, and being "kind."  The kind thing to do is often to be honest, especially with the people closest to me in my opinion.  So, I say what I think too. And it does tend to alienate people at times. I have a knack for noticing and identifying patterns in people's behavior that they have never seen before. Or are desperately trying to hide. Some would say I should keep things to myself, but I try to say something about it only if it's kind and necessary.  If I want real intimacy in my life I think I have to take a risk and get honest about things that people do that hurt me.\n\nNot everyone will get it but whatever. The people willing to have a real conversation and self reflect on a deep level the way I do, are the only people I want as close friends anyway, and usually those others will eventually let me know they learned a lot from me. They often get pissed at first, and in the worst cases it could take a few years for them to process it enough to tell me but I have had to accept that and not make either of us bad or wrong in the process. Not every relationship is meant to be forever. 
3	i put up a brash front once i get comfortable enough with someone.
2	> However, at some point I kind of woke up and realized conflict is inevitable...\n\nYes, precisely. Running or avoiding it is the last thing that it should be done as it often restrain us. We're being thought to avoid it, to remain passive but what we should be thought is how to handle it, how to resolve the conflict. 
2	I wouldn't call myself brash but I stick up for myself, don't let other people push me around or make me hold myself back. Only got one life so there's no point in living anyone's but your own.
2	I'm in your camp. Spent a looooong time on the people-pleasing side first though. I came to a similar conclusion to yours. I want to just be myself and if people like me, then great. If not, then there's one less person to worry about keeping happy. I have many casual acquaintances but only two friends that I care about deeply (INFP style) and that's enough for me.\n\nI'm also far less self conscious which allows me to actually go out once in a while, have fun, dance, make a fool of myself and pretend I'm some sort of extravert. It's very freeing.
2	Just going by the INFP Facebook group, apparently not, as these people start what will obviously become arguments every other hour. Well it's been two INFP Facebook groups where I have observed this.\n\nI think the more an INFP people-pleases to avoid conflict, the more they will also avoid people. The INFP is not likely to be confused about how they feel and will feel stifled and resentful not being able to "be themselves". \n\nAlso an INFP may not know how to express their beliefs without doing so in a way that will make other people upset, since so many of their beliefs will run counter to what "normal" people think. We are not always very good at explaining all the things going inside our heads and all of the information that led us to whatever decision or opinion we have. Also we have to learn that just because other people are upset that doesn't mean we are wrong. We can't control everything.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with conflict, conflict needs management, not necessarily resolution.\n\nIt is advisable for the INFP to use extraverted intuition and continue to explore all possibilities, and to be expressive about this, even if it makes others uncomfortable. Unfortunately many times INFPs will skip this function and instead stick to Si which encourages comfort and stability and introversion.
2	When I was younger my nickname was "Mike Tyson" and I was told I was contentious and that's why people didn't want to be around me. Then I just started staying away from people as much as possible (while continuing to argue online with strangers). \n\nNow I am known as a very "nice" person, which just means people feel betrayed when I put my foot down, but I no longer regret putting my foot down. It's always worked out for the better.\n\nI have always highly valued peace, just not peace based on deception.
2	I usually get 49% INTP and 51% INFP, so I do have my brash moments with some debates. xD However, I really love the idea of being a mewling kitten/demurring snowflake dolphin princess and a magical world in a person type :‚ÄôD And I like this sub actually a lot more than INTP. Anyway, what I mean is that I feel more in tune with my feelings side, but I do have my brash moments for sure!! 
2	I find that if I say something smart and funny, people tend to laugh even though I am making fun of them. 
1	Someone once said, "a cynic is just a disillusioned romantic".  Not sure if that means anything to you but it makes sense to me
1	I‚Äôve gotten brasher with age but I still don‚Äôt call myself brash. I‚Äôve had situations where I had to put my foot down but they never felt ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or ‚Äúexhilarating‚Äù 
1	Nah. I like it. I can be pretty brash. A lot of time I overthink it in the aftermath, though.\n\nI think, for an INFP, the move to brashness begins with recognizing conflict as inherently necessary for all the things we're idealizing -- like authenticity, intimacy, community, growth, etc. \n\nYou're probably going a little further than me, though. But I think, apparently like you, that the greater error is to go in the opposite direction, maintaining a comfortable equilibrium of pseudo-harmony that does nobody any good at all.
1	Yess, MOOD. Love this post. 
3	My story.	I found this Reddit subpage through Google search when I was looking for infp stuff.  This is my story. I never met people like me and I kind of have a big ego but again, I never met people like me.\n\nI was born on June 22nd and I am a cancer / infp / a Empath / and I had a sort of a mental disorder relating to my life. I use my right brain. I am a Empathatic cancer INFP man guy boy. \n\nI value kindness, patience, hope, love, wisdom, honor, righteousness, and I have a specialized Empath life. \n\nMy Empath life has made me medically insane. I live in Texas USA. I have dreams of God(Jehovah) as an orb if electricity and dreamed the devil before. I dreamed Buddha and dreamed obatala( Santeria voodoo God) and I seen many angels and saints in my dreams. \n\nMy dreams manifest as positive (light holy energy) and negativity ( shadow dark evil energy). I do not like drugs alcohol muarijauna(weed) and I do not like gothic people , gangsters, negativity, metal music, gore, Halloween, bad neighborhoods, peircing, tattoos, and I rarely have sex with women because their emotional scars make me sick physically and mentally. During sex I heal wounds of the other person or get drained. I believe in merraige and love. \n\nEmotional scars do make me sick. So do people with evil personalities or liers cheaters thiefs as well I get sick from dark emotions like anger fear hate chaos confusion death negativity depression sadness and greed. \n\nAnimals love me. And some women find my charm very attractive. I am charming because I am compassionate and confident. I know my mechanics and my strengths weakness. \n\nI live on social security and get 500$ a month. I am extremely dumb because I am not logical at all or very limited logical and intelligence. I don't know how to drive and I don't know how to survive in this world. I failed college and graduated highschool because of president Bush's no child life behind. \n\nI am told that I am an angel. But I don't know about that. I live with my grandma and I have 3 sisters. \n\nI use Florida water and candles to help strengthen my energies. Emotions are energies. That's a truth but science doesn't know that yet. I always feel an emotional chaos in me....\n\nThis emotional chaos is like starwars. As an emapth I can choose to switch to negativity and be a amazing asshole and greedy evil person. \n\nBut I haven't figured out that mechanic yet. Most negativity hurts me but I always feel a pull to shadows ( to be a wicked amoral human being)\n\nWell what else ...I am 29 and in 5 months I will be 30.\n\nI guess that is the end if the story. Thanks for letting me talk and rant. I know it sounds like a lot of bullshit. But I swear my right brain personality has a weird life. \n\nAsk me any questions and I will answer them. Thanks for hearing me out. I love this subreddit. Thank you. 
1	More about my life ........\n\nAs an Empath and an INFP - I read the power of now by ekchart tolle and know the dalai lama. \n\nI am not shy or secluded. I do not run from social encounters. \n\nThe matter of the fact is - I am like Goku. I love spiritual self development training and I love energy combat. \n\nI know I am super sensitive as an Empath and negative people hurt and drain me. But I "push or force" my positive presence wherever I go and a clash of spiritual energy happens. \n\nI make ugly people bored angry tired or confuse. I know my "light" eats their shadows. \n\nSometimes I need a shower/bath to recharge or Florida water. Other times I light candles for knowledge or defense(protection). \n\nI seriously have an ego and a nasty judgement. I judge bad people as bad based on my feelings towards them because shadow emotions and - negativity - is my sworn enemy. But I do feel the devil try to sway me to the Darkside.  I tend to be a egotistic idealist - a paladin and I dislike hanging around people who are not as um...ethical ? \n\nI don't know what I am and I know I have a mental illness. I am cancer. Empath. Angel. iNFP. And a right brain user. \n\nI actively fight negativity everywhere I go. \n\nAnd yes I have strict morals and high standards. \n\nThanks for letting me go crazy haha üòÖ

9	How would you describe intuition to another type?	I think the best way I can put it is, "It's my brain processing thousands of finite details in seconds, which allows me to understand people and situations on another level. It's the way someone's smallest corner of their lip turns up when their mad at you, even though they say they aren't. My brain is able to see that and understand it without me realizing it". \n\nHow would you guys describe it? 
4	I have some kind of internal process that gives me a feeling when I see, hear or touch something that is of meaning or importance to me. When I get that feeling my mind can see infinite possibilities and outcomes that paint ideas in my mind for me to bring in or share with the world.

10	Making Friends Online	Many people in my life (especially extroverts) don‚Äôt understand how I make so many friends online. In real life I‚Äôm painfully shy and awkward, as I‚Äôm sure many on this sub are, but online where I have time to think about what I want to say and I don‚Äôt fear I‚Äôm being judged on anything except what I put forward, I‚Äôm much more confident. That and the ability to walk away from someone without consequences takes off so much pressure and makes it easier to open up about how I feel. \n\nI love making friends online! I‚Äôve formed lasting relationships with friends I‚Äôll likely keep for a lifetime, even if we never meet in person. Surprisingly, a good number of the friends I make here on reddit are also INFP! That‚Äôs kind of why I decided to make this post. I want to see how many others on here like meeting new people and making new friends through the internet.\n\nAnd if you‚Äôre feeling lonely and need a friend or could just use someone to talk to, feel free to PM me. I‚Äôd love to chat :) 
2	I wish I could do that. I fail in real life and I fail online. I am not a good friend.
1	I find making friends hard either way, mostly because as I've gotten older the pickier I've gotten with who I consider friends.  I just don't often meet people who I feel happy going out of my way to spend time with.  Whether I have more online friends or irl friends depends on where I happen to find someone I like who'll introduce me to new people.  Either way I'll open up to anyone who cares to be inquisitive and retreat into my shell when they don't seem to care, regardless of whether I want to be their friend or not.
2	A dilemma - get out of comfort zone, or do what makes you happy?	So I have a dilemma.... A week or so ago, whilst high at a festival, I had a meltdown in front of my bf and another friend about how sad I was and how I want more friends. \n\nMy bf is used to these meltdowns so is all lovely and comforting at the time and then knows to not bring it up again when I'm sober cos he knows I don't really mean it and/or will never do anything about it.\n\nThis other friend however, who I only ever see at group events, is a lovely human and is clearly worried and has now obviously resolved to make  more effort so has invited me out for dinner. \n\nTonight.\n\nProblem is, most of the time I'm happy on my own, I only freak out once or twice  a year whilst drunk or high and  on a day to day basis am perfectly fine with being my introved anti-social self. I HATE one on one social activities because I get real bored real quick and there's no escape. \nSo I'm really not feeling like going out for dinner tonight and would be perfectly happy staying in and getting started on my next sewing project.\n\nBUT I know my bf is going to disapprove (he's an extrovert, and doesn't quite get why I don't just go out and make friends)\n\nAND my inside voice is also kinda nagging me that I should make an effort and be more social cos then I won't have bi-annual loneliness meltdowns....\n\nWhat to do? 
1	Im a bit late to the party so to speak, but im a bit curious. \_If i may ask, how did it go? did you go to the dinner at the end or not?
784	Woah	
61	Yeah this is kind of my life philosophy. First read about thinking about time this way in Slaughter House Five. Every moment, good or bad, is happening in its place in time and will never stop happening in that time. It‚Äôs permanent. So when I‚Äôm feeling my darkest I try to go to a time where I was happy and live in that moment. It‚Äôs hard for humans because of the way we conceive of time but if you start to think of time differently, you can try to invoke the emotions of somewhere else in time.\n\nSounds weird but it‚Äôs gotten me through a lot.
34	This is why I have anxiety lol
13	I think this is why we always write ‚Äúnever forget‚Äù in our culture when someone has passed. \n\nAt first, I thought this post was going to talk about multiverses/alternate universes, which would‚Äôve been a completely different topic.
7	But what if people forget? 
6	This actually inspires me to create some art. Or write. But I‚Äôm not in the practice of doing that. Actually, that makes me appreciate (even more) the effect this has on me. \n\nAlso: I read a thing once that seemed to encapsulate this concept a little bit. I think from Pema Chodron or Tich nat Han. Basically that we think of a river as the same entity over time, as though it‚Äôs static. But in actuality, it‚Äôs ever-changing. From one instant to the next, it‚Äôs entirely new in its content and form. But we continue to refer to it by its proper name. \n\nAnd that that‚Äôs how people are, too. Entirely fluid in identity/personality, yet we are under the impression (illusion) that each of us is the same person from birth to death, or day to day, moment to moment. \n\nWe are like rivers. 
7	How would people remember if I was the only one there to see me?
3	Wow...I've thought of this before...can I use this?
4	Wow, that's insightful. And so true.

5	Unexplainable Feelings	Hey everyone, i'm new here. I decided to come due to the intensity of the melancholy i've been feeling today, the sad hopeful type. Walking by my old high school on my way back home it hit me hard. The scenery of the sun setting, a cold evening. The way the wind was blowing. \n\nI almost feel attached to my melancholic feelings when they come. They come and go usually once or twice a month and can last for a few days at a time. I can't really even explain what i'm feeling melancholic about, but i'm listening to piano music now as that keeps the melancholic feel. Maybe the scenery, the distant memories, longing for something but I don't know what it is. I'm in a happy relationship! Things at home could be better but as is life. It's a melancholy I enjoy having around.. Is that odd?\n\n\n\nAlso, somewhat related? This has been happening for YEARS. Sometimes i'll have a dream where I meet someone and feel the strongest love I have ever felt. An extreme sense of comfort and being overcomes me when this person comes to me in my dreams. It's not always the same person physically but it feels like it! There's even been times where they would tell me, "i'll be waiting here for you until the next time!".. I've purposefully taken up meditation and I do so before sleep so I can remember these dreams more clearly and experience them better. I wish I could find an answer as to what this all means..
3	Yeah, that attachment to melancholy seems to be an INFP thing, both from my own experience and lurking around here. I, too, have a playlist just for that. 
4	Deca!!!!!!!!!!!	Hello Norwie. If you find this I just wanted to say hi :D
1	HAAAAIIIII\n\n&#x200B;
1	What's up, brother.
6	Curious to meet another INFP in person....	How many INFPs do you know in person? I don't know any personally, but very curious! 
3	Turns out most of my friends are INFPs, only exception being one INTP. I don't talk to a whole lot of people though
2	Well, in my country, even most INFP's are very judging. It's pretty hard to tell. Also most INFP's behave and think like INFJ's here. and INFJ's tend to think like ISFJ's. ISFJ's are all over the place and it feels like they have many subtypes here.\n\nAnyway, once I really got into MBTI, I started noticing that more people than I think in my life are INFP. In fact, I just didn't notice before and thought that I didn't know INFP's. \n\nMaybe it's because my family is very distant from me, not only in MB, but also in everything else that has to do with personality. The only one in my family that is somewhat close is my grandmother, an ENFP. Love visiting her. She's also much more interesting and closer as a person regardless of her MBTI type.  \n\nBut apparently, my singing teacher is an INFP, my ex's best friend might be an INFP, a few distant friends are INFP's... With that being said, I've never got real close to one. In fact, I don't get close to people, almost at all. I've only got a bit close with an INTJ but it's over now. \n\nSomething important:\nMBTI types are presented like videogame character classes. And everyone is perfect and beautiful. Well, the descriptions they show for each type is in a very actualised, blossoming form. Most people are not nearly as close to the description in terms of their flourishing as a personality. Also, people are so different from one another and MBTI is just 4 traits. And finally it's also worth noting that for instance feelers can feel less than some thinkers and vice versa. \n\nWhy am I saying this?\nBecause not all INFP's you're going to meet will be the same and will not necessarily be like you. That's why it took me so long to realise that some people in my life are actually similar to me and heck also happen to be INFP's. 
2	I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever met one because, well, you know how adaptable or closed off we can be. But I have met a few ENFPs, they are pretty easy to spot.
2	Found out my dear friend from my first year at college is an INFP. the only friend that I still talk to, aside of one other person who also happens to be INFP! LOL. I spent Christmas with her family in Alaska one year and fit right in. I was surprised. Spent all of last summer with her. There is literally no one else I could stand to be with all the time for 3 months straight. I love her! We were able to help each other live out our thoughts rather than just sit and think them.
2	My sister and maybe 2 friends.. 
2	currently there's only two that i know of for a fact are also INFPs like me   \nive also found that i have lots of INTP friends as well which kind of surprised me lmao   \n\n\nmy closest friend is also an INFP and we've never even gotten into a serious fight once through out the 5-6 years we've been friends which was always kind of surprising to me. but the more i think about it now , the more its not so surprising since we behave so similar.   \n\n\n(only recently gotten into MBTI tho and tbh im not all that confident in my ability to identify other personality types lmao buuut i honestly think this is worth looking into) 
1	Yes, absolutely. I tried to get one of my friends who I am pretty sure is an INFP to take the test, but he still hasn't. Just curious to meet one!
10	Break ups are hard.	I broke up with my boyfriend (ENTJ) yesterday. I did it. I told him that I didn't want us to be together. I'd thought about it a lot. I knew he wasn't right. Nevertheless, I know I hurt him and I've hurt myself. I thought I would take the time to write about the emotions, now that a day has passed.\n\nGuilt. I hurt him. I really hurt him. I believe he really did love being with me and he didn't want us to end.\n\nSadness. This is the biggest understatement of the year. I feel terrible. There were positive aspects of our relationship and we did get along quite well. \n\nRelief. In a sense, I'm glad that it's over. We were never going to last.\n\nFinally, why did I decide to break up? I felt like we lacked an emotional connection. I want a partner who I can talk to and be open with, but he didn't want to do that. He didn't like to talk about our inner feelings. He wouldn't open up to me about his own feelings and when I spoke to him about mine, he'd try to change the direction of the conversation. This was the main reason why. There were other little things, but they were less important. \nWas I being petty? \nShould I have persevered? \nI really don't know. Advice would be appreciated, or feel free to share your own stories.\n\nI thought I'd link this clip from BoJack Horseman. It's quite relevant to me at the moment.\n(Warning Season 5 spoilers)\nhttps://youtu.be/g4x9u6OU214
6	Good for you for doing the right thing, even though it was hard.\n\nI had an ENTJ ex who would dissociate if I tried to bring up difficult or emotional topics. He would space out for a sec and then start talking about jeans. Yes, I am dead serious, JEANS. It was extremely weird, some kind of coping mechanism. \n\nHe was also really obsessed with gaining friends (regardless of their morals or character) and popularity. He almost cried once when a semi famous instagrammer cancelled a lunch meeting on us. \n\nThey cannot stand being alone and most go from one relationship instantly into the next. It's sad.\n\nI am through with ENTJs. They are compelling and fun to be with but in my experience, they do not fit my definition of a good person.

3	GOD that scene with Diane was so fucking powerful to me and I'm honest to god happy that someone else saw what value there was in that scene. I also saw this when I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years (an INFJ) and it honest to god made me spiral so much deeper into my depression i thought i couldn't survive it .   \n\n\nI always had a fear about my relationship with my INFJ boyfriend because it always felt like a kind of love/hate relationship to me. I was never confident in myself or the words I said so I always tried to find some new way to be heard and honestly , talking to him felt like talking to a brick wall sometimes.   \nHe's a really sweet guy to be honest, and i still hope even now he finds happiness in his life but the constant flip flop between us was always there. We fought a lot in the beginning , we fought a lot in the end. I either did too much or did too little, and it felt like he just always wanted to do something to the point where he'd become unstoppable in his goals. It was exhausting and draining and I never felt like anything I did made any impact.   \n\n\nyou're valid as fuck my guy and im always gonna be hoping for your health and happiness <3 this post honest to god spoke to me and made me felt understood in a way i never thought i could be.  \nkindness from strangers online lmao amirite 
2	Yeah, sounds like you were not getting your emotional needs met.  I like to have a deep connection with my partner too, but I‚Äôve never found the right person.  It sucks.  
1	Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day...	
40	Came across this while playing slime rancher, really hit home	
4	How is slime rancher? I was thinking of grabbing it just to have something to play that's relaxing.
5	Yeah except the part where people miss seeing you
1	Ye, i started and finished it last week. I'm glad i bought it. It was a very nice game.
6	What are your daily/weekly routines?	Hey guys! It's your friendly neighborhood ENTP. I'm wanting to create a set of YouTube videos where I follow the "average routine" of each type and then reflect on what I learned. I thought it would be an especially interesting experiment to start with you guys since Fi is my blindspot.  \n\n\nAll ideas welcome! It doesn't matter how unstructured you think you are. Happy V-Day. üòâ
5	I really struggle with routine, so I try to avoid it as much as possible. At the moment the main activities/responsibilities in my life are my university degree which involves a lot of writing, working (support worker), hiking with my dog, hanging out with friends, volunteering in a sexual health clinic, working on projects, looking after my niece (who is 4 and thinks EVERYTHING is an adventure) and some self care stuff (yoga, swimming). \n\nHowever this usually all jumbled together and no week, or day, looks the same. One day I could be working a 14 hour shift, the next spending a whole day outside with my dog, the next in meetings for project work all day.. it really varies.. and that is how I like it. 
5	Daily routine would be something along the lines of wake up, smoke a bowl, shower & eat, off to work , home, smoke another lil guy, gym, home, then either go out with friends or chill home and play games/read/smoke more. \n\nAm low-key dependent on pot atm 
3	The most important daily part of my routine is meditation. I make time for it because every time I slack my quality of life goes way down.\n\nI put very deliberate effort into having alone time without a lot of noise or distractions. I like to have peace and quiet at the end of the day. That being said, I've recently started putting more effort into being social again. Otherwise, I get home from work and either work on some crafting projects or clean. I try to stay in the habit of cleaning because having a welcoming home makes me feel so good. My home almost feels like an extension of myself, so I put a lot of focus into it. \n\nI meal prep once a week and really want to start canning and my own garden. I do a lot of knitting and crochet. Big fan of movies and music. Love everything about music. Wish I could play an instrument but I don't. Thinking about taking up painting.\n\nI used to exercise a lot, but I'll admit I let that slip after a very emotionally difficult year.
3	Weekly but not necessarily daily: cooking a big meal to last 2-3 days, running, some yoga and exercise, painting, reading books and blogs, watching tv/movies, browsing social media, salt baths, nature walks, fantasizing about a better life lol
2	Kundalini yoga 2x a week, running and weights 1x a week, meditation pretty much daily for at least 15 mins,  hygiene, reading, hobbies like writing, crochet, learning new things, watch some show/movie of interest. Weekly astrology forecast. Cooking I like homemade meals, and I drink a latte most days usually chai or London fog or some herbal stuff. Work on my personal goals. I listen to music pretty much most of the day while I do things, and have my aromatherapy machine going, and I sage a couple times a week to clear the energy, and pray particularly before a meal offering gratitude and sustenance for all beings in existence. Nothing is in order just off the top of my head and an approximation. üôÇ
2	Daily routine: hard af to get out of bed sometimes so, using atleast 20 minutes sleeping right after i get woken up.\nLove Entp's, think you're super fun and brave.
18	Are we often lonely because we are so selective?	And also introverted, often shy, slow to trust... And being sensitive not everyone actually gets us at all, they just find us weird.\n\nBut then we also need someone with similar values and morale. Then that godforsaken "I want to have an intimate relationship with my best friends" - you just don't get there in a few weeks. Trust takes time.\n\nI feel like there's a long and specific list for me before I want to make close friends with someone. Thankfully I already have few good ones around.
5	Yes. But then this attitude only really works when you have a big enough applicant pool. :P You have to give people a chance. 
3	I‚Äôm lonely because I have lost trust in people, since I‚Äôve been taken advantage of one time too many.  I‚Äôm very guarded around strangers and co-workers. 
3	I think that I'm lonely because I'm not selective. I'm desperate, waiting like an uninvited guest in a yacht party, waiting for someone to notice me, save me, anyone. And people aren't drawn to that... I think that friends are for the selective. Ironic.
3	I dunno why, I just feel like I have so many questions for this group in recent days: Does anyone else feels like people are constantly being condescending to them? Not everyone, but enough people that you actively notice?	Not trying to be dramatic, just curious. 
2	YES. \nAnd seriously underestimating me or treating me like a child. It makes me wonder if i should change something about my demeanor or appearance to convince them otherwise but then I come to my senses and kinda laugh about it to myself. 
1	Do you mean people in this sub being condescending or just the people in our personal lives?
3	What does it mean for an INFP to be very perceiving of others??????????	How is an INFP perceiving of others? What are some examples? Can you read their minds or body language? Do you see hidden intentions? Do you see both good and bad? Please explain. I'm highly fascinated to figure out what 'perceptive of others' means.
10	I just get vibes off of people. Almost like I imagine a dog or cat would. No type of solid information, more just a general idea of what their real intentions are either in support of, or in spite of, what they're saying. I used to push it to the side, and I do still give everyone a chance, but its frightened me how often my assessment of their general motives has been spot on.\n\nI was just saying to someone the other day: I rarely if ever judge someone based on just their words. Body language and just general gut feeling play a big role. 
7	Hah ur wild dude , i just get these feelings and dunno what to do with them :^). \n\nYou can definitely read into people‚Äôs minds , you don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre thinking but I feel like you know why they‚Äôre doing what they‚Äôre doing, like the underlying cause to they‚Äôre actions. \n\nThis has not helped me in life , especially in regards to relationships but I‚Äôm definitely curious to hear about others
3	Most of the time I just feel their vibes, like what their mood, intentions, well being is etc. It's vague and I haven't really learned to trust and use that information very well yet. \nThen sometimes if I'm listening to one person talk about a second person and issues with them, I am often able to explain how I think the second person is feeling and why they might have acted the way they did. Sometimes if I'm listening to an an argument, I can mediate and explain both sides of the story. This is something I've done from a young age, I'm not even sure where the information comes from. \nFunny thing is, I'm not good at knowing the exact thoughts of people I'm directly interacting with very well. It only works in third person. I think my own thoughts and feelings get in the way when it's me interacting with someone. This means I can help other people better than myself. I end up feeling like I have poor empathy in some ways because I'm actually not good at putting myself in other people's shoes. I think this could get better with time and experience though.
1	Well I've always been a people watcher since childhood, from all that I can pick up on people's motives or read their problems pretty easily. \n
1	Basically, I can take a situation and imagine what I would be feeling in their shoes. It's almost always spot on. But the thing is, that I don't realize that I'm doing it, until I'm talking it out with someone. "I think you're feeling X and Y, because of Z. That's how I would feel."
1	perceiving=not judging\n\nso perceiving means having a tertiary/inferior judging function (Fe or Te) when looking at function stacks
10	Chuck Palahniuk-	‚ÄúYou realize that our mistrust of the future makes it hard to give up the past. We can‚Äôt give up our concept of who we were. All those adults playing archaeologist at yard sales, looking for childhood artifacts, board games, CandyLand, Twister, they‚Äôre terrified. Trash becomes holy relics. Mystery Date. Hula Hoops. Our way of getting nostalgic for what we just threw in the trash, it‚Äôs all because we‚Äôre afraid to evolve. Grow, change, lose weight, reinvent ourselves. Adapt.‚Äù
1	Is it his way of describing the Fi-Si loop?
3	What the hell is a Magenter?	I'm curious what the correlation is between INFPs and liking the Rocky-Horror (late night double feature (fuck your teacher)) Picture Show.  \n\nMy guess is that it's pretty high.\n\n
2	I‚Äôve heard about it, but it looked really weird so I avoided watching it. 
1	Never seen it before
13	I remember I want love	During today's meditation I had a realisation. It was a distraction to be observed mindfully then ;), but I remember it now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remembered I have a dream to have a wholesome family. And it flooded me with memories.\n\nHow fun it is to spin her around and make her laugh. To not say a word and just look into each other's eyes.\n\nTo do little things, different things for each other. To give a small wooden stick as a gift, because it means something for both of us.\n\nTo care about someone in a loving way, so they love themselves more and grow.\n\nTo touch. To dominate sexually in a loving way, without controlling.\n\nTo have hope. To explore an area of life that is precious to me. To actually enjoy going on a **DATE**. I know people don't use this word, because it has expectation weight in it. For me it's beautiful, because it simply implies romantic interest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was buried under all the rejections and bad experiences I had in last few years. Neglected, while I was focusing on self-healing, self-love, ironically ignoring what I really like. Even hating myself for being romantic, because it wasn't working for me at the time. Well, this is what was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI may not like the fact that it's always "best" to play it cool, to not assume anything until *it just happens*, to be emotionally unavailable, which appearently is the most seductive thing in the world. I don't like that, I don't take that, I may not have a success without that. But life is full of surprises. It surprised me many times already, why wouldn't it surpirise me again?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater I checked the calendar. And laughed. :D Love to you all, friends. Remember, if you don't believe you can find find love, it is only due to past experiences. And those few or maybe even plenty of bad experiences don't define the rest of your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqSraJpqfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwqSraJpqfs)
48	I recently started sketching my thoughts and feelings before sleeping. Rather curious to see how my day to day sketches will vary and what my state of mind was. I call this one "in and out of the meat suit."	
5	Love it! Keep drawing and posting please! r/drawing would probably love to see this too! 
3	Take up digital drawing too! 
3	I think about tits before I sleep too\n\nJoke aside, looking back on your state of mind over time is a very useful tool, such as journaling or drawing. Hope you understand yourself more through the journey
2	I wish I could get into charcoal sketching, but it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve had the passion. I guess it wouldn‚Äôt matter if they were only for my eyes. I journal, though. Have you shown your artwork to anyone else?
39	Fragmented speech?	I‚Äôm not sure if this is just a me thing, but sometimes I find it hard to express  my thoughts or ideas verbally.  The speech comes out fragmented or awkwardly.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? I wonder if this could be related to being an INFP, maybe some fault in my brain or even a form of social anxiety.\n\nI am curious to hear your thoughts! 
12	Me too! I have fragmented speech and terrible word retrieval (I can never think of the word I want to say right in the moment). It happens even when I'm talking to someone I'm comfortable with (when I feel comfortable, I just get more persistent in trying to make my fragmented speech make sense to the other person). I wonder if it's because it's a sort of underdeveloped thing, as I was always a quiet kid growing up. Sort of like how politicians have stump speeches they always stick to and repeat, I wonder if my list of stump phrases, words, sentences that I fall back on and can easily recall is very limited compared to the average person. But I noticed there are people who seem fairly social who also talk in fragments. Maybe it's a combination of brain and environmental influences that cause this...
10	Absolutely! This happens to me all the time. I have a hard time organizing what I want to say and thinking of the right words to express it. Then it comes out sounding choppy and awkward. Also, sometimes I lose confidence and trail off into mumbling at the end of my sentence. Whoops.
7	Yep, wow. I‚Äôve never been able to put words to it but I experience this too. I have so many thoughts in my head, but when I try to translate them to speech, sometimes it feels like all the thoughts are just hitting a wall and getting lost in translation, and come out fragmented like you said.  \n\nSometimes it depends on the person I‚Äôm talking to or my mood though. Sometimes I‚Äôm feeling really confident and articulate or just have a really good flow with a certain person. But in general I‚Äôm bad at telling stories or holding the floor for extended periods of time. 
4	I can certainly relate and it‚Äôs something I genuinely struggle with! That on top of being anxious in certain crowds, headaches, and occasionally being too tired to interact makes for a mess. Especially socially. Which is why I try to surround myself with people who genuinely understand me. I have always been a Very strong writer though. If I ever feel self conscious I usually say it‚Äôs from a migraine. It sounds a lot better than INFP brain fog. Remember those moments don‚Äôt reflect your knowledge and don‚Äôt let them define you or make you self conscious. 
5	Yes! I‚Äôm great at writing but if I talk to anyone or a group of people, I hit a wall. I can‚Äôt finish sentences or find the right word. I can‚Äôt remember the name of the Netflix documentary I‚Äôm talking about. My therapist mentioned that I don‚Äôt finish my sentences and it made me really insecure about it. 
3	Yes. Though it is very rewarding when I pause for a moment to focus and then I say something very precisely, meaning exactly what I want it to mean. It's like in a split second my intuition goes through all the known words, grabs the necessary ones and puts them in the right order. ...it's probably how it works for everyone :D But it is beautiful to watch how it happens.
3	We're in the same boat.  I think a lot of us are like this!  It tends to float out in little clouds, one after another.  We can be very talkative in an almost hyper, agitated way, but this is often punctuated with weird silences.
3	I'm either this, or I put out too many words and ideas rapidly. Either way people take a moment to understand, haha
3	This seems common with HSP types. There's just so much to what we think or feel. Words mostly can't describe it.\n\nTo me it's like using emojis to communicate a feeling. As my girlfriend says, "They just don't convey the depth of the feeling."
2	Yep, I've always had problems as this. I can find words or fillers... Mostly fillers, and I don't exactly always know how to order them.
2	Massive yes from me. I actually made a post about this in this sub a few months back
2	Apparently I take forever when speaking sometimes but to me it feels like no time goes by at all! Lost a debate to that though...
2	It's very difficult to describe an understanding that is arrived at through intuition, because it bypasses logic. That I think is the real difficulty for us.\nStudies have shown however, that intuition actually integrates far more information than the simple conscious brain could ever process, therein, making it next to impossible to explain with the language of "logic."\nI think metaphors can be helpful for me at times, but only to communicate with people who are also intuitive feelers. Sensors often look me up and down and sideways and sometimes go so far as to tell me I'm irrational or even dumb. Oh well. It's too much energy to explain myself to those people anyway, it's mostly futile and a little self-destructive to even try. It's unrealistic to expect people to get me, when half the time even I don't understand my process, it comes from a feeling of a deep inner knowing.
2	Yes! I think the INFP mind has a way of taking in information and fracturing it in an effort to be able to understand it. It's like when someone takes apart a model car to see how it works, but they are unable to put it back together again. Or like a light prism, we can take a white light and turn it into a beautiful rainbow, but it's harder to turn the prism on it's head and do the reverse. Especially if i'm upset, I will be completely in my mind trying to figure out what's upsetting me, how to fix it, etc. but when someone asks me what's wrong, my mind goes blank and it's very frustrating.  
1	I didn't expect to find so many individuals that are experiencing what I am! From everything that I have read, it sounds spot on to what I often go through when trying to communicate. I pondered for awhile what caused it, and I wasn't sure if it was due to my personality, if I was just simply inept in this area, or maybe it was health related and I was missing out on some key nutrients. Now I can see that it may just be part of being an INFP for some of us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you everyone for also providing your insight into the problem and what you experience. This information was very helpful for me, and I hope it will help some others as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Very much so. When I'm in person, taking verbally, it all comes out jumbled. Sometimes I wish I could pull the images, feelings, thoughts, etc out of my head, heart, body, and show them to the other person that way instead of trying to rely on speech. 
1	If I just pause and give it some thought I can usually reword it into an easy-to-relate metaphor or analogy that connects easier to the person I‚Äôm talking to. Anyone else?
6	How to format text and everything in Reddit	Thought this could be helpful to whoever had questions on how to do these things!! \n\nhttps://amp.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/
2	Thanks!
2	thanks!
30	Is this our destiny?	
6	It‚Äôs funny how such a seemingly normal thing as community is actually missing in a lot of people‚Äôs lives. Each person only has so much time, energy and compatibility to really connect with others, and introverts suffer isolation more because we lose time to our intentional solitude. So maybe, our destiny is to fulfill the hole by forming/joining communities
2	I personally find a lot of value in giving help to others, it's almost as if I'm justifying my existence through that act of giving. It's just recently that I have begun asking questions like what do I want? And mostly I don't get an answer but sometimes I do catch myself wanting something and make a mental note of it. Otherwise I guess it's easier to feel useful by helping people with their needs, rather than asking myself what I want and feeling no sense of purpose.\n\nEdit: words.
1	>is this our destiny?\n\nNot unless you allow it to be.

19	I can't stand people who overwhelm me with rapid questions.	You know the type. They mean no harm but they interrupt you, don't give you time to think, ask "why" you're doing this and that. "Why aren't you going out on a Friday???"\n\nJust had another one of these "conversations " and he kept on even though I was trying to continue reading my book. In the end I snapped a bit and he finally got it. Lol. Poor bloke.

2	Ooooh sugar, I feel that. I‚Äôve got a roommate that I absolutely love, but I‚Äôll be watching Netflix and have to pause it while he talks to me about something completely random for 20 - 40 minutes. I gotta stop him if I ever want to finish anything. 
2	‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you going out on a Friday?  Don‚Äôt you know that not having plans on Friday is actually illegal?  You don‚Äôt want to be put on death‚Äôs row!‚Äù

7	How do you keep your spirits buoyant when the Universe keeps sending you situations in which you can't recharge?	Hello all,\n\nLet's just say the past few months have been difficult as I've had to uproot myself from my former living situation and move back in with my folks. I love them, but I just don't feel at home with the dynamics at their house. I crave my own space and my own headspace. I've been planning to get away and take a break, but an emergent family problem is making me feel like I should stay for a little bit more and see that they're going to be okay.\n\nI just can't shake the feeling of "all I want is to spend time alone, but I can't have that". I also feel like opportunities are passing me by with the waiting.\n\nAny advice on how I can shift my perspective? I want to be there for my folks even at least for just a short while. But how can I maintain my headspace and cultivate a hopeful and positive attitude that things will move on and I'll get to do what I want to do eventually?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate it.
3	A few things you could try. \n\nSpeak your emotions out as much as you can: I'm sorry, I need to be alone now. I feel tired today and not very chatty, it's not personal. Thank you for your opinion but I need to think about it alone now. I'm sure the situation is stressing for your parents too, reminding them (and yourself!) of your feelings won't hurt.\n\nAlso just quietly noting your frustration can help you to be more at peace with it.\n\nYou highlight that you "can't" have more space but I've heard so many people say that (I can't this or that) when it wasn't the reality. Your well-being should always be your priority. Don't get burnout. Sacrificing too much will get you drained.\n\nYou said you moved in with your parents, but you're a grown up now. Once again, focus on communicating of your needs. Express positive feelings, gratitude etc but don't be afraid if you feel like you're not treated as a grownup or like you're at home. Whatever it is for you.\n\nBasically if I were you I would maximise your alone time and possibilities of getting away and try to communicate of your feelings and needs. Best of luck :)
2	To answer based on how you worded your title:  If the universe is sending you situations in which you cannot recharge, it might be to give you the chance to learn that you don't need to as much as you believe you do.  That is, you are capable to getting by with less need to recharge, but haven't figured it out yet.  The perspective shift is from 'life is bearing down on me' to 'life is pushing me to do differently' - and such opportunities come up only because we *are* able to pull off whatever change is needed.
11	Famous & Fictional INFP's	I found this list of famous people with our personality and fictional characters who portray us as well. The list is full of surprises and eye openers and I enjoyed it, thought I'd share it here:\n\n[https://www.personalityclub.com/blog/famous-infp/](https://www.personalityclub.com/blog/famous-infp/)
4	Love this, thank you! David Lynch, Bob Marley, Thom York, to name a few that I really admire...... Amazing üòÅ
3	How could they leave out Eddy Scissorhands? He's the ULTRA INFP OVERLORD
18	I made a video about the creative process/how to deal with creative blocks/motivational issues. I think many of you guys might be able to relate to this stuff!	
2	I love how sage-like you come across, and your thoughtfulness and empathy. It's calming to hear to talk. :) 
2	Thank you! I'm off to watch it. :) 
2	Things that make you cope?	Hello my fellow infps (: I‚Äôm gonna be honest Ive never been able to hold down a job. I have been working the bare minimum but it is required of me to work more now. I have just been feeling really down and haven‚Äôt been able to break out of the cycle. I know that if I‚Äôm going to have to work full time that is very draining and I need to schedule in things that uplift me. I live on a main road in a dodgy area with my boyfriends family where it is so hot I rarely can have alone time in my room as we don‚Äôt have aircon. The room is quite ugly and poky too. I know I should be more appreciative but I just need to uplift myself somehow. Im interested in what you guys do to I guess spark inspiration energy and joy to cope with a system that makes it hard for us to flourish. Here are some ideas:\n\nDriving somewhere to see a beautiful sunrise\n\nCreating an Instagram to write poetry or share edited photos\n\nDoing a woodworking course $$$\n\nBuying flowers for myself ü§ì\n\nMaking scented candles/ bath bombs to enjoy\n\nGoing to the art gallery ( I live in Brisbane and the museums pretty lame though)\n\nGoing to the library\n\nListening to audiobooks with headphones in the ac\n\nLearning the art of macrame\n\nResearching and growing indoor plants\n\nMaking the bed everyday with beautiful clean sheets\n\nWould love to here how u guys have learnt to cope or any suggestions u might have (:
1	Playing with my bunnies, relaxing in bed, napping, listening to music, talking to my closest friends, journaling, etc. :) 
2	Which personality type seem to ‚Äúwork on autopilot‚Äù the most?	I get criticized at work sometimes for making exceptions. I respect rules but I‚Äôm not bound to them, I look at everything individually.\nThen there are people that will follow rules to the T. \n\nexamples:\n a stop light has been red for over 5 minutes at 2 am but they will not run it, despite the light probably being broken and no one is around.\nOr sweeping a floor despite it being clean and not being used all day, because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scheduled to sweep the floor according to my job duties‚Äù\n\nIn my opinion, most xSTJs seem like this. 
3	Yes. ESTJs totally. I think it's the sensor part the most though. For the most part, ESTJs and I don't understand each other at all. It used to really offend me, but since I realized it was because of personality type, I've come to understand and accept it more.
1	LOL.
4	I think I‚Äôm in love with Meg Myers...	
2	Ey, she's good !
2	Desire
2	Am a dude in my 30‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt think anyone my sex and age is into Meg Myers. That aside, her music is incredible. It brings out a lot of emotion in me. \n\nShe sings about jealousy in a few songs, which is a big issue I have in my life. My favorite song of hers: Jealous Sea. Lyrics aside, I find the music just very dark and powerful in that song. The music does this occasional leading tone thing at the end of some phrases where it goes from Ab minor to Gb right before starting the next measure, which first happens at 0:57 that just tickles me deeply. That chord change feels amazing and I‚Äôm not sure why. \n\nReally wish she was on tour right now! I‚Äôd pay good money to see her live. \n
1	Shes a cutie isnt she? \n
295	This is my favourite place to sit and listen to the sound of crashing waves.	
18	Better hope the extroverts in your life don‚Äôt find this post.

3	This looks like pure bliss to me
2	That‚Äôs beautiful.

2	Gorgeous!
3	Woooow, it looks so peaceful. 
4	I want to have sex there so bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Why the downvotes? It's romantic as hell.

3	I really love the visual ending of this. 
2	I like it. \n\nBut swords are definitely tongues.
2	Excellent!
5	I'm going through a real hard time. And the song that reflects my current *status* is walk on water by Eminem. I've put up a metaphorical analogy (if you can call it that) and I'd love if someone helps me...	So here goes,\n\nWalk on Water\n\nLYRICS\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water\nBut only when it freezes (fuck)\n\nWhy, are expectations so high?\nIs it the bar I set?\nMy arms, I stretch, but I can‚Äôt reach\nA far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as\nSoon as I grab, squeeze\nI lose my grip like the flying trapeze\nInto the dark, I plummet\nNow the sky's blackening, I know the mark‚Äôs high\nButter-flies rip apart my stomach\nKnowing that no matter what bars I come with\nYou're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow\nSo I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis\nI feel the ice cracking, because\n\n\n*Why are expectations so high? I guess this line is pretty self explanatory. I've always been a victim of high expectations. I'm not a bright kid mind you, but I've always been at the forefront to help someone. I've never abandoned someone who needed my help. And even if i had ignored someone, i went forward later and apologized for that. For me, I can't stand sadness. I've had to face enough sadness throughout my life... And i can't watch anyone else suffer. Ik this is like a far fetched example. You can't truly end suffering and sadness. But i believe you can damn well make it a little bearable. And in that short moment, thats all you need. To bear the sadness.*\n*I've always done that. Stood there for people who needed my help even though i was a sad mess myself. I wasn't able to function properly but i remember days where i stood beside someone and helped them. That sounds pretty god complex of me i understand, but I'm not typing this from that view.*\n*And people just expected me to be there all the time. I was surrounded, 24x7 by problems. And i wasn't able to tackle all of them at once. So people left. Generalized that I hold other people at a much higher priority cause i rushed to help them first. Thats not true. And no matter what bars i set, people always look down and say; you weren't there... I can't be there for everyone, I understand. But you need to understand this too... I'm no Jesus.*\n\nIt's the curse of the standard\nThat the first of the Mathers disc set\nAlways in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet\nWill this step just be another misstep\nTo tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?\nThe rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless\nAnd it always feels like I'm hitting the mark\n'Til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart\nLike, "this shit is garbage"\nGod‚Äôs given me all this\nStill I feel no different regardless\nKids look to me like as a God, this is retarded\nIf only they knew, it's a facade and it‚Äôs exhaustive\nAnd I try to not listen to nonsense\nBut if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence\nMission accomplished\nI'm not God-sent\nNas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so\n\n\n*I wonder these days if helping people is even worth it... This happened to me in real life; my closest friend was really unhappy the other day and i decided to help her. One of my friends (also a girl) came up to me and said she wants to talk. I wasn't able to do that since my closest friend was crying and was on the verge of breaking apart. I wasn't able to help that other friend. Later, i went up to her and said I was sorry i wasn't there. But ofcourse she assumed I've feelings for my closest friend and helped her cause of that reason. Which isn't the truth... Now one can say that she was wrong in assuming that and all... That she was being selfish... Ofcourse she was. I understand that now. But it begs the question, how many times has this happened?*\n*And ofcourse people look to me for advice. And i just want to give the best advice/help that is possible from my part. Sometimes i don't know how to respond, but i give advice regardless. And i go home, and have a sleepless night thinking; I shouldn't have said that. That's not helpful at all.*\n*Everyone looks to me as that intelligent kid who's caring and doesn't have a problem in his life but thats wrong. I've been a mess for as long as i can remember... And unfortunately, i haven't been able to fix myself. How can someone, who's so understanding and caring and gives such a good advice and help, be a broken piece of shell? That's impossible! He's looking for attention that's all... That's the stereotype I've to face... Even after everything... Now ofcourse I've people in my life who I'm grateful for. I love them. Infact, if you're reading this, i love you man. Thanks for being there for me. I just hate to be misjudged. I'm not that person...*\n*People gossip about me. I wasn't the one to listen to gossip, but hey... I'm a human and it does affect me. A lot. Especially these days when I don't even know what the fuck is going on. I try to talk, to express, to cry... But I can't. Its as if I'm cockblocked... Lmao to that analogy. This post might be the closest I've come to sharing my problems in a long time.*\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nMaking my mistakes, oh if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\n\nIt's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess\nAt times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest\nA flawed human, I guess\nBut I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations¬†\nAnd meet 'em, but first, the "Speedom" verse\nNow, Big Sean, he's going too fast\nIs he gonna shout or curse out his mom?\nThere was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm\nEvery album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on\nAnd now I'm getting clowned and frowned on\nBut the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun\nAm I lucky to be around this long?\nBegs the question, though\nEspecially after the methadone\nAs yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground\nAnd all that's left of my house is lawn\nThe crowds are gone\nAnd it's time to wash out the blonde\nSales decline, the curtains drawn\nThey're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind\nAnd everyone who has doubt, remind\nNow take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times\nNow let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes\nAnd as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine\n'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight\nWhen I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?\nBut when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine\nI won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine\nBut I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause\n\n*As i said, people have often misjudged me. More often than not, I'm called to be a free spirit. I like to joke. I like to jest. I like to act like an idiot if it makes someone laugh. I've never quite had a personality of my own... So I'm always like learning and adapting Myself to other people. Ofcourse people say stuff like "he doesn't give a shit about other people. He's caught up in his own world. The only reason he helps is cause wants attention. He doesn't care. Doesn't do his assignments. Doesn't study." I've always been a victim to these allegations. And even now, people misjudge me. I'm not like that. I'm really not like that. I try my best at everything.*\n*Ofcourse i haven't opened up to anybody, but thats cause no one gave me a chance. I have a bad day, i meet the people i love. They say; "why do you have a sad face? Its rotten!" And before I can explain myself, they walk away. I put on a happy face. I try to distract myself with all the 'stupidness' and then, I'm a victim of "look how he's doing nothing. He's doesn't give a fuck."*\n*I just wish people would give me a chance. Like look at my assignments. Look at my studies. Ask me about my future. Ask me what i want to be. Ask me if I'm ok today! Ask me how my day was... Ask me... Please. Maybe I'm being selfish. And paranoid. And both...*\n*Another reason why i never shared was because i always think I'm being selfish. And no one said otherwise. I always put others before myself. Even if it meant I'm going in a huge loss. But no one saw that... Everyone gossips behind me... And no matter how good I'm, i just... Can't seem to change that. I don't want to be misjudged.*\n*As time moves on, people drift away. They stop talking to me. Cause of all these gossips and the talks. I am alone. Even after everything i did. But i still stay here... Cause I don't wanna walk alone. I don't wanna be alone.*\n*I have told this to just one person, but these days, I'm suffocating from lack of human touch. Yep. That's a thing. I just want someone to hug me. I just want to like stay close to someone and just stay in silence. Just holding hands. I don't care who that person is... I just want to feel human touch. A friendly touch.*\n*No matter how many times i keep on rushing and proving Myself, i always seem to fall short. And then, boom! I've just lost a person. And that feeling hurts me so much...*\n*But I won't ever approach that person who hurt me and tell him stuff thats hurting me. I'd never show I'm weak. I'm desperate yes... I'm really fuckin desperate. But there's a shred in me that says "you're feeling fuckin fantastic dude. Don't worry. Don't go to them. Let them walk away..."*\n*And even though i know that i should make all the toxicity go away, i wonder how many people I'd be left with at the end... If i let them go, what if i end up all alone?*\n\n*PS: i know Eminem didn't write this song the way i picture it. I understand his intentions. Its just my take on it cause its so dayum relatable to my situation.*\n\nI've been caught up in some shit recently. If you read this till the end, i really appreciate it. Thank you. I'm an absolute mess. And being an overthinking infp, it doesn't help... 
2	This is weird, I too take this song and make it my own,not as detailed as this but I understand what you're trying to say
2	This song came out exactly when I needed it, I felt every word. When I hear it now it reminds me so much of how far I've come in a year. Eminem got has always had a way of expressing exactly how I feel.....Cinderella Man has always been my go to song.
1	Thank you! And remember your on your way to, whether it feels like it or not you're always moving forward, bcz time only moves forward. Have faith in yourself, I got faith in you!
733	I hate myself for being like this.	
100	Ouch, that hits close to home.\n\nThough, I just suck at first contact. If someone initiates conversation with me I‚Äôm fine, but I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around the concept of randomly talking to someone I don‚Äôt know. 
70	You‚Äôre not shy! You‚Äôre afraid of conflict and rejection!\n\nYou‚Äôll just fall in love with the idealized versions of your crushes, put them so high up on pedestals that even just saying ‚Äúhi‚Äù seems unthinkable!
52	Does anyone else have the problem of their shyness coming off as narcissism? I feel like some people avoid me cause they think I want to be left alone. No, it‚Äôs the opposite. Please talk to me. I won‚Äôt talk much, but I like listening.
29	Why are you targeting me?
14	While I am proud to be an INFP, reasons like this are why I reject typology and force myself to try to to better : / 
8	How do i break an INFPs shyness? Ive asked her to hangout a few times but she just makes excuses but i feel as if she likes me.
7	stop telling my most intimate fears to the whole internet _damn_
7	How I managed to get a girlfriend who is also an INFP is beyond both of us üòÖ\n\n
6	And when you get through your shyness and talk to a girl you really like and let yourself be you with her she finds out you are a great listener so you become a good friend. Which is not exactly what you wanted.
6	I‚Äôm so shy. So shy that I type posts out on here and never post them. I did my first post on here yesterday though! Small steps...
5	Am I the only INFP who broke their shyness? I mean, I just eventually learned enough about other people to read them and act accordingly. I work as a sells person actually, I do need alone time to recharge and I used to be extremely shy as a kid. But. I have noticed, there is something magical about us, we have a way of captivating people's attention. The mind is a powerful tool, you are so loved. There is nothing wrong with being shy, but hearing that so many of you hate yourselves, hurts my heart. 
4	Aw someone talk to me :( 
4	I'm honestly not shy. I used to be very shy tho. Reserved more describes me though. Even with my partner I only speak when I have something to say. 
3	And then when you ARE in a relationship, you jeopardize it by never truly opening up to your partner. :):):):)
2	Oof, I like this sub because I can relate to it but I also hate this sub because I relate too much! Gotta love almost being 19 and never even been close to a relationship. There's still hope and plenty more time of course, but seeing others date people frequently sucks.
2	And i don't want to look needy because it's a turn off üòî
2	You can have deep relationships without having to talk. Its called being. If you desire deep 'romantic' relationship then you would have to talk, but since romance is a drama and INFPs move away from that... who craves it? 
2	ENFJ here with INFP sister, just came by to say that you guys are the most beautiful creatures I can imagine! So kind hearted and pure, please embrace and believe in yourself! I love talking but not for people to like me, and not everybody likes me. I just enjoy talking to them, they open up my world. So I hope you guys get out there more so that others get to see what I've seen too. Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è
2	any aromantic INFP?
1	Same
1	hello
1	Same except I'm not interested in romantic romantic relationships that much.
1	Aaaaaah :'(
1	Even though I am not really too shy to talk but I sure as hell am too shy to go on a date or let people close, or trust them.\n\nThis still hits hard. üòÇüòÖ
1	oof too relatable :(
1	And I imagine it be with a person who's about just as shy as I am, but also realize that the world might simply just not work that way
1	I feel attacked üòê
1	Are you me? 
1	I‚Äôm INFP and not shy whatsoever. I just withdraw when I need to. Big difference 
1	This is accurate AF
1	Aughhhhhhhh
1	When you stop taking yourself so seriously (a challenge for INFPs), talking to others comes more naturally. Work on confronting some of your fears pertaining to social interaction (he'll think I'm awkward, they will be annoyed, etc). Expose yourself to your fears and then ask yourself, can I ride this fear out to satisfy my goal?
1	Had the same problem. After the first few (dozen) fails you get a hang of it. You need to learn from your mistakes and keep an open mind though. At one point it won't matter to you anymore.
1	Oof
1	I met my hubby online :) such a great way for us Introverts to meet people! 
1	Close enough grus an infj
1	Sounds about right 
40	Does anyone else love/hate feeling things so strongly?	I constantly struggle with this love/hate relationship with having such strong feelings. They can be amazing sometimes. Like when I‚Äôm listening to music I can strongly resonate with the mood of each song I hear and it‚Äôs great. \n\nBut then on the opposite spectrum when it comes to feelings of sadness or anger it‚Äôs really bad. There are some moments when I wish I just didn‚Äôt feel things so strongly or even at all. Is anyone else familiar with this? 
8	These moments of anger and sadness are moments I wish we didn't have phones. So many angry texts sent. Damn.
5	I have brain damage that has left me unable to feel anything,I was always a romanticist and incredibly passionate person.I long everyday to have my feelings back,to just have a response to a song,I beg all day,but nothing.Trust me it is a harder but much more rewarding and deeper life with strong feelings,everything is epic for us,life is lived at the optimum,our souls rise and descend.Its what makes us most human,what makes us poets,writers,artists,musicians and holds the bonds we have with with each other.What I have now with no feelings is not even a life worth living.Be grateful.
6	Yes, my immediate impulses have to be squashed and even then, it can be unsuccessful. I'm sure it contributed to my depression in the past and some mild mania lately as my outlook has brightened.  I've been on medicine for the lows for years, but am coming to suspect that they need to be adjusted again. 
3	I was just thinking about this today! Yes, especially in the case of anxiety. I love being able to deeply feel the experiences of my life. However, anxieties, failures, and depressive moods are also felt intensely and can sometimes overshadow other emotions. I've spent a long time avoiding feeling (or at least trying) because of how aversive the negative emotions were when they occured. However, after a while I missed them. \n\nOver time I have become more tolerant of negative emotions and try to reassure myself that they are temporary. \n\nAt least when we're feeling something we know we're alive! 
3	I've had to try and exercise some form of control for rage and anger in particular. Slow breathing, closing my room and locking the door, listening to calm music, venting into a text document on my computer (which I securely delete afterwards) until it all subsides. Even running through whatevers bugging me in my head helps sometimes.\n\nOn the other side, I get the same intensity from music as what you seem to be describing, where I can feel the music, try to understand the lyrics as best I can if they have any, feelings that can be easily accessed just by putting my headphones on and listening. I think it's a unique experience to me, with no real focus on anything in particular in the song like others do, and it's something I couldn't imagine living without
2	The more deeply you can feel one the more deeply you can feel the other. The important part is the ability to honestly love. Something most people are not really capable of. 
2	This is relatable. I have extremes. I'm an HSP. It is my best friend and worst enemy. Not many people I've met understand my way of thinking. 
2	Yeah, my emotions can be quite intense at times.  I sing and write music as well as play guitar.  They are all really great avenues for channeling my emotions.  \n\nI have gone into rage many times...many times I have cried while singing and performing...I‚Äôm empathetic and have cried along others in their pain...hard for me to control my emotions at times...
1	HSP? Highly sensitive person. It's not normal.  I am one. 
5	What jobs do you guys have? Also do you enjoy your job?	I'm in college right now and I'm trying to think of what jobs I would want to do in the future.... I am studying environmental science and I like it but I also like psychology a lot and a lot of other things too haha...what do you guys do and also do you like your job? 
5	I used to be an it tech support. Before that i was a janitor for 5 years. Now im back in college taking psychology.\n\nI miss being a janitor tho, such a chill job with some nice perks. I went to so many concerts because of it. But it didnt pay enough to survive.
4	I've worked a lot of jobs. Sales, janitor, para educator, greens keeper, chain runner. I currently work as a corrections officer at a jail. I really enjoy what I do because it's always changing and interesting.
3	meat maker
3	dog dodger
3	I work in education. I'm an Indigenous Education Officer.  
2	then i went back to the poop patrol for a few
2	Work-at-home graphic artist, although it is my uni‚Äôs work-study job. Idk if it counts?
2	I love it üòÅ
2	Mechanical engineer for 17 years.  It's never quite felt right for me.  It does a great job of paying the bills though.   So I manage to try and see the positives while searching for a new career on the side.
1	poop patrol
8	I feel like my life will never live up to my thoughts on what it COULD be.	I feel like I‚Äôm always waiting for something to happen. And then I snap out of it and try to take control of my life, doing projects and painting and creating music, just doing what I love. But I feel like there‚Äôs just SO much to life that we will never get to experience, because they‚Äôre impossible to experience. I rarely feel bored, but sometimes I think to myself, ‚Äúis this it?‚Äù  \n\nI‚Äôm struggling because this is an inexplicable feeling. I feel like life is HUGE but I can‚Äôt think of any experiences that are possible to have that will make me feel satisfied with my life; I will always be waiting and searching. I travel, meet people, create art, and do drugs to get new experiences, but I feel like I will eventually run out of new experiences. Does this make any sense to anyone else?\n
3	Thing is, when you wait for life to be something, you will end up feeling frustrated. Most of life's moments are not magical. So much of it is doing dishes and writing job interviews, all those mundane things we dreamers disdain.\n\nIt can be hard to be connected with what we want. But we need to act. We need to do stuff for it to be what it could be. Not that it always should or can be great. Pushing your comfort zone is a great hobby. Go for things that are exciting and terrifying. Make it a habit to dare yourself, just a little bit, especially if you're shy or fragile. You won't see life go wasted as much. And the kicks you get! Stop every now and then to ask that question: what you would do if you could do absolutely anything. What ifs aside, they can usually be conquered anyway when you really want something.
2	definitely! I think it is to do with being very idealistic
1	Rant/ can anyone else relate too?	I 15f don't know but I been living the past three years of secondary school feeling useless. Because I feel useless I would have low self esteem and tries to find ways that show I would be useless. Like I try studying hard at certain subjects to show at least I'm good at something. But I feel useless idk...I just hate feeling useless it makes me think about my existence :"( can anyone relate?
3	hi there, I‚Äôm 20/f and I felt the exact same way as you at 15. maybe even more so, I let my environments control how I felt and became extremely self destructive. \n\nmy advice to you would be to turn your attention inward: avoid comparing yourself to others (especially online) and explore your passions. I personally took up poetry and photography and I still use them as creative outlets today. \n\nschool was a really rough time for me and it‚Äôs not easy for anybody. I actually ended up dropping out because of how much I hated it, but just know that you‚Äôre never trapped in any situation and you‚Äôre most definitely not useless. everyone has a purpose and if you can‚Äôt find yours, make one. school is a passing thing and I promise you, things will look up. \n\n(sorry if this was a little messy I‚Äôve been up all night haha) if you ever need a place to vent my pms are always open! 
17	How Are You in Discussions?	Usually, I sit back and listen to both sides of a discussion, but if it's something that really "stirs my pot", I chime in. I volunteer my opinion and leave it there.\n\nWhat I don't like is to argue, especially if it is an opinion piece. If opinions are requested and I offer mine, don't tell me I'm wrong, just so I can keep going back and forth with you, because I won't.  \n\nIf I notice that you're a person who is only one sided and judgemental (now, i admit, i can be a little judgy, but I'm open to change; I'm a Virgo üòâ) but I offer an opinion that satisfies both sides, to keep from getting into an argument, I just say "okay". Okay doesn't mean you're right, it just means "you're wearing me out",or "you're pissing me off".  Anyone else?
12	I usually have trouble getting a word in because people won't stop talking for more than 5 seconds.
3	It all depends on how likely I think one or more parties are likely to change their stance on something, based on discussion *alone*. I'm not going to waste my time arguing with someone who is incapable of believing they're wrong, and won't budge on an issue that I feel is negotiable. I'm often mistaken for being more forgiving than I really am, because people have wronged me and I know nothing I say will get them to apologize, or change the situation, so I don't bother arguing or say anything petty/spiteful about someone.\n\nIf I think someone's mind *can* be changed on an issue, I'll attempt to make a visible compromise and/or make it seem like that was really their stance on something. It's hard enough getting some people to change their mind on something; doubly so to get them to publicly admit they were previously wrong.
2	Usually I won‚Äôt chime in unless a really important subject pops up, or if someone says completely wrong or offensive \nGenerally though I‚Äôm not a fan of discussion \n\nI once had a class where participation was part of the grade, and the professor actually told me ‚Äúeven if you‚Äôre not sure you‚Äôre right, just say it‚Äù. I strongly disagree with that. 
2	If it is a serious discussion I usually don‚Äôt say much (if I‚Äôm in a group). If it‚Äôs more like a debate I usually point out flaws in the arguments of others.
2	I don‚Äôt usually say much in a group discussion because most of the time someone already says what‚Äôs on my mind so no need for me to reiterate. I‚Äôll only say something when someone is false and spreading lies. I feel the need to let people know they aren‚Äôt right.
2	I'm just quiet and awkward most of the time unless I'm with my few trusted friends. If I'm with them, I'm extra loud and it doesn't seem like I'm an Introvert at all.\n\nI'm generally better at 1on1 convos, I get less overwhelmed and it's easier for me to stir up a conversation.
1	One on one I get weary quickly but can hold my own. In groups, usually people don't get me and gang up on me. The people closest to me do this the  most. I'm a teaser of others who can't take being teased. 
1	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 14	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
4	What's your favorite love quote or poem? Happy V day everyone ;)
4	It‚Äôs storming in my area and the power is out at work and they made us wait outside for like 10 minutes. We‚Äôre finally inside in the break room. I already have major work anxiety and this isn‚Äôt helping at all. \n\nHope y‚Äôall are enjoying Valentine‚Äôs Day!
4	(Rant) Fuck my dad! He just told i'm not cut out for the job i'm going for that he himself never tried to do. Negative comments like that don't motivate me, they just make dislike you. To be fair things were a little tense before that, mostly my fault. But still what parent says shit like that and assumes i'm going to still have confidence in myself.\n\nOn a side note i'm tired of explaining to my mom i'm just an introvert. I just need space sometimes, it's nothing personal. I don't have social anxiety, I just don't like talking to people for that long.
3	I don't know I feel like becoming a recluse but at the same time I know that's would be very detrimental to me cause I truly do enjoy human interaction but I get tired so quickly. *sigh* It's hard at times.
2	I have decided to let go once these people let me move on.
539	Sorry not sorry for saying it a lotüòã	
29	*squints *\n\nNot sure if INFP or Canadian.
30	I never knew saying sorry was an INFP thing! I am sorry, I should have known better!
12	sometimes when I hit a table or something I say sorry and think deeply about why I said sorry to an inanimate object
9	Yikes I feel attacked 
6	Hahaha! 
6	I to never really knew this was an infp thing.. people get so weirded out when I apologize over the smallest things 
6	Oh gosh I am an INFP aren't I 
4	Lol, so true
3	Lol 
2	I must be the odd INFP never saying this. 
2	My friends make fun of me because I say sorry when people bump into me
1	Oh God. At work I'm pretty sure that's all I say to my coworkers. Then I apologize for it.
1	You've probably heard this before, and it's kind of a thing going around. But I like it and it's pertinent, so I'm going to post it. (Sorry.)\n\n**Instead of "sorry", say "thank you".**\n\nAlso, there's still a lot to say "sorry" for. We're just not saying it for the right things sometimes.
1	Used to do it so much.
1	I feel very attacked, it happened so many times haha
1	Sort of psyched myself out of that habit.  I had a coworker that always apologized.  Nothing unusual there except I was unusually attracted to them and whenever they would say they were sorry in my head I kept thinking about that old (dumbest thing you'll ever hear) 'love means never having to say you're sorry' business so I just drove myself crazy over it and vowed never to say sorry (to them, specifically)\n\nlike as if I could train myself to always be aware that saying sorry sometimes isn't enough and if you don't have this word to lean on as a crutch ...\n\nHopefully somebody sees what I mean in all this rambling.\n\nWhen I'm hanging with somebody I love and care about and the words "i'm sorry" escape my mouth I actually feel a drop in the pit of my stomach like "omg I have sooo totally failed right here whoops" 
1	I get so upset when someone tells me I don't have to say sorry for something.... I always feel like I messed up so bad like what's so wrong?? I was just trying to be nice what's the big deal :( \*goes and cries later\* Can't people just let you say some things? Like first we don't talk enough but then when we do say something it's not the right thing and they have to call us out and say we said something stupid and make us feel stupid ugh I'm done I just.... grrr
1	"My bad" is my own personal favourite
1	Do INFPs do this alot because all of the ones I've met do (btw I shift between ENFP INFP and INFJ alot)
1	I don't excessively say sorry, but if someone jokingly mentions it or I apologize and they say, "don't say sorry", I'll usually reply with, "ah, my apologies."
1	When I instinctively say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù along with every other ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù, with customers at my part-time retail job. üôÇ 
0	**Upvote this more**
12	Any INFPs from a ‚Äúnon-INFP friendly‚Äù culture?	I‚Äôm Latino, born and raised in the US ‚Äî- both are society of extroverts. \nMany INFP traits are not particularly appreciated in my culture (especially for guys). 
21	Yes. *Planet Earth*. \n\n----\n\nBut really, I think we all have challenges being a minority mbti, of probably any culture's population. \n\nI can definitely see how being an INFP in a Latino culture can be challenging. To look for positives, I wonder ways it can also be good? 
7	I've struggled with this my whole life. I actually just posted a similar thread a minute ago. \n\nOne day, I decided I'd stop apologizing for who I am and stand my ground about not conforming. Oddly enough, I think people appreciated it and I'm more popular than when I put on a face. Some people will never care for me, but that's the same for everyone. \n\nI say, you be yourself. If people give you a hard time, ask them how they'd feel if you asked them "Why are you always talking? You should be quieter." or "Why are you so outgoing? You gotta learn how to get inside your shell." Basically, the opposite of the kinds of things people used to say to me. 
3	you might be surprised about being appreciated... it's just that the appreciation may not seem to be relevant to ones life..\n\nsometimes people may feel threatened and/or competed against when somebody stands out against the background..\n\nunfortunately, there are many popular values in the world which do not help the state of things, but erode the viability of living.
2	Germany. It's ok I guess. A lot of your social "value" is based on how hard you work but at least it seems more normal if you are highly introverted, not emotionally expressive and rather outwardly dry/blunt.
1	Spain lmao
1	Same here, but not Latino. Mongrel. 
1	Remember there's always those "your kind of people" who value you as you are. The more true you are to being yourself the you and your dream pack will find each other. :)\n\nAlso, because it's extra hard for men to be the Feeling (and Introvert), I like to remind guys that there are so many of us girls who can't even imagine dating a non-sensitive guy. I would never have a connection with a rational, non sensitive, overly stable and overly confident macho guy who doesn't cry or do anything that's not masculine. It's just all about compability and no one should try to be what they love in others (I always tried to "cure" my introvertism because I really admire extroverts).\n\nThe rest, work colleagues, relatives, will be there and make your life difficult in how they just don't (try to) understand but reminding yourself it's just work or not the people who truly matter is the best way to deal with people you can't change or ditch.
11	This may be a little silly or juvenile, but does seeing posts from people with other MBTIs talking about being attracted to INFPs or saying they think they're awesome make anyone else's day?	It just makes me smile. I've always felt like a lot of aspects of my personality weren't appreciated much. At least, not in America. It makes me feel better since I've always had an internal battle about whether I should try to fit "Western" standards of behavior more.  
2	I've just looked at a thread linked to this and felt the same impact. It really makes my day to know that my personality is and can be appreciated, although the people they met were different. The things they wrote I resonate with and it makes me smile. Glad to know I'm not the only one.
2	I'm a classic cynic when it comes to people who come from out of the blue like that. It always sounds phony to me. That's something I'm trying to get over, but I overthink it to the point of 'why are they here?'. \n\nProbably because I've been often challenged, manipulated  and overpowered by others who pretended to be friendly to me just to get something. Since I know I'm gullible I try to protect myself.\n\nThat's probably the first time I've realized this out loud.   
2	A little but sometimes I think they wouldn‚Äôt be sayin that if they knew me. 
2	Awe. Can someone share the link of that? :) 
2	I don't really care to be honest because although those people exist they're definitely the minority.  When out and about in the world most people don't value these things and honestly couldn't be bothered to care.  Our values basically exist on the fringe of what is considered valuable as a human being.  Sure some INFP artists or whatever become big and they're valued, but in my opinion that's uncommon and I don't consider celebrity status in an INFP as validation for our values/traits.
60	I saw this handsome guy on the train, and it got me thinking	This isn‚Äôt an ask for advice post, just a self observation.\n\nI imagined our first time we spoke, our first date and how we broke up. I‚Äôm not emotionally invested obviously I just saw the guy, but my imagination is insane.\n\nMy mind just wanders off into lala land but it‚Äôs fun. Writing stories in my mind. Then when im done I just laugh at how silly it is.\n\nI‚Äôm guessing like how Ti users probably wander off in their own minds in a logical way. Our minds wander off to create personal stories.\n\nCool thing is when I sleep and my mind comes up with crazy adventure filled dreams. It comes so naturally to me and I wonder how I could use that into the real world.
23	This the part I love about being Infp aka the dreamer. I am almost never bored. I have had so many lives üòÉ.\n\n\nKeep calm and dream on üòä
24	So.. why did you break up?;)
9	Do you ever get so invested in your stories, then come back to reality and get sad that you‚Äôre not living the story? This subreddit has made me so much more self aware of my ‚Äúdreamer‚Äù qualities.
8	I can have so much stories, worlds, and romances in my head, but when it's time to write any of them down my mind turns into a dumpster.
6	I can‚Äôt even tell you how often I imagine my entire relationship with somebody I‚Äôve just met, or even a stranger. Sometimes I wish my mind would just give it a break!
7	Haha, I can relate. My dreams tend to be completely random messes though.
4	The best part is that you got to experience all the emotions.
4	Yeah dreaming about a lot of awesome stuff.
5	This has been all my life. It's a burden and a curse. \nMakes for good story material, start writing them down (If you don't already)
3	Just saw a cute girl i've never seen before in my neighborhood and was fantasizing bout our sunday eveninga
2	Yeah, I do this too but when I act it out it just scares girls away.  I have several songs all about women.  I‚Äôm pathetic.  There‚Äôs all this emotion in them, but after the fact and I hear them again I sometimes get embarrassed from the old emotions that propelled me to right the song.\n\nI just wrote one last week.  I always think my voice and songs suck too.  But other people like them sometimes.  It‚Äôs hard being an artist INFP type.\n\nIt‚Äôs all that thinking you‚Äôre talking about.  Women prob think I‚Äôm crazy.  \n\nAnyhow, I can totally relate with you.  Lol.
2	As an INTP my imaginary moments like that are not primarily logical but more Ne-based, like what if we shared this coincidence or what if that happened and it's more of a one-way rabbit hole of imagined interaction. Whether it's the maladaptive dreams/fantasies I used to pursue, dreams/nightmares at night, or daydreams, it's always Ne leading and Ti reacting to the created story. Like yes I would constantly be analyzing the scenario in the dream but the trajectory itself is whimsical and impulsive.
2	Hahaha I did the same thing this morning. Except I saw a Facebook page of a friend of a friend. I kept thinking about her and our life together, and yes I know that sounds creepy. But it made me think if she is the one then what would life with her to be like? I know I‚Äôm over thinking it but it‚Äôs nice day dreaming of a better life. And then when I‚Äôm done I realize that she probably wouldn‚Äôt be into me so I need to stop, it‚Äôs just a fantasy.
2	Get into writing.
1	I think in psychology this is called default mode network. The train of thought that keeps feeding us thoughts when we aren't actively doing or thinking anything.
1	I love this post. \n\nMaybe this is why INFPs make great writers!
1	Note to Self (blog post by a fellow INFP)	
4	Risk taking	I‚Äôm typically risk adverse and I‚Äôm guessing a lot of INFPs are?\n\nFor any of you who do take risks (including the risk adverse) what are they? The kind you have to get up and dust yourself off after.
2	I‚Äôm risk averse, I hate taking risks because it ends up being a mistake. Why take risks when it‚Äôs probably not what I should be doing. If it looks like a big risk than maybe it‚Äôs the universe telling me I shouldn‚Äôt do it. That being said the one thing I have to take risks on is relationships. I have to at least try in order to get what I want. But it is scary putting myself out there when most of the it‚Äôs not going to go my way.
2	I don't take, I don't take, I don't take, \n\nThen I throw caution to the wind and launch the "risk taking" nukes baby!!!! \n\nThere's no dust to wipe off after that. Lol. \n\n-----\n\nReally, though, mostly I just try and take measured risks every day. Nothing ventured nothing gained. We miss 100% of the shots we don't take. I'm working to not miss taking risks until it's too late. That's far too painful. :)
1	I weigh the risks
1	  I like taking risks more often than not; it leads to positive things and learning. It takes guts, though the last time I took a risk it did not go as well. Moved to a city with my then girlfriend, after a month she broke up with me. I realized that she had been depressed since the minute I met her. She had only hid it for me. She could not hide it anymore when she moved in with me. \n\nSo even though it was/ still is incredible hard for me to accept it. I cannot do anything about it. Even though I am in pain now, it have also made me grow as a person. Realized I have to set boundaries for myself, since I always see the best in people. It‚Äôs in failure you learn, so take risks.
2	How does one reach satisfaction.	I feel so unsatisfied and that I have no meaning. I work part time at a job that I hate doing only overnight shifts, a bad wage, too scared to ask to do dayshifts, also too scared to look for another job. I am a full-time student and I find it hard to find meaning in what i am learning sometimes and i'm always stressed about it. The most annoying thing is there is this girl, I find cute, but I am scared to approach her (i'm an INFP male) and i'm scared of being judged by my friends for going for someone outside the norm (she has green hair and I think she is cute and seems odd which is +). With my life, honestly all I want would be a decent living, a meaningful career, and a family. I feel that there is a huge lack of meaning in what I do. How can I tackle all of these important issues?  I just feel overwhelmed, all help would be greatly appreciated.
1	In you like someone, dont give a shit about what others might think. 
1	When I read your post, I see all the things you say you're "too scared to do" are the one's you would need to do to feel more happy and free and in control of your life.\n\nObviously you sound stuck. I know how it feels, being too tired and scared to do anything, when there's just so many issues and stresses in your life to take one down at a time.\n\nThere are some small steps you can do. You can rationalize a few of your worries: Would your friends truly laugh at you? You could try speaking up a little bit more. What's the worst that could happen if you talk about changing your work shift? I seriously can't imagine you'd be working at such a toxic workplace where it would have negative consequences. Taking baby steps towards doing more things you would want is the right way to go.\n\nGetting help for anxiety could be useful too if you can reach that from your school.\n\nAlso a lot of girls like shy guys. :)\n\nBeing scared is alright. We're all scared.

3	What if you took that step?	The scenarios that we play in our heads, the outcomes that we generated, and the anxiety that we feel.\n\nWhat would I feel if I just took that step?\n\nThe unknown is always scary and if we did have the courage the bravery and the drive to take that step.\n\nWould it be different? \n\nBut here I am thinking about it. The what ifs of what ifs.
1	Just remember that the outcome of not taking the step is most likely way more scarier than the outcome of taking the step.
8	Any other INFP's diagnosed with "ADD"	It's hard for me to take public messages from the teachers in school, that'z why i got it.
4	Yesssss, it's so intense. I'm 20 now and my parents never listened to me growing up when I told them about it so I have always just had to deal with it. It hasn't gotten much better over time so I would live to eventually be prescribed something for it. A lot of my schooling growing up was hindered because of it.
2	I was diagnosed when I was 21 (ADD/ Inattentive subtype), though some folks had commented on my symptoms for many years before that. I took meds for it for several years until they became no longer effective. I wasn't willing to accept the side effects listed for the alternatives presented, so I go without medication at this point. I try to use behavioral coping mechanisms and some limited use of essential oils (vetiver, and a few others) instead. 
1	Me too. Diagnosed in my mid 30s. No meds prescribed, but management suggestions like ' make a list.'

2	I‚Äôm a 20 year old virgin, and I have a chance to hook up with a girl from Tinder. The thing is, I‚Äôve had a massive thing for my best friend, and don‚Äôt know if I should wait	(Skip to the last paragraph for what is basically a TL;DR, but ideally read the full thing)\n\nSo basically I‚Äôm a 20 year old virgin (I‚Äôm gonna be 21 in a couple of months), and while for a long time the only thing really pushing me to want to do it was peer pressure and wanting it over with, to put it bluntly lately I‚Äôve been mega horny. I honestly think its partly a delayed puberty thing going on, like in the last year or so I‚Äôve changed noticeably, I still don‚Äôt have much armpit hair yet but more is growing in now, more hair on my stomach and shit, etc. I think my face looks a lot more masculine now too, I‚Äôve always been a short, baby-faced guy, but lately I think I‚Äôm noticeably better looking and I actually get some degree of attention off girls now.\n\nAnyway, going off topic here. For the past couple of years I‚Äôve had a massive thing for my best friend. I‚Äôd actually say she‚Äôs the first girl I‚Äôve ‚Äòfallen in love with‚Äô, I think I‚Äôm always gonna have a soft spot for her. We‚Äôre probably always gonna be in each other‚Äôs lives. She had a boyfriend the full time, and I told her how I feel, and nothing happened but awkwardness and cutting contact for a few months, so after a healthy dose of complete heartbreak I decided I need to move on. Since then little crushes have came and went, but I feel like I‚Äôm always comparing them to her in the back of my head.\n\nPart of trying to move the fuck on has been me downloading Tinder. I first got it like a year ago, and had like no success at all lmfao. But like I said, I‚Äôve changed a bit in the past year. So recently I gave it another go, and I was shocked by how well I‚Äôve been doing. While I‚Äôve only really ‚Äòhit it off‚Äô with a few people, I‚Äôve matched with maybe 50 in a month if I include people that have been unmatched and shit. It‚Äôs been a nice little confidence boost.\n\nThe last week has kinda felt like a crossroads for me. On the best friend front, she broke up with her boyfriend about a week ago. She‚Äôs been completely heartbroken, and she says I‚Äôve kinda been her rock through it all. I feel completely awful seeing her like this, it‚Äôs fucking horrible, but having said that obviously I‚Äôve thought to myself about what the future might hold for us. I always thought it was pretty obvious there was something between us, and that if the timing had matched up better something might have happened. By the time I realised how crazy I was about her she was deep in her relationship. In between the bouts of crying and asking me why she‚Äôs not good enough, she‚Äôs been pretty obviously flirting with me. I‚Äôm trying not to read into it; she‚Äôs in an emotionally vulnerable place, her mind‚Äôs probably all over the fucking place. But she‚Äôs outright joked about us going on dates, at one point said it was ‚Äòa shame‚Äô she couldn‚Äôt send me nudes of her gym progress, and overall the vibe between us has just been far more intense and sexual than it would ever have been if she was still with him. She knows exactly how I‚Äôve felt about her, so I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs gonna flirt with me just for the sake of it, but again, she‚Äôs not in the best place. Even if she asked me to sleep with her tomorrow, I‚Äôd probably not do it. If anything ever happened between us I don‚Äôt want it to be some stupid rebound; I‚Äôd want it to be something we both go into clear-headed, and completely sure of what we want. It would probably take a good few months before that‚Äôs possible.\n\nOn the Tinder front, I matched with a girl a couple of days ago who is extremely open to us hooking up, and that I definitely wouldn‚Äôt mind hooking up with. Like she‚Äôs outright told me that she wants to fuck me, but that we should still just talk for a few days and get to know each other. From our convos I‚Äôve kinda learned she‚Äôs honestly probably a bit much for a virgin like me to handle sexually hahahaa. She‚Äôs into some pretty kinky stuff, which I have nothing against, but for a first timer I feel like it would be intimidating as fuck. But again, the hormones are kinda raging, and honestly I just want to get it done. But I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd feel losing my virginity in a hook up like that. Like I don‚Äôt want to let the opportunity just pass by, since the chance really hasn‚Äôt came around like at all, but at the same time I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs right for me. Having said that, I feel like getting it out of the way with a casual hookup means that when the people that really matter come along later, I‚Äôll have a better time and know what to do.\n\nSo, to sum it up quickly, I can either hook up with this girl from Tinder and get it over with, or see how things progress with my best friend, even though her recent flirting with me could be for literally any reason cause of how emotional she is over a recent break up, and I‚Äôd potentially write off a solid change for myself just waiting for ‚Äòthe perfect time‚Äô. Having said that, the girl from Tinder is probably a bit too much for me, and it could be a terrible first time that I‚Äôd massively regret. I really don‚Äôt know what to do here, so any advice would be massively appreciated.
6	Your first time doesn‚Äôt need to be with a best friend or someone your in love with necessarily, but you must be completely comfortable with them.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt turn down opportunities just because of some fleeting hope with a friend who is in an emotional state. That‚Äôs a very idealistic and hopeful thing to do (classic infp). But you also shouldn‚Äôt jump into something you‚Äôre uncomfortable with just to lose your virginity. Wait until you find someone who you will not feel regret about regardless of the experience. 
3	I'd say wait. It's not gonna be good sex if it's someone you don't completely care about. Is a stranger being your first how you want to look back on your life? Being called a virgin shouldn't be a shaming thing and idk why it is. Tbh, if someone my age said they weren't a virgin and shown off, I'd be less of a friend to them than those who are. Why should being called a virgin determine how you are seen. If anyone really shamed me for being a virgin, instant bridge burn. As for the horny thing. I don't think having sex would solve anything. It would probably make you more horny depending if you like it or not. \n\nBut I'm still a virgin y/o virgin so take what I've said however you want. Just stating my thoughts. 
2	In my experience it‚Äôs better to hook up first. My first experiences were with two girls I loved and it was awful and led to us breaking up. After that there were lots of hookups that taught me what and how to do with girls and I regret so much disappointing people I loved with my inexperience, for sure it would be much better for me to make mistakes with random girls and be good with girls I really cared about.
1	I wouldn't wait. You made things clear to her. Though, she did have a boyfriend at the time. Right now, IF you guys do get together, more likely you are a rebound. It will be worse for you both.\n\nOnly you can decide. This is just how I would handle it.
1	I‚Äôm honestly torn. I want to say go have a hook up, but if you have a chance with the girl you like it would probably be worth it to wait a little longer. You said you‚Äôre horny but it‚Äôs not going to be satisfying having sex if you don‚Äôt know what you are doing, you‚Äôre better off just jacking off to clear your head. That being said you really don‚Äôt know what is going to happen with the girl you like. She might reciprocate the feelings or she could just see you as a rebound and realize the feelings aren‚Äôt real. But just because you like a girl doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have a casual hookup. You‚Äôre technically single and you never know if you will get another chance to hookup with tinder girl or any other girl. \n\n\nI‚Äôd say go for the hookup because you need to look out for yourself first. And find out what sex is like will be beneficial for you. You might even learn a few things that you can use in a real relationship, maybe with the girl you like. But do you really want to be inexperienced when starting in a relationship with a girl you like? I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong either way. But in my opinion I‚Äôd go for the hookup, get your confidence up then try to date the girl you like. She‚Äôs still trying to get over her ex anyways so you‚Äôre going to need time anyways.
1	All I would say is forget about your age and the pressure you feel about "getting it done". It really doesn't matter.\n\nAlso, I personally wish I hadn't rushed in it. What happened though I kinda acted it through, with the expectations of what it should be and didn't enjoy myself too much.\n\nI don't feel confident giving advice too much but. If she does have feelings for you she would probably feel like you've been playing double and it could ruin the whole thing. Maybe you could try to make a move with her first and see how it goes.
3	Analytical mind?	I realized today that I have a very analytical mind at work. Someone pointed out that I always ask the question why, which probably helps with me doing the ‚Äòhow‚Äô part of any task. A while ago, my mom said that as a kid, I always asked why. \n\nI dissect every detail to every little thing including happenings and situations that are subjective in my personal life. I do the same at work because I work with numbers oddly enough, although I am so much more artistically inclined than I am practical and objective.  It‚Äôs not always a good thing as you all know - I quite literally become obsessive until I have carved out every piece of the picture and gave those pieces the meanings as it applies to the whole. If I don‚Äôt, it feels empty. I feel empty and lost. \n\nI know we are idealists and we need to have meaning behind the works that we do, the actions we take, and the words we say or simply imply. But I also tend to side towards the objective side. I think many people that personally know me outside of work would scoff at that idea, but I have the J attributes that lurk so closely behind the P and it shows more professionally, but is pretty close to me personally. \n\nAre you guys the same way? I need to know this is an INFP thing.
4	I can relate. I‚Äôm definitely INFP, but I‚Äôm in science and have spent a lot of years training my brain to think analytically and go against those tendencies in some ways. Luckily I don‚Äôt really have a problem retreating back to my natural artistic/feely way of thinking.  \n\nIn a lot of ways I‚Äôm really glad I went against my natural tendencies and did a science degree because while it was really difficult for me, I think it has made me a pretty well balanced person. So, maybe it will help to frame it that way- you probably know your natural tendencies but it‚Äôs possible and pretty cool to be able to embrace a different way of thinking too. 
1	I was convinced that I was INTP for quite a long time but when I finally studied mbti I found out I was clearly INFP. I also ask "why" often, sometimes because I'm bored or something.
1	I think we're all a mix. I had to remake the test a few times because everything else than if I'm Feeling wasn't 100%. Some things vary depending on the situation too.\n\nFor example, I'm an introvert but I often act extrovert when I socialize. I get easily anxious and need a lot of alone time to recharge but I am talkative and bubbly in conversations. When I feel energetic, that is.\n\nAlso, it's easy to mix intuitive and impulsive. I don't ACT intuitive (=impulsive) because I always weigh my options carefully. But I do make my decisions with my heart instead of my head, in the end. So I am rather analytical, I take my time making decisions, but intuition is far more important for me than reason.
57	I feel like General Iroh from Avatar is like an INFP who figured his life out, and now is an old man content with who he his.	Some of his quotes:\n\n[crying] I was never angry with you. I was sad, because I was afraid you‚Äôd lost your way.\n\nLife happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.\n\nWhile it is always best to believe in one‚Äôs self, a little help from others can be a great blessing.\n\nGoodbye everyone. Today, destiny is our friend. I know it.\n\nThere is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang ‚Äî positive energy and a negative energy. Only a select few Firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in the moment the postive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.\n\n‚ÄúYou have light and peace inside of you. If you let it out, you can change the world around you
9	I always thought Iroh was an INFP even though most people say Zuko is one... Dunno never really resonated with Zuko but I really resonate with Iroh, he's got a playful side but he's a wise old man. He's opinion is often discarded but he knows what he's doing. And he tries his best to protect his loved ones (basically Zuko) while respecting his inner beliefs (being a member of the white lotus...). Zuko seems more ISFP to me. All this to say, yeah I agree and Iroh is the best.
2	I love those quotes, thanks

46	INFP here. I'm curious about this particular Subs fixations.	First off, I'd like to preface that this is in no way a judgement. As stated in the title, I am an INFP myself but lately I have been feeling pretty alienated (surprise surprise) from this sub. I (obviously) empathize with the insecurities and overwhelming feelings that are shared here but I've noticed that this sub tends to consist of only that; Posts about insecurities and overwhelming feelings of loneliness/shyness/etc. When in reality I know that we INFP's are so much more complex and strong willed than just the shy, lonely and sad people we seem keen to make ourselves out to be. We are deep thinkers. We ponder the basics of everything. We want to understand why things are the way they are. We love deep relationships and deep conversation while simultaneously in need of isolation. We crave adventure and new experiences and want nothing more than to better ourselves and the world around us. In closing, I suppose my goal with this post is to see more of us sharing what makes us INFPs other than lonely introvert stereotypes and I hope that anyone who reads this knows that they are more complex and interesting than just the wallflower at every party. You are an entire human being filled with every emotion and passion. I really hope I haven't offended anyone or made them feel like their feelings don't matter. It certainly isn't my intention. 
35	Hello! I think a certain subset of emotions strongly compel people to post in this subreddit. Otherwise, they're off doing cool things in the world (or at least in other subreddits).\n\nAnd we're very supportive of each other so we'll reply to people in need. More engagement, more upvotes, and Reddit pushes that content up to "Hot", which skews representation. I think that's all it is.\n\nHopefully, more fellow INFPs can recognize this and not fall into the trap of mutual wallowing. I think it's our job to help keep each other level-headed and see the bigger picture when others start tunnel-visioning from hopelessness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS\n\nI've noticed r/infp bleeding unusually profusely these days from loneliness and despair. I think it has something to do with winter blues and being the week of Valentines.  Hang in there, guys!
16	As an older INFP just an FYI, I used to be sad, lonely and shy when I was younger... went thru the whole goth phase etc. I felt like I didn't belong, didn't fit in, nobody liked me blah blah. But now I have matured and see life in a whole different way. Of course I remember who I was and how I used to be, and to a certain extent it informs who I am now. \n\nHowever, at this age (40's) people are drawn to me BECAUSE I'm different. They come to me bc I help them see themselves in a positive light. I see their potential, their qualities, their talents. I encourage them to find and use their gifts. People believe me when I tell them I sense energies and are intrigued. \n\nI'm sharing this bc I wish that I had an older me to tell me that people's attitudes would change toward me when I got older and that I was a rare gem and to keep being me. It sucked to be INFP when I was younger and didn't understand who or what I was. It sucked to grow up in a family of extroverts who ignored me. But now, I've lived longer, have a few wrinkles, and those whose souls are lost, always find their way to me. \n\nWe see the wonder that is life, we look upon nature for the intrigue and beauty it holds, we see inside people's souls and draw out their inner strengths and goodness. We sense the energies, positive and negative that come from everything, living or dead. We use our intuition to guide us and keep our values in tact. We are INFP!
6	I think, like others here have pointed out, that a huge part of the userbase of this sub and reddit as a whole is made up of people 16-22 who are at the point in life where they are first starting to enter into society, come into conflict with it, and struggle with *who they are and where they fit in*. Add to that that people who feel alienated tend to spend more time on the internet (and vise versa), and it makes sense why the content of this sub is what it is.
6	I think a lot of the insecure posts are made by young/emotionally immature INFPs or INFPs going through a rough patch. So naturally the people that relate to them will comment/upvote and those who try to comfort them will also upvote/comment. And I think most INFPs are too polite to be blunt about such posts and prefer not commenting them. Consequence is these posts get a lot of visibility. And thus the subs becomes a bit of a vent sub for INFP because often they'll be comforted which is understandable. Sometimes I think some posts are a bit toxic (reinforcing the negative vibes). \n\nFinally I think a lot of INFPs don't see the need in posting "positive posts" as they can focus on their own life or don't feel like posting something positive because it could come off as a bit condescending towards all the "vent" posts.\n\nHence we get mostly those types of posts. I try to be positive in the comments because I'd like to see everyone grow into their best self.
4	Yea I do feel alienated from this sub since there's such a huge focus on DAE post that focus on "INFP" aspects that I just don't relate to. I've mentioned this before but plenty of INFPs don't comment here because they don't feel like they have a place to. This sub lowkey discourages arguments and alternative thoughts, so it makes sense that INFPs with different thoughts, who are known to not love confrontation anyway, would simply not post. It's a problem when subreddits focus solely on validation like this one does. \n\nI wish there was another INFP subreddit like there is for other types. Like a sub for INFP females or a sub for INFPs over a certain age (not over my age tho lel). I want to talk about other mbti types and Fi and identity and certain philosophies, but post that that don't get much engagement here. 
3	I post this at least once a day it feels like....but there are a lot of you young/immature/unhealthy INFPs on this sub, and it shows. \n\nSo to add to op‚Äôs point: \n\nFellow INFPs! There‚Äôs a whole beautiful life on the other side of that desperate feeling. Dig deep for some motivation (real deep, I know) and progress yourself towards a fulfilling life!\n\nIf you learn to use it, your sensitivities are a powerful weapon, and not at all the target on your back it might feel like ‚ù§Ô∏è
3	tbh, i usually scroll past those kinds of posts unless they come up on a search i do with a specific issue in my mind. while i completely understand people might need their own posts when they are in certain distressing situations and am in no way against it, what i notice is how there are piles of posts on basically same situations. sometimes there are posts within only few hours on very similar issues. though it's not my place, i'd expect one to just check the subreddit first before posting, otherwise it feels like someone barging into the room and just starting telling their problem while they are still on the doorstep. i think this makes this subreddit harder to navigate. the way i sense such an impracticality in this subreddit made me even question if i am an infp (i know i am, have been one since i can imagine). and another impractical thing that i come across quite frequently is titles like "anyone else feel this way?" and that's it, the title ends there. in such a case, without reading the post itself, there is no way i could understand if the post interests me or not. i really do wish there could be a way to better organize this subreddit, to make it easier to navigate for everyone. sometimes i look at other mbti subreddits and envy them lol. so, freedom of expression? yes, absolutely. but making things easier for everyone? that's also great to support.
2	I used to feel sad and lonely because I thought that my mindset and my passionate thoughts were too weird and off putting for most people. But, after struggling through all of high school and most of college (till senior year) trying to fit in and adjust my viewpoints to seem "fun" and "popular", I've finally made peace with the fact that most people I've talked to just didn't stimulate that sense of being close or had the potential of having a deep relationship with me. And I'm not talking about like bf/gf, I'm talking genuinely deep relationships, the kind where you have a best friend that knows your mindset and can be at the same level and talk about things objectively without judgment, but also passionately. You really do have to have patience when it comes to these times, because you can't really control most of the people you meet while in highschool, and you have a little more independence in college depending on how big your school is, but again, infps are shy and reserved so its hard looking out into a crowd and saying "I choose that one" among thousands. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is, if you feel like you are having to change yourself to fit in, don't. Take the few friends who accept you for who you are and embrace those relationships.
2	I'll repeat this again. Get a copy of *Introvert Power* by Laurie Helgoe, Phd. and read it. 50% of the population is Introverts. Once you look around it's obvious. You do have power to live a good life. I promise. 
2	I‚Äôm glad you said something! This post is like a breath of fresh air when it comes to this sub for me. I was beginning to wonder if I was in the right personality, despite being solidly INFP each time I test. \n\nWe all get down and working through our feelings can be a struggle. I learned in my early 20s how to acknowledge my feelings, take the time that I need to fill my cup and keep myself sane, then use that to care for my loved ones. I make deep connections with each friend I make by being vulnerable and listening and genuinely caring about them. I think that depth of character and potential for empathy and emotional understanding is what makes us INFPs special. It also makes it easy to feel isolated or misunderstood when those around you can‚Äôt understand you in turn. \n\nI love being an INFP and I love that there are others on this sub who can see past the potential for isolation and sadness to the depth of love we have to give. 
2	Great post! Like others have said, there are a lot of young people here (like myself) who are struggling with things in their lives or the whole process of becoming a real adult. I think sometimes people reach out more when they need an outlet for that sort of thing. Tbh that's what brought me here, but now I'm just happy I found this great community!
1	I think you could have made this post without mentioning what others are doing. Let them use this place to talk about whats going on in their lives, you could add other things to INFP as well ~
4	Fellow INFPs can you offer me some life advice?	I am almost 26 years old and I‚Äôm going through a pretty confusing life period right now. After a relationship breakdown I left the city I was living in (London) and have been living with my parents since November. \n\nThe time has come for me to leave now I‚Äôve healed and I‚Äôm just not sure how to make such a decision as to where to go. \n\nI don‚Äôt have a huge circle of friends, though I have a few back in London and some contacts. Naturally I‚Äôm entertaining the idea of returning to London except I‚Äôve tried living there twice and both times have found it overwhelming at times. I would have ¬£500 less per month in terms of salary then when I last lived there, meaning I won‚Äôt be able to save money at all. But life there can be fun and there‚Äôs always things to do. \n\nThe other option is moving to a new city altogether and starting fresh. This scares me a lot but I‚Äôm quite open to the idea. I would pay less rent and have the opportunity to save therefore. I have a city in mind, with decent job opportunities and tons of culture still.\n\nI‚Äôm conflicted between the two and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I have a ‚Äòlife is all about now, who cares about saving/being sensible - go to London ‚Äô mentality VS ‚Äòhave a fresh start, be an adult, save and go somewhere new‚Äô mentality. \n\nI‚Äôm just so scared I won‚Äôt make a single friend if I go to the new city. And, that I‚Äôll lost my contacts in London. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? Which would you choose? 
4	[deleted]
2	From my experience with crossroads, and I've had many of them, is that if you rinse and repeat, you'll face the reasons you left. Even if some of the factors change, returning can still seem like a "where did we leave off?" kind of a thing. Not always bad, but if you want changes, then the new setting can be helpful. \n\nGoing with a new path that could tip some odds in your favor seems like a good plan to me. If you're less stressed and stretched thin by the basics of life, you'll be in a better headspace to be open to social opportunities that come your way. 
2	Does London have an outskirts? Excuse my ignorance, I've never been. Maybe live and work outside and commute in on occasion, taking it in small doses?
2	I think what's important is if the idea of someplace new feels exciting yet terrifying or just a defeat, the adult thing to do. And vice versa. I'm an infp too and I think as we are Intuitive Feeling, making those purely rational decisions rarely takes us anywhere but to misery.\n\nBeing scared and terrified is okay. You can always change your plans. And you'll less likely regret not giving it a go than going and seeing what it is.\n\nTry to connect with your guts and whichever you decide, remember you don't HAVE to stick to your decision if you ever feel trapped.
3	How often do you actually trust people with your dirt?	I'm at -54% here. I only disclose what I can live with disclosing. 
5	90% but we gotta be Day One...like either going back to car seats or I vibes with you like fam from first meeting. But you can tell by your intuition who you can trust.
3	5-10%. People seem to like to use information as blackmail or to get in with a certain crowd at the victims expense. I have to REALLY trust them before they even get basic info like who I was crushing on in high school, what I'm thinking atm, the less great parts of my past, etc.. I know it isn't the greatest way to go, but it's the way I'm comfortable with.
1	Someone I know once called me an open book. No actually he said I was more like a rolodex. But no one knows the Shadow me. 
1	Never
10	Is this normal for you people?	To feel sudden changes in persona depending on the people whom you're with specifically?\n\nBecause it's been made out to me for it to be an INFP thing to carry this unwavering authenticity with you in the way you present yourself to others. My impression could be wrong.\n\nI mean, if I'm not mistaken there was this one guy who commented on this Youtube post about "INFP (guys) when it comes to masulinity" who stated that they felt the need to put on a guy-like front whenever he was around guys doing their kinds of things.\n\nAnything to say?
7	this is a normal personality trait for all the people.
3	I think certain behaviours are shallow/performative, these can often change depending on who you are with. That's just good people skills. :) But, as far as I'm aware, when it comes to INFPs there is an unwavering authenticity in their belief systems and approach to the world. 
3	To an extent. I'm always authentic to myself, absolutely it is a core value of my entire life and I tend to only want to be around similar people.\n\nSo I just avoid inauthenticity because it pisses me off. \n\nI'll be me. The people who like that will come. The people that don't will leave. It's how I made my best friends. People who will be my brothers for life.
3	I am different in front of different people due to my perception of them. I imagine that it could be the openness in Perceiving. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It has to do with what things we have in common with each other and what we relate to. I talk about different things with different people based on what they're interested in and where the flow of the conversation goes. Meanwhile, I'm still true to myself. It's difficult for me to partake in a very shallow conversation. I'll get bored in my head and either just stay silent or say few words. Many INFPs can be good at disguising themselves, however, due to introverted feeling. I just open up about different parts of myself to different people that relate to those parts specifically.
2	I know the feeling you described because I have been there before. I used to change so much varying on whom I was with and what I was around. \n\nIt stopped when I just accepted who I was. Honestly. \nNow I change my behavior very little if at all. I am who I am and am very humble about it. 
2	Some of us have grown up not realizing we're under a lot of pressure to be someone else. Here lately I'm seeing closet Introversion as similar to other, differently stifled groups, and really lately have experienced a sort of 'coming out' as an Introvert. \n\nIt's of course not as severe, but on the other hand, many in the past were sure I was gay, which isn't the case. Those of you who've been pressured to 'be a man' or faked an interest in sports, or even who've been belittled for being unsociable or a loner know what I mean. 
6	I‚Äôm not a quitter	No matter what we go through I‚Äôll never quit on you, but that won‚Äôt stop me from quitting on myself and wanting more for you. 
2	Yes, say it louder
2	Damn, that was a little too real for me
50	Took this a few nights ago. Finally decided to share it	
1	I love the colors. It feels very relaxing to look at. Very nice :)
1	Oh this makes me happy! Thanks for sharing.
1	It‚Äôs pretty wtf happy vibes
1	Ne-Si Axis: The Ultimate Matching Game?	Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to provide different facets of this occurrence: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can look at an object and I immediately remember another object I've seen that looks similar. For example, I'll see a barret in someones hair in real time that looks like a movie character's. I'll immediately note it or tell them if I'm comfortable with them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work in a museum, so I do see older objects that look like forks or something, and call it a fork for myself to remember (prob Fi-Si), yet these items usually aren't the same function as what I see them as. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do the same see-and-remember thing with people's faces. I can easily detect if someone looks like another person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do the same thing with words as well. Like someone will be talking about listening to Queen and my brain will jump to the Queen of Hearts, or whatever association I have with the word. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr something will happen in real time and a movie quote that directly relates to the moment will come to mind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this happens without thinking or trying. It's a very "oh!" surprise...daily. Ha. It feels like a super power in some way, like the ultimate life-long matching game, but I'm not sure how useful it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see the Ne-Si axis at play here, but I'm not sure which function is dominant in this scenario? (I do see Fi involved in some level but I'm not always passionate about the things I immediately compare without thinking. Ex: forks.) Have others experienced this? \n\nBTW: Also posted this on the general MBTI page. 
1	Huh. I think it's Si, but I'm not totally sure. I do the same thing though. My specialty is matching colors from memory! 
312	Painted my cousins dog and they sent me thisüò≠üò≠	
19	Dog's  like I don't like my picture I thought that I looked more handsome you made me look like an idiot
11	You should get really meta with this and do a painting of this picture as well.
7	This is great! \n\nMaybe you should print and frame it!! \n\nSo\nCool!!
3	Damn that's so good!\nThe painting is amazing but the sad dog's reaction is what makes it so damn good!\n\nThis would make a great meme format tho, try posting it on r/memeeconomy
2	He looks like he's posing for his new R&B album. And the painting is the vinyl release.
1	Omg I have the same photo with my dog and a painting I made of her :D [https://imgur.com/a/lhVXLEH](https://imgur.com/a/lhVXLEH)
6	Power Dynamics	I feel like this may be an INFP thing.\n\nI'm prone to struggling with the power dynamics of certain relationships/people, and this seems to come with difficulty managing emotions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExample: This person I know does things specifically to make me feel uneasy or unsure about myself.  I confronted them about it, and asked if they were aware of how they were making me feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey said "Yeah, I know it makes you uncomfortable, thats why I do it ha ha ha ha." \n\nI said, "that's kinda rude man, cause if I did the same I dont think you'd like it."\n\nThey simply laughed and told me to "just relax" and walked away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I'm in these types of situations all the time. \n\nAnd if I react emotionally, it's me "making a big deal out of nothing". \n\nIf I'm to play it cool, then I'm more or less giving the behavior freedom to continue and said it's nbd.\n\nThoughts? 
8	I don't know the dynamic but if someone did that to me I would tell them to fuck off.   \n\nAnd if they told me to relax I would tell them that I was relaxed but to fuck off anyways. 
3	> "making a big deal out of nothing"\n\n"No, I'm making a big deal out of you being an asshole."\n\nSome people have neither empathy nor compassion.  Even if you point out that he's being an asshole, it may have no effect - other than for you to let go of the upset.  Which is worth it.
2	They're an asshole. Don't associate with them. If you're forced to interact due to school/work then report the behaviour. If they're family then blank them until they apologise 
2	Sounds like a total dickhead. Probs not a good person to hang with.
2	INFP's what philosophy speaks to you, or do you follow?	I'm starting to get into stoicism, seems pretty cool. I use to be an existentialist with nihilistic tendencies, I'm curious what philosophies you guys (and boob guys [also known as girls]) follow.
3	Minimalism is a sort of lifestyle and philosophy that suits me in a lot of ways. See r/minimalism.\n
3	I mostly connect with stoicism. There is a ton of wisdom from those old philosophers that I find myself applying to myself regularly. 
5	I just love Jesus man
1	I've read only nihilism and existentialism, but i know i should get some stoics to my list.\n\nI also like some social thinkers like thoureau and deleuze
42	Anyone else find it almost impossible to hate?	I always try and understand the reasons why someone acts the way they do and this has made it very difficult to hate anybody. I thought of this as I saw that meme earlier about would you give a billion dollars to the person you hate if you got a million. I seriously could not think of anybody I truly hate. People have made me very angry and hurt me but I can never bring myself to actually hate them.  I‚Äôm very forgiving. Is this an INFP thing? 
13	When I was a kid, I used to hate a lot more than I do now. I do experience hate, but I don't have as much of a reason to hold onto it now. Most of my hate was irrational and due to ignorance. I hated people who I've barely known, and a few people I thought had abandoned me as friends. \n\nOne time when I was super unhealthy I even defined a aspect of my personality by hate, and another of anger. Once I began to realize my hatred was irrational, I began to pull away from hatred. I may have actually hated something for a small period of time, but it was often replaced by some imposter version of hate that I defined myself by. \n\nNow, I barely hate anything and barely get angry. I personally believe hatred and anger is a waste of my energy.
9	i'm forgiving to a fault. 
7	No. Majority of people I work with are ignorant. Through their ignorance and preservation of their ego they spread suffering and degradation of everything that should be correct and oriented towards improvement and ease. \n\nIt rubs me the wrong way on so many levels that it triggers me, it is an ordeal to maintain composure to simply be in the presence of such humans.
4	I definitely relate to this. 
4	Many INFPs do have an immense capacity to forgive, and see the good in people, that's true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is commonly true to a harmful extent too, like when some INFPs get stuck in a toxic relationship for years and years. We can be quicker to forgive other people's serious missteps than to forgive ourselves for tiny faults and recognize a situation that's truly bad for us and bad for everyone in the bigger scheme of things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you think you're too forgiving, a friend whose judgement you can trust can be helpful in getting you out of trouble. Just having someone in your life you can confide to but with a different perspective is healthy in general, and is great for creative endeavors and big decisions.
3	Same, I can't think of anyone I'd actually hate. I've built up a lot of anger and resentment for some individuals for how they've treated me in the past but I don't think that's anywhere near hate, I'd still act coolly civil around them without problems, if it came to that. \n\nBut I've been lucky enough to not have been bullied or assaulted or anything like that, just ignored a lot and I know that's pretty much never intentional. I think these people should try to be more thoughtful, but it would require a much more personal crime for me to hate anyone.
3	I have a lot of anger due to the seemingly impossible nature of what I want in life compared to what would be easy bu lt I dont want.
3	I somewhat feel the same way. I try to make amends with any bad blood I have with people. But in reality there will always be someone who you don‚Äôt agree with or have bad blood with. It‚Äôs just inevitable in my opinion. People like bullies, competitors, exes, your partners exes, etc. I just try my best to forget about those people completely.
3	Ever since I was a child, I've never been able to hate people. Sure there are people I strongly dislike and would not want to have anything to do with, but I can't hate them. I have this tendency to think of people as their child self, and wonder what happened to make them who they are as adults, and if we could go back in time far enough to find common ground. As long as people are alive they have an opportunity to become someone better, so I can't hate anyone because that feels like I would be taking that opportunity away somehow.
2	its easy not to hate and it also feels freeing not to do so x)
2	I have internal outbursts of irrational hate but they usually normalize within a few hours.
2	I tend to project all my anger on things rather than people. Unfortunately I've found that this doesn't shield people around me from my anger, so I've had to deal with that. \n
2	Mostly, I don't *hate* people. I can be angry, hurt, frustrated by people and by extension don't care much to be around them, but very rarely do I actually hate someone.\n\nBut I hate Donald Trump. **Hate him.** I hope he trips and falls headfirst into a roaring fireplace.\n\n
1	Yes. Haha
6	What Careers are recommended for INFPs?	I think the main thing with me as an INFP is that I despise the following in a career:\n\n9-5,\nWorking around the Public,\nRepetitiveness in Tasks and \nAdmin Work.\n\nIt got me thinking about careers, I can cross out a few, Law, Pharmacy, Medicine, Lab Tech, Politics and most importantly working in a School, it brings me to thinking, what careers would fit me?
6	Maybe don't think about which careers you wouldn't like. Look at the subjects you enjoy and go from there/explore your options i wouldn't dismiss jobs because they're 9-5. I don't like 9-5 but I found something I'm passionate about and work 8-7 and come home happy :). \nSo yeah just look for fields that interest you!
3	I started out pursuing a strong interest in mapping.  That led to a university degree, then some jobs with progressively more complexity and responsibility.  In my current job, my work has morphed into some mapping with more planning.  Quiet me is now an assertive person who has no trouble speaking to large groups, leading discussions, presenting, etc.  I still prefer to be alone in my office, but that extrovert stuff is no bother.\n\nI had no idea my job existed when I started out, and don't think it would have sounded appealing at that time.  Actually, it didn't exist - it only exists because I grew into it professionally.  No amount of planning or thinking would have led me here.  Also, I am not the person I was in my early 20s.  That is something people seem to overlook when searching for careers, relationships, lifestyles, whatever - by the time you achieve whatever it is, you won't be the same person.  So why bother spending your energy striving for things that won't look the same once you have them?\n\nInstead, you can keep an eye on future possibilities while choosing what is good for you today.  There are many steps from here to there, most of them things you just don't know to consider before you actually take a step.
2	I think a lot of the ones you‚Äôve crossed out were high on my list. \n\n\nAs a child, and even a young adult, I had a ‚Äúsave the world‚Äù mentality. I wanted to teach, be a politician, be in medicine, be a social worker, a fire fighter. \n\nReality is far less optimistic. I wandered a bit aimlessly before deciding on nursing. Compassion fatigue was real - I have a hypothesis that this is actually worse for feelers. Now I do consulting. A lot of mental stimulation, room to create/problem solve, variation, constant change (which I love), and just enough face time with other really smart people to fill my cup and propel me forward. 
1	Not sure if it's an INFP thing or not, but it wasn't until I took a job I was sort of qualified for (in this case lab work and chemical compounding) that I enjoyed it. I didn't go back and get a chemistry degree (I have two fine arts degrees) but the point is, I had no idea what I really would like until I tried out several jobs. \n\nDo you think that INFP's are more likely than others to want a lifetime career as opposed to just working a job that makes money? It sure feels that way to me. Or maybe I just don't like interviewing. 
1	An obvious job I read about that seems to apply really well to us is counselling and mental health, where are our caregiver natures come through. \n\nCurious, why is working in a school a strikeout for you? I would have felt this a close second to the above; helping people grow and providing guidance and care.
1	I‚Äôm going to school right now to be a minister. But I volunteer as a youth minister right now at a church each week and really enjoy it. \nI‚Äôve found that I really enjoy jobs where I can help people smile and appreciate life or jobs where I don‚Äôt have to talk to anyone and can just think all day (I worked as a grounds keeper for a summer) 
137	Any INFPs on here find the more solemn, dark side of life to be more apppealing/beautiful	I get the sense that a lot of INFPs are on the more optimistic side of the spectrum, but personally enjoy the darker, melancholic aspects of life. Rainy days, sad music, winter, silence, dark humor, etc. I find these darker aspects to be aesthetically pleasing, filling me with both comfort and wonder.\n\nI'm wondering if this is a common trait for INFPs. 
42	I actually prefer that pleasant melancholic feeling over happiness. It feels more raw and true to my core self. I may fake happiness but I can't fake melancholia.\n\nWhat about dark/melancholic aspects do you find pleasing?
33	I‚Äôm optimistic, but I also enjoy the dark side.  ;)\n\nI find the light and dark aspects of life equally pleasing.  How can you appreciate one without the other?
17	Life is a balancing act. You can‚Äôt have light without dark just as there would be no concept of ‚Äòup‚Äô if you didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äòdown.‚Äô The challenge is how we choose to embrace that shadow. I‚Äôve struggled with bouts of depression on and off for a few years and there‚Äôs a whole host of circumstances and challenges that facilitated those feelings but that‚Äôs a whole other story. I‚Äôve been making big strides over the past couple months towards improving my mental health overall, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm beating the depression so much as I‚Äôm embracing the perspective it gives me in a healthier way rather than stewing and feeling sorry for myself.  Channeling those feelings into something productive like writing or drawing gives me a clearer window into what‚Äôs going on in my head. My mind is constantly buzzing and I can often get lost in its intensity. There is certainly an element of beauty to feelings of melancholy which is something I‚Äôve been learning to appreciate on a deeper level. We just have to learn the proper way to handle them.
8	Maybe the unhealthy ones?\nI personally loooove dark stuff. But I'm more for dark stuff as in horror, rather than melancholy. \nCan an INFP be into that stuff? Like, being fascinated by the gruesome and morbid. ü§î\n
9	That's a terrible stereotype. INFPs are the most idealistic and sensitive of all types and that makes them very prone to melancholia. You can think of famous INFPs personas and most of them, were actually on the dark side of the feeling spectrum: Virgiana Woolf, Fraz Kafka, Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, Kurt Cobain, Ian Curtis, Fionna Aple, Heath Ledger etc. None of them were your happy go lucky sunshines, that's more of an ENFP anyway.   \n\n\nI'm sure that enneagram plays a great role in this as well, INFP 4s are more prone to melancholia than INFP 9s for example. 
7	Haha my favorite parts of life! \n\nJust a little dark, and gloomy is perfect for me!
6	Absolutely. I'm seen as a happy person, despite my quietness, but the happiness stems from feeling secure and confident in the things I enjoy and who I am tied into this. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the lighter aspects and believe them beautiful as well, but the more solemn side I find poetic and resonating on a cellular level. It's reflected in my tastes of music, dress, art, literature, and my outlook on life in general.   \n\n\nBoth sides have their unique beauty, that the other cannot be.  \n\n\n&#x200B;
5	for sure, it appeals to me for the same reasons i like negative space in art, debussy also once said "the music is not in the notes, but in the silence between them." just my personal opinion but what i feel like i enjoy about the dark side of life is the natural pulling down you feel in the absence of good things, there's like a natural gravity in human experience that's always working to bring us back down to earth and earth where you can see how things work eye to eye as an agent who is engaging with an elegant beautiful system instead of the abstract birds eye view from above
4	More like I don't put the generally accepted term "negative" to those feelings. Accepting all parts of yourself is a key to being whole. There is no dark without light, but more practically, crying and feeling depressed (acutely, not chronically) are healing and human.
3	I had a girlfriend who once said "I think I just like being sad". She wasn't an INFP, I don't think I feel that way but...darker life can sometimes feel more "real" than bright, shiny, days.
3	I like both sides. I used to be only  drawn to the darker stuff, but I realized how good the other side is too.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I enjoy the peace and solace of rainy days where I can reflect on things.  It just depends on my mood.
3	I'm not necessarily a fan the "darker side of life" but I do enjoy tranquility. The silent trickling of rain against the window, cold and foggy fall days, melancholic songs, fall in general, etc.\n\nI feel most at peace in these "imperfect" settings, not necessarily unpleasant but not quite ideal either. A summer thunderstorm for example, something people generally consider unfortunate, makes me rip open my windows and just enjoy watching the rain patter on the ground.\n\nWhich in hindsight is probably what you meant, oops. Tho I wouldn't say optimism and preferring "darker" things are mutually exclusive, since I can identify with both. I dunno, I'm tired and Prosper M√©rim√©e has been haunting me for the past few days so I can't quite think straight.
3	Sometimes i used to enjoy feeling sad when i was very lonely at times - feeling sad was better than feeling empty, but that was years ago. Now, i meditate and exercise regularly, but enjoy sad songs movies etc bc it contrasts the joy in life, and again, feelings of sad are moving in a way that‚Äôs misunderstood 
3	oooohh yesssss!\n\nthose wonderful dark underground electronic music genres as real dubstep, drumfunk, breakcore, psytrance, hard techno, crossbreed...\n\ni never managed to describe that feeling that i love the most. that feeling seems at first emotionless and not caring, but its not, its dark love and energy. idk :D\n\nbut i also love the sad aspects of the darker side as deep, distant, melancholic future garage...\nend of the world vibes...\n\nrainy days and nights, lost places, underground vibes, ...\n\nin the world of art i adore dystopian cyberpunk, newaesthetic & freaky glitchart.\n\n**walking the the path between the light and darkness is the most beautiful thing**
3	Authenticity is generally found in the dark 
2	Yes, I enjoy the dark side a lot, I can be very Plutonian/scorpionic as well. 
2	Yes! I think a lot of people would consider me rather optimistic and positive, but I definitely enjoy melancholia and find beauty in everything dark and gloomy. I've loved "sad" music for as long as I can remember and my sense of humor is pretty dark and morbid. I've struggled with depression before, but I find that being mentally healthy actually makes me enjoy the dark and melancholic aspects of life even more. 
2	Yepp i like dark humor and rain a lot
2	I prefer the dark side of life by far. 
2	I've said before (when asked why I appreciate "bitchy" girls over sweet ones), "Think about how often people fake smiles. Now think about how they fake being angry." I just trust negative honesty over its positive sister.
2	I tend to go back and forth when it comes to this. Comfortable in the dark while the light is appealing. 
2	Idk if it‚Äôs a common trait but I can highly relate to your description. I‚Äôm an overall happy person and well balanced but when it comes to art (series, music) and just other interests I‚Äôm always up for some sad/melancholic/dark shit. \nFor me, personally, I think it‚Äôs a way for myself to cope with those sides of the life. It helps me appreciating the real good sides of my life while still being able to explore dark feelings without being personally involved. Because yeah, exploring feelings is a thing I love to do, being able to have empathy with those things. Way more healthy than having those feelings about myself or my real life. 
2	Meeeeee.  \nI like being satisfied more than being happy, if that makes sense.
2	bittersweet <3
2	I find that I actually "enjoy" feeling bittersweet/nostalgic/slightly sad/melancholic because these emotions enable me to experience the full depth of my emotions more easily than positive emotions do. Psychologically, it takes 5 positive experiences to overcome 1 negative experience, which really illustrates the strength of negative emotions. I enjoy feeling **strong** emotions because they make me feel alive. Since humans seldom only experience one emotion at a time, I find that adding a bit of melancholy to my cocktail of emotions actually enables me to think more deeply and introspectively. I think it's all about balance in the sense that I do not like to experience too many negative emotions at once, but to feel 100% positive with not even an ounce of negativity also feels a bit hollow to me.\n\ntl;dr I enjoy feeling certain negative emotions because they increase the intensity of my emotional experience
2	I love dark shit.\n\nDark art, sad music, dark humor.\n\nI used to be emo for fucks sake.....\n\nThere's a part of my that won't completely let go of that. My wardrobe is still 97% black lol.\n\n\nOn the other hand I do also like happy shit alot. I just love FEELING.\n\n(Other than anger and anxiety. They can fuck right off)
2	You legitimately just listed most of my favourite things. It‚Äôs odd, I‚Äôd never thought of myself as someone who liked the darker side of life more, but seeing this has made me consider that maybe that is entirely the case. 
2	I actually prefer it! I love night time, french movies, BDSM, poetry, exploring the intricacies of mental illness, depth psychology, forensic psychology, grunge music/culture. You need it. I use to hang with all the punk/grunge kids. Now I just attract melancholy starving artists. I love joy, light-heartedness, and happiness. But I take my coffee black ;)
2	I embrace the dark side of life! I also find comfort in sadness, but part of that might stem from my childhood experiences. I‚Äôm fascinated by serial killers and horror and gore. I‚Äôve actually taken a couple of taxidermy classes. I‚Äôd say my style is goth, most of my wardrobe is black. If I could live in a castle with gargoyles and have bats as pets I would be the happiest human on Earth lol\n\nWith all that being said, my life isn‚Äôt always doom and gloom. Im very positive and optimistic in life. I just enjoy thing that are extreme and shocking to most other people haha
1	The balance of light and dark is beautiful in itself.
1	Definitely
1	I am generally optimistic, but do like the dark side and the melancholic aspects of life.  Not really into horror, but i find dark stuff very interesting. 
1	I went through a whole snuff-film phase.  I think it was near the tail end of my goth phase, actually.\n\nAlso, INFP is probably HEAVILY correlated with Enneagram 4, where a lot of "meaning" is perceived in meloncholy....  Spoiler Alert: It's a trap!
1	No, but darkness seems to be fond me. Good thing i like survivor stories because i am in one every time i turn around.  
1	All the best to you as well, thank you!
1	More	 When I was a thief  \nThe only thing I couldn't steal was a heart  \nBecause I could take them  \nAnd never truly make them mine  \nWhen I was a cheater  \nI hoped for a chance to face death  \nTo see if it took little thought  \nTo play it as I played that game best  \nWhen I was a liar  \nThe only thing I couldn't twist was the guilt  \nEmpty smiles and empty promise  \nCould get me miles and empty pockets  \nWhen I was a lecher  \nThere was a flesh to be had in many a bed  \nA night or three, maybe a month  \nThis hollow to fill demands a new toy  \nWhen I was a killer   \nThe only body safe was six-feet buried  \nAs I stalked the dark streets  \nVoices ask whose blood is demanded this night  \nWhen I was much less  \nI'd worry and fret over these small things  \nNow I am much more   \nAnd it all still comes as easy as breathing 
9	Any movies you can recommend?	I‚Äôm not much of a movie guy. I‚Äôm definitely a music kind of person and I constantly need to be listening to music and I just love it. So basically I‚Äôve never really gotten much into movie watching so I just wanted hear some recommendations and I‚Äôll watch them:) thank you. 
6	The Grand Budapest Hotel - cool plot and really well acted, filmed etc.\n\nPrincess Bride - classic movie I think. Romance, action drama, comedy all in one. 
6	I think you would love Little miss sunshine if you have weak spots for underdogs :)\n\n&#x200B;
5	Since you prefer music, you can watch a musical, maybe? Les Miserables is one. Also, if you like Pink Floyd and haven't listened to the album The Wall, there is a movie by the same name. It's basically the songs in sequence but qualifies as a musical, I think. The story is great!
4	Good Will Hunting. You seriously need to watch it. 
3	Yeah go for musicals !! My favourites are: Moulin Rouge (seriously the best) and Lalaland. Also Across the Universe. Strongly recommend all of them:)
3	I just watched The Martian for the first time yesterday and holy shit, I don't think I've ever clenched my fist so hard because of suspense, I even clenched my toes
2	I feel like I couldn‚Äôt get any more basic, but if you haven‚Äôt seen them, the harry potter series is an amazing investment. There‚Äôs 8 Harry potter movies. Or if you have Netflix, Bandersnatch by black mirror is really cool. It‚Äôs an interactive movie where you decide what happens. This probably isn‚Äôt much help, but I love both of these.
2	The Little Prince and Gifted üòÅ
2	I watched Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky" the other day.  It's wonderful.
1	HERO\n\nLegendary story of China's beginnings.  The story is excellent and well-made, the music score is superb and sets the mood in most scenes, the grandiose use of color in the various story segments ties different elements together.  My fave movie.
1	Western: Elizabethtown, Cashback, Keith, In Your Eyes\n\nJapanese: Tremble All You Want, Kids on the Slope, Unmasked Noise
1	Mary Poppins (the original with Julie Andrews) is my favorite movie of all time. Second is Willy Wonka (with Gene Wilder) third is Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium (with Dustin Hoffman). And the first two are great musicals. 
1	I just finished watching Shape of Water and it was great
1	Interstellar!
1	How about movies with good music in them? I‚Äôve enjoyed:\nAmadeus - a biopic of Mozart\nMarie Antoinette \nDonnie Darko\nThe Breakfast Club\nThe Virgin Suicides
74	Extreme loneliness as an INFP male	Hi,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a 24 year old male INFP going to art school and this is my first post ever on Reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've recently been experiencing feelings of extreme loneliness, isolation, and unworthiness. I'm hoping that, through this post, I can ask for some advice from other fellow INFPs who has had struggled with similar issues as that I'm going through right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo simply put the struggle I'm dealing with right now, I have no real friends and I have never had a girlfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have people who I would talk to when certain situations arise, but there is no one whom I regularly make contact with. There is no one whom I can confidently say that I genuinely care about and enjoy being together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find it extremely difficult to find like-minded people that I can make meaningful connections with. I don't think it's a problem that stems from shyness or lack of communication skills, because I can perfectly converse and socialize with people without an issue. I used to be incredibly shy and even struggled with a mild form of social anxiety, but now I've mostly overcome them to the point that they no longer prevent me from doing the things that I want to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the problem has more to do with the fact that I'm so different from everybody else. I'm so different that I just don't fit in with the vast majority of the people that exist on Earth. I feel like an alien that came from a different planet. I exist on a different frequency. I feel like a total stranger in this universe, with nothing that I can cling to for emotional support. And this obviously makes me feel incredibly sad, lonely, and estranged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes these negative feelings become so intense that I almost lose the will to go on living. Because what's the point of life if it is to be so painful and lonely? Is life supposed to be this painful and lonely? I see everyone smiling around me. What the hell are they smiling about? I have nothing in my life to which I can smile about. Why is it so difficult for me to make friends and find a girlfriend?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like there's a bottomless hole in my heart that saps all hope, joy, and meaning from my life. I want to be genuinely loved and cared about for who I am. I want to find people whom I can genuinely love and care about. I want to give and receive love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy inability to form deep and meaningful relationships with others almost makes me feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me. Everywhere I look, I see people forming friendships and romantic relationships as naturally and easily as catching the flu during flu season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand logically that there's nothing actually wrong with me and that I just don't match with most people, but I just can't help but to feel that I'm intrinsically flawed and unworthy of love. Because if I really am worthy of love, then shouldn't I have good friends and a girlfriend to prove that point? I see no evidence in my life that validates my worthiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing the idealist that I am, maybe my conception of friendship and romance is too idealistic (aka unrealistic). I seek true friends and a wonderful romantic partner with whom I can build deep and meaningful relationships. But maybe what most people call "friends" are really just little more than acquaintances in my book. Maybe what most people call "romance" is little more than a way to fulfill their sexual and aesthetic impulses. Maybe my standards of what exactly constitute friendship and romance are too high. Maybe most people just settle for and compromise with what they can get, but I can't because I'm an idealist at heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went through a major identity crisis about five years ago. I realized that who I was at the time was not the kind of person who I wanted to be. So I took steps to change who I was so that I could become my ideal self. I can confidently say that I've undoubtedly become stronger, wiser, more mature, more resilient, and more experienced now than who I was before, but I still don't feel any different. I still feel like an unworthy piece of shit. I'm still just as lonely and isolated as before. I still have no friends and I am still forever alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's so frustrating. I've become a better person, but my life actually hasn't changed one bit. I still feel the same negative emotions of loneliness, isolation, and unworthiness just the same as before. It makes me wonder, if my life hasn't actually changed, then did I really become a better person?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the extremely long post. I guess this turned out more as a venting of all my thoughts and emotions than anything. I really don't have anyone with whom I can share my inmost thoughts and feelings, so I poured out everything going on in my mind right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if you can relate to my experiences and have some advice that you can offer me, please share them with me. I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
15	You're an art student. Art is emotion. Lean into the feelings of sadness, fear, anger, isolation, and loneliness. These feelings are a gift. Use art as an outlet for these feelings. The greatest artists in the world are the one's who didn't fit in and who were lonely.\n\nI went through a period of my life just like you. And I leaned into all the crazy feelings I got and wrote music to pass the time. Now I am at a point in my life where I am comfortable sharing my art and music with the world and people seem to really enjoy it. I've started meeting people and making connections because of it.\n\nInstead of venting on Reddit, vent into your art.\n\nI hope this helps you!
10	**Philosophical side of an answer**: People are weird. Every one of us. I don't know any normal people. I don't know anyone who has it all together. I don't know anyone who's presentation of perfection and respectability goes straight down to the root of their soul. It is not how people think of themselves, though it may be how they *want* to think of themselves. \n\nSo the first thing to do when in this kind of rut is to realize that you are not alone at all in it. The feeling of something wrong or different with you is universal and is a direct connection to everyone else. \n\nThe second thing to do is understanding it, teasing it all out and defining it is *exhausting*. It is not just a long conversation, it is decades of long conversations. So when building friendships, instead of focusing conversation on differences, you focus it on similarities with the understanding that the differences are present and go all the way down. For example: "I like chess, you like chess, lets play chess! Lets talk about chess. Study chess. Go to chess tournaments etc." but I am more then a chess person. So are you. That is understood. But our connection is built on chess even if it moves into other things later on. \n\nThe third thing to understand is that friendships develop and grow and are nurtured by you. They don't just happen. Even instant connections don't just happen (you have to at minimum, meet and talk) and they, in themselves cannot sustain a friendship or relationship. You can be completely in tune with someone. The conversation can be a five hour back and forth of "yes! I know what you mean!!!!" but without getting together with the person again and having something to do (even it is just talk), it will go nowhere. Without going *through* the shallows you will never get deep.\n\nWhich leads me to the...\n\n**Practical side of an answer**: Get out of the domicile and get around people. College is really great for this. There are a lot of opportunities to be around people. You don't even necessarily have to join a group or do a thing. It helps, but more important is being around people. Being available to talk to. Being somewhere you can spot other people who might be interesting to talk to. Somewhere you can overhear interesting conversations. You can take you art projects/homework and work on them. People may leave you alone or come up and ask to see what you are working on. If they do, you get a conversation and if they don't, you get some work done. \n\nKeep in mind that you can choose when too much interaction is just too much and you need some recharge time. One of my fears of doing this kind of thing was that I would become overwhelmed and always have to be "on." But I found that people will leave me alone when I need it. Also I can stop making close friends when I have enough.\n\n**On a final note**: start developing a good relationship with yourself. Meditation can really help with this, but doing nice things for yourself, taking yourself to places you always wanted to go, spending some money on things you want but don't need, telling yourself nice things and so on can really help ease loneliness because you are always around someone you like: *you*. You also don't need other people so intensely which helps you walk away from relationships that are genuinely awful when necessary. 
13	Make hobbies. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôll make friends. Put yourself out there, it won‚Äôt just fall in your lap. And if you‚Äôre willing to do this as it will help your chances, read some socialization books like Carnegie‚Äôs how to win friends and influence people. You may say you‚Äôre fine but it will help you understand what people like out of their interactions with friends. And make sure you aren‚Äôt asking too much of people, usually letting them scale up the friendship is an easier method than throwing all your emotions at them like a monkey throws his own shit
5	You sound and write like me what the heck. Send me a DM. 
4	You desperatly need a social circle you care about and a future ex-girlfriend. It's hard I know, I used to be in the exact same position as you, but I got pulled out of it by an INFP friend of mine who was light-years ahead of me in personal  development, kind of like a father figure to me to this day.
5	There is a way of being that is interrupted by our thoughts. We get so far inside our head that we lose track of the light that surrounds us. From your words, I can tell you feel heavy, like you're carrying a stone. Practice thinking of replacing that stone on your shoulders with a feather. Lightness attracts people, they gravitate towards it. As you move through space imagine yourself as that lightness. Transfer that lightness into your face, hands, walk. It may help separate you from your thoughts, and you may feel less burdened. Trust your lightness and you'll feel easier. People will notice.
4	Being an infp can get very lonely. Even a feeler female.. it is almost impossible for us heterosexual women to find a man we can express ourselves with, to the point where I think that it's impossible to find one that would even listen. My other female friends are NT's so i'm not going to talk about feelings with them, and I don't expect that from them either. So basically you are left alone as a feeler woman. And constantly invalidated and rejected for being who you are. I know people say life is hard for feeler men, but as Fi-doms women, we are also constantly punished for being who we are. Being emotionally honest is "being irrational", being open is "blaming" and exploring the truth is "a waste of time". We also can see the "truth" and many guys and women find that "pushy" and "revealing too much". I just cbf anymore lol. \n\nThere is a lot of hope for you to find feeler friends and a partner who will understand. I have definitely offered that to all my partners, a safe passage for complete honesty and realness. I highly recommend infjs, they are so good to be around and their perspectives and empathy is very soothing. You'll find lots in personality groups, but also they like theories, so intellectual places are breeding ground for them too. They are rare, but out there. Good luck and hang in there. Life for an infp is filled with ups and downs, and some days are terrible, other days you have hope x
3	It sounds like perhaps you're putting too much pressure onto your social encounters. When meeting new people, whatever the context may be, try not to focus on an end goal such as finding friends or a relationship. Relationships and friends might result (and indeed are more likely to happen once you take the pressure off yourself) but if not it doesn't mean you wasted your time. It's good to talk to new people for it's own sake - though this is a lesson I struggle to take to heart myself of course!
3	You may feel lonely but everything here on earth is alive and connected. We‚Äôre all in this together even though many of us, at times, think everyone and everything is against us. \n\n‚ÄúDear Prudence, open up your eyes\nDear Prudence, see the sunny skies\nThe wind is low, the birds will sing\nThat you are part of everything‚Äù
2	When would you consider someone to be a real friend?
2	I know how you feel my man. Honestly it sounds like you haven't accepted yourself, which might be why you have a hard time finding people to relate to. \n\nI'm 25, have a small group of close friends, make new friends easily, and have only had 1 real girlfriend so far. But by no means do I consider myself in a better position than you mentally. I still think of myself as a loser most of the time due to not having a real career, no college degree, living paycheck to paycheck, and struggling with online dating. I've thought of myself as an alien on earth just as you have.\n\nBut although I have self esteem issues, I've accepted that I will always have high standards for myself no matter the situation and the only thing I can do is push on forward with a smile on my face. I've also come to realize that we all struggle to fit in, INFP or not, and that is the one relatable thing that everyone shares. Bring a great attitude with you everywhere you go, even if it's not how you really feel inside, because that's what really attracts people.\n\nI think another piece of advice I can give you is to make an effort to hang out with people. I've struggled with that mainly because I'm a loner, but realised that relationships (friendly and intimate) are a two-way street. You won't keep people around if you don't put yourself out there. \n\nDon't despair my dude, life is hard but it can only get easier with optimism! Let your personality shine through everywhere you go!
2	No idea if you play and video games on PC, but if you ever wanna play something, just DM me!
1	Whether you make friends or not, you need to start putting these feelings onto your canvases. Pour it all onto the paper with the right colours and images.\n\nFriends, they come and go, you need to make friends at any age, I‚Äôm 30 and I‚Äôve cut out loads of people from my life and starting where you are, friends are over rated. Enjoy your own company and you will find people, it will happen. Try to do activities or anything that excites you.\n\nSome of us do go through loneliness, it gets easier as you get older, as people rarely live up to basic expectations.
1	There's nothing wrong with preferring ones own comfort. Like you, i feel isolation, for me the thing is that it's only a feeling; how i feel now certainly won't be forever.\n\nGoals dreams and everyday tasks are more important to me, do you and you'll be fine.\nPushing boundaries, seeing the results of your effort as you face a deadline. I can't stop, neither should you.\n\nI could fall for lust\n\nI could loosen my restrains\n\nI could forget\n\nI could have given up\n\n\n\nI took another step forward, that's what i did
1	I was going through something similar about a couple of months ago to a year. For some background, I'm also an INFP (Recently found out) and am a Director of Photography, and direct if I have too but usually only do when I write the screenplay or deeply studied a book for a screenplay. This feeling of loneliness hit me out of nowhere one day, and I've just kept thinking about how lonely I was. At first, I thought it was a mid-life crisis thing, but realized I was being too skeptical since I'm only 22. Then I thought depression, but I didn't feel sad or ever felt to end it. I would just be sitting in front of my computer or notebook thinking about it for hours or laying in bed staring up thinking about it. I now realized that I was trying to find the root of the problem and trying to find an answer to fix it, a question to improve thyself if you will. Thankfully, I have parents who always talk to me about anything and show my brother and I unconditional love constantly, which I think is a huge factor on why I'm almost never depressed. I would thank them for always being there (Never done this much until I had this loneliness thought), I would then stumble unto reddit about I think 6-8 months ago and meeting new people around the world. But I think the biggest thing which people already mention are hobbies. As a Director of Photography and camera operator, I would always try and go do something with my craft. I've made a bunch of friends in film school and we all still get together to bring an idea to the big screen. Even now, I'm making 2 short films in the next 2 months and the process to get it finish just evaporates the thought of loneliness. And this recent thought of loneliness made me go into the r/filmmakers subreddit and posted if anybody needed help for their films in the local area to PM me. And so many people did! I've made so many new friends like this, new and old (Mostly old) that I bonded close with. I would go not knowing anyone except their script and ideas and would instantly connect when I studied it and everyone respected that I put my time to study their idea they had for a while. It takes time too. You're an art student, and most INFP end up in some artistic field (I think? New to this). If you're in school, go to your schools ART department and work there instead of home alone. Have some art? Post it on the r/pics subreddit and have some people enjoy your art and maybe send you a PM about how you end up making it and what was the process. Make the change. If you stay at home all the time then that loneliness will eat at you. Strive to change yourself and find yourself again if you feel like you need to end it because you really don't, you can make great things and should think of the future and then a future with you in it. Hope this helps!
1	I got out of art as a profession because I did not fit in... it's not all about talent. Much of life with people is about fitting in... connections. Many artists have connections due to family, money, etc. Even artists with connections struggle, unfortunately.\n\nPeople need support. That's why I got into IT. It feels great to get handed jobs and make decent cashola. And I still have my personal vision.\n\nIf I could go back I would get into more social justice stuff because the people tend to be more grounded in stuff that matters for all life, less about selfish stuff IMO.\n\nI recommend running and meditation for personal maintenance. Breathing... so many feelings get reinforced in the breath, sensations compound there IMO. \n\ntake care.
1	Hi, I'm an INFP female and I just created my first reddit account because this thread resonates with me. Recently, a really close friend of mine (a male INTP) decided he needs "solitude", then started to decrease his communication with me. We were each other's go-to person, and Idk why I was really hurt by what he did. In the past we dated for a little while, he was my first boyfriend. During that relationship, he hurt me because he was so insensitive and we decided to call it off and back to being friends. Really, when we broke up I just felt worthless because I thought "even someone who knows me for 8+ years can't even put up with me. Maybe I'm not worthy of love." But afer that I still regarded him as my favorite human, I thought my love for him was platonic. I really cared for him, as a human. He was my anchor that kept me grounded, a home in a spiritual sense.\n\nDuring the no-contact moment, I thought about the things that I might did wrong. Yes, I am not perfect. But what I realized is I was never his "favorite human", not his first "go to person". We've known each other for 10 years but we rarely got into deep, meaningful conversations. He dislikes them because they tired him out. However, he liked to have them with his new friends, he prioritized people he just knew over me, said that his new friend was "his only friend". I was so hurt because I thought we were on the same page, and I am his priority. \n\nThis made me very lonely, extremely lonely. I lost someone who's very dear to me. (He said we're good and are still friends, but it's not the same anymore. I decided to take it to the extreme: I lost him). I lost my anchor, I didn't know how to identify myself without him. For days I cried, I felt like a piece of breathing meat. All I did was sleeping because I didn't want to think about it. And I hated myself for being in that state. But there was nothing I can do. So I cried until I felt tired and then decided a "new life" for me. I just graduated so I decided to learn new skills and made myself busy with finding jobs, improving my resumes, etc. Basically made myself busy by doing everything I can.\n\nAs time went by, I realized a few things. I thought I was unable to open up myself to others (him, especially) and I thought that was why he felt closer to his new friend. But hey, it was him who did not open up to me. In fact I opened up to him a lot, and often he was not paying attention when I did. Then, I realized maybe I was "in love" with the idealized version of him in my mind, not the real him. I got "over him" by repeatedly saying to myself that he's only human after all, and my expectation of him was too high. I should've known he was not I thought he was, and remind myself to keep my expectation low towards anyone in the future. I decided that maybe we already grew each other out and that it was time to let go. He said he didn't understand why I am like who I am: feeling everything so strongly, too complex for him to understand. That was why our conversations were so mundane, I often felt craving for intimacy that I was so deprived of in our relationship.\n\nNow I feel better because I had those epiphanies. I lowered my expectations towards people. I no longer believe in the myth of arrival (quoting you, "I've become a better person, but my life actually hasn't changed one bit. I still feel the same negative emotions of loneliness, isolation, and unworthiness just the same as before." Before I believed that I would be happy if I dated my best friend, but it didn't happen). I decided to be in charge of my well-being, happiness, emotional satisfaction. When I feel that I have the power to make myself happy, I feel empowered and more at peace. By doing so, I feel like I'm doing myself and people around me a favor. I'm still bitter, but not as bad as before and that reflects how I handle my other interpersonal relationships. I take things slow, I don't expect much from people, and I don't try to control things that's beyond my control. I experienced that even someone can even feel lonely in such relationship, your happiness is not guaranteed. So, I decided that myself is enough.\n\nSorry for the long post, and somehow you can take one or two things from my experience :')\n\n&#x200B;
1	Can relate, and honestly it's mainly that people suck...sorry to all people reading this I love you all. What I mean is that everyone already has their best and closest friends chosen, making it way harder for us to get in. Personally I'm nobody's first choice, yet I help as best I can. Those dark feelings of loneliness hurt so much that I might never be able to live them down, even scars on my body from it. Reaching out like this really helps settle it down, personally I had to contact the crisis text line and honestly they probably saved my life. Never had a girlfriend either my dude, and I get how that can just hurt a ton but think about this: you get to be yourself and have nobody to tell you otherwise. Honestly high school is where this gets to people like us the most when everyone around you seems to have their social circles and you don't, just take time to focus on yourself, people will take notice. We're always here for you man, good luck on this journey
1	You are not alone!! I can relate to everything you said and I would give you a big hug if I could! I‚Äôve suffered from depression my whole life because my awkwardness has made me feel like an outcast.  \n\nEveryone has given great advice already. Whenever youre feeling some type of way direct that energy into your artwork.  As far as relationships, have you tried bumble? Even if your date doesnt blossom into a relationship, you might make a great friend out of it! \n\nGoodluck and I hope you find your happiness. \n\n
3	Looking for INFP gaming buddy(ies) :)	Hi everyone, \nWas just thinking if there are some INFPs here that play World of warcraft or overwatch in EU and would like to play with me? I'm not a competitive player or anything. Not really very good but I do spend a lot of my free time playing so if anyone would be interested in playing with me lemme know :). Thought It'd be cool to play with other INFPs.\n\n(Also if you play other games on pc and are looking for someone I might give another game a chance :))\n\n(If you would prefer getting to know me before playing just send me an MP and we can talk ! )
2	Lame ass European ppl , too bad you‚Äôre not in Canada 
2	Consider me interested. I'll PM my battle net nick.
2	I would play with you, unfortunately, I wont have anything to play games with for the following months, since I'm away from home for a project and as if that's not enough, my laptop was a stolen a few weeks back.
19	Anyone else sure they‚Äôll die alone (without an SO)	Just as the title says. I‚Äôve somehow managed to make friends, even had a few romantic interests, but nothing seems to stick. I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me, but Im sure there is something wrong. It‚Äôs almost like ‚Äònormal‚Äô people can sense when someone is a little off.
18	Either that or unhappily settle and repress parts of myself 
12	I‚Äôve definitely accepted the idea of being without a partner forever. Usually either I like the person and they don‚Äôt like me or vise versa. I also don‚Äôt particularly enjoy going out and meeting new people because I prefer to spend time with friends one-on-one. I don‚Äôt go to bars and deleted all my dating apps, so I‚Äôve basically eradicated all hope of finding a SO unless the universe graciously sends one my way by shooting star.
8	Absolutely looking forward to dying alone
3	Until just recently my dream has been to be a wife & mother. All the sudden I am indifferent to that prospect, which is great considering I haven't even been on a date in 5 years and I'm honestly pretty young. Now I am dreaming up all the things I could do with so few responsibilities and my independence. But I imagine that having 50,000 different interests is a common dilemma for us INFPs.
4	If you think that you will die alone, you increase your chances of that happening.   Im doing that because i would rather die alone than with someone like my last two SO's.  
3	I really never hope this happens to me, but a lot of the time I feel like i‚Äôll never find a partner. I‚Äôve always been very antisocial, and I get so nervous around guys even if I really do like them. It‚Äôs one of my worst qualities I think. I also have a hard time showing my true self to anyone in the real world.
3	This is one of my worst fears.\nI worry that I'll die completely alone.\nWithout even having friends.\n\nBut maybe I could learn how to be happy just by myself? Maybe I don't need other people as much as I think I do? \n
3	I still hope for the first girl i fellbin love with, but i'm definetly going to be very lonely for a while.
3	My divorce is coming up pretty soon so I've decided what's best is to stay alone so that way I can't get hurt again and I can live life the way I want now.
4	Don't be hasty
4	My grandparents were married for like 65 years.\n\nBefore Granny died, she fell backwards and hit her head on the pavement.  She wasn't really there for about four weeks, just sitting in a chair staring ahead and wasting away and not speaking at all.  So she was absent, and then she just died.\n\nAbout six years later, Pop died, he was 99.  He had been saying things like, "I guess Jesus done forgot about me" for the last decade.  Then one day, his kidneys quit.  They can't just write "old age" on a death cert.\n\nThey both basically died alone.\n\nDeath is a personal thing that is just yours.  I wouldn't worry about it much.  When the time comes, by most accounts, it's absolutely fine (to the extent that a lot of people who get revived after brain flat-line spend some time angry because they got yanked back from a place of BEAUTY and BLISS and into this world, again).  There's no sense making an otherwise sublime moment that is alone for literally everyone into something else.\n\nAnyway, I have had a lot of SOs, and it can be very lonely laying there on the bed curled up with someone and feeling completely alienated and like you should be basically anywhere else, doing anything else.  In a few relationships, I stayed with that for months, due to wanting to stay with a commitment or else ironically being afraid that being alone would be worse.  But alone is always better than a bad relationship.\n\nAfter a serial monogamy with lonely periods in the middle of it, I look back and see that I consistently overrated being in a relationship.  It's like there's a lot of social pressure to do it, like social pressure to be very Extroverted, Sensing, and Thinking, and J rather than P (or p rather than j for you socionics freaks).....  and like feelings of freakishness and self-consciousness for differing from the norms.\n\nIf you want to date somebody, go do it, but don't expect too much.  It's the expectations that make it heavy.  All this business about "Dying alone."  Dying is trivial, probably very interesting, and it's always alone.  \n\nIf, on the other hand, you expect about as much from a lover as you expect from your pets, i.e. you don't care if they occasionally piss on the floor....  then there's a lightness to the whole thing and it's easy and you get all the brain chemicals from it, so they're your pet and your heroin dealer, and you're their pet and heroin dealer.\n\nBut you never get anywhere with a lot of gravity.  Gravity always makes things "a little off."\n\nEdit:  Oh yeah, I was a virgin until I was like 23, which seems unusual in America in 2003.   But I had had a very religious upbringing, literally broke up with every girl if it got sexual.  Then I felt obligated to try and marry them until I was like 27.  It was kind of a shitshow.  Eventually I took it all very lightly, had very much shorter times "alone" and enjoyed the experiences a lot more when with someone.
2	Likely going to be on the path of the "off-grid hermit monk" here. Always liked the idea of having a light load; no family (as in creating a family of one's own), no S.O, and ultimately, no anchor. Said things seems stressful from afar, but it's likely due to a mixture of laziness, fear, and a certain level of apathy; and possibly internalized unhealthy ideas regarding relationships as well. Though, if one is content with it internally, then good for them, I suppose. 
2	I've learned to accept it at this point, maybe that will change but I highly doubt it
1	I already know the girl I want to marry, and shit, I know her a little under a year. This relationship changed me positively so fucking much I'm a completely different person now. INFPs without love are so clueless and without real direction in life, atleast I was. I was so extremely detached before, now I finally don't feel like a spectator of my life but like the actual captain of the goddamn ship. And I know no longer need her, I learned my lessons, but I still want her, so that's a plus. We'll see how it'll turn out.
1	I've thought about this phrase from time to time. Why does it matter what your status is when you die? I think everybody dies alone. You exit the world as you know it, from within your vessel, and nobody is going to do it with you.. Even if they technically do die next to you, or someone is there watching you, your journey is yours alone. \n\nI've been in a few relationships and have often felt the pangs of true isolation when it's the wrong one. \n\nI say, thrive with yourself, and find your path. Eventually, people will show up along the way, and you may be surprised at how aligned with you they seem to be. 
1	I was resigned to staying single the rest of my life. \nMy girlfriend was too. \n\nIt all depends on what you want in life. If you want it go get it, go find it, go do it. I don't give a shit if it's hard or uncomfortable. Go!\n\nYou can be unhappy and uncomfortable doing nothing about it, or you can be unhappy and uncomfortable doing something about it.
16	i had this last night and this afternoon im still waiting for the effects to happen. on the other hand, maybe im just gullible. i don‚Äôt really have high hopes in life, just something to hold on to, to get me through each day without feeling empty.	
3	Sometimes it takes two doses.
3	LMFAO to both of you!
1	When I was a child, pudding really was a source of joy
4	I guess I'll learn to accept one good oerson at a time.	I have a trans friend online who really changed how I looked at transgender people but the folks at the trans subreddit made it clear she's an exception not the rule.\n\nThey totally missed the point about being valued as people and zeroed in on the implication that I saw a difference between cis women and trans women.  Of course there's a difference, but I really didn't think being valued for who you are over what you are was such a horrible thing.\n\nWhere the hell do we fit in in this world?  Apparently my trans friend is the exception to their community that I am to Christians.\n\nI digress.  I guess I was happy to have a cause while it lasted, but it's not my cause, and I'll take the hint.  Phew.\n
2	I can understand being put off by that experience, but keep in mind that Reddit may not be the best representation of the transgender community out there.  People who stick to certain subs can get pulled in by the echo chamber, and it doesn't represent real life.  I hope you don't quit your cause of being an Ally, and I'm sure your friend appreciates you being by her side ‚ò∫
3	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 13	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
4	Rain is good and all, but when it pours, the sound echoing through the house causes me anxiety. I shouldn't have stayed up so long.  \n  \nI'm once again taking time to grow my art-only Instagram account. I'm sad that so many aspiring artists respond to comments that are really shallow platitudes that serve to draw massive attention to the accounts that made them. I have faith that my commitment to authenticity will bring some fellow artists that I can grow and inspire with. Starting with comments and follows for accounts that have promising work and not the fanbase to show for it, I will do my best. Perhaps this is what I need to take my artistic passion seriously.  \n  \nFor far too long, I've brewed and drank my own wormwood from comparisons with others and warping my own meaning of success in a cycle of self-destruction. This poison has only slowed my growth and hampered my willingness to work. It's time to drink water for once.
2	Thought I wasn‚Äôt an infp anymore and retook the test. Still an infp 
1	Why the fuck is David Sylvian so good at music. I cannot stop listening to this
541	I can relate. Can you?	
84	100%. That‚Äôs why we have fewer friends, but better friends.
29	Yes this is true. I can relate. \n\n---- \n\nWe seek real, deep, heartfelt, meaningful connections with those we care about / relate well with. \n\nCould be friends, partner, family, etc. I've even felt this with strangers or people I only met once--it's quite rare, though it's happened. \n\n----\n\nLook for authentic connections reminds me of shooting an arrow into the sky and figuring out where it lands.\n
28	An alternative title could be:\n\nWhy I was incredibly miserable when I moved to Chicago last September.
39	Totally.  I‚Äôm a soul whore.  Sadly, I scare away potential mates when I attempt to mind-meld with them like a dumb gelfling.  Still searching and learning to wait to explore the other persons subconscious cave until we‚Äôre both ready. 
26	I can relate but, personally i feel so holed up in my head that... I cant connect. I do believe being outgoing and friendly will lead to intimacy, and im not those things unfotunately :p but its so nice to have a conversation with someone beyond a superficial level, i just kill those opportunities for myself so often and i hate it. I run and hide
10	I‚Äôve found this as both a blessing and a curse. I like the deep dive and heavy eye contact. Very flirty. And partners gravitated to the intensity.\n\nBut they often fell a bit too quickly, they‚Äôd be making plans for Christmas after the first date, and I‚Äôd back away. Making them feel rejected and I‚Äôd feel terrible. Even when avoiding early sex, it would still go bad.
5	Emphatic description on relationships for us.
4	Yea. I have a feeling I‚Äôm losing someone I thought I could really connect with. This feeling really, really sucks.
7	Hi, very well said, have a silver award, gotta spread the love!! Innit!! :-) \n\nüòÅ
3	This is why I‚Äôm a single middle aged human. 
7	[deleted]
2	Oh yeah definitely 
2	Hard yes. I‚Äôm struggling right now as a matter of fact. I connected really well with a guy but some things happened and we don‚Äôt talk anymore :( I wish everyone looked for a deep intimacy but everyone seems so afraid of it? At least everyone I‚Äôve met is.
2	I can't stand any kind of phoniness.  I can totally relate.
2	We are rare creatures seeking rare treasures and when we find them magic ensues üíú
2	Me exactly 
3	The INFP I'm dating is like this when we are on the phone or in real life. But she doesn't know how to be intimate while texting. Texting is very improtant for me, and I think it will not work out just because of this. 
1	Definitely 
1	Yep, can totally relate to this.
1	 Can‚Äôt relate
1	;)
1	Yes, but I value having lots of friends and connections even though they tire me out. It increases my social status and I think it's important in life, makes a lot of things easier.
-11	Of course everyone here can relate, this is garbage aimed at self-absorbed morons and this is a sub for self-absorbed morons.\n\nLPT: If you live your life based on a retarded facebook quiz that is 100% meaningless if you have to fill it out yourself like all shitty facebook quizes then you are a self-absorbed moron.\n\nWhy is the internet so chock full to the brim with self-absorbed morons who use every trick in the book to jerk off about themselves? MBTI is a circlejerk for idiots, if you were self-aware or in any way intelligent you would cringe to death at MBTI enthusiasts. Fuck the internet and humanity in general. Humanity deserves to be destroyed if people like you believe that you are above average in any way. You're all average and we all know that the average is not anything to be proud of, if you were above average you wouldn't buy into garbage like this.
16	My life is a mess. I just need someone to hear me. I don't know what to do	I'm a 22 yo F from a Muslim background. I'm studying in college, and I still live with my parents. I wish i could leave them and move out on my own,but it's hard where I live and it's not easy to find a part time job as a girl.  I do love my parents but they're ruining my life.They fight all the time and even stopped all communication over 4  year ago all they do is shout and curse at each other everyday. They live under the same roof and use me and my sister as a means to communicate with each other. Sometimes it gets really v*iolent* , Mom can gets crazy sometimes and she *threatened to kill* him and herself more than once she says if she did it it's his fault and we can go live with grandma. I'm scared of leaving them alone. I tried to tell someone but they brushed it off as normal couple fighting, but they've been fighting since I was 8 and they refuse to get divorce bcuz "they're staying for us".\n\nMom is sick. She can't have a reasonable conversation and she always acts as victim when confronted. Whenever I tell her about my day or my social anxiety she mocks me and compare me to other kids and how I'll never be normal. I mean i get where she's coming from, she was forced to quit school and marry my dad. But I'm so tired and overwhelmed. I feel like the parent and it's so draining. I wish my sister could help but she just stir things up by telling each one what the other said.\n\nAlso my parents were always so hard on me. I was always in trouble for something. I have to keep good grades or my phone gets taken. They wont let me go out, had strict curfews, I was followed around and I wasn't allowed to let my hair down. If I did something my dad would hit me so bad leaving bruises sometimes.But my sister was given all the support and she was allowed to do whatever she wants bcuz she's the youngest.\n\nAnd when I was around 7 my parents used to make fun of my weight and when I'm out with dad he would tell me to suck my belly in or people will laugh at me which lead me to stop eating breakfast, or i'd eat and throw it all up, exercise at night all at age 9. I stopped throwing up now but I still can't eat without feeling guilty. I know I look unhealthy but I can't help it.\n\nI developed severe anxiety. I‚Äôm a socially awkward mess I have social anxiety. I can't make friends or talk in class without shaking badly, and I sound so immature around strangers or even friends . I don't know if I'm developmentally arrested, but at home I take care of everything and I feel like the parent of the family but with strangers t's like my child self came out.My parents or teachers don't understand this whole social anxiety thing or they just don't care so I can't see a therapist or talk to someone.\n\nI study English in college, and I read a lot of books without looking up words, but when I'm asked a question or when I want to write an essay or even just answering a simple text like 'what's up' , my mind goes completely blanks no matter how casual the conversation is. and when writing I can't remember simple vocabularies nor complex ones, and I took a lot of time to answer or write. I don't how to put the things I want to say into words so I ended up rumbling or saying meaningless things .I suffer from this problem when speaking in my native language too especially in writing so I don't know if I have a learning disability or something. but it's making me so anxious I don't know what to do or how to change it. Do you have any advice for me?\n\n I'M SORRY IF THIS WAS A MESSY POST but I don't how what to and I feel so lonely and I have no one to talk to
6	You are such a beautiful person, and you are not 7 anymore. Make plans to get yourself out of that situation, and don't look back. Until that day, focus everyday on something positive that happens in your home and add spend as much time as you can doing any activity that makes you feel better. Your stress level is likely really high which impacts your learning - that doesn't mean you are not capable, it just means you need calming and positive things in your life to ease your mind. Encourage your parents to seek help on their own. 
3	How many years more until you graduate from college? I suggest creating a timeline of at least 3 to 5 years from now that you could stick with and look forward to while living with your toxic parents. If anything, you need your family's resources(i.e. money, food, shelter) to continue your education.\n\nSet a tentative date in that timeline with regards to looking for a job and finally moving out. You may wish to bring along your sister with you or whatever it is that you plan in your dreams. And though the dates may not be as accurate, believe me the stars would align for some reason. Look back to this timeline everytime you feel down and hopeless from all the toxicity. You gotta have grit and hunger moving forward as you achieve these goals.\n\nI know things feel difficult right now but in the meantime, find what you love to do and join an organization in your college relating to that(maybe the english literary club or something) for extracurricular activities. Keep yourself busy and away from home if possible. **Some of the connections that you will make in college during this time will be priceless moving forward** since it's harder to make friends in work life depending on office culture. You will also have the benefit of finding yourself in the process and improving your resume for faster hiring once you graduate.\n\nLastly, here's some poems that kept me through my darkest times. I hope they help you too. Stay strong! I believe in you.\n\n[If by Rudyard Kipling](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---)\n\n[Invictus by William Henley](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus)
3	I would just go find a job and get out of the toxic household.  I could not stand suffering like that anymore.  My dad was very abusive with his words and would fly into a rage at any minute..and never apologize.  \n\nYour situation is much worse that mine was.  You can‚Äôt change people.  You can only change yourself and your environment.  Learning to be self-supporting independent of your parents will give you a lot more self-esteem. \n\nThey can‚Äôt control you unless you let them.  As hard as it may be, you meed to move on.  Leave them to fight their demons alone.  Once you‚Äôre out of the picture, they‚Äôll be left with only themselves to blame and that would probably help them more than you trying to meet all their demands.
2	This struck a chord with me. I'm 19, ex-Muslim and have a similar family dynamic. Mother loves to play victim, father was pretty distant. He left home about a year ago (not for the first time), but prior to that they were always fighting. I have some **horrible** childhood and adolescent memories - violent, aggressive behaviour from my dad, mostly (emotionally - he never hit me, which I guess is a plus). I was never understood as a kid, and for the longest time it *really* fucked up my self-esteem. I also have started to experience psychotic episodes (it's looking like schizophrenia so far), and the stress and isolation I feel at home definitely didn't help matters with that. I had to learn to, and still do, hide my true self from my parents (if they knew I was a mentally ill, non-straight atheist, I don't want to know what'd happen.)\n\nI still live at home, but try to minimise the time I spend there by distracting myself with other things. I go to work, then go to coffee shops to get some personal projects done. Or I'll go to a friends, or literally anything to keep me from being in contact with my mum. I had to fight for these liberties, but I eventually realised that she only had control over me if I gave in. She's pretty much given up on me, which was upsetting at first but I realised I was much happier being free.\n\nI'm kinda blathering, I'm sorry! Here's some actual advice: \n\n* I get that you're scared of leaving them alone, but honestly, it is not your responsibility to keep them from acting up. You have to put yourself first. You're still young. You do not deserve to be going through this shit.\n\n* GET A JOB! It'll help you feel way more independent, you'll have something to kill time, and you'll make some money! Save up, GTFO, and never look back.\n\n* I was mocked for my weight as a teenager, and it fucked me up too. I never purged, but I did stop eating and when I did eat, it was never anything substantial. It's hard to unwire those habits, and I'm still getting there. You really do want a therapist (are there any private therapists, health care, etc. you could utilise?), especially with your anxiety.\n\n* I had pretty bad social anxiety, too. I still do, but it waxes and wanes. Staying in that household definitely won't help - it was only after I started to exercise my independence that it got better. It *will* get better.\n\n* My parents were similarly strict. I couldn't go out, had to come back at unreasonably early times (I don't want to sound like an angsty teenager, but it definitely did impact my social life), couldn't dress how I wanted, the works. It was bad enough for me being 18 and having these restrictions, but **you're 22**. It is totally unreasonable to have to live like that. \n\nIt's hard to offer solutions, and I kinda went on a rant there. I guess because our situations were so similar and I felt like I had to get this all out. But TL;DR: get a job, move out, exercise your own independence. Think about yourself.\n\nIf you need to talk, feel free to message me. I hope it works out for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1	You might look to your school for resources in dealing with with a lot of this stuff. Universities often have programs and professionals in place to help its students. \n\nI really hope you find help in dealing with this stuff. It may suck right now but you're still very young. You will get through it and one day it'll be in the past. Take care of yourself. \n\n&#x200B;
1	Sending you a spirit hug. I left home unexpectedly at 18 when I realized I didnt have to live in a dangerous, emotionally damaging environment anymore. I hope you have the opportunity to do the same. Police Dept. Or your school counseling center will have information about domestic violence and resources for getting out and getting better. (That doesnt mean you have to report anything).\n\nI read a great book by Nadine Harris, I believe, and she described how living in a stressful home impacts your brain's ability to process stress. It leaves you in constant fight or flight mode. When you're in that state, no wonder you dont have mental resources left for conversation or simple memory recall. I used to forget things all the time from stress, too.\n\nAlso, I just want you to know that your brain doesnt distinguish between emotionally threatening events and physically threatening events. It's all damaging to you & you are worthy of a healthier environment & care & healing.
1	I felt sort of trapped when I was stuck living with my parents, too- they're both unwell (physically and that takes a toll on all of us psychologically) and that's taxing. I moved out for my last two years of college because I transfered into uni, and trying to be independent is hard, but I've had the space to work on creating a more positive energy around myself. I feel like I am recovering pretty well. My parents and I still in contact, and its just space to grow up and learn to have faith in myself on my own. I know its not an option for everyone, but I hope you at least have a study spot or something where you're genuinely comfortable. \nWe're the same age, and I'm also studying English. I love escaping into dictionaries though- in several languages. Maybe posting this can be a draft for more writing about what your going through, later. 
2	INFP(F) and ISFJ(M)	I met an ISFJ guy, and he is the sweetest and most caring person I have ever met. He truly has a beautiful soul. Yet I can't understand him as much as I did my intuitive exes...\n\nHe is very mature and much more emotionally stable than I am. Two common things between us I noticed are we both are super sensitive, and that he apologizes so often as me as INFP do...\n\nBut still it's difficult to tell how his mind works and sometimes it's as if we don't speak the same language sometimes...What can I do to connect with him on a deeper level?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I just came back meeting a close ISFJ guy friend. We had a wonderful time and spend 5 hours just talking. The topics and style of communication feels different from conversations with iNtuitives (when I think about it now), but there are plenty ways to connect nonetheless. We share our interest in people (people we both know but also those the other does not know, just from stories). We love talking about our observations and experiences, social psychology and love/friendships on a general level. I also enjoy asking him about his passion for sports (in this regard we are totally different). It is important for the connection to an ISFJ that you are willing to show your weaknesses and honest/inner thoughts although it will feel quite uncomfortable at first. That is because ISFJs will see through you anyway and they want genuine and ‚Äûreal‚Äû talk as much as we do. And yes, I just love how caring and hospitable they are!
2	INFP guy with ISFJ spouse.  Getting to be old married (not first), so I've had observations.  First, communication.  I need to remember I am going to get detailed stories.  Very detailed.  Is there a point?-type stories.  I've learned patience.  She had to learn that when I mention alternatives they are not slights to what she is saying; it's just that my mind continually thinks outside the box, and forgets the box.  We attended a couple of Couples Communication weekend courses even when we were dating to learn some of this.  \n\nMy ISFJ spouse is sensitive.  When I talk in abstract it is not a put-down, but I work at limiting the theory thing because she won't be interested if there is not an application for it attached.  I also try to remember that just because I thought something in a conversational thought does not mean it has been said.  For her part she doesn't pick on me for misplacing everything if I haven't developed a 'spot' for it, and that there are many things I really don't have an opinion about, such as wall colour and other aesthetics (I ask her to let me blue-sky about something, and then get a range of what is intolerable, but beyond that I am perfectly happy with she making final choices--for example, she feels more strongly about restaurants or where to go dancing, etc. I only know the places that really don't do it for me; other than those she knows I'll ask her to decide.)\n\nThis week is 17 years together and we met in mid-life, so I hope there is a kernel of something that might help here.
2	Take the love language quiz.   \n\nThis is one but there are many out there.   \n\nhttps://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/  \n\n
1	Well I don't know if you truly can, from my experience the relationship will always feel different than with an intuitive and ISFJ have vividly different functions stack - Si Fe Ti Ne. That being said you can still probably connect with their Si. Thr difference between their Fe and our Fi might be a problem. I typically see Fe as not authentic enough so they might view Fi as too harsh.
5	Maintaining a Long Distance Friendship	For me it was hard finding a real friend, that one friend that gets you. Around 3 weeks to go,  me and my best friend will be apart. \n\nWe are living in the same house for 3 years now but we have some plans of our own to some other place. And now I‚Äôm mixed emotions. I‚Äôm happy because I‚Äôll start a new life to another city and I‚Äôm sad that we will not be together anymore. I know that if a friendship is true, distance is not an issue. But for me its an issue, I‚Äôm not good with keeping in touch. Or I have this attitude ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt talk to I will not talk to you either‚Äù \n\nNow I‚Äôm afraid with all the what ifs. What if we grow apart? What if one day you will forget about me? What if one day you got busy with your life? What if you found someone new? Yeah, I think I‚Äôm the jealous type and clingy one. \n\nI‚Äôm just really scared to lose him, he was the first person ever I got really close.
1	I text my long distance friends throughout the day and it maintains our friendship
1	In high school I had a best friend. After two years they moved away and there wasn't communicating for 2 years. (Mutual uncertainty I suppose).\n\nThen right before starting college I mustered up the courage to call and say hello. The friendship rekindled and has been strong since.\n\nNow we text every day with some exceptions, and we try to meet in person every 6 months if possible. We went to the arcade last year and saw Spider-verse, so that was cool. :)\n\nI think since this experience was so good I'm more inclined to try long distance relationships/friendships. Alas you really need some person-to-person time because you may be relying on texts and emails and phone calls which isn't always enough to sustain.
1	I quit my job and moved away a few months ago, leaving behind a coworker who'd become a real, genuine friend like I'd never had before. I was pretty gutted. I'm not good at keeping in touch with people, either, but I was hellbent on making sure I maintained a connection with this friend. She's too important to lose. \n\nI have to actively remind myself to not resort to my usual tendency of waiting for the other person to initiate. I started out worrying that maybe she would be bothered if I pester her with updates, but she crushed my fears pretty immediately by emailing me the day I got on the plane telling me how much she missed me and how excited she was for what the future held for me. (Love her so much. I've always dreamed of a friend like this but never thought I'd find one!) So I encourage you as you're going about your busy days in your new city, whenever you think of them, reach out! They'll be thrilled to hear from you, and it's so nice to feel close to them again for a brief second in time.\n\nTalking long-distance through texts and emails definitely doesn't feel the same as talking in person. The friendship is still there, but it's different. It's harder to feel close. But I've tried to be honest and vulnerable when I'm feeling down about that, and that seems to help the deep connection going. I think when we finally get to reunite in person, it's going to be so so special. I can't wait for that day, but I like having that to look forward to, even if it's off in the distant future. \n\nYou'll still have all those fears and questions hiding in the background ‚Äì I still do ‚Äì but you do get used to them. Even if your friend does find new friends or life gets busy, he won't stop caring about you just because you've moved away :)\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, by the way. Being separated from someone is one of those pains in life that is hard to put into words but just hurts. \n\n&#x200B;
90	I call it "It Just Reminds Me". I made it based on the feelings I get when something triggers some bad memories. Thought you guys can relate to that.	
7	Can relate
6	The Facepalm, by Vincent Van Gogh 
4	Damn this is too real. I get that bad feeling all the time and have to relive my darkest mistakes/experiences. This painting described that perfectly, so good job!
2	This is how me now. Depressed due my bad memories come and I can't really move on with it. I just hope maybe someday they will disappear in my life soon. Too bad for this year. 
2	Cool!
2	I love this paint. Great Job!
2	I absolutely love this sub and you guys. Not an INFP but this sub warms my heart <3
23	Broad City on the TV, a jigsaw puzzle, and dog snuggles: my INFP Utopia	
3	Is your life for sale? I'm willing to offer you my entire savings of 41 American cents.\n\nSeriously though I'm getting comfortable just looking at that picture.
3	literally me 
0	I wanna eat ur legs
11	Quarter Life Crisis	Hi everyone! I'm 27 and a little lost right now about what to do. I've been a registered nurse for 5 yrs (my mom got me into it), worked multiple jobs. The latest one was in a large city hospital and I didn't like it -- too much politics and bullying. I quit my job and found out I'm an INFP. Now I'm not so sure if I want to continue nursing and look for another place or pursue a totally different field... been stuck for a year with so many options :/
6	Time for some soul searching.  Sounds like you‚Äôre just gonna‚Äô have to try some things and see what sticks.  I can relate with you though.  I was a software developer and gave up that career to be a singer/songwriter.  I am much happier now.
5	You have so many options in your field. Travel nursing, boat cruise nurse, teaching, etc. I would keep exploring the field and see if you can find something you enjoy. 
3	I'm 25 and going through this big time. Friends drifting apart, having a second go-round in the career field I started in and the novelty (which I misidentified as passion) has gone.\n\nI just want to travel and soul-search! I guess there is no "right time" to do that and it feels so arbitrary but I dunno, I didn't do enough of it in my early 20's, is how it feels.
17	A friend thinks I am unstable.	Like mentally/emotionally unstable. They said I was a ticking time bomb.\n\nIt was kinda weird hearing that. Sometimes I can be really talkative and crazy, almost in a manic state where ideas are flowing nonstop. Other times I am completely quiet and distant, completely absorbed into my own world.\n\nDoes anyone else get this? Is it just a sort of moody INFP trait?
7	What kind of 'friend' calls their other friend unstable... why not just that you are having a hard time.
4	It really sounds like all my social interractions pretty much. But k also feel a bit depressed sometimes. Idk maybe its just hoe we become as depressed infps
2	I don't know you so I cannot comment on you specifically or why your friend said whatever they said.\n\nOne of the pieces of advice I have often seen for INFPs is "go experience your dark or angry states alone."  Basically, people don't get it, and there can be a lot of pieces to pick up afterwards and stuff that gets 'taken seriously' that really ought to be handled lightly and then let go....\n\nHeavy seriousness is consistently one of the least useful and least valuable states human beings can generate.  But I don't meet many people who know this....\n\nSo it's possible your friend was just responding with *gravity* because they were trained to do this by a basically dysfunctional society, plus the fact that people don't typically react well to over-stressed or angry INFPs.
1	"We're all a little mad"
7	A Nightly Dose of Reminiscence About the Future	It's 01:55 AM where I live right now, and I'm sitting here at my desk just thinking about my future. Not knowing where it will take me and what kind of memories I'll be able to make. Having around 130-140 tabs open with inspirational stuff, scientific papers or whatever sparks my interest.\n\nI don't know how to describe it, but do you sometimes also feel this need of spending some time for yourself to dream and fantasize about an idealized version of your own future? I especially love to write down my thoughts and just scribble around a lot.
1	My ultimate dream is opening a small art shop in town that sells art supplies. Where i sleep on the top of the shop and continue to live my life.\n\nMy dream right now is to be a therapist. I have a little trouble studying and doing the work, but it gets done eventually. I thought about it for a long time and decided i wanted to help people with their problems.\n\nSo i usually sit around on forums and boards giving out advice best i can.\n\nBut yeah i often think what itll be like in the future. I try stay realistic most days, tho some days i think about winning the lottery, those are fun.
4	Fellow INFPs, did you ever have "the one" that got away?	Was just thinking about Valentine's Day that's coming up and I was curious if any of you have a story about "the one" that got away. If so, what's the story? How are your feelings about them now?
2	Back in kindergarden, I met a girl and though the memory is fuzzy, we just somehow got in a so called "relationship" weird as it may seem. Continue to 2nd grade and we're no longer in the same class. I didn't have any friends besides her. Third grade, met a lot of friends to last to fifth grade. I saw her sometimes, very rarely. Summer after fifth grade, I was forced to move and forget my friends despite it being unneeded. Now, fast forward in highschool I see that she has joined the robotics club, a club I joined in my highschool last year, and that her team was very successful. Really makes me wonder, what we would have been if I never had to move. I think we'd had been great for each other. She was a very pure, kind and innocent person, someone who is very hard to find nowadays. 
6	Mind boggling question	So we know there are infp personalities in stories and movies and games. But what would be a infp anti hero? 
3	The Wizard of Oz. 
8	How did you get used to working?	Note: please don't berate me or belittle me telling me everyone has to work so get used to it or boast that you don't have to work because you got lucky and own a business or etc. I don't wanna hear it. I just wanna hear how my fellow INFPs got used to and enjoy working. \n\nTo me I'm having a hard time realizing I won't have as much time as I want. I'm only part time now but eventually I'll have to go full and the idea of not having the whole day to myself anymore scares me. I don't want to be one of those people who live for the weekend and whine about Mondays and barely make it to Fridays. That's not a life to me. That's prison.\n\nUgh. How do I learn a different way to see this so it's not so...dreadful to me? I'm too free spirited. I'm not used to this life.
3	I know it's clich√© but find a job you'll actually enjoy. Getting used to going to that job is another story, because yeah having to spend so much time there takes some time getting used to. Or maybe you'll be one of those people who manages to make your living as freelancer, options are endless.
3	Try findings a local small business. Being apart of a system where you very much matter is rewarding and will grow you. It helped me!
3	Stoicism. \n\nHonestly one of the best things I learned about, they guy who created that Phil was a slave for half his life so he might have something to say about work ethic.
2	I feel you. My grocery store job isn't so bad since I am only working 3 days a week and my coworkers are friendly. It's a local business that started over 50 years ago, so I imagine it's a much different environment than say, Walmart. Hopefully when I'm done with school they will let me stay part time and I can supplement with pet sitting and spend more time on fun activities.\n\nBut I still daydream about doing something else.
2	My dad worked us when we were young so it came naturally.  We are born into a "system."  One could even say this planet is like a prison.  Regardless, in order to survive and at least function at some level, you have to carry your own weight.   You dont want  "Too free spirited" to be equated with "mooch of your parents and friends."  So now is the time to embrace something you dont mind doing for a job.  If your heart is not in it though keep looking!
1	First off, If you want to actually have time to yourself, DO NOT WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT. If anything do the morning shift. I know it can be tricky juggling time when you‚Äôre at a job, but I found I was truly miserable on the night shift. The morning shift allows you to have the rest of the day to yourself, too. Working somewhere with friendly people you can really talk to is a plus, too. It could take a few tries to find that though. Best of luck
8	In need of a penpal	Hi I would like to have a penpal . I feel extremely lonely and got nobody to talk to in depth . I want someone with who I could talk regularly about my feelings , life and we would advice and motivate each other and keep track of our self improvement journey .\n\nI am 22 in uni I am interest in classical music ( piano) , tech , innovation,brainstorming, business ideas , manga and Philosophy. I identify as XNFP 
2	I would love to. I'm also a 22 yo university student and I can talk all day about art, music, philosophy, tech, and definitely emotions. It would be fun, I could sure use some advice and I could give some as well. I don't have a hell of a lot of free time (as I'm sure you don't either) but I'm down to message a times couple a week. Let me know if you're interested.
2	You should try the app Slowly!! :) 
1	I can talk if you want. Message me whenever.
1	I‚Äôm in undergrad for business and looking to minor in music design for games. I‚Äôve been struggling with mental health for a while and think it might help to have a pen pal. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk. I‚Äôm infp
1	We have an INFP Telegram group chat if any of you guys would like to join:)
1	There is /r/infppenpals\n
23	Do we have any Atheist INFPs here?	It seems to me that INFPs are labelled as spiritual, but I don't see myself as that, I don't believe in God, anyone here also the same?
13	INFP Atheist here.
10	I believe there's stuff science can't explain at it's current point but I do not believe in any single god. IF there is something out there, there would definitely be more than one being out there. It would be similar as how we view single-cell organisms, we would be too small to truly perceive them and we would be too insignificant for them to care about us.\n\nIt is possible to be spiritual without being religious. I am very in tune with nature and feel a great piece with it (in my soul if you will) but I have rejected the idea of god(s). 
7	I don't feel like, we, as human beings, can possibly know what makes the world work. Maybe there is a higher power, but who are we to say?
6	I was raised Catholic, but I think I‚Äôm more of a deist now. I believe there‚Äôs a God that created the universe, but I don‚Äôt believe in direct intervention from God. I figure something had to start the big bang which set off the chain of events that is the universe being created and time passing, and whatever/whoever that is would be God. Miracles and transubstantiation don‚Äôt make any sense to me though, and organized religion just kinda smells like bullshit to me. 
5	I don't believe there's a God or any spiritual being out there. I kinda really dislike religion also, but only when people are taking it too far. So yup, hello there haha
6	I was raised Catholic but I really don't believe in any gods or religions. Parents use to take us to church every week and made us go to Sunday school but I always doubted everything.
4	Yes, but was raised evangelical. 
4	I don't believe in a specific God, but I think there may be something unnamed out there. I guess I'm agnostic, but sometimes atheist, I can go back and forth. 
3	Atheist too
4	Me
4	Yep
5	I don't believe in a God, but I'm fascinated by Hermeticism and Animism. I think there's more going on than a strict materialist view of reality allows for.
5	Agnostic here
2	Me
2	Raised in a catholic family, went to a catholic school, I think I believe.
2	Many years ago was an atheist. It didn't work for me.  Does it matter? 
2	i dont understand atheism. i have friends who are, and just like any other choice, i understand its validity. it makes no sense to me though. i definitely believe in god. faith is something that fills the gaps between reason and logic. there are things we don't and can't know.  
1	Yes. I am pretty sure most of us are. 
1	I don't follow religion and am absolutely not a fan of organized religion in the slightest, but I do believe there are some "forces" out there that make certain things happen. I guess you call it my version of God, but I don't believe in the biblical sense of God.
1	Yep! Raised muslim but now I'm agnostic. 
1	Hello, it is me, INFP/J Athiest. However, I am very spiritul. It's hard to explain, but to me religion and spirituality are two different things. I firmly don't believe in any god or gods, but was raised Celtic Wiccan so I'm spiritually inclined. I don't believe in magic, but I do believe in spirits and souls to an extent. I do believe in soulmates, and shared particles, but not that god smushes you together and says "now kiss." I am very close with nature, and have a lot of "spooky" related themes, but it's more of a hobby than a religion. Hobby isn't the word I am looking for but I can't think of anything else to describe it. I feel at peace with the wind and the earth, and I think spiritual grounding is valid to a point, but not the big fancy sky daddy. (/daddies/mommy/mommies)
1	I grew up in the Mormon church and left a few years ago. Nothing like a billion conflicting and impossible "standards" to mess you up in relationship to God. Religion tells you that you're messed up and they're  the cure. Now hand over 10% of your income. They ruined the concept of God for me. \n\nNow I subscribe to Annie Lenox when she sings " I believe in the power of creation, I believe in the good vibration." Life is short, do the things you love and don't do things that erase your self respect. You are enough as you are.
1	Im personally agnostic. I believe something else is out there, whether its aliens or some higher power i don't know, but i don't fully believe in god. I prey to whatever is out there, and hope well in my life, but im not sure which religion has it right.
1	INFPs look for "authenticity".  \n\nMost religions are inevitably home to many overbearing and asshole hypocrites and oppress people and officially spout inconsistencies, unrelateable abstractions, stretched metaphors and rigid, arbitrary rules.  \n\nMany religions also teach frames of understanding the self, humanity, the world and society, to look beyond the obvious, to be patient and kind to people, to take care of the world, and to go against labels and structures and expectations that harm and divide people.  \n\nThere's plenty of authentic reasons to grow up in a religion and leave it and conclude the nonexistence of the god they were introduced to. Likewise, there are plenty of reasons to grow up outside of any religion and then go looking for meaning in one or many, and some become convinced of some mysterious, higher organizing existence as a result.  \n\nI'm sure you'll find many INFPs floating around anywhere in the spectrum.
1	Not sure id call myself an atheist but I'm definitely a non conformist humanist with deep non religious ideals.  
1	I was raised Christian...mom was a pastor. Currently agnostic right now, and have been since 9th grade, and I'm 22 now. I'm not really a fan of religion, but I'm fine if others are. I do have some resentment towards my mom though, considering I felt she was shoving religion down my throat. It really sucks too, because I know she was only raising me the way she thought was the absolute best for my siblings and I. I just wish there wasn't this barrier between her and I, but its necessary for me to live as authentically as possible. It was in my best interest to leave the church, but I gotta say, I feel pretty empty. I hate having this barrier between my mom and I, because I truly do crave connection with her and the rest of my family, but I just don't see that happening with there being a religious factor involved. I hate that she has to carry the burden of me going to hell, but I'm not gonna pretend I'm a Christian just for her to have some peace of mind. Religion can be so toxic, man...
1	Agnostic here. There‚Äôs no evidence that there is or isn‚Äôt or which god(s) exist. It‚Äôs nice to feel connected to something greater but it doesn‚Äôt affect my life, so I don‚Äôt see why I need to worship something absent
46	‚ÄúHow strange is it to be anything at all‚Äù- Neutral Milk Hotel	It‚Äôs one of those quotes that you read and feel instantly relieved. 
3	And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying,\n\nAs your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet,\n\nRings of flowers 'round your eyes\n\nAnd I'll love you for the rest of your life when you're ready\n\nBrother see we are one in the same\n\nAnd you left with your head filled with flames\n\nAnd you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth\n\nPush the pieces in place\n\nMake your smile sweet to see\n\nDon't you take this away\n\nI'm still wanting my face on your cheek
2	That is one of my favorite songs!!\n\n&#x200B;

4	Ex GF contacted me after 2 years of no contact.	We met up on friendly terms and now it feels like I‚Äôm reliving the breakup all over again. It‚Äôs just frustrating because I felt like I was totally over her and now I‚Äôm back to square one. Dread/anxiety and all. Plus, she‚Äôs been sending mixed signals and even told a mutual friend how she still loved me and wanted to see about taking things slow. However, since we started talking again, she hasn‚Äôt brought up anything about us getting back together. I guess I‚Äôm afraid that she‚Äôs stringing me along or maybe I‚Äôm just reading too much into this. \n\nI‚Äôm split right down the middle on whether I should just go back to no contact until she decides to be honest or just ask her myself. Part of me feels like I could potentially be emotionally addicted to her and I definitely realize how terrible that actually is. \n\nI just don‚Äôt know how to proceed from this. I want it to work out, but I just have absolutely no clue. 
3	my ex is obsessed with me and i have to actively keep no contact with him because hes super terrible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhow do you feel about this girl? would you want to get back together? if so, consider if that is a healthy choice for you or not. make a firm decision about how you feel about her and what you want or do not want from this interaction and then set your boundaries firmly. if you are both wishy washy, it could get emotionally messy for no reason. but like you said, if you're addicted to her and on some weird level want to stay addicted, continue on. i know how that goes! just try to be honest with yourself about what you really want in your life.  
2	Your breakup sounds quite like mine with my first love. Very strung out, and ending in disappointment. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something you should pursue if she‚Äôs already sending you mixed signals. It just sounds like you‚Äôll get your heart broken again to me. I‚Äôve been through that cycle far too many times, my friend. I hope everything ends up alright.
2	Eh, you probably already know what to do, just don't want to do it. You know you're emotionally addicted and that the relation has bad impact on you. You know what to do, do it.
12	Crushing on an INFP, what to do?	Hi there everyone!  So, I have a really awesome problem in that I'm crushing on one of you majestic people and I can't make heads or tails of what's going on.  I figured asking for advice, as I'm just...ugh, so head over heels, but I don't know how this person is feeling about me and I'm usually not one to be assertive with communication either.  I will try to make this post succinct and summarized, but so many interactions have happened between us, so It's probably going to be a fairly lengthy post.  I apologize in advance, I'm just at my wit's end, and I figured coming here would be helpful. I also signed up to reddit just to post here, so if for some reason I didn't post in the correct forum, please let me know and I'll move it or something. :)\n\nSo, some background information.  I am (26F) INTJ (honestly I could pass as an INFJ, but I use the T often as a defense mechanism, so it's usually people's first impressions of me.  I don't know if that distinction matters, but I figured I'd let it spill).  The person that I'm absolutely enamored with is a (37M) INFP.  \n\nWe met about a year and a half ago and run in similar circles.  I was in a relationship at the time, so I only thought of him as an acquaintance/distant friend and we would occasionally engage in the usual chit chat over text, but rarely see each other in person.  The texts were usually lighthearted and playful (and usually fairly quick/short exchanges), but never flirtatious, and he would use a lot of double smiley faces and the occasional heart, but I wouldn't think anything of it.  Some time passed and I found myself single again and that's when things got...different.    A week after my ex and I broke up, my crush randomly initiated a conversation over text with a message simply saying "poke"  I found it odd, as we usually had a reason to talk to one another over text (An event we both went to, a facebook post that one of us shared and wanted to comment on, etc.)  And the resulting conversation was once again light hearted banter.  For a while, there were almost no texts.  Also, while I was in a relationship he would like my statuses/posts on social media fairly often.  Now that I'm single...maybe one or two, but that's it.  And they are things of the same nature as what he used to "like", so I've just found that odd.\n\nAgh, this post is already getting horribly long...so let me maybe quickly summarize a few key AGH! moments that stick out in my mind:\n\n\-The texts have been hot and cold; one interaction it's light hearted and nice and the next conversation is very short (he comes across as cold and aloof and I feel like I'm a stranger to him).  I had the courage to ask him to an event, as I had an extra ticket, but he said he wouldn't be able to go, as it was happening on a very busy week for him (as a fellow introvert I totally understood, I just don't know if that was actually the case or if he was just using it as an easy way to let me down). \n\n\- If I am hosting an event or if I'm going, he's more likely to show up.  Case in point, there was a weekend where a mutual friend of ours was having a house party, and the very next day I was hosting a house party for some close friends (he was invited to both of them)  When I asked him if he needed a ride to the friend's party he said "probably not" as he wanted to have a quiet weekend.  However, he showed up to mine the next day.\n\n\-We have an event that we both go to and that he sometimes DJ's at (music is really his thing) and I will catch him briefly looking my way from across the very crowded room (although he might not be actually looking at me and I could be overanalyzing/thinking)  However, when he does interact with me, there is some light touching that happens (both of us initiate) things like him putting his hand on the small of my back as he's approaching our talking group, or me gently touching his forearm while talking.   He will usually stand next to me when in a group of friends chatting at these events. There was even a night where, as we hugged goodbye he gave me a very slight kiss on the cheek!!!!  (he hugs all his friends, so that's a fairly standard interaction, still gives my heart the jumpy's though)  But that kiss...AHHH!! It made everything so much worse!\n\n\-Recently we've been talking through text much more (about 1-2 times a week)  I usually initiate, but most recently there was a board game night a mutual friend was having.  I asked him if he needed a ride there...and he accepted!!  We were actually alone.  In person.  Together.  And the talk flowed, he laughed at some of my jokes and it was really nice to connect with him.  We got to share our love of stationary together and it was very nice to connect with him a bit.  At the board game night, even though he initially said he wanted to make it an early night, he decided to stay late so that it was just him, me and our married couple friends who hosted, and we got to chit-chat a lot and it was nice.  I did notice that in a quiet group setting, he will mostly avoid eye contact with me, but I will catch him looking at me with a slight smile on his face from time to time (I avert my eyes, I don't know if I should stare back and smile, I get really nervous).  Actually, earlier that night while we were all playing and talking, he said something and I looked up at him and our eyes connected and I just felt...paralyzed.  I couldn't talk, and we just stared into each others eyes for about half a minute.  Ugh, gosh.  He probably saw everything in my eyes at that point!  >\\\\\\<\n\n\-The next day after this board game night, he initiated a text!  And it was to divulge to me that he was feeling anxious about his DJ'ing (there was an event that night where he was going to be performing).  I was floored, as he had not only initiated a conversation with me, but it was also about something that some people have a hard time opening up about. \n\n\-The latest thing is that he works for a non-profit and has asked me to help collect bottles for recycling at my place of work.  To which I smoothly replied that I would love to, and that I can pick up the bags (I guess there is specific bags that I need for this particular thing his job is doing) on my way to a small group gathering of mutual friends on Valentine's day, and if he would like to come to that I could give him a ride.  He responded with a "sounds good!" But that might mean anything.  \n\nSo...that's my tale of woe.  I want to go slow with him and not spook him away, but I just can't shake the feeling that there is something there.  I don't know if either of us are at the place yet for a relationship, and I'm okay with that.  He's a very kind person, so there's a lot of times where I'm thinking he's just being nice and that I must be super obvious to him on my crush status and that he is only being nice to me so I won't feel rejected or sad.  But, he could just be oblivious.  I know there's no way of knowing which one it is until I actually take the plunge and talk to him about it and that every INFP is an individual.  I was just really curious about what peoples' takes are on the situation or if you've ever been a part of something similar or have behaved in a similar way with someone.\n\n  \nThank you so much for your time in advance! :) \n\n&#x200B;
6	I think you got him in the bag. You guys are definitely getting closer, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time before he takes a big step. He‚Äôs just waiting for some sort of confirmation. I‚Äôm not sure if this holds true for all infps, but I believe we love compliments. So you could use that to your advantage. 
5	Your in like flynn for sure.  He probably is unsure of how things would be if it were just the two of you together and may not want to risk that yet.  I am in full agreement that you may want to try and be a little more obvious your interested.  Texts are good but they are not everything.  If he is INFP he will want to see how you truely/authentically feel.  Looks like he kind of 'tested' that by having you help collect bottles/bags, seems like a method of reassurment that hes pursuing the right person.  Hipe this helps Good luck to you.
3	This is really sweet. Judging by how I (infp) am towards potential relationships, he's probably a lot more interested in you than he's letting on. Just my take here, don't be afraid to push it a little more if you feel ok with it, we can be pretty timid with these things. Good luck!
5	This was so cute to read lol\n\nI'm not sure if we're all like this, but as an INFP, I find it very difficult to flirt and show emotions, especially to someone I really like. So I think the fact that he kissed you lightly on the cheek is huge. He wouldn't have done that to anyone. This might not be the advice you want to hear, but I think you should go all in. Just tell him how you feel.\n\nIt's going to be really hard, but I think that's what he's waiting for! He's not going to make a move because he's stuck in his head wondering how to do it. If you do it first, he'll be so relieved and he'll like you even more for having the confidence. Just do it! 
2	Run
2	I'd say he likes you, he seems like they guy who is the type to as long as he can spend some time with you, he'd be fine with that, whether you're in a relationship or not. The same goes for me and my "crush". As long as I can just chill with her and laugh. I'm fine with it, though it would be better if things were official. He might be in the same boat. 
2	So..I have an update!  I didn't want to leave everyone who commented hanging.  Also, thank you all so much for giving me advice!  It is really helpful, and I think I will talk to him in April (we have a big event for a LARPing community that we go to every year, so it might be a good time to maybe get some one on one time to let him know).  Until then, though, it's gonna be a lot of speculating. \n\nAnyway, so I had agreed to pick up the bags needed for the recycling drive his work is doing on Valentine's day.  When I asked him if he wanted a ride to a small get together at a place in town he said that he was probably going to stay in, but that he would have the bags ready for me.  So my friend/coworker also needed a ride and was with me when I went to go get the bags and as we pull up, my crush gets out of his house and walks over (My friend is teasing, "oooh, he knows what your car looks like, you're special.")  I get out of the car and move around to go get the bags from him, not realizing he already handed them to my friend.  So, here I am, standing awkwardly in the snow as he is telling my friend the ins and outs of the fundraiser.  He then turns to me and I awkwardly stutter, "Oh, uh! Whoops!  Didn't realize you already gave him (my friend) the bags!"  And I just kinda shrugged  and approached him and we hugged.  I told him Happy Valentine's day and kissed him on the cheek (Ha!  Gotcha back from a couple months ago!) and I felt him tense up a little bit and then he kissed me back on the cheek.  My friend and I drove off and I was absolutely twitter-patted.  \n\nAfter that, there hasn't been any contact.  He did post something the next day, a meme of the "If she doesn't know what this is, she's too young for you" and it had a Fifth Element reference.  I mean, there is a big age difference (11yrs) between us, but I don't mind.  Also jokes on him, The Fifth Element is a really good film and I got the reference.  Him posting it may not have anything to do with me, but I've heard tales of INFP's posting things about their crushes or people that are on their minds on social media, so I don't know...  Later on in the weekend I posted something that sort of hinted at me having an eye on him, but nothing major.  I think I'll wait a little bit to initiate conversation with him again, just because I want to maybe give him some time to process???  I don't know.  I always feel like I'm bothering him whenever I initiate conversation.  I see him in a couple of weeks at the monthly event, so I have some time to wait and see if there are any changes.  It is also his birthday on the weekend I see him next, so I might get him  a little something tied to journaling, as he likes to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, thank you all for your well wishes and advice!  I'll keep giving updates as they come! \^\_\^
89	INTP here to compliment INFP	You people are like unicorns. Your blood is infused with hopes and dreams. Thank you for existing.\n(Bolstered confidence INTP from an INFP)
35	Seriously you guys are some of my favorite people. 
9	I can confirm this as an INTP
4	You are spot on. Hopes and dreams are what get me through the day. Thanks for noticing. 
2	That‚Äôs a beautiful way to put and see it!\n\n... guess everyone wants a drink too though
2	You're a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
2	I have two best friends.\n\nAnd ENFJ and an INTP.\n\nThey are both **literally In the figurative sense** my brothers\n\nSo same back to INTPs. You guys are really fun to be imaginative with. For every idea I start it seems they can run the logistics down. \n\nAnd damnit if we didn't make eachother laugh so damn hard.\n\nHe helped me logically process things. I helped him with emotional shit. I miss that man....\n\nINTPs are great. Could never date one but they can make the best of friends.\n
18	Some days I wake up to find spots made by tears (from last night's crying session) on my glasses and I find them pretty aesthetic.	 And i always have them on my glasses.
6	Cool
3	Wow, that's like, poetry. 
3	Ok.
2	Can you paint this? 
1	Broke too many pairs sleeping with or near my glasses. I try to put them in the spectacles case before I sleep.
6	How would you cope with losing your best friend?	Recently lost my best friend due to self-sabotaging antics that probably stem from a fear of intimacy (even though I simultaneously crave it) and a lack of emotional discipline on my part. I had trouble recognizing and respecting his boundaries. Told him I‚Äôd give him space indefinitely but that he can feel free to reach out to me if he ever wants to talk again. I‚Äôve been in a situation with an ex-best friend of 10 years, where she did one thing that finally pushed me over the edge and I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in years. This leads me to believe that if this current friend views me in a similar light, he may never talk to me again. \n\nTl;dr I lost my best friend because I‚Äôm emotionally unstable \n\nI‚Äôm wondering as INFPs, what are some of the most effective ways you have coped with loss? How would you cope with losing your best friend? 
6	Jeez I know what you mean. Not sure if it‚Äôs an INFP thing or something else, but losing a friend hurts like losing a lover to me. I‚Äôve been through break-ups and I would say it‚Äôs about as intense. It sucks because I have such an unstable personality that it‚Äôs very hard not to have any drama with people at some point.\n\nThat being said, I know it hurts. It hurts like hell to lose a close friend. But it happens for a reason. A real friend will stick with you through all your bullshit; every last bit of it. You just gotta find those people
4	Try to love yourself, find and develop that values in yourself.\n\nYou will never know what's gonna happen on the future, but this is what you can do for the better and so it's not gonna get repeated again.\n\nTo be happy again is how you gonna gain gain it back.
4	Speaking from experience, I would say let them go for now. In the mean time, write in a journal, draw, drink tea, snuggle a pet‚Äî just do anything that relaxes you. Maybe in the future you can reconcile, but for now, just try to be as at peace as possible. \n\nDon‚Äôt forget this friendship, though. Bookmark it and save it for if and when the friend wants to talk again.\n\nI know how hard this can be. This happened back in 2012 for me and I still cry a little sometimes. Just make sure you treat yourself well and don‚Äôt beat yourself up too much.\n\n
2	This is definitely how unhealthy Fi feels like. Literally my train of thought in a past relationship.	
4	Has anyone felt less infp after a particular incident?	When i had first taken the personality test i related so much to infp it was almost mind boggling. Then i got into this really toxic relationship with a guy who was emotionally abusive and thank God i am out now but i feel so distant from my emotions now. \nI dont feel easily hurt anymore and i can very quickly figure out if anyone is being manipulative. I am not mean or anything, just feel less in tune with my emotions. \nIdk if this is a good change or not, i can say with assurance that i am definitely not as nice as i was before and also i just started watching office and the character Pam annoyed the shit out of me in the first few seasons because of her niceness and she is INFP so i am so confused. Has this happened with anyone?\n\nTl;dr Feeling less infp after a toxic relationship, has anyone experienced anything similar?
6	Personality traits can evolve over time based off of how experiences impact you. You may still hold many of the same traits of an infp but you could be changing in some slightly. Just how we all grow. It‚Äôs also an effect of being so self-aware. You‚Äôre able to notice changes better than most. Hope your journey goes well. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre out of that relationship. The disconnect with emotions could just be defense mechanisms that your subconscious has put into place to try to protect you. Only way to get past an emotion is to face and acknowledge it. If your mind thinks it can‚Äôt do that it may reject it and attempt to avoid it at all cost. Just a quick opinion from a small view into the situation. I wish you the best of luck my friend:) 
2	I can relate a bit.  When I first discovered my type I was happy to learn I wasn‚Äôt the only one and that there were others who could relate to me.  Fast forward a couple of years after I ran into some toxic relationships where I have been used, I rediscovered what it meant to be an INFP and I thought it was a load of bull.  Fast forward 5 more years to now: I am 25 years old and have been through a bit of a selfish phase where vowed to do only what I wanted to do and not give a shit about others.  And now I can again relate to what it means to be an INFP.\n\nI haven‚Äôt watched The Office aside from funny short clips on YouTube so I‚Äôm not too familiar with Pam, but if I had to guess why she pisses you off so much it may because she may be a reminder of how vulnerable you were.  I many INFPs go through this where we‚Äôre so willing to give ourselves up for others that we leave ourself completely open to hurt, and when it happens our minds get fucked up and we go into a defensive cynical mode.  I think it‚Äôs our minds‚Äô way of protecting us from potential threat.  So we come cold, selfish, and cynical.  I‚Äôm turning 26 soon which is not that old and I‚Äôm sure many INFPs may be feeling ahead or behind where I stand but I guess you can say I‚Äôve lived alone and selfishly for a while now that I‚Äôm kind of tired of it.  I know what it‚Äôs like to hurt and be used and I may not be as open as I was before but I‚Äôm willing to go through it again because being cold and cynical doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure where you stand at the moment but just do you.  You don‚Äôt have to be nice to anyone.  Just do what feels right. 
2	Before I went to jail, people would describe me as a very upbeat, positive happy-go-lucky guy. After 24 weeks of living in jail, when i came home, many new people would later tell me i would come off as closed off, serious and quiet. I still score INFP on any mbti test but i don‚Äôt feel like my personality type anymore 
2	I'm so happy I randomly decided to browse this sub today bc I realize that I'm infp after all. I've seen a lot of shit and nearly faced death so many times. I have wisdom and strong intuition that have helped to keep me alive. It's not easy to fool me. But I rarely expose how much I truly know about people or situations. I think I play dumb a lot to protect myself.. but hey, it works! \n\nBut bc of my ability to see through bullshit so easily, I thought I might be an infj. Turns out infp's are a fairly intuitive bunch. However, we've mastered the art of having clear insight without losing our innocence/sense of wonder (:
1	"[Four sides of the mind".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG_fAhk3ZGc) Your type only covers 1/4th of your psyche, the conscious part, your ego. There are three other sides that are "different" types that make up who you are.
1	I would think it might be a coping mechanism, also we often get annoyed at traits we see in other people that we posses. 
529	Just wondering if any other INFPS relate to this? It makes me feel more positive about being highly sensitive. I have always wished I wasn‚Äôt. Now I‚Äôm kinda glad I am. I think I possess all those things listed, which I think are important.	
70	Yeah I always thought I wasn't very sensitive because I wasn't good at showing emotion, but I'm incredibly empathetic, the energy of the room can bring me down in half a second.
26	I agree with all of it except the detail oriented. I'm a broad thinker. I miss the tiny details. Subtleties yes, details not at all. 
13	*Excellent in bed
26	Absolutely. Doubly so, as a man - I'm hesitant to describe myself as "sensitive" because it has connotations, or there are societal expectations, of somehow being "effeminate", sensitive or whiny. Instead, I feel like it better allows me to relate to other people, and to help others open up when they're going through crisis and feel like they have no one to talk to.
9	We're definitely on the wheel of emotion my INFP brothers
7	Being highly sensitive, you need to build up really good coping skills.  If you don't, you're in for a bad time.
12	Well, yeah. But I am not HSP. That is not what being [highly sensitive](https://hsperson.com/) means. Think of it as "heightened senses person." You can be all of these nice things and HSP, or either or neither. But they are not the same thing. At most the HSP encourages introversion and lots of alone time which can be used to foster and nurture these traits.
5	Introverted Intuitive First Person Shooters?
5	Praise be to this pie chart.
3	Thank you for sharing, I love this!
3	Yes I definitely relate to all the things mentioned! Thank you for sharing, it is very positive and reassuring :)
3	I had to save this image. Reviewing it, albeit I do already understand what it is I am in these terms, will always reaffirm when I can‚Äôt stop my self doubt. 
3	Yes, but it does also mean I had a propensity to be irrational. That‚Äôs just the way it is.\n\nBut if u can get that under control, I think the endgame is much better for sensitive people. 
3	First glance thought it said ‚ÄúAcute Awareness of Subtitles‚Äù and I was like FUCK YEAH FINALLY they understand me!!! 
2	How about being highly sensitive but with alexithymia?
2	 I've not seen it laid out like this, but I've always believed there was more to being sensitive, beyond the obvious connotations. Sensitive (adj.):  having acute mental or emotional sensibility; aware of and responsive to the feelings of others.\n\n I very much enjoyed reading this, and I'll share it. Thank you! 
2	Thanks for sharing. It makes me feel better, because I am always being told I'm too sensitive, like sensitive is\na bad thing.
2	Definitely resonates with me!
2	I love this and it's very accurate. 
2	Yes, all of it. I'm also slowly spreading the knowledge about it to my loved ones that don't really know or understand. Although, I have come to realize that being a highly sensitive person is its own thing altogether. You can have sensory processing sensitivity (also learned scientific name) even if you're not an INFP. See https://hsperson.com/ there's so much info out there!
2	And even if I would show this to all the important people in my life, they would still stick with "Highly emotional & irrational" .\_. 
2	I love the way this shows all of the wonderful qualities HSPs possess. Sometimes I find myself focusing too much on the top pie chart lol, so seeing the bottom one is a much needed reminder of how much we have to offer üòä
2	EXACTLY!!!! 
1	I don't believe in justice. I'm not that good with language. Nor with subtleties.
1	Or it can be both.  High sensitivity is a state, how it manifests depends on the individual expressing it. Nothing is entirely good or bad.
1	For sure. Minus detail oriented. Im Horrible with detail 
6	INTP seeking relationship advice from fellow INFPs	Hello everyone!\n\nI am an INTP - A (or so I have been told). I am here to seek advice from you guys on dating an INFP - T.\n\nSo let me write a few words to explain my situation. I am 26 and she is one year younger than me. We met online and immediately hit it off. We used to interact via texts at first and then it moved on to calls and then we finally met the other day. \n\nWe have a few key similarities and a few differences just like in any other relationship. I also think we view the world differently or our perspectives are not entirely aligned. We both have had some dating experience prior to this but it seems like her experience has not been very pleasant and she has had to deal with a lot emotionally. That makes her a bit defensive and cautious. She also seemed (seems) like she is a bit insecure about herself and is almost prepping for disappointment.\n\nNow, I personally think (know) that all these so called issues are not issues at all because I can fully understand her POV and I can empathize with her. Her responses and thoughts are completely natural and warranted but I fail to clearly show/ communicate that I can relate and understand her completely and I do not think that there's anything wrong with her. \n\nSo I think what I am saying is that I find her interesting and I enjoy talking to her. I am quite sure she enjoys it too but I think we can have much more fun if she feels more comfortable, secure and confident about me as a person. How do I achieve that? What goes on in your heads INFPs? What do you guys need emotionally? What do you expect from a relationship and what do you expect from your partner? I just wanna see her comfortable in her skin and confident/ secure about herself.\n\nThat's it guys. If you read through this you are awesome and deserve my sincere thank you! Looking forward to your responses.
6	If there is one area where INFPs and INTPs can potentially fail, its with the lack of expression from INTPs, INFPs need that affirmation, and that emotional connection. If you can't fully communicate what you feel, try writing it down, many INFPs love letters and the written form in some way and work progressively towards expressing yourself more personally over time, if you explain things to your INFP clearly, and sincerely, your INFP is likely to work with you so that you can both build something that works for the two of you, and comprehend each other better. You should also search through both the INFP and INTP subs there is a lot of information there about this combination, its a common issue among the two, and to be honest not always the best prospect though possible, many times the INFP ends up hurt, or vice versa, just telling truth, if you know beforehand then you can probably prevent a lot of issues before they happen, though there will still be challenges as in any relationship. 
2	Time and patience, and being genuine, will go a long way. 
2	Make sure you spend quality time together, communicate clearly, and take time to care for each other and show appreciation. INFPs don't ask for much in relationships, as long as you are loving, patient, and genuine.
2	>Now, I personally think (know) that all these so called issues are not issues at all because I can fully understand her POV and I can empathize with her.\n\nHere is your main issue. You cannot be sure that she doesn't have issues, and instead of treating her as if she doesn't, while claiming to "empathize", be sure not to diagnose anything about her. Trust her to know herself and engage with conversation but don't ever think you know better than she does about herself. 
1	I agree with all of the comments here saying to take it slow and be patient. I am also super cautious and defensive when entering a new relationship, and prep myself for the worst.\n\nIf you try to convince or persuade her to be more comfortable/secure, she's going to see right through it and double down on the defense! \n\nJust continue to be real with her and acknowledge the reason for her to be distant. Patience is key. In time, she'll bring down her guard and let you in (figuratively and literally lol)
5	Spiritual Beliefs in r/INFP?	I've spent what feels like my entire life trying to find a philosophy that worked for me, and Buddhism is the only one that makes any sense to me. I've been practicing meditation for about five years but only recently got deeper in actual Buddhist teaching. I grew up fairly conservative protestant, but left due to some issues I personally had with the church. I guess you could call it irreconcilable differences. For a while, I was a pretty strong atheist just trying to find anything else to fill that part of my life. Now, I'm kind of a loose agnostic. \n\nI wanted to see how the rest of you are, spiritually. If there are any similarities in experience. For INTP and INFJ lurkers: I've heard that people who test INTP or INFJ also have an affinity for Buddhism, but I'm not sure how accurate that is. \n\n&#x200B;
7	I do like eastern philosophy and think of meditation as an amazing tool, no matter the beliefs around it. I've read a lot about religion in my time, in general all kinds of mysticism lure me.
3	A mix of non-dogmatic freestyle paganism and advaita (guess neo-advaita).\n\n~\n\nFor me, i dunno what can be more natural than spiritually connecting with the nature. Its the most healthy, reasonable and "real" religion in my mind, if it can be called a religion even. You don't really need to "believe" that the Sun is the energy source for the planet and all the life, and responsible for the life on the planet and our own, that we connected with its cycles, that we deeply connected with water and need it and consist of it, that we are in symbiotic relationships with the trees and plants as they give us oxygen we breath and not only, and eat them and the gifts of nature, that earth is our home, your ancestry brought you life, archetypes of a psyche etc. etc. generally speaking we are involved in biocenosis. and its really not something that needed to be proved or believed in. \n\nAll paganism does is turning your atention towards it connecting you spiritually, restoring and harmonising this natural connection of your psyche and yourself. Paying attention to it, giving respect and reaffirming it, harmonising and coming with peace with it, interacting with it, understanding on a deeper level, discovering you relation with it etc. however you want to describe it :). and you feel better and more YOU because of that. tuning you into yourself.\n\nPaganism is the most natural thing, thats why naturally it was a spirituality in all ancient sociums. Its coming out of you, not as some brought up to you artificial humanly made up thing.\n\nEvery other religion feels like some kind of a construction, not something natural, or a flow of life.\n\nThing is, if you go out and want to connect to some nature entity, force or energy, and try to tune to it and communicate with it. it will naturally appear as a some kind of humanlike form, cos thats how we are tuned to process communication with someone or something. Its naturally happend to me, and I'm pretty sure thats where from all the idea of gods and creature came from (so its just an natural interface of communicating with the energies and interacting with it). and why it was so wide spread in quite a similar (in principle) form. \n\nI consider buddhist, lamaism, taosism, advaita  etc. etc. to be more of a philosophical systems than anything. they sort of become "religionized" when in each society with time for each culture and country over the years they grew with different repeated rituals, ceremonies, yearly celebrations, formalities, procedures you need to to do and so on. Then we can say it became a religion with a package of all of that.  (which i really not a big fan of personally). \n\nAs for buddism in particular it has a nice peaceful appealing vibe, and i enjoy that in it, and generally has this no harm attidute, but pushing for enlightenment and setting it as a purpose of the existence seems iffy to me, and kinda disharmonius from who you are now, pushing for some distant goal. And obsessive fixation on it in general. Why would I see it as a goal? I more into connecting to who you are on the deepest level, and discovering your true nature. So Advaita on the other hand, is more harmonius and holistic  imo, it says that everyone is already enlightened, they just unaware of it, and the act of enlightenment  itself is just sortof recognizing what already is, that you are already enlightened and everyone and everything. Its not something more, its something less, dissaperance of the illusion. at least that how i get it in a nutshell, sorry if any specialist would read it and cringe :). but ya.\n\n\n\n
3	I‚Äôm 45.  Most of my life up until a year or so ago was spent trying to find God.  As far back as I can remember, I was always interested in the big picture.  ‚ÄúWhy are we here? Who made this place? Who is God?‚Äù All that stuff.  My brother dubbed me ‚ÄúCaptain Question-mark.‚Äù Lol.  I really annoyed my dad too.\n\nMy mother did her best to instill the Christian God in my heart by making me say my prayers every night. They also sent me to Catholic School.  But I was a little rebellious hellion al through my school years and even into adulthood.  Always did hate authority.  \n\nI do recall trying having a personal relationship with God as a kid, where I would pray and talk with Him.  But most of my prayers were very selfish, and I was very selfish in many ways too, though I didn‚Äôt think I was.\n\nAfter dropping out of college, I moved back home with my parents for a time.  I started drinking more heavily and smoking weed.  I dropped acid once too and had a bad trip, so I never touched that again.  Anyhow, I pretty much abandoned God at this point and became an agnostic because I thought Christianity had too many holes in it.  It was during my 20‚Äôs where I really started exploring other religions.  Buddhism was appealing,  but there‚Äôs was no way I could put it into practice due to my lack of self-discipline and control.  I‚Äôm way too obsessive-compulsive and selfish for that kind of thing.  In general, if it makes me feel good, my ethics often fall by the wayside and I feel the weight of my actions after the fact.  Many of the wrongs I did were born out of frustration and my perspective of the world.  I felt the world just operated on lies and bullshit and that I would just follow the herd.  It was a dark time of my life.\n\nAt 28 I was a full blown alcoholic.  I was addicted to cigarettes as well.  In addition, lots of pot and sexual partners.  But I hit a bottom and prayed to God one morning when I was hungover yet again.  A month later I found myself in Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nDurning the last 15 years I have bounced in and out of AA and church trying to find God, or my Higher Power.  I had many seasons where I had joined a church and drank the koolaid thinking I finally knew God.  But I always managed to see flaws in each of the churches I went too.  And I began discovering the differences in denominations and theologies.  \n\nOne big difference in theology is that of Calvinism vs. Armenianism.  The Calvanists believe in the doctrine of predestination; in a nut shell, the benevolent God and Creator of the universe dooms two-thirds of His human creations to an eternity in hell and the lucky one-third are God‚Äôs chosen people.  They are blessed and lucky.  It makes you feel real good knowing God chose you before the foundations of time to be with Him in eternity.  It‚Äôs easy to feel smug as a Calvanist.\n\nThe Armenian bent believes that salvation is olen to anyone and that humans choose. God gave is free will and it‚Äôs up to us to seek and find Him.  These churches tend to be more of the missionary type because they are responsible for telling the world about Jesus because people have to know He‚Äôs real if they are going to choose Him over Buddha, Taoism, Islam or whatever path they decide upon.\n\nI‚Äôm a deep dude.  I ask questions and break arguments down and try to make a cohesive whole where all the pieces of logic fit together perfectly.  But there‚Äôs just too many pieces floating around, and I‚Äôm not sure what pieces are even true or not.  \n\nThere are many people who claim to know the truth and are very self-assured in their beliefs; so much so that they will try and convince you of their truth.  But all of them are delusional.  In all my searching for the truth of the gospel I discovered this: God is subjective to everyone, yet many people believe their subjective view of God is objectively true.  In other words, many people believe they have the answer.  Once I discovered this (it only took me about 45 years...lol) I was able to embrace the mystery of it all and accept that God wants to be an enigma.  That makes sense to me.  If God, the almighty, wanted us to know, you‚Äôd think He‚Äôd make that pretty easy, right? But no, it‚Äôs not.  Maybe God does want to see our true colors and it is all some test.  Who knows.  But today, I am ok with the mystery.\n\nI still hold to the Trinity because it gives me peace personally, and in my own subjective view, makes sense to me on a certain level.  But I am not dogmatic anymore and I don‚Äôt claim to have al the answers.  It‚Äôs just faith.  It‚Äôs a faith that works for me.  Life is always revealing more of it‚Äôs mysteries as I progress towards the eternity beyond, so I have no idea what I‚Äôll believe tomorrow, but I am open.  More than anything, what I take away from Christianity is the idea of loving others and treating them with respect.  To that end, I don‚Äôt judge people on their sexual preference.  That‚Äôs not my job.  I am called to love and accept everyone.  I don‚Äôt care if someone is gay.  But many churches do.  I see that as contradictory and out of alignment with not only what Jesus said about loving others and accepting them, but also contradictory to a benevolent God.  And because I am aware that it‚Äôs all subjective anyhow, I have my own view on it.  The Bible is not 100% accurate.  Way to many hands in the cookie jar over the years.  The official western cannon excludes books from some of the eastern orthodox sects, like Ethiopia.  But I digress...I‚Äôm doing it again.  See, this shit never stops.  There‚Äôs a lot to look at.  It took me several years to decipher for myself.  I‚Äôm not here to convince people of my beliefs, but to simply say that we all have our own path and find something that works for you.  Whatever path you happen to choose I just hope it does not hurt others or interfere with their personal growth.\n\nAs far as the truth is concerned? Good luck.  Don‚Äôt stop searching.  When you‚Äôve figured it all out, let me know. Lol.\n\nPeace.
3	I recommend Ram Dass‚Äôs book Be Here Now since you‚Äôre here on your buddhist/spiritual path posting to reddit. I feel this book will help you see how spiritual life really is. & I highly recommend it if you‚Äôve done psychedelics at some point in your life.\n\nI hope you will find that you do not have to attend a modern church to ‚Äúfind‚Äù God. Church can be next to a river or on your bed. It‚Äôs all now. 
2	I am open to all teachings. \n\nCurrently revisiting the words spoken by Jesus and various other parts of the Bible. \n\nBut all in all Buddhism, zen, Tao Te Ching, Law of One, and such all resonate with me. \n\nI prefer to study as close to the original texts as possible, as organized religion and blind followers have obstructed the original messages. \n\nI look for serious teachers who by their works and words you can tell where they stand. \n\nI try to hold no stigmas or dogmas though, but discernment is everything. 
2	Pretty good, I re-entered the gloss of spiritual belief when I realized it worked for me. By 'Gloss' I mean a 'total' system of thought that you take to be true. I think many spiritual free spirits take the approach of trying to tailor their own personal spiritual belief. \n\nFor me it was taking back my roots and then developing a rather personal relationship with God, who seems to get a kick out of the whole thing. \n\nA big part of this is the party of believers who I seem to have an affinity with. To me spirituality is something apart from rationality and strict logic. As such, it was a part of my self that I was missing when I didn't believe.  
2	It seems empaths gravitate to Buddhism more frequently. It does make sense really. \n\nI used to practice xtianity until I finally got honest with myself. \n\nI find when angry, or sad, atheism takes hold for a while.  Though, I can't really tell if it's really atheism or a defense mechanism. Like, my energies are so depleted spiritual matters can't be dealt with while I'm trying to figure out how I'm feeling. So, those matters are just ignored.\n\nMost of time, I believe in the energy of the universe. Maybe there is a being, maybe not. If there is the being is neutral. It's neither concerned or unconcerned about our lives. It just set things in motion and went about it's day. Just like we set up a fish aquarium and leave the fish to sort out their lives. \n\nAt the he same time, we all put out energies, good and bad. Like attracts like. So bad energies create these shit storms that float around randomly. Every now and then they land on someone innocent. At the he same time, there's more love and goodness floating around which is what the universe is actually being expanded with. Those are the things of growth. Negativity is destruction.\n\nSo, when bad things go around, rest assured, more good things will come around in greater frequency. Thoughts, hopes and fears play a big part too. Kind of like Law of Attraction. If you think of your fears constantly, or lean towards supposing the worst possible scenario, the universe gives you those things because it thinks that's what you want. Same can be said for good things too! \n\nI find in humans, at least for myself, the negative emotions seem to be felt stronger than the positive emotions. Which does make sense! Love and kindness are soft gentle not over bearing. They don't intrude and try to control. Where anger, and sadness are destructors. They want to destroy. So like a spoiled toddler, they make themselves known even more so. \n\nThough, they say. If you ignore your emotions, they get louder and louder. So maybe we spend much of our lives suppressing the darker feelings. They feel ignored and start yelling at us.\n\nDunno....I'm rambling as usual. I apologise.
2	I kinda just follow my own inner compass, but I like to learn from different religions and philosophies because its like they all have a piece of the puzzle and they all pretty much have some universal concepts like the search for your spirit and know who you are. Seeking one's truth is crucial, knowing who you are through experience, and working out your shadow.
2	I was raised catholic, but I‚Äôve decided to put all beliefs or non beliefs on hold until I find something that I can 100% get behind. I do have my own superstitions that manifest sometimes, but i try not to let them interfere with my daily life. \n\nI feel like now that I‚Äôm in college and all, it‚Äôs a good time to find myself without too much interference. 
2	Buddhism mostly the Taoist philosophies help me daily.  Its based off of alot of prestablished infp traits anyway so we have a natural advantage to flow right into it.
2	I'm a religious pluralist who doesn't practice anything himself. However, the angels have given me guidance and I am grateful. I think I didn't listen to them enough because they seem to be gone, maybe they grew impatient.\n\nBuddhism doesn't really appeal to me. Maybe I need more spiritual experiences, but the idea that the goal of life is so....singular just doesn't sound right to me.\n\nI also firmly believe that everyone has their own path; there is no predefined way to "find" God. Perhaps some people aren't meant to even.
9	Recommend a Band	I recently got into Sigur R√≥s and I absolutely love it. From the incredible images I picture in my head while listening to them to their fantastic unique sound.\n\nDo you know some other bands that make you feel like you are floating (or just laying under the starry sky)?
7	Tame impala 
6	Arcane Roots, Maybeshewill, The Intersphere, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Dredg, Caspian, God Is An Astronaut, Tool.
5	Cigarettes after sex, maybe? The beat and the gentleness felt really similar to me, although it is also quite different from what you mentioned in some way. But you might enjoy it hopefully, so there. 
4	Not floaty but I'm currently obsessed with Lorn's 'Acid Rain'. I just think its brilliant and just love the music video for it too!
3	at the time I was listening to Sigur Ros, Band of Horses and Explosions in the Sky where on my tracklist. I still reminisce about driving around with friends listening to those albums.
3	I find Radiohead pretty cool, especially their song, how to disappear completely
2	I‚Äôve been liking Methyl Ethel <3
2	London Grammar 
2	Collapse Under the Empire. 65 Days of Static. Hammock. Someone mentioned Caspian - one my faves.  Non Post Rock bands that keep me level headed. Field Report. Pinegrove. The list could go on and on. 
2	Conditions and The amity affliction
2	Kurt Vile is incredible, he's getting really popular. His last album Bottle it In is my life soundtrack for the past few months.
2	The full album Pisces Iscariot by Smashing Pumpkins is UNBELIEVABLE. I think every INFP should listen to it.

4	Relationships in General	I need some advice on the title, relationships in general. I feel like one of my core characteristics and conflicting motivations is my desire to take care of others and the joy it gives me which exists at odds with my desire to feel wanted and taken care of by my partner, friends, and family. \n\nI'm currently in a relationship in which I feel like the happiness I got from taking care of my partner has sustained me long enough to allow resentment to build beneath the surface, resentment that I successfully ignored. Now I feel angry that it is so easy for me to sacrifice for my relationship, but not see the same from my partner. \n\nI particularly find it frustrating that when I get upset with my partner, he responds negatively and hostilely, so I flip to trying to take care of his negative emotions and feelings instead of demanding he acknowledge and reconcile what he did that upset me. I end up always coming second. \n\nThis can usually work for me for awhile. I like care taking. After some time tho, I become aware and resentful of this cycle. \n\nAs an infp, I find confrontation and assertiveness very challenging. I'm wondering if anyone here can relate and how they go about getting off this cycle if possible. 
3	Break up with him? Doesn‚Äôt sound like a good fit
3	I definitely relate and am working to get out of this cycle, myself.\n\nI think the first step ‚Äî which you‚Äôve already done, is recognizing that you have the desire to feel wanted and taken care of.  Sometimes those desires get so buried that you forget all about them.  Then, you‚Äôre left wondering why you feel resentment toward the people in your life.  Not so for you, though ‚Äî you can already verbalize your needs, which is great!\n\nThe next step in getting out of this cycle (for me, anyway), involves assertiveness and confrontation ‚Äî which I‚Äôd rather avoid, too.  I just don‚Äôt see any other way.  \n\nWhen I present my feelings to my partner (or anyone), I always try to take ownership by saying something like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way you could have known this was important to me, because I didn‚Äôt even know until recently, but I would feel more (loved, supported, connected, etc) if (fill in the blank).  I find this helps reduce the other person‚Äôs natural tendency to get defensive.  \n\nNow, this doesn‚Äôt fix everything, of course.  That person still has to listen to you and follow through.  If they don‚Äôt, you can always bring it up again, but eventually...you are probably going to want to move on.\n\nI hope that helps.  If not, just know you‚Äôre not alone.
3	(not even getting into MBTI)\n\nI went through similar with ALL of my relationships! With some serious reflecting, pouring over details, Breaking it all down...and with some good advice, it boiled down to my communication.\n\nIt takes a while for me to put together how I'm feeling. Mostly, I"m focused on the pulse of the relationship and how the other is feeling. After a while I notice there's something I'm missing. Something I need in the relationship. However, since so much focus has been on the other's feelers, and doing things to keep the general harmony in the relationship, I never expressed my needs or concerns.\n\nThe other is blissfully unaware there ever was a problem in the first place! Same with me until there's time to sort out what I'm feeling.\nThen, when I finally do mention something, it's seemingly out of the blue for the other. This causes a reaction rather than a response. It makes me look unbalanced and chaotic. Fucking sucks!!!!!!\n\nMaybe it's the same with you. Maybe you let things go and go, not paying attention to yourself so much as the other person. Then when you do say something, it's more of a reaction coming from you which causes a reaction coming from them. \n\nMaybe, you can take some time and really see what you expect, need, and want in the relationship. Then you both can sit down and discuss all of it with responses instead of reactions. \n\n
1	Get out of my head!\n\nThis is absolutely me. To a T. I haven‚Äôt cracked the nut yet, but just trying to be more aware and put myself first. Honouring my feelings is huge first step. Getting out of unhealthy relationships. Recognizing the ways I enable and coming to terms with those truths. 
1	Google: people pleasing, might help to recognise the issue and find solutions.
5	About a year ago I shared a short song I wrote which really spoke to my INFP traits. A few months ago I released a "part 2" to that song, hopefully you guys and gals can relate.	
2	Nice! You have a very unique sound with good flowing energy. Very will put together.
16	I'm feeling so embarrassed and disappointed because I don't do well in Writing Class when I've always been passionate about writing.	Excuse me for any grammatical errors since English is not my first language. Well, my teacher made students write about our past experiences as a journal to submit. I thought it got pretty personal, so I decided to write about my past friendship with a very nice person and how we got along. I had a good feeling about the journal, but the result is so disappointing that it makes me feel very unsure about my dream of becoming a writer. I got 5/10 and the comment is 'The linking words you use in your writing don't seem to express your idea clearly' because I use 'comma' before 'because', one 'therefore', and forgot a comma before 'however'. Like I get my mistakes; I can learn from that, but how I got 5 out of 10 embarrassed me so much, because my peers have been teasing me about the 'writer' title. I'm just discouraged and sad. What should I do to stop feeling this bad about the situation? \n\nI'm not sure if it's common for Infps to want to give it all up when being discouraged about something we're passionate about, but it's been terrible for me.\n\n 
5	It's very common infps give up if they don't feel enough encouragement, but you don't have to give up !! There's plenty of time in a day you can practice and learn about commas and all that. Commas actually don't have anything to do with being a writer, writers use editors to fix the mistakes they missed. I'm not saying you shouldn't pay attention to this, just that it's not the most important thing about being a writer, it's about what you write and how you convey the message. All writers have to start somewhere and them improve. You can have a talent for writing but you still have to learn how to be better. If it's important enough for you, work on it, don't give up !!
2	Hey, I get like that too. It does take a bit of work and practice to talk yourself out of quitting something you like doing. As I grow older, I find that the list of things I  really, really enjoy doing gets shorter and shorter--making those remaining things very precious. Whenever I feel like quitting because I failed to do a good job -- I try to remind myself that I should treasure having something I \*know\* I really like, and I should honour it by keeping up the practice. Anyway, no one does a spectacular job 100% of the time. If you ask me, that would be kind of annoying and boring anyway. I know it's cliche, but the times we suck are really the times when there's more potential to get better. Also, it gives you a good helping of humble pie so your ego doesn't implode every half second. So, just enjoy yourself. I hope you keep up writing. Much love.
2	I can relate to the grammar mistakes. Are you by chance a native German speaker? Our comma rules are sometimes almost the opposite of the English comma rules which can give us a tough time.\n\nWe don't take critique very well. I wouldn't give up on your dream to become a writer. Use the critique as fuel for your creativity and try to fail better next time.  *‚ÄúEver tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.‚Äù* (Samuel Beckett)

My life has hardly been objectively terrible, which is why it is that much more painful that I've managed to make nothing of myself in my 29 years of life.\n\nI guess one could easily categorize me as a tortured artist. No one understands my art, until recently I didn't even have a message or a direction for myself. After years of abuse in terrible corporate jobs, I've been unemployed for the third time in a 7 year stretch for a long period of time. Living with my parents now, even they feel excessive pressure that I will stay a shut in. I'm ruining their lives.\n\nI've been *trying*. I applied and put my soul into a Masters program in industrial design but was rejected. I felt immediately like the universe is trying to say "fuck you". Plus there's no hope for the future - I failed to make connections with anyone so no letters of recommendation. It will be at least a year and a half before I even begin grad school if that - but I can't get the recommendation letters. Plus I wanted to be a designer, an artist. No one will hire me for employment in the meantime.\n\nMy friends are all indifferent. I push them away. My extended family doesn't care either. They don't care anyway about me. I imagine dying and how the only people who would feel anything would be my parents. People just dont give a shit - my own siblings don't like me, no one cares. \n\nI've never felt so hopeless/helpless. Life just is not getting better - it's been a decade and it's all basically been the same. I'll never "fit in" with society and I'll never get to be/do what I want. 
40	Hey, so first of all please don't kill yourself. It sounds like you're in a lot of pain right now, but that you also have a lot going for you. You're an artist so I'm gonna say you're creative even if you don't feel like it at the moment. You have parents who care about you and it sounds like you care about them a lot too. You've been trying like you said in spite of all your setbacks, which shows you're resilient. It's not too late. I think a lot of people feel pressure to "achieve" something significant by the time they're 30, but many don't figure out their goals or how to get there until later in life. So don't give up hope. 
20	You are not alone! It is actually the universe telling you "Follow your heart and work harder." I can't imagine the pressure you're going through right now, but please understand that this pressure is temporary. It will pass over time. No need to rush to get through it. In fact, embrace it! You will learn a lot of amazing things about yourself. I can tell that you're a very hard worker too. One of the best things to do is talk a walk outside, get some fresh air, and think about your parents! You will always be their child, so go ahead and vent to them as well! They will be more than happy to help you and will be understanding of your problems. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of my favorite quotes:\n\n ‚ÄúWhen someone seeks, then it easily happens that his  eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing,  to take in nothing because he always thinks only about the thing he is  seeking, because he has one goal, because he is obsessed with his goal.  Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open,  having no goal.‚Äù \n\n\-Herman Hesse, *Siddhartha*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I would most definitely encourage you to share your art online! There are so many beautiful connections I have made with people over time in doing so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are people out there to help you and the number one recommendation I'd give is the Suicide Prevention Hotline:\n\n[https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)\n\n 1-800-273-8255 \n\nMuch love and prayers to you. We are here for you!\n\nKevin
14	I almost died this past year and I can tell you this- the first thing you realize in those moments is that you don't want to die, and it's unfortunate that it took such an experience to realize that truth. It's ironic that dreamers forget that this experience is all one big mess of a dream. Regardless of what we set out to achieve, the result is not that, but it is something much greater and much more true to ourselves. I know its cliche, but you can truly become the person you want to be regardless of exogenous forces. If you want something, and you relentlessly do your best, you will find solace in what you become along the way no matter, and you will define yourself not by your perception of others perception but purely by the fact that you do your absolute best in every aspect of life. Your mind will become friends with your heart, perhaps for the first time, and you will no longer look back in frustration and guilt. You will become a conduit for infinite inspiration and love- for yourself and all that you come in contact with. If you haven't read *The Four Agreements*, I highly suggest you give it a try. It was probably the single greatest decision I can remember making for my own personal development- and where I would say I began truly living.
9	I know you feel that you're alone in this world and I completely understand that, and I know how rough it is for it to seem like no one cares but I just want to remind you that are not alone in this experience and there will always be people who you can reach out to who do care and want to help you.\n\nThe pressure to fit in with society can be overwhelming, especially for someone like you who has a passion but hasn't been allowed to pursue it but don't let someone tell you that your art isn't worthwhile because they don't understand it. There are people out there, including me, who relate to your experiences and just because we aren't the arbiters of what kind of art society deems important doesn't lessen its impact. There are many people like you out there and you shouldn't give up on making art just because you haven't met anyone who can understand it.\n\nI'm not really well equipped to talk about suicide but there have been many times where my life seemed helpless I have considered it like you. But, speaking from personal experience, if I had seen where I was today, I know I would've regretted it. \n\nIf you're still considering suicide I strongly urge to contact a professional first so here is a [list of suicide hotlines in various countries](http://ibpf.org/resource/list-international-suicide-hotlines). However if you ever feel like you need a friend to talk to feel free to PM me. <3
8	This is going to be very long. I hope you read it and maybe find something to help you.\n\n\nOh man!!!!!! It all hit hard when I turned 30! It was seriously the worst day/ months/ year in my life! At least up to that point! üòÇ I drank 3 fifths of whiskey that day. Scared me slightly.\n\nI felt much the same. Wasted my life busting my ass to make someone else rich. Didn't accomplish a damned thing I expected by that time. I did have a little to show, but it wasn't what I wanted.\n\nThat whole year I spent time planning and thinking of what I CAN do at that age. I looked at everything I always wanted to do. Then, picked the easiest thing. Then went from there. \n\nThere were quite a few little accomplishments, and one I'm super proud of! On the way to anything, there were failures, set backs, and roadblocks too. It wasn't all gravy.\n\nMy most proud accomplishment was earning a black belt in Judo. My whole life I wanted to learn a martial art. Here ai am, 10 years later, at 42, been a black belt for almost 5 years now!  I know right now, you're saying, okay, that's cool.....then BUT!.....üòÅ \nThere's a reasoning here.\n\nOne day I was a green belt. I was sparring a brown belt. The whole time I did nothing! He kept saying "Come on man! Make your move!"\nFinally I stopped. Looked at him and said. "I was waiting for you to make a mistake so I can do something." He looked me dead in the eye. "I'm not going to make a mistake!"\n\nI went home and sat up thinking about that most the night. The whole next week I thought about it. If he wasn't going to make a mistake, what the hell was I going to do?\n\nOne day it hit like a ton of bricks! I need to make him make a mistake. Then thinking about this. I began to notice things around me. People miserable at their jobs. Whining, bitching, complaining. Hell I was too! Just shit sick of it all. My soul was dying every day. I prayed the roof was going to collapse and just end it all. \n\nThrough all that. It hit me again! YOU HAVE TO CREATE YOUR OWN OPPORTUNITIES!!!! There is no other way in life. NONE!!!!! How you do that, I don't know because I'm not you. \n\nYou're an artist. That means you are creative. You are creative within yourself in ways you would never have imagined if you just give yourself half a chance!\n\nThe last 3 years, I've lost literally everything I've worked for. That's an even longer story. I'm rebuilding once again. This time it will be what I want my life to be. How I want to live it! This is a fresh start! A NEW OPPORTUNITY!!!!!!\nReally, losing everything has to be my responsibility. The mistakes and decisions I made. Allowing the wrong people into my life. Forgetting to create my own opportunity. Through my self loathing and depression, I thought, maybe I was wrong. I let others, yet again, create the life I was living. Which ultimately Led to catostrophic loss. \n\nBut now! A fresh start! Armed with my experiences, and new goals. You have loving parents giving you a springboard to launch the life you want to have!\n\n\nNow, onto the darker note.\nI am a suicide survivor! I very seriously tried to kill myself when I was 13. Ended up in ICU because someone caught me taking some pills.\n\nBy this time, I had already taken almost 70, still was trying to finish. The person who caught me was my ex girlfriend. (Suicide unrelated). She called my mom when I asked her to bring me some water. I guess I wasn't sneaky enough. My ex's mom called 911. I had no idea this was all going down.\n\nBy this time I was barely able to walk, becoming unable to function, anything. \n\nMy mother showed up. My "friends" showed up. The Ambulance showed up. Somehow I was on the gurney. The medics asked me how many I took. Before I could answer they told me my mother said I only took one. \n\nI thought for a minute. Looked over at all the people who were there. Friends, friends of friends, my mother and who knows who else.\nEVERYONE who knew me and I thought cared were laughing! Just joking around. Not one fuck was given that I was actually in my way out!\n\nI thought. I can tell them I only took one then walk over to the field and fade off to the nothing. Then looked over at them all still laughing. I decided right then and there. FUCK ALL THEM SORRY FUCKERS! Looked right at the medics and said, "Get my ass to the hospital!"\n\nI spent 24 hours in intensive care after having my stomach pumped, and all kinds of other tubes and medications to counter act what I took.\n\nGuess what! Not a damn soul showed up to check on me! Later a psychiatrist came in and talked. He got pissed and left. Then another came in. We talked. Then a pretty lady came in and asked me to follow her. Well of course I was going to!\n\nWe walked down a long ass hall. When we passed through the doors, they locked. I knew! Just knew! I'm on my way to the psych ward! I spent 3 months there. All summer.\n\nWhen I got out, I had nothing to do with anyone who I was hanging out with then. With exception! I still had one friend. He never knew what was happening. That's because, for some reason. I got caught up hanging out with the new crowd.\n\nNow check this shit out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nToday, I'm still friends with that dude and his cousin! Not only that I'm dating his cousin's sister who I love very much. Not only that! I was married 20 years. Was with her since we were 16. We have 2 bad ass kids together. Though we divorced, because we married too young. I still have my kids.\n\nThings aren't perfect for me right now. Things are good though! It's going to get better and better!\n\n\nNow, take what you will of this. Let me say one last thing. There's not a day that goes by I'm not glad I didn't end my life that night! Things will look up! Whatever it takes, MAKE YOUR LIFE YOUR OWN!\n\n
8	If you ever want to text me, you can ask for it in my inbox. I really wanna help.
21	I'm a 17 year old nobody, but I would recommend you start your own business. Fuck a piece of paper that says you wasted thousands and and a couple of years of your life. If you can get a good footing and start to make progress in the right direction it will all be downhill from there. \n\nHave you heard of the Mathew principle: Basically the more advantages you accumulate the more you'll advanced.\n\nIt's basically the rich get richer. If you Mage good progress now, it will get easier. Start getting money, get happier, more motivated, socialise (perhaps get into a relationship), Start a family and get purpose. \n\nI hope you get better   (Àµ Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°Àµ) 
7	You sound a lot like me and my struggles.  My suggestion is that you follow your art and find some sort of job that can sustain you.  \n\nFor years I had dreamed of being a singer/songwriter or a blues guitarist...but I got so caught up in what other people thought of me and what I should do...people close to me especially.  They made me feel like I was being silly to want to pursue music.  I waited forever for their affirmation and validation that never came.  \n\nI have recently discovered that being an INFP is just really hard.  Most people do not operate like us at all.  We look for validation as a way to confirm who we are because it‚Äôs hard for many of us to do that ourselves, but that is what you need to work on.  Fuck your parents and family and anyone who tells you who you are and what you should do with your life.  They will never understand.  You have to take a leap of faith and gain the confidence as you move along towards your destiny.  \n\nIs it scary? Totally, but it‚Äôs worth it and you‚Äôll be much happier knowing that you are moving towards your goal.\n\nAs far as school, you don‚Äôt need trophies and shit like society says.  I have struggle with that shit for years.  My dad had a Ph. D...talk about having some big shoes to fill.  I am his sensitive idiot son.  He was a real jerk, but I have forgiven him and moved on.  By brother was an asshole too.  My mom sucks too.  But I have done my best to forgive them and have an alright relationship with them today.\n\nDon‚Äôt kill yourself.  Instead, start living your life the way you want.\n\nI drive for uber and get bar gigs playing cover music.  I enjoy it.  I‚Äôm not putting grandiose expectations on myself to sell out Carnigie hall.  I stead, I am happy just performing and connecting with people.  Occassionally one of my original songs resonates with them and that‚Äôs a great feeling.  Most of all, I get to be creative and free from a boss and am living my life.  I also love being there for people in my uber rides.\n\nGood luck.  You‚Äôre not alone.
5	Speaking as someone on the other end of a serious suicide attempt - If you sincerely worry that you‚Äôre ruining your parents lives now - you dont want this. Your suicide and the guilt, pain and grief it causes is a destruction like you have never known. It would ruin their lives in the fullest sense - permanently. It did mine and my two sisters. Our family member recovered - but barely, and only after a coma. Nothing has ever damaged me more. If they were successful, I would have been ruined. I wish I could find a way to emphasize that more. \n\n  \nThat shouldn‚Äôt be the only reason not to do it, but because you mention a sensitivity to that I felt you should know. \n\n \nJust dont. Dont create pain. Make life. \n\n
3	We love you OP. You were made WITH purpose FOR purpose. Reach out to me . I want to be you friend
5	Post some of your art here and maybe you'll be appreciated.
2	Hey I'm sorry you feel this way. About 2 years ago I was ready to commit suicide so I know how it feels to just want to give up and die. I spent so long thinking that at least I could always kill myself if things got too bad. I'm not one to make a rash decision so I actually thought it out before deciding to kill myself. If I was going to do it I made sure I wasn't going to regret it. But the next day I couldn't go through it. I just couldn't do it. So I spent the next two weeks in a daze. I was for all intents and purposes dead inside. \n\nDuring this time I pushed my family away and I didn't have many friends so I just existed. It was horrible. I didn't feel anything. I felt so cheated that when it came down to it I couldn't kill myself. All this time thinking that death was going to set me free but I couldn't do it. \n\nEventually I broke, I couldn't live that way anymore. I had to make a decision on what I was going to do. Death or life.\n\nI promised myself I would try again one more time. I would genuinely try again at life and try my hardest to just be happy. It was my ultimatum. If I ever felt this way again I had full permission to just kill myself because I had tried my best. \n\nThings nowadays are good. I realized that pushing away my friends and family would get me nowhere and that if I really tried my best I was able to handle and maintain relationships. Things didn't get better for me but my ability to handle the bad things in my life improved.\n\nI was ready to face death so anything else was trivial in comparison. It wasn't the healthiest way to go about things but I eventually reached a point where I felt glad that I hadn't killed myself. \n\nI don't know you but please don't kill yourself. Death is too final. Things may suck now but you can't know what the future holds until you experience it. I know you said that your family doesn't care and your friends are indifferent but maybe try reaching out to them again? You may find that they care more than you know.\n\nI would also recommend therapy. Sometimes you need a little help parsing through your feelings and there may be some things that you already know subconsciously but just need someone to point out. I hope things get better for you.
2	Hey man, I don't necessarily have much to say that others haven't already said, but there is a quote i heard today that stuck out to me and I hope it helps, even if it's just a little bit, but it went something like this,\n\n "Don't let someone else's opinion of you become your reality." \n\nDon't give up man. Keep pushing that rock. You may not think people care, but I do and I'm certain others here do too.
2	Fitting in is a load of crap. Strive to be different than others. You‚Äôre special and you know it! If you can imagine a life of happiness - either by gaining acceptance into a masters program, having a fulfilling job, finding people who care about you (like all of us on this sub!), then you still have hope! Feelings of failure and inadequacy are NORMAL human emotions. Everyone feels like that, especially successful people. It‚Äôs up to you whether you want to let those feelings motivate you to grow as a person or to consume your life. It‚Äôs impossible for your life to go from 0 to 100 overnight but take it one day at a time, one breath at a time, and survive!! We‚Äôre all rooting for you! It‚Äôs soooo hard to have no hope but you do have hope, you just have to remind yourself of it. Don‚Äôt dwell on negative feelings - they‚Äôre normal and a facet of life. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for it! Accept it and move on to better and brighter things! \n\nYou don‚Äôt have to pursue anything right away. The success of your life isn‚Äôt dictated by your age. Amazing people have found success only later in life. Don‚Äôt rob your future amazing self the chance to see how successful you‚Äôll be!! Don‚Äôt think of all the things you haven‚Äôt achieved but think of all the things you CAN achieve in the time you have remaining. Success comes with hard work and hard work takes practice which takes time. We all have time! It‚Äôs free! Use it wisely and chase your happiness. If you‚Äôre not happy with your life, it‚Äôs not your fault. Our society isn‚Äôt built to lift us up. It‚Äôs there to exploit us and our happiness all for capitalism and selfishness. Don‚Äôt let normalcy deter you from happiness. SO many successful people out there are miserable so success doesn‚Äôt define happiness and you shouldn‚Äôt let it! 
2	I assure you.  If you die, you only pass your pain onto other people.  For as long as you live, you are at least relieving them of THAT burden.
2	I'd say one of the most important things is simply living according to your values instead of your goals. Sometimes failing to meet our goals hurts more than it should, and often those are things we can't control. Try to find joy in getting back to a daily ritual you enjoy, or in consistently furthering yourself in something you're passionate about. I've been pretty depressed this last winter and I'm stuck in a job that I loathe but when I come home I'm proud of the fact that I can cook and discover a new meal to make, or that I can make another watercolor painting, or I can go for a short run. Once I have enough momentum from being somewhat proud and fulfilled by who I am, that's when I work on my goals.
2	Please don't do it. I don't have much to say but all I know is that suicide is never the better option. We all have low points in our lives, but we get through them. so what if people don't care? Fuck them, go find some one who cares. also, parents understand we go through tough times, so did they.
2	Mate, you're only 29. There is so much to see and do in life. \nYou've had a lot of disappointment recently but don't let that stop you. Is it time to change up the plan and try a new avenue in the creative industry? \n\nIt's time to reinvent yourself and get that energy back. Have faith in yourself. Listen to some Tony Robbins podcasts. \nI wish I could say more but I've gotta get to work.\n\nBest of luck to you. You're gonna be ok.\n\n
2	27 in a similar spot. Wannabe artist too. \n\nI understand your feelings, and i have little to say more than other folks already had. \n\nHell, i'm too morbid to believe i can help out emotional stuff, but honestly, i'd rather see your art from a couple of years from now when you achieve it than see or hear about another brother found dead.
1	I went through a really hard time a few years ago and felt like I had pretty much hit rock bottom. I felt some of the same things you are feeling and eventually, things really did work out for the better. During this time though, all I wanted was someone to talk and vent to, who wouldn‚Äôt get tired of listening to me. You can definitely message me anytime if you need someone to talk to!
1	Start a Kickstarter (if you can actually commit to one) or a Patreon? Give yourself a goal because you should be living for yourself and not for the people around you. The family thing isn't very important as I had been told many times by locals  in my town "You can't live for other people, you have to live for yourself, family doesn't define you." I had it in my head that for some reason I needed their validation and support but the truth was the validation and support needed to come from self confidence. It was not a good place for awhile and I myself ended up in a psychiatric ward locked in. Not a good feeling and it leaves you feeling as if you don't even own your own being. The truth is at those times you don't during those points in life because it hurts the people you don't know. The people that clean up the bodies and each time wonder to themselves why, hoping something could've been different. It also deprives you of this likely one time chance to do anything you want before you're stuck back in eternal sleep if you take yourself out. If you don't like you, improve you. Write more, self deprecate less. The people that have been cruel to you in your career were likely people that are miserable themselves. Happy people don't demean people for no reason because there is no reason to if you're confident in your stride. Don't kill yourself. 
1	Throwing my hat in the ring here. Don't do it. The future is filled with boundless possibilities if only you would hold on. You get better at life as you get older. \n\nI've been in similar positions to you. Don't let it get to you.
1	I was in a similar boat last year. My life came crashing down on me a couple of years ago from illness and now I am 30 and still have not achieved what I wanted to achieve at this age. Watching other people live their lives while I am still recovering is frustrating. I had no reason to live last year other than the one desire I've held my entire life. To have my own cool love story. Which has not happened yet. I did not believe at that time that it would ever happened. I started to look for the most painless way to take my life so that I could at the very least have a pleasant ending.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI travelled to South East Asia in November and saw a lot of peace in the people there, despite some of their conditions, which I assure you are materially much worse than yours or mine. They are happy with their lot and don't seem to be hard on themselves. The people I spoke with all had a strong faith that things will work out eventually and that it was just a matter of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not strange for a person later in life to make it and I think that happens often. It's just for some reason, our society now is super pushy and aggressive in my opinion and expects others to have it all and to have it all now. Life just doesn't work that way. Things take time. Ups and downs are normal. The road to become who you are is full of unexpected twists and turns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, how you view yourself is much more important than what others think. No one needs to care about you as much as you care about yourself. We live our life alone and we die alone. Try to find peace in that. Feel all your emotions and allow them to pass. I know you'll emerge out of this period with a stronger faith in yourself and realize how much strength you actually have.
0	Sorry your life sounds ideal compared to mine,I have brain damage,schizophrenia,homeless,never get a single night of sleep.Youre free to pursue your dreams,if I were as lucky as you I‚Äôd get a tiny house r/tinyhouses for cheap and then  be an artist as much as you like.Sorry if this sounds harsh but I‚Äôve been looking at photographs of third world miners that risk their lives for 3.50 a month to go down to the mines.

12	Is this an INFP thing?	I hope so. \n\nI get on ‚ÄúI am Sad and Cynical‚Äù benders where I absorb all the collective tragedy I can in the form of documentaries and podcasts. This happens in particular when my insomnia gets the best of me. \n\nRecently:\n\nHIV 9/11 Anti-Vaxxers Jonestown Scientology Waco Ebola Pedophilia Neo Nazis Mass Murder Mothers who Murder Tienanmen Square Anti Biotic Resistance Oklahoma City Bombing WWII North Korea Genocide True Crime Serial Killers Ruby Ridge \n\nIt‚Äôs like... I‚Äôm playing chicken with my empathetic response. How much can I bombard myself with and absorb until I shut down and I‚Äôm not stricken or thoughtful. \n\nSo far, so good. \n\nSo far, I‚Äôm pretty well informed on the most tragic shit to randomly bring up to my friends and husband and family and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh damn‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyeah, damn and also‚Äî-‚Äú\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a ridiculous ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù humble brag. And I‚Äôm okay. Mostly, I don‚Äôt have many people to talk to about this stuff and I‚Äôm always looking for more recommendations, more discourse, more people to collectively mourn with while gaining a sense of how shit this world can be. It makes me feel sad... but so grateful. I have to be grateful. I‚Äôm so lucky. \n\nI also enjoy reading smutty historical romance novels and watching the same romantic comedies over and over if that‚Äôs more your thing.
5	Very INFP. I go to Facebook pages of non profits who specialize in helping children with multiple disabilities and watch the videos and look at all the pictures of these beautiful, perfectly innocent souls.  Brings me to tears - my heart reaches out and embraces them. 
1	I can relate to that. Especially taking a deep dive down the documentary rabbit hole of youtube.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's something you might enjoy... although it's something different:  \n[Samsara (Trailer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp967YAAdNk)
1	[https://www.facebook.com/rbeneteau/posts/10155790626232032](https://www.facebook.com/rbeneteau/posts/10155790626232032)
1	Lately I just realize when I'm getting overwhelmed like that and try to change my scene. For me, it's like I have this ability to go from one moment to the next and completely turn a corner when I need to. Or more often, I just turn that corner and wonder what I was so concerned about moments before. Of course, sleep does this too. 
5	Any INFPs here that don't get the concept of animals as pets?	First off... I really like animals. \n\nRecently I have seen so many memes about INFPs relating to or bonding with pets (mostly cats and dogs). \n\nMaybe it is just because of my ideals; I believe that every living thing should be wild and free. I don't get the concept of a domestic or tamed animal kept for companionship or pleasure. When I see a dog on a leash, a caged bird or a cat that is confined to the four walls of a flat I feel bad for them.\n\nSo back to my question: Are there any other INFPs who feel the same way? I often argue with friends who keep a small Zoo at their home, but they can't seem to get my point (or maybe I just forgot how to have a conversation... again) :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
11	I see where you‚Äôre coming from, but the reality is that there are animals that need homes.  I don‚Äôt like rush hour traffic or agree with it but I drive in it.  There are many animals in shelters that need to be adopted.  And it‚Äôs not only illegal to let your dog run off, the dog may starve or get hit by a car.\n\nI love animals and have 3.  Last night a raccoon showed up outside my door and I fed her.  I don‚Äôt think owning pets makes me a bad person or any less INFP.  I get animals and usually have a deep connection with them.
9	I really like animals, too.  :)\n\nThe idea that animals should be wild and free is beautiful, and I completely agree.  The reality, however, is that the dogs/cats/birds you speak of, have been bred for domestication.  I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right, but these animals are here ‚Äî and they need loving homes.  We can‚Äôt just free them all ‚Äî the majority would be killed.  \n\nI don‚Äôt have pets because my husband doesn‚Äôt like animals.  If it were completely up to me, though, I would take in as many as I could reasonably care for.  I‚Äôd show them love and try to give them the best life possible.  \n\nHaving pets doesn‚Äôt mean that you support the exploitation of animals.  Certainly, we as humans are benefiting from their companionship, but does the animal not benefit, too?  Until we empty all the shelters and put an end to breeding practices ‚Äî what is the alternative?\n\n
5	I feel bad for birds in cages but not for dogs and cats. I feel like dogs and cats enjoy a symbiotic relationship with us, we help one another have a better life... Sometimes
3	I don‚Äôt like anything that‚Äôs enclosed or caged in any restrictive way. I think some pets are ok, as in dogs or cats. I know dogs, as I owned one in the past, are great for emotional support and more. If you think about it, dogs and cats roam around humans naturally. But for example, a killer whale?... I can only answer with, I hate sea world. 
4	I mean I don't relate to the 'introvert loves pets' memes simply because I don't like animals at all. \n\nI do find it weird when dog owners for example gush about their dog's unconditional love towards them like the dog even had a choice to begin with but meh. It's selfish but so is most things humans do. 
1	Dogs have been selectively bred by humans for \~100k years. They are in their natural habitat as our pets.
1	I think a love for pets is more prevalent if you grew up with pets. Also a cultural thing. Some cultures see animals as festy and aggressive like the wild ones in their native country. \n\nBut I get what you mean. Although my INFP BF loves animals as pets, he also has tension with mass farming and would go vegan if burgers weren't so damn tasty. 
1	But cats leave when they want
1	Dogs and cats lived with us for much of human civilization, they evolved to survive and thrive in our society, they would die in the wild. It's also mutually beneficial for us to be companions, they get a great home and don't have to worry about starving and we get pest control such as Rat terriers, cats, which helped stop plagues, as well as help with our hunting such as bloodhounds and tracking dogs and warnings from outside dangers.
8	Are there any Infps in Law?	I value justice and other thigs that seem to work with the job, I'm just wondering whether I should work as a Lawyer or whether that is too much for an infp
2	Kerry is said to ne INFP.  He has the vocabulary and is boring thank goodness.  \n\nJust perhaps soak up the ethical dillema part and how much you would valye money or your time.\n\nYou could help a lot of people.
1	Hello!! I am almost finishing my Law Bachelor. I think I wouldnt be a good lawyer, too much pressure for me. But I found two fields I enjoy and I hope to work for an ngo or something üòä
15	What do INFP like in sex? Any advise for your kindred spirit ENFP.	ENFP (F25) here I'm in a relationship with an INFP (M22) and I'm learning everyday how to love him more.\n\nI known media tends to chat about the difference between men and women in bed, and from this women can box men into a single category. Shut off from emotions, just want sex all the time, lazy in relationships but dominant in bed etc\n\nI know this isn't true for all men. And I'd like to learn more on how an INFP male is with sex. If there even IS a difference. \n\nBeing highly emotional and introverted creatures, do you like being pursued? Do you like connecting first? These are just examples. Please share what you like.
11	Pleasing our partner always comes first. We are really attentive listeners. Talk to him about what you like and he will try to fulfill all your wishes. We also tend to have a kinky side. ;)
10	I like connecting first on an emotional level. Once the connection is made I'm happy to try and please my partner as much as possible. There are very few things I wouldn't do to please them. \nFor me personally, kissing is the most erotic part with someone I love. 
2	Just here to say ENFP's are awesoooooome. My daughter and two of my favorite cousins (from both sides of fam) are ENFP (all took the test), and we all agreed if they were all together anywhere it would be the brightest, happiest place on the planet. I know people like to be around INFP's for the most part, but damn, ENFP's are veritable nuclear power plants of positive energy and happiness! 
1	[deleted]
1	I like pleasing my partner first, like someone else said. I want to make sure my partner gets off first or gets a chance to. And I won‚Äôt feel satisfied until they do. But I think everyone is different when it comes to what we like about sex even among INFPs.
4	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 12	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
5	Does anyone else sort of enjoy debating or stirring the pot so to speak?\n\nI know most INFPs avoid conflict. But I like debating with people that I think are wrong. If someone is spreading lies or is misguided, I like putting them in their place. 
2	The sale I'm promoting is almost over and only one person made a purchase. I didn't make a profit, so I failed. Should I just set up a table outside to sell these? I can't think of a faster way to make funds to expand the variety of designs to sell.
14	hello here is a ‚Äúpoem‚Äù or story or something I wrote, I think maybe just maybe some INFP friends can relate to my words (it‚Äôs about early childhood/adolescence in a toxic home)	i learned early on to forgive and forget,\n\nbecause i lived in an environment where that was my only option.\n\nthere was no escape from the horrors i felt,\n\nthe horrors i've repressed and let go of\n\nin order to allow myself the healing and growth i so much deserve.\n\nwhat i've wanted more than anything from this lifetime\n\nwas to be listened to,\n\nwas to be the one people noticed,\n\nnoticing my pain, and struggle, and anxiety from a very young age.\n\ni learned from a young age that i am not in the spotlight,\n\nbecause if i ever was in the spotlight it became my fault,\n\nit's my fault that they fought,\n\nit's a child's fault that two grown adults can't learn what compassion and love means.\n\ndo you realize how silly that sounds?\n\ni wasn't even capable of rational thought,\n\nbut it's my fault.\n\nsorry for being that burden, i guess.\n\ni wasn't asked to be brought into this world,\n\nand i definitely didn't ask to grow up in a home that didn't support me,\n\nor teach me what love was supposed to feel like.\n\nthese are all things, in my now 19 years of life,\n\nthat i have been forced to learn on my own.\n\nhow to love\n\nhow to accept the love of others\n\nhow to believe in myself\n\nhow to stay positive when everything around me falls apart\n\nhow to force myself out of my anxious tendencies,\n\nand teach myself that people can be trusted.\n\ni grew up in a home that taught me:\n\n	-people are not trustworthy. they lie, even when you least expect them to. and it makes it even more sick when they turn a lie into words of love to attempt and cover their ass.\n	-love is a sacred and delicate part of living, but many people have lost touch with love. they no longer see the best in people, and they live their lives in blame and resentment. these people are capable of love, but they have been out of contact with it for so long--it could take just as long to prove to them love does exist here on planet earth--and it exists inside of them.\n	-silence is better than speaking up and not being heard, or speaking up and being shot down. you are safe in silence. silence will not hurt you. being alone with your own thoughts is safer than what you will ever feel around your family.\n	-music will become a grand escape for you, and it will follow you to the grave. music will drown out the hate in your home, and take you far away. you will listen to music constantly, every day, as much as possible, because it is the only escape you have from your home.\n	-family isn't important. blood means absolutely nothing when the people you are around don't make you feel safe, loved, or even seen.\n	-physical support is important, but emotional support is even more important than that, and you will never learn how to control, or discuss emotions because you have learned to be silenced in fear of others and that mental illness in your home is completely overlooked.\n\n\nthese are only the surface thoughts\n\ni learned from a young age to forget every day i was alive\n\nbecause it didn't feel like living\n\nit felt like breathing polluted air\n\nbut being forced to keep your mouth shut after the inhale\n\ni learned to let go and forget everything\n\nbecause it wasn't my life,\n\nit wasn't about me\n\nand why would i choose to remember a life i didn't even get to live?\n\nwhy remember the violence when it wasn't me who caused it,\n\nor experienced it.\n\nit was always about them.\n\nmy first 15 years of life were entirely about them,\n\nand their issues,\n\nand when you choose to have children that's not how it should be.\n\nit should be about the well-being and development of each kid,\n\nindividually,\n\nfocused and strong.\n\ni never got to experience a life of my own,\n\nand that leads me to now,\n\nand my desire to do everything,\n\nand be with everyone,\n\nand see it all.\n\nbecause i know the world can be a good place,\n\nand i know i can trust others,\n\nbut i have to completely re-wire my brain,\n\ninto believing that this life isn't going to hurt me,\n\nthat people will protect me,\n\nthat i will always be safe.\n\ni have to know.\n\n¬†
1	I'm a talent scout, can I post this on my website?   \nkidding :) 
19	22 male right here. I hate to admit it, but I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before. I haven‚Äôt even as much as kissed a girl.	I‚Äôm going to college in the fall, and I‚Äôm going to actually make an effort to pursue girls. I‚Äôve been on a couple dates with one girl, and that‚Äôs only because she asked me out. I was very nervous around her, and I didn‚Äôt know how to be myself. Any dating advice? Any tips would be great. 
10	Confidence is the main factor.\n\nYou don't have to be arrogant, or a tough guy, or any of that other macho shit.\n\n\nFor a date.....\nJust have an aire of confidence about you. That can look like, You're confident in who you are. You're confident you are attracted to this woman. Oooooh!!!!!! Most importantly!!!!! Be confident she's at least attracted to you physically. \n\n\nThe rest of the time. Be confident in who you are. You don't need lines. You don't need a whole lot of anything really. Just confidence. \n\nFor example. Let's say you like  playing Pokemon Go. \nSome woman comes up and asks you. "Are you seriously playing Pokemon Go?"\n\nLook her in the eyes, let your enjoyment of the game come out in a big shit eating grin and say "Hell yeah I am!"\n\nThen from there, maybe ask if she wants to try.\n\nIf she says no, just say, "Alright then! You never know what you're missing until you try it!"\n\nThat right there is a type of confidence. It's going to take some experimenting with your unique personality and interests, etc\n\nDo not sell yourself short. There's going to be a variety of girls there. You will find plenty who you will jive with. Rest assured! You'll know the ones you really like and would be good for you. Don't be afraid to approach any woman you're interested in. Some will say no....but hell,\n\nWhen you were little and asked your mom for a cookie, sometimes she said no. Did that ever stop you from asking again later? Did you decide to give up on ever getting a cookie?  I doubt it.\n\nSame concept. Good luck man! You got this!\n\n
4	26 male. All of the above.\n\nEdit: except being on a date. I thought I was once, but when I asked if she wanted to meet up again, she answered "Oh, that was supposed to be a date?"\n\n:(
3	Confidence, women are attracted to confidence. Fake it if you have to or be a little cocky. Also listen and ask questions, most women like talking about themselves.
2	I second the confidence advice. Just pretend you know what you're doing. Be yourself, but also not yourself since who you are nervous. Be a more confident version of yourself. It's okay if you still act weird, just don't be scared of her. They are human as well. If you act nervous she is going to be nervous as well. Just don't be arrogant or too cocky. But treat her like you don't care if she ends up liking you or not. If she likes you good, if not there are plenty of women out there. It's kind of why they say women love assholes. Because assholes just dgaf, and so should you.
2	Same, even though Im only 18, almost everyone I know except for two friends have, and they are far more likely than I to do it in the near future.
2	"never been in a relationship"\n\n"never kissed a girl"\n\nNot a big deal.
1	23 was a semi-not totally shitty year.  Um, I worked with a guy's mom who I'd consider an acquaintance.  I was like "dayang your like kinda um not sure blah blah¬´ and she was like "blah blah on the contrary" and like a month later like not sure this and that, she invited me for um this or that.  It was kinda like that but um, you realiE ya um thats just like drooping out and it was ON.\n\nJust like well, dont stress it and don't be so hard on yourself.  10 years later well, June was...........surreal as heck and well don't take anyone for granted and just like well.....You may run into someone from now and then that you might...find intriquing?  But it's kinda fun throwing yourself out there noticibg that pique as well.  Don't get whiney and enjoy the ride.  Romance is severely underrepresented in the world today.  But if they seem to good to be true do watch your own back.  I suggest just getting involved in as much stuff as you can, assuring yourself adaquate downtime.  Do what you do want to do.... \n\nGodspeed
3	People here who played Fallout 4 (Far Harbour): DiMA an INFP?	Usually I'm not one to try and type other people (or game characters), but after doing a couple of missions involving DiMA in Fallout 4 GOTY, I really think he resonates a lot with me, and as a result could also be closest to an INFP by the MBTI. Does anyone else in this community who has played the game think this as well?\n\nI reckon he might be INFP due to his calm nature, the fact that he created a personality of his own (past experience > programming) ability to assist whoever he can, views on expressing individuality, feirce anti-conflict views/ neutrality, and his planning involving every contingency (in regards to the groups on the island wanting to destroy eachother)
2	You say ruminations like it's a bad thing....	Ruminators of the world, unite.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh yes......\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_0t3lNPeOKY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0t3lNPeOKY)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPLoJ9q2H0A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPLoJ9q2H0A)
5	A question for you	Hi! I'll get right to it. I am an INTJ (in case that is helpful for your assessment of my question) hoping to find some answers here. I have a friend who is an INFP who I know feels very close to me, but I admit I don't feel quite as close to. They are incredibly open with me and frequently come to talk about various things. I am always attentative and make sure to listen and I know they appreciate that.\n\nMy problem I suppose is that I don't feel that courtesy is returned. I am constantly reminding them of something I had said previously that they don't remember that could've saved them from trouble or something that they forgot about me that resulted in some misunderstandings, etc etc. Of course I don't expect them to remember everything, but they don't remember anything! I had even confronted them about this and they admitted that they swear they are listening to me but just immediately forget everything I said after the conversation ends. This makes me feel a bit stupid honestly for ever sharing anything and devalued. They say they can't help it, but that they'll try to do better which I am open to, but honestly am not really expecting much.\n\nI know I am applying my own personal belief on them which may be inapplicable for this situation. That is, if you were truly listening, and not just hearing what I was saying, you would at least have some recollection of the words or the emotion or anything of that time. I'm not sure.  \n\nIs this a problem you face? Is there something I'm missing here or not understanding? Please help me understand what is going on. \n\n
1	Hi OP! I am wondering how your friend‚Äòs behaviour makes you feel exactly? You say that it is not a very close friendship on your side. So does it frustrate you on an interpersonal level that they don‚Äòt pay attention or is it already one of the reasons why you don‚Äòt want to take the friendship one step further? Or does it frustrate you because your friend - in consequence to forgetting what you said - commits the ‚Äûsame mistakes‚Äú repeatedly?\nI am INFP but I had a similar experience with an INFJ friend of mine (we are very close), but it was the other way round. He admitted that he is not good at remembering personal facts, because it is just not his particular talent. So I would not attach too much bad intent to your friend‚Äòs forgetfulness. 
1	[deleted]
1	Have you thought about, that maybe they don't really care? The behavior could indicate that they want to be nice to you and listen, but aren't really present mentally because they're either bored or very possibly could even be holding something against you.\nI recommend talking to them about what's up, but try and not sound confrontational and attacking cause that might cause them to close off. Which idk if you want that or not. Hope it gets solved for you two. 
14	Problems with expressing own opinions	Apparently one of INFPs traits is that they can talk about something they're passionate about for hours. But I seem to not possess that skill. I can't formulate thoughts why I liked particular movie, why I like this song or band, why I like doing something or why I like someone, let alone write or talk about it.\n\nAs an example, when it comes to movies my recommendations usually look like this: "It was great, X played well, cinematography was brilliant". It kinda works for blockbusters but it's never enough for those movies with little bit more depth to them. I always try to read couple of reviews in hope that someone more or less captured my thoughts to use that in conversation, but it still doesn't feel like it comes from me. I can even point that I disagree with something but then can't really say why.\n\nAnyone found some good way to improve on that field? 
5	Its kind of a skill you have to practice in order to have a coherent opinion. Multiple times I have written stuff down that sounded aight in my mind but like rambling on paper. Maybe focus on a specific aspect of something, like one character you like and their traits. Breaking stuff up into chunks REALLY helps. Then you can go and move on to bigger things, like the themes of the movie and how the character you like plays into said movie. I hope this helps!
3	Omg yes. I also have the same problem. I was like "hey I really like this show", he's like "why?", me:"*crickets* i can't really explain it, it's really weird but yeah it's awesome". Note this is me talking irl. I'm much better through writing as a medium of expression.
8	Right-Brain Melting	I've been tired\n\nThinking about flowers\n\nI'm great at farming but not nurturing\n\nReap them, take them\n\nOne petal is nothing, a rose is gorgeous\n\nI smell them sometimes and feel sick\n\nThey're refuse scents, utter garbage\n\nMaybe I like them so, from this notion\n\nI wish I was scentless, like he needed\n\nIt's like burning charcoal nipping at my head\n\nDoesn't hurt as jealousy does\n\nThinking of the last ring, got a brain-freeze\n\nHopefully the left side will freeze off\n\nNot bad folk but sleeping in a lake of fire\n\nAnd now I melt
697	Me with EVERY phonecall	
37	On a serious note, would you consider this social anxiety? And  if so, how do you guys go about it 
29	Add to this:\n\n- Doing voice exercises 15 minutes before the call\n\n- Repeating the mantra "I am confident, I am confident, I am confident"\n\n- Making sure I look presentable in the bathroom mirror so that I feel more confident\n\nAll of this for a phone call to my dad 
17	Work at a call center for 7 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelped me get over that fear.
14	Man.  I‚Äôve put my phone on airplane mode for days at a time.  I hate having to be available 24/7.
10	And don‚Äôt even get me started on FaceTime. 
6	Part of my PTSD came from making and receiving the worst calls of my life. Nobody believes me because calling is such an every day thing for so many. I'll only call my mom, brother, or bestie if I really need them.
11	Yes!!!!! I have a serious phone phobia. It feels just like the fear or heights!!!!
3	I really hate to make phone calls. Funny enough... when I receive phone calls at work people always point out how polite, understanding and helpful I have been.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmall talk via phone with friends or family  is a different thing though. I loathe it.
3	Same. While I still hate phone calls, I've adopted a coping strategy: force yourself to make the call quickly, before you have time to think about all the things that could go wrong.
3	This is amazing. I had to call my bank for weeks to figure out why they blocked my account with plenty of money in it and had made a list of things that I could need (e.g. my account number, personal info etc.). When I finally decided to call the lady immediately asked me for my sort code which was the one thing I did not have with me so I panicked, said "sorry" and shamefully hung up. Had to wait another week before I could find the courage to call again.
2	I can't say I hate phone calls now because I forced myself to making call for business I am more confident to pick up the calls.\nIt depends on the days if am tired I will not answer any messages or calls even if the world is going to end but if I have energy I can talk on phone for easy 20 min to an hour with people I know. \n\nWith strangers i just say weird things. Or will just pretend to be a child and tell them to call later üòÇ
2	I had to cover the front desk at my work for 2 months (before they found a new one) but it definitely forced me out of my comfort zone. It wasn't  so bad when I acknowledged that the caller and I didn't want to be on the phone longer than needed.\n\nUntil I get the people who see me as inferior since I wasn't the big boss :)))))
2	Then you actually make the phone call, it goes well, and you wonder why you paced around the whole room for about an hour before calling. Now you have to make another phone call. Rinse, repeat. 
2	This is the most common phobia of INFPs. 
2	Same. The more important the call the more I shit bricks before, during and after.
2	You mean?....there are more of me out there?
2	Weeks? Haha how about months... *cries*
0	I just don't understand this phobia, having grown up before cell phones existed.  It also seems weird that a generation who routinely post pictures of their nekkid bodies on the internet find it uncomfortable to talk to someone.^guess^I'm^old...
3	INFP (23/M). What do you do for a living? Do you love it? Why?	I recently lost my job.  This is a unique opportunity for me to change up my career and find something fulfilling, but I am a little lost on where to start.  Sometimes infinite possibilities make it impossible to make a choice.  \n\nWhat do you do?  Do you love it?  Why do you love it or hate it?\n\nLet's talk about life, purpose, and fulfillment.  \n\nLet's smile and wonder together.   
3	I‚Äôve done a lot! I‚Äôm 25/M. In college I worked at an auditorium on campus. After college I worked at a homeless day shelter in New Orleans through a volunteer program where I cleaned the public showers and distributed hygiene supplies. After that I did six months of debt collection (wasn‚Äôt a collector but still had to talk on the phone to people who we collected from and it was awful! Now I‚Äôm comfortable on the phone though). Then I was a housing case manager for mentally ill individuals who were homeless or recently housed. That wasn‚Äôt paying the bills so I got a second job at a jazz venue in the French Quarter selling tickets, selling merchandise, and running the hourly shows. Eventually I was working too much so I moved back to the Midwest and now I‚Äôm in admissions for a university in Chicago. It‚Äôs been a whirlwind but being open to new experiences as well as a plethora of opportunities to develop my people skills has helped me have some awesome times! \n\nLooking for work is tough, but at the end of the day, my work isn‚Äôt going to define me, the rest of my life is. Find somewhere you can develop professionally and personally. And I know this sounds like a no-brainer, but avoid any and all toxic work environments. I‚Äôve been lucky enough that most of my jobs have been with great management and coworkers. The ones that didn‚Äôt have support were difficult.\n\nGood luck!

1	I quit being a teacher because it was way too extroverted and overstimulating for an infp. It ultimately led to my decision to be childfree. Now studying to become a marine conservationist. 
1	I serve tables for a living, and i actually do enjoy it. I was raised in a loud, extroverted & traditional italian family, and so i learned* how to be extroverted. It takes effort, but when i come home tired with cash after making connections with people all day, i go to sleep happy that i wait tables. \n\nEDIT: But i am studying to be a professor of philosophy, so i guess i don‚Äôt love it enough to make a career out of it. 
1	Bottom of the barrel stockwork here (at least to me). Hope to get out of the 9-5 job system soon, or at least get to the point where I can work remotely while traveling (and eventually leave my current country). Not sure how that's going to happen, but I'm sure something will come of it.\n\nAfter that's been established, I suppose the phase of working on major personal projects may present itself (some of these require a bit of $; such as building a mobile off-grid home, setting up a large garden, various electronic projects, etc) as well as generally drifting about. 
7	Hey fellow INFPs, what's your love language? Curious to see if there any consistencies between us.	Hi all :-) I'm as interested in the 5 Love Languages as I am in MBTI, so I'm curious as to what your love languages are?\n\nI have taken the love languages test a few times and always score very highly on quality time and physical affection - however I think as I get older I value physical affection more and more. I am always the first one to hug and the last one to let go, and I even find that physical touch from someone I love is as energizing as spending some time alone to recharge. I also feel very drained and lonely after a longer period without physical affection.\n\nIn contrast, I place very little emphasis on gifts especially, and sometimes I unwittingly offend my friends who value gift-giving, since I'm always forgetting birthdays and never know the right gift to give.\n\nCan anyone else relate?
5	Words of affirmation
3	Words of affirmation for sure. I feel like this is going to be a pretty common theme for INFP haha. 
2	1 Quality time and 2 acts of service
2	Quality time first, acts of service second. \n\nI'd probably rank physical touch and words of affirmation last. Words don't mean much to me unless it's backed up. Even then I'm very awkward with compliments. Physical touch is ranked low because even though I love hugs, I have a hard time showing outwards affection through hugging. So I might adore a person but they'll never know. Thanks dad and stepmom for ruining me!!!! 
1	Quality time  and words of affirmation comes close second for me. I LOVE hugging people and small physical touches, so I‚Äôm surprised that didn‚Äôt come out higher. I also scored really low on gift giving... I hate doing it because it makes me feel like it‚Äôs compensating for something that I could just say!
1	words of affirmation and physical touch !
1	never done the test but i think iam big on physical touch and quality time too.
1	Acts of service and Quality time. 
1	Words > quality time > physical touch > acts of service > gifts. And yet I would say gift giving is a big thing for  me, I put a lot of thought and energy into it
-3	MBTI is a garbage system so you asking INFPs if they have a general love language is stupid because like 40% of the comments you'll receive will be by people who are mistyped
60	Not mine, but I think it fits here	
8	Beautiful hat, but how does this relate to INFPs?
2	I need this. 
1	Gasp! It's gorgeous <3
16	Hi extremely depressed intp here looking for friends here to relate and talk with	I'm jack I'm an INTP, if you just wanna talk in happy to listen or you wanna here about my depressing life feel free to ask me anything.\n\nYou INFPs are great people 
3	I'm a hybrid. Have you tried to just let go of what ails you? Believe it or not sometimes we are responsible for how we feel because we choose how to react. Maybe I'm telling you nothing new, but I find that when I dwell on something upsetting for too long (like today with a f!@#ing locked out iphone) it doesn't do you any good because it's out of your control.
2	Found this sub today. I'm glad there are other people with similar problems and perspectives. \n\nAnyway why are you depressed? Is there anything I can do to help?
2	From your personal experience what do you think makes INFPs different to INTPs?
2	sorry for spamming your thread on /r/intp. i have aspergers
1	Hi Jack 
1	do u have a discord? what are your hobbies?
1	Happy to hear your story. If I have something to personally add, I will.
1	Yep! Anything you feel you want to talk about.....
12	Ok INFPs name a Movie/TV Character you identify with the most or that you believe/know is an INFP?	I have always been a big fan of the Christopher Reeve superman character growing up, gave me personal courage at times I needed it most and felt the most different from my own family.\n\nUpdate: Wow!  I did not realize there were so many INFP characters/people in TV/Cinema thanks INFPeople for the posts keep it up, this is cool! 
7	Donnie Darko 
6	April Ludgate is my spirit animal.
7	Anne of Green Gables. I didn't know she or I was an INFP until a year or so after I watched the new Netflix adaptation. I actually cried and watched it 3 times because of how much I loved her character and how much I related to her, so imagine my delight after realizing we were both INFP!
4	I feel I can relate to the punisher (not det angry violent part). But have strong principles, want to help anyone in need. Silent in crowds and hate small talk. He seems like a cold guy, but are really a loving caring guy once he opens up. Just give him some time and he will open up. I‚Äôm somewhat the same. Not sure if it fits INFP but yeah.
4	The first one that came to my mind is Violet Parr, I‚Äôve always identified with her 
5	John Dorian in Scrubs
6	Belle from beauty and the beast\n
5	Not a tv character but the celebrity I identify with is Eddie Vedder
4	Chidi from The Good Place all the way
4	Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis Evangelion... I was a pretty fucked up kid at one point\n\nAlso Bojack Horseman, because I'm now a fucked up adult
3	Pam and Jim from The Office. On my good days I‚Äôm Jim but most of the time I‚Äôm Pam.
3	Lady Sibyl Crawley (Downton Abbey). Kind, caring, optimistic and a free spirit. She's the embodiment of authenticity and idealism and has a rebellious side. When I watched the show I instantly fell in love with her character.
3	Theodore from Her
3	Amelie. 
2	I'm going to add Brandon Heat of an anime called gungrave my buddy and I used to watch during our awkward teen years... mafioso crime member whim rarely speaks but always keeps a group of close friends and stays friends with them for years.  He becomes so good at protect his friends almost batman stylee he quickly becomes the frontrunner right hand gunamn to the mafias top boss.
2	Tina Belcher. Not sure if she's an INFP but I really like her and she reminds me of me...a little. \n\nOr maybe she's the person i wanna be. :p
2	Iggy in Igby Goes Down. Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation, Watashi from Tatami Galaxy, and Albert from I <3 Huckabees
2	Jack sparrow
2	Dick, Championship Vinyl employee from High Fidelity, played by Todd Louiso.
2	Matt Murdock aka Daredevil. I'm not sure if he's an INFP but I relate to him a lot. 
2	Belle-Beauty and the Beast (1991 version mostly)\n\nAnd Sabrina Fairchild-from the 1954 Audrey Hepburn movie, Sabrina.\n
2	Bran from ASOIAF. How he gets dragged through the mud but still keeps his empathy for others. He has a quiet strength to him that I deeply long for. 
2	Takanashi Rikka from Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai q.q\ni dont know the exact reason why but she's waaayy too adorable
2	Sailor Moon! I don't know if she is an INFP but I like to imagine she is. She's a big softie, romantic and has a sense of justice and follows her morals. I'd love to find more characters who are INFP's
1	Oliver from Submarine!!! I feel like the girl version of him lol
1	- Doug Parker from the novel How to Talk to a Widower by Jonathan Tropper\n\n- Claire Robbins from the Starz mini-series Flesh and Bone
1	I liked the dragonball charecter when i was young
1	I'm surprised no one has mentioned a jedi
58	Found an old picture off a phone from high school, when I used to walk a lot more. Still always waiting for Spring.	
3	Home
6	Any good inspirational movies? Some of the movies that really move me are Good Will Hunting, A Beautiful Mind, Fight Club, and Forest Gump.	
3	American Beauty, Truman Show, Big Fish (Tim Burton version of Forest Gump),  Ink, Spirited Away
2	"Gattaka" is from the same era of movies, if you haven't watched it yet. very inspirational. \n\nAnd two more well known movies "requiem for a dream" and "into the wild" obviously but i bet you watched them :).
2	watch Gifted!! I never expected it to be so good. I watched it 2 times in just one day because I loved the dialogues
2	Interstellar
2	John Q, Larry Crown, The Last Samaurai, Warrior, Scent of a Woman 
1	Hunt for the wilderpeople
1	Elizabethtown, Cashback
1	The Green Mile..... near perfectly made movie \n\nAlso Back to the future 1 and 2. Marty is not technically an infp but he relys on his knowledge of future events to strenghten his parents and others relationnships and futures by any means available at times.
19	I always end up as my partner's therapist. What can I do?	I try and help people whenever I can and I ask for nothing in return. \n\nWhen I am with someone who is suffering emotionally I can't help but feel a "duty of care" to them and I end up turning into their therapist. The relationship usually becomes extremely unhealthy, ends and they end up hurting me in the process.\n\nWhat can I do, reddit?
5	I'm in no way an expert for relationships, but I have had a similar experience with a friend of mine so I definitely understand where you're coming from.\nIt's usually a very nice feeling being able to support someone and be there for them when they need it, but it can definitely be very draining also.\n\nWell, first off.. As much as you'd like to, playing that role can be very dangerous. Especially if that person is struggling a lot with mental problems, and most of the conversations are about their difficulties, which some might handle, but some might start to feel drained over time and feel like all of their effort is not doing anything and nothing is helping them. \nThat's why there are professionals out there, who are professionally trained to be that role. So id recommend that. \nIf that option is unavailable though, maybe try  looking at some self help stuff and show it to your partner, being there with them and doing stuff that might help them together. (If they have mental health problems, which is how I interpreted it, sorry if I'm wrong.)\n\nI'd also highly recommend openly communicating with your partner, open up about your thought and feelings, but also tell them that you're there for them and care about them. \nYes, opening up about your feelings and how its all affecting you can be very hard and you might feel guilty about it, but you matter too, and you shouldn't forget that. A healthy relationship should be rather balanced, and you both should support each other. \n\nPlease be patient and remain supportive with your partner, and try to talk it out. If you're both willing to work it out, then it'll eventually work out, even if it might be hard. \nI hope it goes well for you and your partner. 
4	Solution:\n\nDate people who don't put their entire emotional burden onto one person (you).
3	relationships are two way streets. 'Asking for nothing in return' can come across in such a way that the other person feels unneeded/unwanted, your not actually interested in them. This could also end up with you kind of putting them on a pedestal, which some may actually regret. \n\nBeing a martyr in a relationship doesn't work long term for that relationship.
2	Work on you, relationships are huge mirrors in our faces, some of us do have this vibe, this healing vibe, and often we can provide some insight which is great, but what ends up happening we either attract sick people who can be manipulating or malignant, or become less attractive because instead of being a mate, we are more like a friend, in the end, I guess its more about setting boundaries, and balancing ourselves more. 
2	Before you reply to someone, take a minute to think the situation through. I assume you're not a licensed therapist, so there's only so much you can do. You need to create boundaries, for example - letting them know that while you understand you don't have the capability to provide sound advice and refer them to some resources. It's not just for you, but also for the other person so they get professional advice. The last thing you want to do is give uninformed opinions that hurt everyone in the end.\n\nThink of like this, when someone tells you about symptoms you tell them to go to a doctor, it's a similar thing.
1	Yikes, I used to struggle with this too :c I know it‚Äôs probably a natural reaction, but do your best to observe yourself nonjudgmentally. When your partner opens up about a feeling or an experience, how do you tend to respond? It might even help to record your response in a journal so you can better catch the patterns over time. \n\nThere are multiple ways to respond, we just like to stick with what we know best! By simply rephrasing statements and pausing before you respond, you can completely turn this dynamic around ‚ù§Ô∏è
1	You have overcome the need to be with someone who needs your help. You don't have to date someone who needs you as their therapist. Partner is supposed to be your equal, not your problem/burden. Don't look for someone who will become your 'project' to work on and improve. It will always fail your expectations and they are under immense pressure to change immediately.
1	Maybe you can stop helping people? It might be that simple. "Choose the people you surround yourself with" could be valid here.. Maybe you have a tendency to meet people who are like that? Could it be that you might not have anything else to offer in any friend-like relationship? Perhaps you need to give some time to reflect a little bit on yourself.
129	Hi I‚Äôm new, I‚Äôm INFP and have always had a thing for pretty skies but after browsing this sub it seems like everyone else here does too :)	
3	Like impressionist painting!
2	So beautiful!
16	As an infp... do u have the same problem?	Would like to know if Infps have this problem of when starting to get to know someone, sometimes act ‚Äòtoo close‚Äô like how you would with others. For example, using too informal ways of talking to the other party because don‚Äôt want to make is very awkward with one another then realising OH did i act too close? \nJust curious!! 
6	I scare women away all the time when I like them because I mind-meld with them like the Gelflings in the Dark Crystal.  Even the deep girls I freak out.  It sucks. Welcome to my world.  Lol.  I am learning to chill and not give my heart away so quickly because I just get hurt too much.
3	Yes, I can do this. I've learned that formalities and rapport are there for a reason! and to be mindful. Still I often goof. :/ I'm very much a work in progress and working hard on it. 
3	Hmmmm... Maybe?\nI personally rather try and "force" myself to act informal and friendly with the person, even if I'd rather be very polite and it makes me slightly anxious. So, id say it's actually the opposite for me, I guess? Since my worries then are both "Am I being friendly and likeable enough?" while also being "Am I acting too close with the person?" just like you are.\n\nBut then again I'm very dumb when it comes to social interactions, so take it as you will lmfao. 
1	Honestly I hate small talk to I tend to skip straight to real talk so... Yes, I do I suppose xD
1	Oh yeah. Most definitely. I sadly tend to be too friendly and therefore ‚Äúinformal‚Äù to even my teachers, so far no one has said anything but I do feel a little weird with myself after the conversation is over. So yes, I can definitely relate to this issue very much
3	Curious: What kind of people do you generally find are attracted to you?	I'm thinking of asking the INFJs this, too, since the types are so often confused.\n\nI wanted to see if there were any patterns, because I've noticed consistently throughout my life that I end up around the same kind of people whether friends or romantic. They are always people you'd describe as "intense", for better or worse. On the better end of the spectrum, I've had a lot of great friends with very strong personalities who were either creative or very outspoken. I've dated a lot of very passionate artist types, like actors or musicians. On the darker side, I've been with a lot of people who, in retrospect, treated me just awfully because they could only see what they wanted and didn't care about boundaries. When I was younger and more accepting of bad behavior, a roommate told me that I always ended up dating "the male equivalent of Regina from Mean Girls" because I was too mellow and would put up with it when no one else would.\n\nAny thoughts on this? Any of you have similar experiences.
4	I've dated someone who was very different from me. She was outgoing and just had to be known by everyone when she entered a room. It seemed at first to be cool but eventually i realized she was very controlling and just didnt care too much about what I wanted as long as I knew what she wanted. I guess what I am trying to say is that when it comes to looking for a partner I tend to look towards people who can do the things I can't. 
2	My boyfriend might move back home	I'm 28. He's 23 going on 24. He's going to graduate this semester and is thinking of moving back home. I feel...hurt, but I don't want to be selfish about it because that's wrong. I like the closeness that we share emotionally and physically, and I'm going miss that. I'm an infp, and I have one other friend and that's about it. I just...i don't know. 
1	Can you say more?  What dont you actually know? Or better yet share what you do know.
1	Sounds like your bugger problem is fear more than anything.  The upside is its 2019.  Theres a million ways to stay in touch and even better theres plenty of other people out there and adventures for you to get into.  If you get to wound it it could possibly makes his move harder and feel bad that hes hurting you to do it.  Its a tough spot but one that will teach you both about how to agree.  And then after who knows.  But no matter what remember to tell yourself what ever it is it will be ok.
5	I found what works for me to develop and enjoy using functions	Fi\nMessages (example: just because you can aay something doesn't mean you should)\nRules\n\nNe\nCombinations\nBrainstorming\nMeanings\nExploration (example: varieties, or asking questions like what, how and why)\nSummaries\nMnemonics \n\nSi\nReading (Learning- gaining knowledge)\nYoga (Relaxing)\nKeyboard (Music- especially nostalgic)\n\nInstructions\nCheckpoints (mini goals)\n\nI will add to this overtime
1	After realising the connection between Fi and Messages I feel almost certain Bob Marlet's personality was like that of the infp description
4	INFP is a curse.	I accept my personality for who I am and I would never change it.\n\nI'm a 17M and quite frankly hate myself at the moment. INFP is one of, if not the worst personality types for having a career and I understand why. Years ago when I started secondary school I found a deep interest in Science, my granddad was a dentist and my brother and sister both did scientific subjects. I had a deep fascination with science because of all the fascinating and wonderful things you can learn like how animals changed over thousands and thousand of years to specialise, and how things like acid where used melt bodies to hide them. I've now resized my fascination was with the fantasy of science and not the science itself. \n\nNext year I'm taking a gap year because I don't know what to do. I'm doing Chemistry, Biology and Welsh baccalaureate (Mandatory subject in Wales). I feel completely exhausted at looking at careers and am feeling depressed as time becomes thinner. I have no idea what I want to do!\n\nI don't want  to go to university and get into thousand of ¬£¬£¬£ in debt. I could do learn a trade like plumbing but I have no ambition in plumbing whatsoever. I'm crippled by my own personality and don't know what to do.\n\nIf you could give your opinion or offer ideas I'd greatly appreciate it. Also thank you for reading I really wanted to tell someone.
9	It is a curse and it isn't a curse. I've had jobs ranging from fast food to retail to construction to my current career of 25 years - DBA, CAD Admin, SPOC & SME for a fortune 100. The problem is that all jobs are in many ways soul sucking and mundane. The INFP's advantage is that 'we' can weave meaningful layers into anything we do. I think of all the types we have the most capacity to truly enjoy what we're doing - if framed and considered correctly. 
5	Yeah they all say that but every personality has its downs and ups. 
2	I'm the same right now. 20(M) and in a gap year after my first year at uni. I'm learning programming and math (more math at this point, because fundamentals) and after pondering the same question for about 5 years I've learned the best practice for me: since I know there will always be a boring side of working anywhere, I am aiming for the highest paying job markets and doing my best to go through the hardships, because then... it will be worth it. Furthermore, the field I've chosen has a high dynamic and isn't something that involves repetitive tasks from day one to 30 years later. I hope this story helps\n
2	First of all, life itself is both a gift and a curse for everyone. Second, nobody really ever ‚Äúknows‚Äù what they want to do with their lives that‚Äôs deadened to demanding capitalistic influence. But! You can make a good guess at what you do wanna do based off of things you like/excel at, and if you‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôll follow those things so that you don‚Äôt grow up working a job you absolutely hate. Take ‚Äúthe long‚Äù way. The unconventional way that rings true to you, despite how much it might cost. You can die with all the money in the world, or owe the world everything but either way you‚Äôre gonna die, and when you do, you‚Äôll either regret choosing a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù career or relish in doing what you wanted. 
5	I'm in a loop	This is probably gonna sound a lot like stupid teen drama, I mean it is stupid teen drama, but I want it to end and I don't know how.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I go out with 4 other people.  \n\nOne of them is a complete asshole that just has no concept of the fact that people are different and not everyone acts like him. \n\nwhenever I say that I'm skipping a night out, because I just want some time to myself, he goes on this ignorant rant about how "He just doesn't understand what I do all day that I have to skip going out. How am I not bored being at home. That's so miserable. You're miserable."\n\nMeanwhile when I do go out, I never talk to him because he spands the whole god damn night out on his phone playing games.\n\nAnd there's 2 other people who just blindly follow him like sheep. whatever he says or does, they say and do also. They start calling people miserable, they play the game with him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the solution seems pretty obvious right? Just stop going out with them. Here's the thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 4th person is the closest thing I have to a best friend.\n\nHe's the only person I can talk with about literally anything. Shows, Movies, Politics, Sate of the country, State of the world, Comics, Books, Events, History, School, Games, Music etc. etc. \n\nwe have a lot of things in common, we like a bunch of similar things, but there's enough different about us that makes the friendship fun. I give him music and comic recommendations, he teaches me about history or the shows he's watching.\n\nBut of course, whenever we talk about literally anything that isn't fucking sports or the dumbass game they're playing they all us "Miserable"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I know for a fact that if I were to leave and ask him to leave with me, he probably wouldn't do it. He's been going out with them  since they were kids, and I've been going out with them for like 3 years. \n\nI can't just ask him to drop such a long friendship with these people, especially because of the fact that he at least has the touchstone of talking about sports with them to the point where he isn't completely annoyed or exhausted by their pretentiousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhat do I do. I desperately want to leave, but I don't want to sacrifice a best friend while doing it. 
4	It‚Äôs totally ok for you to leave the group, yet still have a friendship with him. Good luck.
3	Invite the one real friend to hang out. Not the others. And, tbh, if you don't like the other guys, don't chill with them. There's 6 billion people on the planet; you can find better friends then someone who just puts down everything and everyone.
2	Hang out separately with #4 he's probably an Introvert and secretly as frustrated as you are. \n\nThen prepare for your insecure bad guy to go ballistic and accuse you of anything he can to try and yank your chain. On thinking about it, you might be better off just breaking off with 3 musketeers  completely for now. I know a person like that who's a narcissist, and they can get really ugly when they see their kingdom threatened. \n
3	Is there anything in your life that you are productive at, and it doesn‚Äôt require much motivation on your part? I really need a creative outlet of some sort. I used to love drawing, but it bores me tremendously.	
8	grinding in videos game... and thats about it!
2	I really enjoy knitting and crochet. 
2	I like playing Smash Bros. I make up all these match up lists for my favorite character such as advantages/disadvantages, playstyle, and even notes on what to improve on and how to get better. Yet I always procrastinate on my homework lmao
1	coloring,  baking, simple gardening, making jewelry (if you're into that. You can make simple stuff!), I make collages with magazines, glitter glue, paint, pens and random textures/photos i like. 
1	read books
1	Listening to Music literally all day 
2	Finding a career	Hey friends! I'm currently struggling with finding the right path. I'm 18 and just graduated high school. I actually graduated late. How did you find a career path that fits you? What do you do? Why do you like it? I'm interested in hearing your stories! 
3	I'm currently working as a graphic designer. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do career wise, I initially studied Urban Planning in Uni and after 2 years of that couldn't stand it anymore, dropped out and started working at a fish and chips shop. I've always loved drawing and messing around with arts, while I was in Uni I also did some freelance graphic design work and realised that I really loved the combination of creativity and problem solving, that's how I decided to go back to Uni and study design, and follow this career path.\n\nI think the key is to just get out there and experience as many things as possible, start working - even if it's just in hospitality and retail, meet different people from all different backgrounds and talk to them about what they do. It's hard when you're so young to find the one thing that gives you purpose in life, but one fact that always makes me see the bigger picture is that on average people end up changing jobs up to 12 times in their lifetime, so don't stress about what path you take, just approach it with enthusiasm, curiosity and an eagerness to learn, and if it turns out to not be the right path don't beat yourself up over it - every path is an adventure and an invaluable life experience. 
1	Hi! I‚Äôm a dancer currently and like what I do. I get to go in whenever I want, set my own prices and rules of what I offer. I get to express myself in an art form. Through the outfits I wear, person I portray myself as and performing on stage. You get the assholes every once in awhile, but if you pick a good club with doormen that watch out for you, it can be a great way to save up money. 
1	Hi! I was just like you when I was 18. I'm now 30 and still not sure what I want to do when I grow up (haha), but at the very least I'm doing very well in my current career path and now work in HR at a well known tech company. \n\nI fell into HR by chance which isn't a natural fit but there are parts that I idealized and thus have done well i.e. helping people. I've had several roles within HR at this point; it still isn't the perfect fit as I burn out having to be so extroverted at work, so I'm plotting a career move to something more creative, such as UX design. I like HR enough to stick with it for several years, but because it isn't my true life passion I get burnt out after a couple years and need to switch to a different part of HR each time. I'm targeting UX because I'm finding that I need a creative outlet.\n\nMy advice based upon my personal experience would be to find something that you can in some way connect to. Speaking for myself, I could have never stuck with it if there wasn't something about it that I could idealize. It's taken me 8 years of working to understand how I can be productive and happy at the same time.\n\nMy last pieces of advice - always keep the faith and stay focused. The ones who get ahead are the ones who never gave up! #INFPthought
67	shadows on a fence, golden hour	
2	I love this pic. It's like something that could have occurred in any era, in any place. Renaissance painters probably used to observe things like this.
2	That's indescribable!
31	Strong Fi not useful in "real world" rant.	It's Sunday night and I'm watching some sappy teenage romance. I'm feeling all sort of insane emotions from this movie to the core of my bones. I will never able to describe the feelings that I'm feeling while watching this melodramatic romance. Close to no one that I know of will feel that intensely about some movie. It is an astonishing ability that I have and I'm sure you, other INFP, feel the same. \n\nI'm just so frustrated that this ability is pretty much garbage, no use to the "real world." It doesn't help me to make money, get a better career, and just making things happen in real life. I'm just banging my head on the table. I wish this intense feeling would be of use for some more productive things. I guess that's probably one of the biggest frustration for INFPs. \n\nI'm not saying that having empathy and having intense emotions is bad, just not helping me as a person in this world. I love being myself, being an INFP, but it is so hard to live in this world that wasn't made of rainbows and unicorns. Some days I wish I was like one of my ISTJ or INTJ friend. They can just get shit done. What are some of your thoughts?
22	Fi is an underdog function when it comes to the "real world", it's true. It's not the most practical, and can often be a detriment to efficiency and exactness. BUT when you're really feeling something, and talk about your reasons for liking that movie, or wanting to do that career dream of yours, it really does show-- to both you and others. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFi is THE function when it comes to personal involvement. You're going to be worse than most people at most things, but you bet your booty that you'll be one of the best at what really resonates with you. Fi is the toughness that keeps you committed to what you believe in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI once read it from someone that having lead Fi is like starting off life with a little bit of a lower level than others, but having the benefit a little bit of a higher overall level cap. When you can give Fi a little something to work with (read: Te), you can do a LOT. 
11	Love your post, and I relate more than you can imagine. I have same experiences with some movies, particularly John Hughes movies. Would not be surprised if INFPs all worship him. Ha.\n\nBut in terms of our abilities in the workforce, or lack therof, I can relate there too. In the company I work for, I had previously worked in web content and SEO. Good safe zone INFP work. But since last March, I was handed paid social media marketing. It has proven to be a nightmare for me. I love social media, I even like setting up campaigns and seeing how they perform. But it is also problematic for a few reasons. First, I don't care very much for the company I work for, or the overall industry we are in. That is an issue for us. Second, since I am running campaigns for many biz units, it is really complicated. Analyzing data, working with the budgets, reaching out to groups for assets, lots of meetings....I am in INFP hell and to be honest, failing very quickly. I hate this position and my life right now and heading for the exit as quickly as I can. Will be tricky, there is nowhere to really transfer with my current company, so looking outside. \n\nBut I have to tell you, I am scared shitless. On one hand- I am no spring chicken, 47 with wife and kids to support. Next job I take will probably will be for less money, at least initially. Its just an uncomfortable I find myself right now. \n\nBut having said that, I am also incredibly excited to find a new career role in line with our INFP sensibilities. Like, very, very excited. Reading INFP career pages bring me so much comfort, lol\n\nLike this one:\nhttps://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/best-careers-for-infp-personalities\n\nI just took the MBTI two weeks ago, so still sorting through all this, but to realize now why i am so unhappy in my current role has really been a tremendous relief. I see some of the careers that are good for us, and I agree with most all of them. Just visualizing myself in any of these roles brings me so much hope and anticipation! \n\nBut to your post, yes, I understand 100%. Would you mind looking at that link and letting me know your thoughts, or if any of those look good? Thanks.
10	Alright I have to say this because I keep seeing this as a recurring theme in this sub. Fi does not cause intense emotions. And if you keep telling yourself it does, you end up abandoning responsibility towards keeping your own emotions in check because it's just Fi. Plenty of INFPs are out there doing kick-ass things with their life regardless of their cognitive functions. You're just as capable as any other type.
4	I‚Äôm a singer/songwriter, and I love my ability to feel shit.  I love photography and how a sunset makes me feel.  I want to capture life in an image.  I love drawing portraits and wish I had more time to pursue the arts.  \n\nAs an uber driver I love playing therapist and having deep talks with people one on one.\n\nI love crying to It‚Äôs A Wonderful Life and other movies.  I am empathetic and would love acting, film making and the like.\n\nThere‚Äôs purpose for us, yet we live in a world molded by sentinel types who like walls and procedures.  I hated school and the institution as it is set up.\n\nPursue your art and don‚Äôt give up.
3	Yep, 100% relate- even despite having "real world success" - you have captured NFP experience brilliantly. I am an enneagram 935, so I have a strong sense of competence, but I am STILL an NF through and through. And I will not pretend I am a natural at practical stuff. My strengths are abstract and empathy/feeling oriented. It has taken me a VERY long time to be comfortable in the real world, as well as figuring out how to use my gifts. This is standard for an NF who is strong in Fi. We have very particular and very high standards for what we are seeking. It's just the way it goes. Developing other functions \*does not\* make our Fi go away. Our other functions \*support\* our Fi in seeking what it can't help but seek. \n\nI don't agree with other posters who can't relate, I think if you refuse to relate on some level, or think being impractical is an 'excuse' you are \*definitely\* not an NFP. There are a lot of people who type infp who are sfj, sfp and nfj. Sometimes I am sick and tired of seeing infps shamed for not acting like other types. Simply because these people are obviously not NFs. No NF would see being a standard NF as "an excuse". Our Sensing and Thinking are our last functions to develop, it's not "bad" it takes us longer than other types to figure out our path. I see no shame in admitting that. 
2	sometimes I wonder if people have been born, or are born, with the perfect ability/talent for a job that does not exist in their lifetime or place.
1	The careers INFPs should avoid suggestions are funny to think about by the way. Sales manager...ROFLMFAO\n\nHELLLLZZZZ NO üòÇ
1	I also wanna be intj
1	The INFJ feeling is valuable, it's just that it's not generally recognized in an Extroverted society.  And let's face it, many of us have grown up learning this from our parents and others, sometimes being ridiculed, sometimes being set apart as 'special'. \n\nWell, guess what? A person who leads strongly with feeling can really be passionate about some things, sometimes things that others don't even see. It's like a super power. To me it's an ability to see when ideas are very important and I usually intuitively follow this, investigating those ideas and learning more. \n\nThere's a certain inner strength that comes from such intense scrutiny of what we think about. It allows me to be centered on the inside, even though I may be manic depressive on the outside. \n\nMaybe in another society I'd have been a witch doctor, but in this world I do things others can't even figure out how I do them. To them it's inexplicable, and with a track record of this, I've developed a lot of personal freedom if not monetary riches.  
1	dont think of it as a wasted ability just think of it as part of your personality
12	She's probably an INFP let's be honest.	
4	Well peanut butter and jelly does cheer me up too.
3	Groundhog Day, Family Man, Butterfly Effect	Okay! \n\nThe first two are two of my absolute favorite movies. I could talk about them and the theories behind them, life lessons/things to learn from them forever!!! Butterfly effect is also good! \n\nWhat if we could repeat a day over and over, growing until... or if we could relive something differently... or if we could make different choices...\n\nWhat are your thoughts?? \n\nAnd what if life is like the matrix or not real like we know it?

2	Make sure you check out the novel *The Fifteen Lives of Harry August* . Good luck! Oh another one completely different is Steven King's *11/22/63*. 
2	Check out About Time and Time Traveller's Wife;) I also love that topic. 
1	What is/are your love language(s)?	Words of affirmation\n\nPhysical touch \n\nGifts \n\nActs of service \n\nQuality time 
1	All of the above
47	Searched for this sub on a whim ‚ù§Ô∏è I've clearly found my people. Here's a sunset photo I took while in Greece this past summer.	
1	Very nice, I'm jealous. What locale? 
59	Any other INFPs have a super unfriendly/unapproachable resting face?	I've recently talked to quite a few of my close friends about our first impressions of one another and the common factor with most of my friend is that they thought I looked really unfriendly and unapproachable because of my facial expression. Some of them even thought I hated them before we met because I have such a serious face, which some described as angry and others just said it was disapproving. In reality it's just my default expression when I'm deep in thought which is almost always, and now my friends have gotten to know me they know I'm really one of the least serious people ever.\n\nCan anyone else relate?
26	Right here.\n\nI'm constantly called out for my major resting b\*\*\*\*h face, and/or a resting sad face (depends who you ask). Interestingly, though, I've been told I have an "innocent smile". 
16	Yeah, I‚Äôve been told ‚ÄúI thought you were a bitch before we ever spoke‚Äù quite a few times in my life. It always makes me sad because on the inside I have nothing but positive intentions. I love observing people and am interested in getting to know them, yet people interpret me as the complete opposite of how I feel just by looking at me. So, I try to overcompensate by having a giant smile and then it makes me worry that I‚Äôm coming off as fake. Also, people ask me ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù a lot because I tend to look sad even though I‚Äôm bubbly on the inside. I was once accused of staring a girl down in high school , but in reality I was just admiring her makeup lol 
3	Yep, that  definitely happens to me but I try to compensate it with the brightest smile that I can possible give, only with people that I know tho.
4	I have been told I have a resting concerned face a few times in my life haha 
3	Smiling hurts a lot when I don't mean it. I get bored easily and is always daydreaming or thinking and that's when my resting face comes out. I can try to smile if I'm talking to people, but they shouldn't expect a constant smile unless I am engaged in the conversation or a cute animal video is looping next to their face.
4	I have a resting sad face. I'm lost in happy thoughts and people come to me like is everything okay?
3	Yes I have resting asshole face, but that's just my face a blank stare. I don't get why I need to always look happy. But to be fair my most used facial expression is a "wtf?" look.
3	Only when I'm in an environment I don't want to be in.
3	Yes. One of my best friends said I was quite unapproachable, with a serious, angry face. She said that, and I quote, "I looked like I might bite."\n\nI genuinely think it's at least partly because I'm quite short-sighted, and was squinting a little bit all the time in order to see.
2	Yes, my ex told me her and other girls were afraid of me.   \nI actually got this angry face as a response to bullies, to keep fuckers away before they even try. Ages go by, now it is carved on to my face.  \n\n\nBizarrely is when i am not feeling okay, am in a hurricane of anxiety, people say that i have a "zen face". Probably cause i try to hide feels
2	Yes, it is seen like I'm flawed or a bomb against society. 
2	Everyone has told me I have a resting bitch face. I feel like their first impressions don't match how I was actually feeling at all, so that has me a bit worried... Lol
2	Maybe more of a clueless / "spaced out" look that tends towards being interpreted as sad. 
2	Yep. Apparently most people find me very intimidating until they get to know me lol 
2	Sometimes just listening to the people around me makes me smile like a stupid fucker
2	Proud resting bitch face ‚ù§Ô∏è
1	Yep. I'm a passed off looking individual. My son used to ask me why I was mad all the time. I wasn't.
1	Wait until you see my ‚ÄúI‚Äôm focusing‚Äù face. I try to smile a lot to make up for it though. I feel like I just can‚Äôt control my facial muscles. Botox helped considerably on my furrowing brow fewer wrinkles were just a bonus. I was getting tired of being asked if something was wrong.  Highly recommend Botox, it works wonders and has become relatively inexpensive.
1	Absolutely. Because I'm also a rather quiet person, my friend used to constantly ask me if I'm mad at her lmfao. 
1	No but I kinda wish I did. I think I look too approachable! And I don‚Äôt really like being approached.
1	Idk. I have constant headaches that make me look mad all the time and don‚Äôt get enough sleep, but if those weren‚Äôt a thing, maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have one? It really weird that so many INFPs have rbfs tho
1	Yes yes yes. I try to smile and look like normal people but it's hard 
1	Watching a friend play a game and sitting next to him. He asks: "Why are you angry?" And I'm like "WHAT? I'm just sitting here..." 
1	Yes, tried to smile more often by getting lost in jokes and happy thoughts but backfired when I laugh out loud to myself
1	I sometimes make people walking in front of me on the street run away.
101	Since you guys enjoyed the last one... One of my woodcuts projects <3	
4	Damn how you do that?
2	This is BEAUTIFUL! Totally something I would have on my wall <3
2	Is this inspired by Nina Simone?
2	Yes! I can feel the witchcraft coming out of your fingers, it's like an expressive self-hand portrait!
2	Lovely work, tlikt. :-)
1	This is gorgeous!!! 
-2	Sorry if I'm missing something but what's the connection with infp
2	Ni, Ne, etc, etc.	Ok, I spent an entire morning going over all the meaning of these types of subscripts. All the details about leading with this or that, the Primary, Auxiliary, etc. \n\nDoes any one else get really annoyed by all this detail? I feel like I'm doing the I Ching and get about as much out of it. Can't I just be an INFP and leave it at that? Surely this is something  another personality type came up with! What type was Jung, anyway?
2	Thank you. I was mainly venting. The best validation of my 'type' is an affinity with many on this sub. 
1	> What type was Jung, anyway? \n\nJung thought of himself as an introverted thinker, so most likely INTP. Most people would type him INFJ though due to stereotypes. Some socionics scientists might even type him INFP, which I think is not very likely.\n\nTry to focus on your two main functions primarly, you can trust this "stack" quite well. After that it starts to become a bit wonky.\n\nAlso, I don't like the MBTI function descriptions. They are very superficial and wrong most of the time. They often display Fi as some kind of "confidence in your values" primarly, which is actually just a sideeffect. Function wise, the best descriptions are probably Jungs original ones even though they are complicated and hardly applicable to surface personality traits. Otherwise, I recommend socionics for functions and especially type descriptions.\n\n[http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Wikisocion\_home](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Wikisocion_home)\n\nFor introverted types the J/P is switched, means MBTI INFP = socionics EEI-INFj
1	I had a hard time too learning about the functions because there's such a wide variety of descriptions and explanations out there that it's hard to reconcile them all.\nThe source I've settled on for learning (though I still continue to look for other sources) is the  YouTube channel Type Tips. Out of all the websites, videos, and books I've gone through, this channel has made the most sense to me and resonates with me the most so far. Although you don't really need to know this, he uses John Beebe's 8 function model for ordering the functions for each type but does a Socionics-based explanation to describe the functions, and he doesn't just spew out everything that is in Socionics theory. He attempts to filter through all the intricate details in order to get at the underlying essence of each function, and I think he does it well. 
1	Actually MBTI creator is INFP (Isabel Briggs Myers), Jung is usually typed as INFJ. \n\nDetails and depth is what i like about MBTI.
404	Not mine but I think you guys would like it	
6	Ha, I watched this on the other subreddit and thought this belongs here.

1	Where is this? A friend of mine skated across Utah Lake with another friend a couple weeks ago and that looks a lot like Utah lake...
78	Thought this would be appreciated here.	
8	But if you find someone else like that... maybe you can be alone... together.  That‚Äôd be pretty cool...
5	I used to sit in the closet with the doors closed. It was the best way to be. 
5	You can be a healthy INFP and find interaction.  Maybe some therapy is in order?  EMDR and CBT therapies have saved my life several times over.  I can recommend enough... 
3	Woooow I can relate. I spent my teenage years hiding in my room from my very angry, verbally abusive, and sometimes violent sibling. Didn't really think that followed me but I guess it did. I want to grow out of it.
2	üò≠
2	Well, in my case I want to know other people but I rarely want to make myself known unless they have spent like 5/10 years with me maybe.
2	Yep, totally relate!
2	But does anybody know how to stop?
1	I can so Relate
1	ya when i went to therapy, my guy said that i deliberately create conflict between myself and others close to me in order to control their space between you and them so I can choose when to end the relationship in order to keep the fear of abandonment in my hands. That puta might be right, but he‚Äôs right i feel more comfortable knowing i‚Äôm isolated

2	nice place, what career did you choose ? I'm just about to pick one
2	Ayyyy, I work in the Alkek library and theater. Nice to know an INFP is so close. :D

7	Daily INFP random discussion thread - February 11	\nThis is your daily random discussion thread for /r/INFP. Feel free to chat, or ask questions. \n\nNew to this subreddit? Read the sidebar!\n
13	Hey guys, I never get here early enough to feel like my comment will be seen. I guess this is the glory of an 8am!\nJust poppin' in to say, I hope you guys have a wonderful day today!
10	Almost finished with my bachelor's for teaching History, and I just stayed up all night researching on how to become a forest/park ranger after playing Firewatch\n\nLmao
5	I love everything. But then why do I wish to stay away from them and become a recluse.
2	I'm too old to watch Arthur, but I'm pretty sure Fern is one of us or INFJ. I also find Buster really relatable.
1	I got an official second chance with my love yesterday! We were apparently rebuilding and starting over this whole time. I'm excited for this fresh start to build something better than we had before. 
18	This is a video I (INFP) worked on with my friend (ENFP), and we're super proud of it. It's probably our most polished work yet. Our sense of humor can very abstract and philosophical and we thought some other NFs might enjoy it! :)	
2	Posting this everywhere I can.\n\nThis reminds me so much of, old youtube humor! I love it.
1	Very nice. Currently watching a video where I'm typing this in. No script, though. My tablet is set for full screen and looks just like I'm typing into a Reddit comment box. 
1	That one was really good. Thanks for creating this! 
14	Self-discipline and achieving goals as an INFP	As an INFP I always struggle to achieve my goals when they demand a constant effort. Be it exercising, studying, writing something, etc it's hard to keep going when the inicial motivation goes away. What has worked for me is conquer small victories; wake up early one day, drink water, leaving my phone aside for some minutes. When I see that I can accomplish those things, even if they are small, I feel that I can do bigger stuff. \n\nHave you found something that helps you with that? \n
4	What helped me a lot lately: Getting up early, drink two glasses of water, 15-20 min yoga exercises before I hit the shower. 
5	I relate with you a lot. What's really helped me is breaking bigger things into smaller tasks, for example. I like to use the pomodoro technique when I'm studying which breaks down studying into 25 minute intervals. 
4	Shorter work intervals.  Even if the task at hand takes hours, stop once in a while to do something else.  By do, I mean physically.  It doesn't help to just stay in the same chair and click different things on your laptop screen.  Get up, move to a different space, do something physical.  Soon the mind is clear and can get back to the task.  It works for me like a reset button.
5	Would love to hear someone‚Äôs input on this 
3	I like to categorise my goals into areas of life, for example, financial independence or health and well-being (7 areas of life)\n\nWithin each area I include smaller goals - some I enjoy, like yoga and some I find tedious, like booking a dentist appointment. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt make time for yoga or booking the dentist but when I can see they‚Äôre linked to a wider goal I find it easier to work towards.\n\nI try to chose at least one thing from every area to complete each month. Some of them are really small goals like texting a friend or going for a walk.\n\nI try to be patient with myself when I don‚Äôt feel motivated to work towards anything, sometimes I just need to have a nap or a bath.
2	Break it up like others here say, but especially, write it down, AND put it in your phone like an appointment or reminder. 
2	One extremely strange thing that helps me is taking cold showers every day. Or even taking normal warm showers and after you are done turn it to cold for as long as you can handle it, as some people prefer. One of the first things I do every day then, is choosing to go outside of my comfort zone which builds confidence, and ofc cold or cool showers are physically healthier as well. Ik it sounds weird but it does help üòÇ
2	I use an app called flip that records how much time I spend on each assignment while studying. It‚Äôs satisfying to see the bar charts at the end showing the breakdown of my day!
20	How are you when you get angry?	INFPs are not know for being bad tempered, but we all have our moments when we lose it. \n\nIt takes a long time for me to get annoyed at someone, but when I do, I don't go into rages and I rarely yell, no, but I'll throw sarcastic and very cutting comments when I'm finally pushed to the limit. Sometimes I'll bring up issues from months or even years prior. Additionally, among friends and family, I have a legendary 'Arctic ice cold' stare when I see or hear something I don't like.
7	Sounds about right lol
3	I can relate with the sarcastic comments, but I usually just keep it in and listen to music.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt recommend keeping your anger in all the time, though. Last summer I had a bit of a breakdown because I was in a bit of a rough spot with friends, ever since I‚Äôve let my anger out occasionally.
2	If I'm dumb enough to drink....I'm an unfiltered moron fully ready to make statements I"m sure to regret till the day I die.\n\nOtherwise...I don't say much. Just let it fester. Then again, it depends on how long it festered, or how many chances I gave someone while dropping hints or even making blatant statements.
2	I have a way of calling people on their shit in a way that really messes with people, because I see shit they were clueless about, but I have to be pushed way way beyond my limit before I will finally do this. It kinda scares people. Trying to break the habit:(
2	I get angry a fair amount but definitely don't say anything. Sometimes if I'm angry AND hurt I'll just shut down socially. Anger definitely festers and explodes sometimes though, but I definitely have to be drunk. When that happens, I'll be super sarcastic. my comments are often personal and sharp and I'll say exactly how I feel. it's kinda brutal tbh
2	I used to scream and yell when I was younger, now at 26 I'm able to internalize my frustration with the other person (for the most part...)
1	I tell the person something they did that hur me ages ago, depending on what they say we discuss that matter or we get the whole thing sorted out. I usually hate having to tell people they've pissed me off because when I do they go ‚ÄúIt's not that big of a deal‚Äù and I'm like ‚Äúyeah it is why do you think I brought it up‚Äù in my head
1	Actually, in my case, I am highly turbulent.  INFP-T.  There are also INFP-A‚Äôs which are more mellow. I fly into a rage and shoot my mouth off often when my values are challenged or someone hurts me.  I have a ton of emotion that just rushes me.  I am learning to get it under control, and I always feel remorseful after the fact, but just because I rage does not mean I am not an INFP.  
1	I have to be careful, it hardly ever happens. The worst was when I began shouting as a put-on, a joke, and then suddenly I was really angry. Still can't believe that happened. I haven't repeated it. 
1	I don't really get angry anymore these days. More of mild frustration that quickly dissolves into self-pity and sadness. If anything, if something has me upset, I'd likely abruptly leave or just ignore it all, and escape further into the mind. 
1	Nah if i‚Äôm angry, like legit angry, i‚Äôm either 1. Yelling in your face why you‚Äôre wrong or 2. punching you. Anger might not be an emotion i have often, but it‚Äôs definitely not an emotion i control well - M INFP 25
1	Shit happens to everyone over time but INFP pasts are just more present.   When it happens it can be overwhelming for us and others.  Bit What i have learned if I get over it. Then they get over it just as quick.  Dont worry to much about it.
25	Not an INFP	
3	It is the sun of my life that is setting to never rise again. 
2	Stunning 
23	Healthy Habits for a Healthy INFP (and non INFP's too)	Hey fellow INFP's, thought I'd make another post. I've been an extremely unhealthy and unhappy INFP for most of my life and want to share some things that have improved my health and happiness. One of the most important things I've done is focus on habits. Not only getting rid of bad ones, but creating healthy ones. Just a reminder, every single habit i talk about is created or destroyed over time, if you try to go from point A to point Z overnight, it won't stick for long. So, here are 5 core habits that have improved my life (and the next one I'll work on):\n\n  1. Sleep Schedule + Duration: I survived high school off of 3-5 hours of sleep every night, when 6-7 is ideal for me. Surprised I graduated at all tbh, but those years screwed up my sleep schedule for 2-3 years past it. I still don't have a perfectly consistent schedule, but now I get between 5-8 hours usually, and almost always fall asleep before 3am (used to be unable to fall asleep before 6am) I have been able to accomplish more in less time. I also have seasonal depression so getting more sunlight in the winter, instead of falling asleep when the sun comes up and waking up an hour before the sun goes down, is extremely helpful.\n  2. No soda, no snacks, no dessert: I implemented all 3 of these at different times and gradually so it would stick. The most I have weighed in my life is 237lbs, and I am currently at about 198. Dropping these 3 unneccesary eating times/drinks have helped me lose weight, along w advice 3. I replaced soda w black coffee when I need caffiene, when I don't need caffiene i drink only water. Losing weight has made me more confident and willing to go outside of my comfort zone, because going outside of my comfort zone has proven results now. Although I do look better, looks are one of the lesser important benefits IMO.\n  3. Work out DAILY (no off days): I don't have a gym membership or anything. So far, I stretch, do push ups, sit ups, planks, and simple things that can be done w/o equiptment. Shadow boxing as well. Not having access to equiptment is a bad excuse, just start somewere, even going on a 10 minute walk every day is a good start. I couldn't even do 2 good push ups a month ago, now I can do almost 10. Once again, no excuses. Being physically active is good for the brain, heart, and pretty much everything else.\n  4. Organize: I hate this word but it is important. I'm not saying you need to have a dozen complex organization apps/tools, you could just write down every single thing that you need + want to do and cross it out after it is complete. I personally use the notepad windows app or whatever on my laptop and type up what I plan to do every day. This is extremely helpful, especially while depressed because it gives me a reason to roll out of bed xD\n  5. Read Every Day: Even if it is just for 10 minutes. Benefits are self explanitory.\n  6. Talk More: This is one that I haven't started working on yet (well, I sorta have), but it is the next one I plan to work on. What I mean by sorta is I make YouTube videos and talking on a mic has actually improved my confidence to talk to people in person. But I haven't yet made much of an effort to increase my interaction w other human beings (which is currently way too low), but this summer semester of college ima take in person classes instead of online classes (i prefer online but this is a good excuse to socislize and meet people). Online friends + communities are great and have improved my life a lot and helped me a lot, but it's important to have friends INRL too.\n\nTLDR; Sleep Schedule + Duration, Eat Better, Exercise DAILY, Organize, Read DAILY, Talk More.
6	thank you
6	Talk more is a MUST, it changed my life. Over time, it helped me being comfortable showing and acting like my trueself to others that weren't close friends or family. And it's not even talking more *per se*, but also letting your emotions be free, don't be afraid to say what you think, don't be afraid of a conversation on numerous everyday situations that might involve talking/social interactions. If I had to give a single advice to a younger me, this would be it. 
6	‚ÄúWon‚Äôt You Be My Neighbor?‚Äù Documentary	Watched this documentary on the great Mr. Rogers last and I just thought this sub would absolutely love it.

3	About to give up on MBTI	About half the tests say I'm INFJ, the others say I'm INFP. Even socionomics say I'm INFJ.\n\nReally, it seems I relate more to INFP. Then there's sooooo much in INFJ that I also relate to. I'm starting to get overwhelmed and overthinking all of it.\n\nApparently it's a common thing for people to be confused about FJ or FP. And all the functions...Lord! It's all Do, Ra, Me, Fa, So, La, To, Da to me and I can't seem to make heads or tails because I just need the gist of it. Which is a total INFP trait. But, I can't help but delve deeper and deeper to try to understand myself more. Again an INFP trait, though, FJ also.....\n\nI'm also very intuitive to the point of being almost psychic and it's just things I know that I know and trust them. I can literally feel what another is feeling, especially if we're touching each other. It can sometimes take days for me to sort out which feels are mine and which are theirs. Though, now days as I'm older, others emotions have a foreign feel to them. Almost like a dirty kind of feeling. Like you're wearing someone else's underwear.\n\nI speak in parables, metaphors and analogies. I accept everyone for who they are and play devil's advocate so bad, I swear I can find good qualities in even Jeffrey Dahmer. Yet the same time judge the fuck outta someone while still not completely understanding what it means to judge at all.\n\nAnd here....I'm rambling as I usually do when trying to make a statement or explain something. It's like I'm speaking Swahili all the time!\n\nIt's starting to seem more and more that it feels I'm not really born of this planet or even this dimension. At the same time, there's absolutely nothing special about me. Nor is there anything that I find odd or original about the way I process this life and those in it.\n\nThough, today is the first day I've had complete silence and alone time in almost 2 years. Maybe this is all floors of thoughts previously building up and I can finally think.\n\nGood Lord I just wore myself out with just this post! No wonder my love takes so long to reply. Poor thing! 
6	So you're between those two types. It's fine, relax. All this typology stuff is just a theory that merely helps to group us. Statistically hardly anyone will fit in accurately at the start of their journey with psychological typing.\n\nI will get a good lynching here for what I'm going to say... Most typology stuff nowadays is a straight-forward pseudoscience. I used to be confused by all this theory so much that I'd decided to interpret the world on my terms and dived into neurobiology in a search of more concrete reasoning. I still use cognitive functions, though. It is a good base model.\n\nIf you're at some point overwhelmed, get a break and find a new perspective. After all, life is not about fitting yourself to the world. It is the other way around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbtw. Socionics and MBTI have crucial differences in their INFx/INFX model. You just can't say that INFj is INFJ/INFP or that INFp is INFJ/INFP. Seriously, I love reading various descriptions of these types: [EII](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/list.php/category/54-EII-INFj) and [IEI](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/list.php/category/11-IEI-INFp).
3	Idk why but, I find this interesting to read.
3	Former INFP/J here. Do what i did, subscribe to both. You'll soon find where you want to hang. 
3	Really good infj/infp comparison image here: https://imgur.com/a/dmkkgd0\n\nFor the basic understanding of functions (6minutes video) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uKaFveOhXY\n\nFour functions you need to focus on: **I**ntroverted I**N**tuition (Ni) + **E**xtraverted **F**eeling (Fe) which makes out INFJ. \n\nWhen INFP is = **I**ntroverted **F**eeling (Fi) + **E**xtraverted I**N**tuition (Ne).\n\nAs for types descriptions, you need to look at what is the least contradicting and most fitting. If i look i probably relate to some part of the descriptions on all 16 types, it doesn't mean im that type or doubting between the types, just because im relating to some parts of it, why? cos it contains other parts which i can't see myself being, and doesnt really fit me.\n\nin a nutshell example: The color of my face is the same as that house which i see from my window. Does it mean Im a house? no. Similary if you relate to some parts of the infp description or any other description it doesn't mean you are infp. look it as a whole, and the contradicting parts. \n\nThese are a two different types for a reason, they are not describing the same personality archetype. though both infj and infp are in the idealistic subgroup of mbti types, and  (roughly speaking) process with feelings and ideas. so they have similar points in their description. you need to look at differences and the meta picture. and what makes them differ from each other, despite both being an idealists/dreamer type.\n\nP.s. if you want me to make a guess, based on the description you provided you more seem like INFJ. no way, im certained, ofc, so don't take it any seriously. \n\nP.S.S. As other person said, browse both subreddits for a while. you get a meta feeling from both subs and types on the feeling level. both leave certained meta impression and have a certained aura to it, so to speak. So you could feel where you belong. Especially if you are that sensitive even psychic sometimes as you said. 
2	Honestly, watch an interview of JK Rowling (INFJ) and then watch an interview of Keanu Reeves (INFP). When I watched Keanu and heard him speak, I KNEW I spoke like him and had similar mannerisms. I'm female, so it wasn't a gender-based recognition. When you hear JK Rowling talk, it's very fluid and logical. (My thought was: "I don't talk like that. She's too put together.") There is some emotion there, but she's easy to follow. With Keanu, he uses quite a bit of slang and has more choppy sentences. The Fi is pretty clear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecord yourself and watch yourself back if you have to for a comparison. Cognitive functions can manifest all the way down to our speech pattern. I think it's helpful to try and compare yourself to others that are supposedly the same type. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust generally, Ne users typically say "um" or "like" to fill in gaps of speech whereas most Ni users only speak after they know exactly what they are about to say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are an INFP and you do record yourself, you'll see "Ne eyes" super clearly. Basically, Ne eyes are when your eyes move all over the place when you try to explain something. INTJ & INFP Coffee have some great videos on detecting that. 
2	Awesome!!!! Thanks folks!!!!!!! I really do appreciate the insight and the time you all took to reply! \n\nI think it's all pretty understandable now!\n\nIt's actually kind of sad. I was really hoping to be INFP. That's not the case. I'm definitely INFJ. Everything I've read and watched...all the links and information you guys gave really helped a lot!\n\nThough, I really do enjoy this INFP subreddit. Most things posted really just exude warmth, beauty, gentleness, and honesty, creativity.....the things I try to cultivate within myself and things I really appreciate about life. \n\nIt seems it's my artist side that really resonates here more so than the other attributes. The conversations here are just fantastic and really insightful and enjoyable on soooo many levels. \n\nSo, though, I"m not INFP üòï, I'm going to stick around on this subreddit because you guys are really great!  Though, I'll take longer to reply and make sure I know exactly where I'm coming from before any advice or anything like that is given.\n\nThanks again for the insight! 
11	This. I never get what they mean by "speak your truth"	
6	Everybody might have a different take on what is true. Especially when it comes to feelings.  
4	### Every time I see or hear "speak your truth" I'm reminded of this episode of The Office:\n\nPam:¬†So, we had couple's therapy.¬†\n\nJim:¬†No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.¬†\n\nPam:¬†And we have homework.¬†\n\nJim:¬†Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.¬†\n\nPam:¬†And we're also supposed to ***speak our truths***.¬†\n\nJim:¬†Mmhm.¬†\n\nPam:¬†Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.¬†\n\nJim:¬†Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ‚Äúopportunities.‚Äù\n
2	Would 'live your truth' make more sense to you?
8	INFP horror story: A life of pain, misunderstanding, emotional loneliness	First of all I will preface this by saying that, yes, I am intoxicated (it's Sunday, nothing to do after working all week) but let's start this shall we? It's going to be long and I'm not sure anybody will read it all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n As a child I was an outgoing kid. Always getting into things, adventurous, artistic, very much an ENFP.  I was NOT  a shy kid. As time went on, I experienced some traumatic things in my life. Witnessed death at a young age. It changed me completely. I went from outgoing to being quiet, not that big on people. At this time I was heavily bullied in school (but the year before I was very popular but now that I was vulnerable, I was fair game for bullies) It was hard and I dreaded going to school. All my previous friends abandoned me as I was now some quiet weirdo. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never stopped doing art but it got much sadder. After a few high school years, I eventually dropped out.  After this I wandered around in life. Doing art, music, but feeling completely fundamentally alone. Nobody understands my pain, why not? This seems dramatic but it's how I felt. I became a weirdo overnight. Alienating everybody around me, I retreated into my shell. I locked myself in my room. Got my computer, distracted myself, I never faced myself at all. Anything to relieve the suffering. I had extreme anxiety. I was a very unhealthy person (still am in a lot of ways) I started using alcohol to cope with it. It worked. I was my old self. I thought, man, this is awesome. We all know that Alcohol is not sustainable. We all know it isn't good for us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ended up discovering a lot in my time of suffering. Found out who I really am. What matters to me. What I didn't want to do, because I had done it already, it's a dead-end. Drugs, alcohol are dead ends. I experienced a lot of suffering and I'm still fighting every day. I started trying to help others who may be going through what I'm going through. I realized I can't really help others until I fix my own shit. I can only inspire others in small ways. I'm in my head a lot. I overthink a lot. I overthink A LOT. Cannot emphasize this enough.  I cannot get out of my own head (pretty sure I'm Enneagram 5). I found solace online, with communities like this. Although I have said dumb shit online as well and made people angry. There's something about having this as an outlet. I have no idea what people did before the internet. Weirdo people.. Must have been terrible.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter graduating from this place where you can get a degree (like a HS equivalent thing) I went off to college I studied various things but I just felt like I was drifting. I loved the experience of college. The campus, the excitement in the air, people doing what they thought was going to get them somewhere in life. But there was also a lot of bullshit, too. A lot of alcohol, a lot of partying (even though i don't like parties) and romantic relationships which while they were fun at the time and even deep at points, felt like a passing thing. Nothing felt real nothing felt sustainable nothing felt like it meant anything. I was looking for something but it wasn't tangible. I had a stupid idea in my head before I went to college. I wanted out of my hometown. I wanted to go somewhere else. Meet new people. Artistic people. But just good people in general. I hadn't experienced them yet in my life. Years of pain lead up to college. I had a weird, and again intangible idea something open something new and beautiful. It was that at times but I was mostly just too fucked up to experienced it or remember a lot of it.  There's a weird nostalgia about it for me. But after college, it was just straight up being lost. I tried to go to an art school but quickly dropped out. Again, I never felt with others or understood at any point during these years. The only time I somewhat did is when others were drunk as fuck just like I was and we were on the same wavelength. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI currently live with a roommate. She's quite annoying but harmless enough. My mother died a month or so ago. Lost my father as a teenager. Although these are tragic, they'll never eclipse the pain of being fundamentally alone. Psychologically alone. Emotionally alone. When you feel that you think in a way that nobody else does. It's fundamental. Your entire being is not like others. What the fuck can you do about that? Apparently nothing. I've battled with myself to try harder to relate to others and going deeper into myself and saying fuck other people. I'm going to be more of myself and content with myself. I struggle with both sides of me. I rely on authenticity a lot. It's a comfort I have. ''If I died today at least I was always my weird self'' there's something comforting about that. There's pride in it. But at the end of the day, I am struggling. I wake up every day filled with terrible anxiety and fear and pain and depression. I've tried therapists and it didn't work very well. Once I had a therapist and they randomly left and moved to another state. She was very nice. I loved her. Probably an ISFJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I sit here wondering what the fuck I'm doing in my life and I can't give an answer. I like making music and art but that stuff is just not feasible really as far as a career goes. And others look down on it (though they'll claim they like music and art) They'll still judge you as some guy who is delusional. Dreamer, not logical and practical. It gets very tiring. When you put all your heart into things. People are like that's nice but please get a real job. I cannot work a real job. I never have. I had one job, actually... a retail job. Not for me. People say well you can learn to do it and like it but I just cannot do it. I'd honestly rather be homeless than work retail and other shit jobs. I'm aware that that is stupid as far as my circumstances but I'm stubborn like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm very stubborn. Very weird. I hate that I'm alone but I prefer it to trying to be just like everybody else. I'm sensitive around others ( a highly sensitive person) and their energy affects me and can change me completely. I have to protect myself. I feel unequipped for this world. \n\nThat's it for now.
1	Probably one of the most relatable pieces of writing I've ever seen. Kudos to you for being brave enough to put yourself out here like this. I wish I had your skills to make art and music so I could work from home and not have to go out into the world to find a job and face people. 
2	how did you figure out that your INFP and not ISFP?	just wondering. 
2	Never related much to the Se, to be honest. I know that within the model of the cognitive functions, I've always felt that I was better equipped with Si than that of Se. Additionally, test of the cognitive functions indicate that my usage of Si is indeed, higher than Se.
1	This is the thing that i struggle with the most in MBTI. After months of researching MBTI and cognitive functions i can never seem to figure out if i'm ISFP or INFP.
1	[https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/sensing-or-intuition.htm?bhcp=1](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/sensing-or-intuition.htm?bhcp=1) This helped me a lot. 
1	I tested INFP/J until I went back (after several years) and took it again recently. \n\nYou could try subscribing to both subreddits INFP and ISFP and see if one of them resonates better. 
1	I‚Äôm intelligent. Boom over
13	I knew it. Always loved Warhol. Why are INFPs attracted to other INFPs?

2	I LOVE Warhol. He's brilliant.
2	Is John Lennon actually an infp? Always felt very attracted to him and his music...
4	How to boost an INFPs self esteem	Hi guys, ISFJ here trying to help my INFP significant other. Shits been going down recently but long story short, he recently confided in me that he really lacks self esteem (especially when I get upset with him and he feels like a bad person) and questions his ability to make firm decisions. Currently seeking out a couples therapist to handle the arguing/emotional incompatibility under stress but in the meantime I really want him to know how wonderful he is. I tell him I appreciate his effort and give examples and all that but once we argue it seems to all go out the door. I really genuinely believe he‚Äôs the most amazing, caring, passionate person I know but the words alone don‚Äôt seem to hold much meaning to him. Any ideas on how to help boost his self esteem? Thanks:)
1	Hey, I think the issue is the arguing, which sounds obvious but perhaps he feels like the words you say about him when you argue are more true than those when you are not. Those true feelings you have for him may appear as conceited only because he may feel like you have been bottling up your ‚Äòtrue thoughts‚Äô of him that surface once you argue.\nWe also tend to reflect on the negative memories more. \n\n\nYou may know this already so I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs old news so to speak. Get to the heart of why you argue. Look at your personality types and understand the conflicting traits and try to see where they manifest in actions or lack of action with one of you and how the other reacts. \n\nThis is my two pence \n\nAll the best
4	What makes you guys laugh?	From jokes to videos to happenings, drop them all below.
6	Something like [this](https://youtu.be/bKdeqeP7VU0) is my type of humor.\n\nAlso, I like Michael Ceras kind of awkward/weirdo type of jokes.
4	Mostly dark humor, John Mulaney too.
3	Awkward humor, dark humor. Also spontaneous and ridicolous edits. I tend to focus on sound effects and stuff like that more than the words or context. Here's something: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/PEiI8pqC4WU
2	Sarcastic jokes and running gags always make me laugh. Also, inside jokes with friends no matter how much we overuse them
1	Unexpected humor. Clever humor and satire, like books *Straight Man*, *The Sellout*, *White Noise*. Unintentional humor like the movie "Signs".
1	My favourite comedy programme is Peep Show. Just find the awkwardness hilarious. It‚Äôs also slightly odd
1	Really campy but genuine humor. 
1	Dark humor. Like adult swim,/odd future humor xD
11	People don't get me	I'm hugely depressed most of the time, have become a recluse in the last few years and suffer pretty extreme anxiety, but the worst part of my life is people's inability to understand my perspective or thought process. People think just because I dont talk much I'm either dumb or just not very smart, but in reality I am quite smart and I'm only just coming to that realisation myself, I wouldn't say im smart in the conventional sense but I take things from context very easily and once I've got the context down I can put things into practice. Being an imfp is hard. I can't form healthy relationships with people, but somehow I've bagged the best girlfriend I could ask for lmao, so friends come and go and I have this creative urge that's blocked by what I can only assume is my being an introvert, life is frustrating and seems pointless at times. I kinda just feel like another brick in the wall.
4	I can relate.  I write music and lyrics help me get clarity on what‚Äôs going on inside of me.  It‚Äôs very rewarding when I can express myself fully and gain understanding of my own feelings.  Because I have so many thoughts and emotions I have a hard time verbalising what‚Äôs going on.\n\nWriting is good too.  Find some way of gettinf that stuff out of you in a positive way.  
4	I can‚Äôt recommend this book enough: Introvert Power by Laurie Helgoe phd 
2	Pelele actually understand you more than you think
2	Highly recommend 12 rules for life by Jordan  Peterson,  helped me out greatly as an INFP Male, hope this helps
7	Speaking Truth	Title Change: "Identifying Intention and Communicating Fi Effectively"\n\nWhat does this mean? \n\nIf I see a bird, and delight in its flight, or encounter a flower growing where no flower would likely grow, should I stay silent to such things? To me, beauty exists from the way ants march to the way colors dance in the sky twice every day. Every day! Amazing. \n\nI met a man named Ansel. We shared donuts together and talked about life. He sits on a busy corner, every morning, and sings songs of love to the people passing by. He also says "Good morning, good morning, good morning to you!!! Good morning my friends!!  Good morning indeed!!!" In 10 minutes I saw dozens of people warmly effected by his words. And his bold, generous display of kindness and love. To strangers! I also saw several people stop, with gifts for him--gifts they had gotten specifically for him as they had grown to know him--drop these things by with smiles on their faces and delight in their eyes. Ansel reminds me of an angel radiating light to everyone. I think that, we could use more Ansels in our world...\n\n----\n\nTo answer my own question: Today, to me, the truth unfolding is this: We need to display our Fi, cognizant of Fe. Yesterday a dear friend and I were talking of related things. And she discussed the idea of harmony. I brought up balance. I think it's important to integrate the yin/yang. We need Ansels, we need love. We need respect, understanding, to identify and communicate intention well. My life is about growth. To that end, it's finding a way to show Fi through an Fe construct. These are developing thoughts. \n\n----\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\nPlus... I love all the sunrise/sunset pictures!!! 
2	This does in fact work and can benefit INFPs in return to what their FI turned Fe can offer society.  My mother was just like Ansel, she was always sayimg good morning and offering help to strangers, even told fellow woman (complete stranger) who was in a hard times that she could just come over to her house for a swim in our family pool anytime. She went to lunch with elderly people stuff like that. She always was fixated on the feelings of others, usually sad or depressed feelings and was dedicated to turning that around by almost any means necessary lol.  This behavior continues for years and My mom left this world over a decade ago and the most amazing thing happened at her funeral. \n   The entire town showed up that might for her wake.  They told us that they had to turn people away in a line that wrapped around the building which they said has never happened before.  I remeber it was time for them to close and people were still coming.  I remeber seeing all the cars lined up down the street waiting for their turn just to get into the parking lot.  To this day I often wonder, do all those people friends or randoms still radiate positivley in their lives from meeting my mother and if so just how many more people do they know that they have shared it with, knowingly or ubkowingly...\n  I am not bragging about my mother, but she is an example of how good sharing Fe or Fi can really be.  Its a learned response and clealy from people like Ansel and mother.  But it was always in incrimants, very subtle like good morning, how bout a swim, and persisting with that and in time that positivity can literally last forever\n\n
2	Thanks man.  Thanks for sharing your story too.  I imagine Ansel as an friendly italian restauranunt owner, the way you spoke of him. Actually cheered me up instantly to he honest.   Do you ever do any writing he might make good inspiration for a character.
7	It feels like the world is rotting	As fellow INFPs, you can probably all relate to the fact that, at least once a day, your mind wanders and you‚Äôre thinking about the role of humanity on earth and what its existence is/should be/would be/etc.  \n\nLately this has been causing me a lot of inner conflict. Im from a very rural area originally, so a lot of my childhood friends are trumpers. I see so much negativity and racism and anti-intellectualism from their posts, and when I try to remind them of things I know they once believed, I leave feeling drained and terrible because so many of them have chosen to hate. Some mornings I don‚Äôt even want to get up because it‚Äôs like what‚Äôs the point? The direction things are going makes me exhausted just thinking about it. If I can‚Äôt even convince people I used to be quite close with, how will any of us ever convince enough people to stop the destruction to our environment, stand up for the weak and needy, celebrate our differences in belief? Today was just one of those mornings where it feels like the world is rotting. 
2	I think it helps to have a clear-eyed view of the world. It does seem like a lot of bad stuff is in the news right now: climate change, the seeming retreat of democracy across the world, and the global migrant crisis are issues that will challenge humans as a species for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut there's also a lot of good stuff happening in the world. The global extreme poverty rate has [dramatically declined](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty) since 1970, lifting more than 2 billion people out of poverty. Global life expectancy [continues](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/mortality/World-Mortality-2017-Data-Booklet.pdf) its meteoric rise since 1950. [Child mortality](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/) has fallen *by half* since 1990. Diseases like tuberculosis and polio that used to be extremely common are pretty much eradicated, and [malaria](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-050633/en/) probably will be eradicated this century. [Global murder rates](https://www.unodc.org/gsh/) are at or below their all time lows ([including in the U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/upshot/us-murder-rate-for-2018-is-on-track-for-a-big-drop.html), despite what how local media outlets portray crime). [Literacy](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000163170) and access to the internet are at all-time highs, making the average human being more educated and connected to other people than ever before. The average human being is living a longer, healthier, more educated, and safer life than ever before in all of human history.\n\nI think it's tempting to get depressed about the state of the world (I know I definitely have, especially since 2016), but there are so many opportunities for us to make other people's lives better, so I try to focus my energy on that instead of being worried.
2	Sounds like you might be spiraling a bit.  Maybe try not so much social media and news.  Just a thought, i dont mean anything negative by it but it can affect humans mentally. and if your friends are 'trumpers' why does it matter so much.  Arent they still your friends?  Shouldnt being a friend outdo any political affiliation?\n\nDont let your feelings rule you because other people dont rule theres.  Thats one of the main issues with Trumpers.  Its possibly because they are so out of touch with their own feelings theyd rather syphon all their frustrations into this controversial spectacle of a man.  If people watch a scary movie they get scared, if they watch a comedy they laugh, if thry see an angry frustrated oompa looompa running the white house they go a bit Willy Wonka bat shit.  Its a normal human response.\n   \nAll i am saying is theres millions of trumps in the world.  But as an INFP we only have a few friends.  And in that theres only 1 of you so of course you feel outnumbered. As an INFP Emotiotive behavior comes naturally to you, just be a positive role model to them.  And if they really do appreciate you, in time they will follow your model behavior especially if they see the outward affect it can have.\n\nSorry to sound preechy, just reading this got my gears churning thatvyour having such a hard time.
1	I feel you, it's hard to not feel discouraged with the current state of affairs. It's frustrating. \n\nI've been a lot better about not getting bogged down in this kind of thinking lately, do you want advice or anything?
1	If you have any I wouldn‚Äôt refuse! I mostly had to post this to get it off my chest. I‚Äôve been trying to be more positive and it‚Äôs been working well in my day to day life, it‚Äôs just when I ponder the state of things that I start to feel discouraged 
10	Where do I start?	So hi, I‚Äôm a female INFP. I also have Asperger‚Äôs, so it gets hard for me to participate in communities right off the bat. Usually I just end up lurking for some amount of time before doing something, but this seems like a community that I would like to be active in. So, does anyone have any advice on where to start here? I would appreciate any feedback.\n\nOh, by the way, my name‚Äôs Sadie.
7	This is a pretty chill, non-judgemental community. So I‚Äôm sure you can just post whatever you want when you feel like it ;)
3	Welcome.  Just be nice. 
2	Hello. Just do whatever feels like you should do. After all, its infp place here. :)
1	Hi, Sadie! 
1	I'm appreciate you are in here. Just. Ok welcome buddy XD 
1	Hi Sadie, welcome to our community. : )
10	Real shit, I can never find any gruff infp‚Äôs	Gruff is a dumb word but it was the quickest for a title. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt describe myself with that word, but I certainly do feel generally I‚Äôm a lot more jaded and annoyed and sarcastic than most infp‚Äôs I meet. I‚Äôve got maybe 1 other INFP friend that I really relate to in that aspect. I‚Äôm always sort of off in my own world. I‚Äôm kind of a loner. I say hello back to people, and I don‚Äôt ever intentionally let loose on anyone. \n\nBut I‚Äôm certainly not the type that like babies people. Idk how to describe it. I try not to be mean or callous, but if someone is being an asshole, or is being stupid in such a way that it impedes the good fight, I get pissed. Shit like people being racist (but especially covert racism from a person that purports to ‚Äòhate racist people‚Äô). \n\nPeople that are so unwilling to have a difficult conversation, they‚Äôd rather keep a status quo of perverse hatred and backwardness or encumbering stupidity because they REFUSE to understand people really irk me, and tbh, I meet a lot of infp‚Äôs that do that. They are sunshine and rainbows to the point, that as soon as a conversation gets hard, or as soon as they disagree with you, they run from it, and it really kind of bugs me at this point. I meet a lot of infp‚Äôs that come out real strong with some kind of opinion, and as soon as I detect they are being fake and ask them to explain, they basically go to the ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs like, my opinion man,‚Äù response. It‚Äôs not like I go out and get in bar fights, but Jesus I have such trouble finding infp‚Äôs that have hardline opinions, and are willing to have hard discussions that pit their ideals and opinions up against the world. \n\nI‚Äôm definitely a million miles away in my own world like most infp‚Äôs I know. I‚Äôm constantly inventing scenarios in my head. I‚Äôve got this really ingrained sense of ‚Äúright‚Äù and ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù But I just can‚Äôt seem to get down with that ‚Äúeveryone just get along‚Äù thing. Like, I wish people did, but they won‚Äôt. So at the end of the day I wish I met more infp‚Äôs that stood by their ideals instead of just being washouts that are so afraid of conflict. \n\nIronically the INFP friend I have that‚Äôs probably as (if not more) sarcastic and coarse than me, has a lot of ideals that are very inverse to mine. And I still respect him because he stands by them, and realizes the only way to really make his ideals worth a shit is to argue in their stead. \n\nIdk. This is kind of an unaimed rant, so I guess I‚Äôll try to tie to together with: why are so many infp‚Äôs these sad/angry people with a fake skin deep sunshine and rainbows exterior? Why not just actually be sad or angry, and why not just actually stop caring about whether people u don‚Äôt wanna be like enjoy you or not?
9	It takes time and intention to build up the intestinal fortitude not to run from conflict. \nBut you don‚Äôt *have* to then be gruff. Look around and see if you can spot any of us standing inside conflict without actually engaging in it, helping people hear each other.\nBottom line- ‚Äúwhy not just stop caring what other people think‚Äù- we all come with baggage. Mine was a parent who would emotionally squash me like a grape if I expressed a strong opinion different than theirs. At nearly age 50 now I‚Äôve spent a lot of time overcoming that, but I could just as easily spent that time and effort learning to play the banjo or design video games or becoming a champion athlete. Also people I happened to meet were pivotal. \nHowever- just as some of your fellow infps are where they are in their journey, you are also. Good to vent, good to identify what is pissing you off. Next step: what is it in this that is about you that maybe you don‚Äôt like about *yourself*? Very meta, but you‚Äôre being intolerant of intolerance of conflict? I dunno. Ponder. In any case, hugs and Light.
6	Right there with you!\n\nI"m definitely more rough and tumble than you'd expect an INFP to be. \n\nIt's probably from the life I had growing up, working in the oil field definitely changes a person's culture, and being in the biker world for so many years. \n\nStill, looking at me you'd never guess my MBTI type. No one would ever know until they become a trusted part of my life. That's when they see.\n\nEveryone is different, MBTI isn't the end all be all of who we are or how we behave, or our persona.\n\nI mean, I can be on a rig, (and I see this a lot with others), cussing, joking, being a dick to people who are shitty pricks, then next thing you know, I'm looking at a lady bug that landed on me like it's the coolest damned thing ever! \n\nSome are more comfortable in their own skin than others. Sometimes life teaches us to be bold when we really don't feel it inside. Just kind of a have to.\n\nOn top of it all, I'm certain an INFP quality is not caring what people think of who you are as much as most would.
5	I see a lot of young/immature/unhealthy INFPs on here. I think that‚Äôs part of it. \n\nI‚Äôm not gruff, but I am straight forward. Things seem ‚Äúobvious‚Äù to me and I have a hard time shutting my mouth when others are ‚Äúobviously‚Äù wrong. \n\nI definitely don‚Äôt seek out conflict, and will let go of unnecessary conflict, but if something rubs my own moral compass wrong - I say my piece. \n\n
2	We have a dark side! Especially when our morals/values are crossed. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing you to be ‚Äúgruff‚Äù. Personally, I have been called ‚Äúharsh‚Äù before and it seems out of character for me because I am an INFP and I am very nice but at the end of the day I am not afraid of an argument especially if I believe something to be true. Also being an introvert can make me ‚Äúshort‚Äù with other people in some social situations that I find exhausting. Overall I am very playful and positive but I have my dark moments that I can‚Äôt seem to prevent. 
1	I can never find any infp's. I don't know people with these traits in real life. But yeah, I'm also not gruff. I live in my optimistic idealistic world. That's ok because I know my way to see the world is not the only one and I'm open for things that are against my ideals. At least I try haha
1	I love to argue, but mostly when I detect a logic flaw. And if I can tell the other person is going to get super emotional, disregard any arguments despite their soundness, or try to shove their perspective upon me to make me agree with them, I hold back (politics, religion, bla). Those conversations are not fun.
1	I am a 25 M INFP, and nobody would ever know. I‚Äôve been to jail three times, been in around a dozen fights and got myself in situations that led me to having a loaded gun in my face twice. It took me a lot of years, self reflection, meditation and discipline to turn into a healthy INFP, but by no means am I a walking rainbow or an angry storm cloud - Yes, i have my values straightened out, my head is always in the clouds, i‚Äôm reserved, can spend hours on my guitar and really do have a gentle nature, but I carry a sense of very serious purpose & pride with me everywhere. I think after years of living in a harsh reality i‚Äôve come to realize life is far from the fantasy worlds a lot of sheltered people hide in. I‚Äôve suffered a lot, and really developed the extroverted thinking into something I can balance myself with to not let myself get too much of anything stereotypical of INFPs. \n\nPersonally, when i scroll the INFP page, i do not relate at all, and am actually glad to know there are other tough people with a similar personality type, because i was starting to think other INFPs like me didn‚Äôt exist. 
4	Are any of you video game developers or programmers in general?	I'm trying to figure out what I want to study. Is computer science a good career for an INFP? I'd like to make a little bit of a positive impact to the world/people. I don't really play games often anymore (in the past I did) so I don't know if I would find game developing interesting. A few years back I learned some coding and made simple games by myself though. I'm a little bit lost, I don't know what my interests are anymore and I should apply to university/college soon. Should I just try it out (probably)? 
4	Im a senior in high school and plan on trying it in college. Codeacademy has some free courses you can dip your toes in. Honestly it wasnt the most fun thing from what little Ive done but it seems like a job i could handle to support myself. I want to change the world someday but for now I just need to become independent of my parents. I want to be a screenwriter one day but thats not really feasible as much as I wish it was
4	I am a computer science master's student (undergrad was computer engineering) and INFP as well. Programming is such a satisfying process to me, it's an act of creation that results in a really cool finished product. I think it could suit you well if you like making and building stuff. Also, it's ok to not know exactly what you want to do right away! You can always start out as a CS major and transfer if you decide it's not for you. Please message me if you want to talk about majoring in CS more! 
1	I'm going to school for business and marketing and teaching myself gamedev (a combination of online courses [Not college tho], books, youtube videos, trying crap out until i figure it out, and networking w other devs. Im getting into indie dev and want to start my own game studio tho, so i need to learn a tiny bit of everything when i start out, hence going for business. Gamedev is my go to form of artistic expression which sounds weird, but think abt it.. It has art, music, a story, etc. And ofc I can entertain ppl and improve lives w games so it is extremely rewarding, and even w the programming stuff that some INFP's wouldn't like due to the technical aspect, I absolutely love programming and it came to me more naurally than art even, but everyone is different.
450	Real shit though, is happiness the end game? or level-headedness? , being in control? and being sane? Because just being okay is enough for me. You can't be happy all the time. #AmIright? So is happiness equal to contentment in life. Or would you all feel guilty being happy all the time too.	
63	Peace is the highest form of happiness
22	For me, purpose and meaning is the end game.
16	Check out The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris
14	Contentment!  Happiness is a high from which you come down; sadness is a low from which you rise.  Finding that sweet balance in between allows for a calm, pleasant experience.
12	I used to think achieving inner peace is the end goal, but in reality it‚Äôs just the beginning. Once you get a hold of it it‚Äôs time to put on the big boy pants and start living life the way you really want to live it, put the effort in and get exactly what you desire.
9	For me, there is no end game. It would probably make me sad or suspicious. \nKind of like, you get so used to anxiety, when it goes away you almost feel empty, then get anxiety from worry about not having anxiety, then, it's almost a relief when it comes back. LMAO
5	Love is the endgame.
5	Happiness is part of Sadness, like you‚Äòre happy because you were sad and vice versa. In the end i think they both shouldn‚Äòt matter that much
4	I think contentment is the goal for us.  Happiness comes and goes (and yes, too long a stretch and I start to worry and overthink it), but being content seems a more attainable state and more sustainable baseline.
4	An INFP-pondering illustration if ever there was one.
5	If you're intelligent and empathic there's no way you can be happy happy much of the time. 
4	Wachting people be happy makes me happy and this happiness can help me make other people happy in return so i don't really feel bad for being happy most off the time hehe. for me it is definitely my goal ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5	For me it‚Äôs just having some sort of peace within myself and knowing who I am 100% \n\nsimply being the person I want to be will be success to me.
3	There is no end game, I'm all about trying to ride this wave as best as I can, in the here and now, always. Looking at where the wave is gonna end or trying too hard to end up in any particular destination has always resulted in me wiping out.
3	Happiness is a mode of transportation, not a destination. 
3	My opinion is pursuing goals that are meaningful enough to the justify the inevitable suffering you will experience in life.\n\nThis is shaped largely by Viktor Frankl's book *Man's Search For Meaning,* where he also says: \n\n>"Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run‚Äîin the long-run, I say!‚Äîsuccess will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it"\n\n&#x200B;
3	My school would sometimes have ski trips. Every time I was on the lift alone, when it was getting to be twilight, the combination of light and scenery and cold and my smallness next to the mountain, would give me this amazing feeling inside. It was so beautiful and kind of joyous and swelling and achingly lonely all at the same time. I very much wanted to share it with someone, so they could feel amazing too, but whenever someone else came on the lift with me, the feeling wouldn't come. That's what this reminds me of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, have you read this, by The Oatmeal? I liked it. [https://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy)
2	Here's an emotional guidance scale - you might be interested to see it: [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/cd/b2/c2cdb214179af2222b50fe584a63ad89.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/cd/b2/c2cdb214179af2222b50fe584a63ad89.jpg)
2	Maybe it's cuz my mood shifts dramatically frequently, but a lengthy time of contentment would make me anxious. It makes me feel like I'm forgetting something or that something bad is around the corner.\n\nThat said, feeling content is a great feeling. Feeling like you don't have to worry about things def feels good.
2	Security.  Then peace.  Then happiness, love and everything else.
2	For me, I realized my main goal in life was to achieve peace and enlightenment. It‚Äôs not about being happy, it‚Äôs about acceptance and harmony. The balance between good and bad.

6	How can you spot an INFP?	
15	> The most reliable characteristic which allows to identify EII sociotype  by appearance - is a dispassionate face. The classic features of his  appearance resemble the faces of saints and martyrs from ancient icons.  \n>  \n> His face never shows any boisterous positive emotions. It can only  smile. At a distance, the expression on EII's face seems to show a  silent reproach towards everything negative that is happening around  him. The same is expressed in the tone of his voice.\n\nThat's from socionics. Generally, you can see a bit of a built in suffering and depth in our eyes. Clothing is rather plain and normal most of the time, even though we like people with a more creative and unusual style we don't want to stand out.\n\nIn terms of public behaviour I've found this to be fairly fitting:\n\n> The EII likes to watch people, assessing the emerging relationships, and  later joining the conversation. Himself is not inclined to initiate.  Certain sharpness, touchiness, resentment, inherent to the EII,  especially of [ethical subtype](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EII_subtypes),  make him not very comfortable in communication. His didactic or  moralizing tone, his monotone voice, quench any playful and happy mood,  orient people at more serious considerations, as if forcing them to  think about all the bad things that happen in this world.
1	I am not used to being included in a group.  That being said, I will notice someone in a group I am in who might be the same.  I might eben feel a little annoyed at them as they seem so simple, so boring.  If I can become self-aware soon enough I will consciously try to correct that, but usually it will be a few days later, I will think of that boring person and realize.....wait.  His suggestions were nice, he seemed tactful.  Maybe?\n\nWe are bery ...we emit this aura of "not useful" "not skilled" "simple."  ESTJ's and some other types will home in on this to basically torture us until we become mature enough to understand what it is that they are needing.\n\nThe INFP is the one who either is smiling, as the abobe said, or is bery dull.  Start prodding me with a hot iron and see what happens :)
5	How do you guys think would things in this world go under a predominantly INFP society as opposed to the contrasting personality type?	I don't exactly know how outlandish this question may seem, so pardon if it does, but I would be really curious to hear you guys's genuine thoughts on this.\n\nI'm more certain that most if not, none of the comments will receive any of my responses though, because reasons.\n\nIt might be nice to just read.
11	- More focus on the arts in schooling, maybe artistic careers being more highly coveted and better paid\n- Single bedroom apartments would be much more prevalent so that everyone can have their hermit caves!\n
3	I think you see this in countries like Japan, China, maybe Sweden Finland and Norway. To be sure, the United States is pretty extreme on the extrovert scale. 
2	I see large swathes of public areas cordoned off for noise-free regulations. The extension of the quiet "sacred space" (ie. churches, graveyards, etc.) to envelop places extrovert types usually inhabit. 
0	It would probably be a world less absorbed by economic status and more driven by the pursuit of happiness and contentedness (not necessarily a good thing, perhaps would lead to the neglect of important roles regarding the everyday running of a society). There would be a focus on the welfare and emotional well-being of the nation's people. And the criminal prosecution system would probably be driven be morality rather than justice. \n\nOverall, infp's tend to look at the bigger picture more than fine detail, so it would probably be a malfunctioning society with "good intentions". But to be fair any one-type ruled society would be off-balance :)
1	Where my Enneagram type 5s at?	I‚Äôve always known that I am INFP but there are sometimes when I feel different to the INFP community, mostly that I am not interested in expressing emotionally in an artistic way and that I am way more direct and even harsher than other INFPs. I think the type 5 explains this well.
1	I took a test and it said I'm enneagram 5w6\nI don't know what that means though so I'm not sure about the result, can someone explain what it means? (I'm INFP btw..)

7	What's your most feared sentence/word?	For me, it's "Leave me alone."
13	"We have to talk" 
4	LEAF me alone because that means there's a talking tree!
6	‚ÄúSlow down‚Äù when I bump into someone  or when someone is watching me make mistakes as I‚Äôm rushing  - that one almost always upsets me. I don‚Äôt necessarily fear hearing it but it‚Äôs always unexpected and triggers memories of stressful situations.\n\nI also hate hearing that someone didn‚Äôt understand what I said. I normally don‚Äôt say much but when I get comfortable and talk a lot, my speech can get somewhat slurred. Then I instantly regret starting the conversation in the first place.\n\n
3	do you speak english?????????? why are you so quiet??????????

1	Because I said so.
1	Sometimes you have to do what you dont want to do to survive in this world.\n\nWell if Im doing what I hate all the time what the fuck is the point? Yeah there are good times here and there but few and far between. Hopefully I feel better about this once school is over.
13	Don‚Äôt know what to do	Honestly don‚Äôt wanna live anymore, not suicidal but I hate life. I‚Äôm not appreciated, and you we‚Äôre so little of the population who will understand me? I hate how the genes that someone was born with can make them better than me.
7	Yeah, I‚Äôm feeling this tonight myself.  I just feel hopeless when it comes to finding romantic love.  But I know these feelings will pass.  \n\nHope you feel better.  You‚Äôre not alone in feeling this way.  We INFPs are prone to depression.  But the clouds will lift.\n\nWhen I get down I name 10 things I am grateful for.  That helps.
7	I understand, I hate my life. I too am not suicidal but adulting sucks, and everyone else's lives is better than mine. I really don't have much going for me. I wish I could have a redo in life or at least change things in the past to make it better. 
5	If you were doing anything that made you proud of yourself you wouldnt be throwing in the towel based on a lack of respect from others\n\nFigure out what you want 
3	Succeed anyways
1	Disclaimer: English is not my native language, and I am no therapist, just an empath.\n\nIt seems to me that you are in the kind of loop I sometimes get caught in.  I will tell you what works for me.\n\n\- Reserve time to deal with and accept your emotions. There's nothing worse than ignoring feelings when you are an INFP. Write them down if it helps you have a clearer image.\n\n\- Try to understand your current situation. The feeling of hating life comes from your mind constantly focusing on the negative and offering you generous details from your memories. You'll be given many examples of when you failed and why it happened.  It could be just one random event where you felt awkward being at. And that could easily develop into "I hate all parties and I don't even like people."  Or you might remember a single time when all you wanted was to be home alone, and turn it into : "I should never leave my house."\n\nWhat you need to do is to expose yourself to new scenarios to prove yourself it's not all black and white. You might not enjoy parties, but you could actually enjoy intellectual events where you can meet like minded people.\n\nYou might think the problem is out there, but it's just inside. Many INFPs start decorating their places when it gets messy inside their heads. While this could be therapeutic, it's not very effective. Share your thoughts with close friends who will offer you their perspective. Practice self care as a proof to yourself that you still know your worth. Go jogging. Think of what you need to change in your life and do it.\n\n\- Reconsider your thinking. You might genuinely believe that others have better lives because of their specific qualities - which you lack. Well, success is SO MUCH more than a set of skills. And you might not even want their kind of success when you understand how they define it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nP.S. INFPs are awesome!\n\n&#x200B;

12	Sunrise from the floor of a drilling rig.	
2	I love how the way the light goes on the sea it makes it look like a never-ending outrun style road with a sun in the distance 
2	heh i was doubting to post about the similar photo https://imgur.com/BSH7atz though its sunset. not a drilling rig floor, but irl it looked completely surreal, with snowstorm waves on the ground swirling pouring from the sun. your photo made me reaffirm again, that its crazy to think its the same object (the sun), we are all being in the difference places over the planet are looking at and photographing. hello from my sun to your sun :)\n\n
20	Mistaken for asexual?	Anyone else have something like this happen to them? A friend of mine is in a relationship, and has since made it her thing to set up other friends of hers on dates and such. After a few months, I noticed she hadn‚Äôt tried to set me up with anyone, so I asked point-blank why that was, and she said ‚ÄúI just never thought of you needing sex or dating or that kind of thing.‚Äù \n\nA lot of us here have trouble socializing, and for many of us, ‚Äúdating and relationships‚Äù are a big subcategory of that trouble. I hate the feeling that I‚Äôm missing out on those things just because my external presentation makes people think I don‚Äôt need or want those kinds of connections. Anyone else relate to this kind of feeling or experience?
14	I even thought I was asexual for some time just because no one had ever interested me. \nBut then I realized, I just need the connection first. \nBut yeah, for the more extrovert people we might seem not interested
5	Yes! I‚Äôve had multiple people say they thought I was asexual, which sucks because I really do want intimacy. I‚Äôm just good at suppressing it. 
3	Yes. My friends called me a plant in high school.
2	Yup, think of myself that way sometimes too! I just don't want to 'settle' like most people do. I find it hard to let people in, whereas most people go from relationship to relationship, sometimes I wish I could just settle just for any kind of connection but know deep down it wouldn't work. 
3	I don't know.  I'm a Christian so there are no suspicions about me not hooking up that I know of.  I'm certainly not asexual, but a lifetime of being convinced God's standard was the right ideal was reinforced by two marriages.  Now I'm older and I don't want the drama of hookups.  I don't like condoms, women lie about birth control, I don't believe in abortion or abandoning children, and my son's mother died, so I don't want another child taking more of myself from him.  It really doesn't matter what anyone says 
1	Yeah my dating friends are always presenting each other their date's friends but i am left out. They know i need it, but they probably think i am not relationship material and don't want to embarass themselves or their dates
1	I'm a demisexual. 
42	Just another little sunset, I use to live near this place üòä	
3	That looks so blissful 
3	I wish this sub had a flair for sunsets so i could just look through all of these wonderful pics :)
2	Roughly where is this
2	:) beautiful 
9	Philosophy for self-improvements?	I‚Äôm currently interested into a philosophy (Stoicism) and curious to know other philosophy that INFP finds useful especially for self-improvements. Any recommendations?
5	Stoicism is great. I have an interest in Quakerism as religion as it is attuned to peace, simplicity, and justice. They also hold silent meetings which are a slice of heaven themselves. \n\nMy own belief in self improvement? Go with what you innately know to be true about yourself when you are healthy and explore with self awareness. Build on your strengths and you will better yourself. You can't see every step when you stand at the bottom, but the next step is there.
3	While it won‚Äôt have specific ‚Äútechnical‚Äù advice, I‚Äôd recommend Albert Camus to gain perspective. It‚Äôs a brand of nihilism that I personally find highly motivating. 
6	Nihilism.
2	I was going to recommend stoicism after reading the title haha. I'm not to sure about other philosophies but in terms of stoicism, I am currently reading "meditations" by Marcus Aurelius and its given me a new, productive, more content outlook on life.
2	12 Rules for life by Dr Jordan Peterson is a exalent book if philosophy and self improvement is what you're looking for it's helped me improve beyond what I'd imagine, he takes inspection from great philosophers/phycologist such as Friedrich Nietzsche,Sigmund Freud,Carl Jung and many others, again highly recommend this book!
1	Epicureanism?
1	It‚Äôs more of a lifestyle with people even though it‚Äôs a philosophy: Minimalism. There‚Äôs even a sub Reddit for it!
1	Taoism(daoism) eastern philosophy, \n\nHelps INFPs focus their minds and helps keep my feelings regulated by giving them purpose or a place.
1	Egoism! Such as the writings of Max Stirner and Raoul Vaneigem.\n\nEgoism doesn't necessarily advocate that one act selfishly (in the colloquial sense) but that they rid themselves of the illusions that distort one's real desires, such as religion, morality, and law. It's a good counterweight to the INFP tendency towards being timid.
64	I see we share a love for sunsets. Here‚Äôs a spooky one (taken outside my old place)	
3	Moody and atmospheric. Very cool!
3	Wicked!!!  I <3 silhouettes!
2	:) beautiful 
24	Sunset	
150	You guys have been posting sunsets, so here is a sunrise 3 months ago, didn‚Äôt edit anything.	
4	Where is this place?
2	Thanks for sharingüòç
2	Very magical
1	:D That's beautiful lol
21	a little video of my favorite places in the world (: i watch this whenever i feel too stressed/ overwhelmed by people	
1	wow so beautiful and what a great idea
1	this is so pretty, thank you for posting this 
1	This made me cry a little :‚Äô) so beautiful 
10	Assumptions	So sick of people calling me naive or "gullible" (I hate this word so much it makes me sick) because I'm nice, polite, and friendly to people. People seem to think I'm an airhead and that I don't understand certain situations when the likelihood is I have a pretty good understanding and I decided to not just be a prick about something. I'm so sick of it at this point I can't even explain myself properly haha. 
6	I completely understand. I've had major issues with people talking down to me. I've especially had this problem in my romantic life. I think you'd agree that we have an entire world hidden within our minds. People can only see so much of that. Other shit just feels so trivial relatively speaking. All I would say is to just hold on to people that can understand that, they're as rare as gold. 
2	I relate
3	Isn‚Äôt it hilarious we are all gonna day one day? Good stuff.	die*
5	Why is this Hilarious? I assume you mean die.
1	yeet.  let's both reincarnate after 1000 more cycles of the universe's death & rebirth.
4	Anybody feel like an imposter INFP? Do I come across that way?	I just watched a bunch of DaveSuperpowers videos and now I'm doubting my entire perception of myself. According to them, we tend to flip our stack (thinkers think they're feelers and feelers think they're thinkers, etc.).\n\nIf you flip the INFP stack (Fi/Ne/Si/Te) you get the ENTJ stack (Te/Si/Ne/Fi) or heck maybe I'm confusing my values with tribe values and I'm actually INTP (Ti/Ne/Si/Fe). \n\nHeck I feel like I'm a feeler and I feel everything super intensely, but I also freaking suck at being a feeler and using my emotions positively, so I guess being a thinker makes more sense in the bigger picture and maybe I just overidealize feelers but idk.
7	You're over thinking..... ironically, probably leads you more towards the INFP archetype. Though, seems to me the only ones worried about imposters might be INFJs.....seems MBTI is a much bigger reality for them. Also, this self reflecting trying to really understand yourself lends itself to INFP.\n\n\nThere are the basic INFP archetype main functions, then there are shadow functions. Any functions you have can sometimes be used more than another. It's still the same thing.\n\n\nWe all change as we experience life and reflect in events, influences, and ourselves. It's entirely possible to develop and use other functions. It's also entirely possible to be fairly healthy emotionally and mentally. Just kind of balanced all around.\n\nHonestly, humans are way more than just those 4 letters destinated by MBTI. 
1	Many of us try to deceive our self and others by pretending to be extroverts thinking that will make life easier. I don‚Äôt do that anymore. It sounds ironic but try coming out as an introvert!
9	So what is your study technique?	I'm a college student and I started trying the pomodoro technique because I tend to procrastinate a ton, but I am never satisfied with the 5-10 min breaks in between and end up finding something far more interesting that makes me skip the next 25 min study session... I am curious, what do you people do to study, combat procrastination, etc?
6	I read something thats important, try memorize it. Then i walk around for abit thinking about. Check back to see if i got it right. Repeat for the next thing then do a review of the last important thing.\n\nIt gets me 70-80% on my exams depending how thorough i am with the info. Takes awhile tho, my study sessions are usually an hour long. I use flash cards if im being serious.
5	I joined the study hall server on discords and joined their screenshare groups. Work is so much easier to do for me when I know someone is watching also this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn8zz\_ilPIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn8zz_ilPIY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also listen to this when I study, [https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXa2SPUyWl8Y5?si=GGxfgPbDQte1ebdEoXOCjA](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXa2SPUyWl8Y5?si=GGxfgPbDQte1ebdEoXOCjA) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also do the pomodoro technique and essentially to keep me inspired I break down bigger tasks into smaller tasks 
3	Maybe...\n\nTry to get interested in your subject so that studying is not work. Look up background information to make it more interesting if you can.\n\nHighlight important things in your books and then try to quiz yourself on it regularly.\n\nStart a competition with a competitive friend to see who can get the best grades in each class?\n\nI don't really know. I didn't study or do any homework in high school. I got high grades in college, but that was mostly because I was dealing with the suicide of someone close to me and threw myself into school work as a distraction.
3	I recently started using the pomodori technique, and it's been helpful for me. My method is to do something that gets me out of my chair and let's my mind take rest on the break, but not something so interesting that I get distracted. I usually put away laundry, wash dishes, tidy the house and things like that. If I browse the internet or get into a hobby I'll be lost.
2	I play music ND try to overcome burnout by playing Beat Saber.  Only half the time I don't stop playing until I'm exhausted so it back fires.\n\nI'm testing some focus music streams from  focus@will, and they seem to work.  It suggests ambient for me, and I don't particularly like it, but it really seems to help my focus.  It's supposed to be designed to accommodate the brains ability to focus so at 45 minutes for example it may mix in something different to counter what may have been a natural diversion.  I'm reading psychology to it with apparent focus and did a full chapter in a setting.  Pretty impressive.\n\nI'm 41.  I breezed through never studying once or even ever doing  homework really   College is a new challenge for sure, especially online classes where the instructors take it upon themselves to over compensate for the format and completely disregard why it exists for busy people.
2	It's discipline and force of habit.\nIt feels really awesome/productive if you stick to the plan and the total number of Pomodoros for the day is a huge number.
2	I read first, then write. Summarizing the subjects, reading and reading again till understand the logic.
6	Don't ever read A Fault in Our Stars if you ever want to feel again. A warning	
4	I bet it's not as bad as "Never Let Me Go?"\n\nIn perspective, I LIKE being scared or taken for a weird ride.  I went through a phase where I would strip down naked and put all the bedlinnens along with my clothes in the wash, and turn on the A/C so I would feel cold and take out all the lightbulbs and take a bit of Ayahuasca or LSD and watch horror movies in my apartment alone.  (Yes, really)\n\nBut "Never Let Me Go" REALLY messed with me.  I hated the way it made me feel.
3	Everyone in this subreddit NEEDS to read "the peculiar life of a lonely Postman". The entire book just screams infp
2	r/explainlikeimfive please? 
2	Looking for Alaska is his best book IMO. it's rough too. 
1	Tbh this book pisses me off because it romanticizes cancer and uses it for shock value. But I only changed my opinion on it after I read some critiques that pointed this out to me.  
2	Artist block (B;_|||_)B What to do??? How do you guys solve this?	
2	Maybe not for everybody, but I switched media. Lately took up photography from lifelong drawing and painting.
2	Get your mind off whatever you're doing artistically and start again after some time. Start a new project after doing something else for a while, but never stop trying.
3	I have been an u healthy NTFP	I'm glad to be NTFP.  It wasn't good to be ignorant of what makes me special, but I learned about it at a great time to make the most out of part 2 of my life.  However long that part will be.  I seem to be in decent health, but I suspect trauma has taken a toll.  Trauma that was enhanced by being NTFP but ignorant of what it meant.  I wish I had known sooner when dealing with toxic people that my commitment wasn't as good as a thing as I thought it was.  It still worked out in many ways, but it's hard to be sure it was worth it.  I think I had much more to offer the world than I have by being a victim, a title I refused to accept, but clearly fits in hindsight.\n\n
1033	Stole this from Facebook üòÇ	
74	I feel this\nI often just listen to people talking about something I like, I almost desperately want to join the conversation, but I'm just too shy and scared it'll be awkward. 
115	It's funny cuz this guy is wearing rose-tinted glasses.
18	*Pretty much my entire existence because I'm awkwardüòÇ*
17	This is the worst, especially if you pick up on something that is factually incorrect and don't wanna face conflict for saying it's wrong...
29	We be intuitively creepin by accident. Empathy is a hell of a drug 
14	Oh god oh no this is absolutely me :(
12	And then they see me staring intensely and think I'm mentally impaired. 
12	Not even kidding, I will hear people joking with their friends from afar and start laughing with them... while sitting alone....
12	Ok but 55% of the time you brace yourself and join in, it‚Äôs super awkward. Gotta love that 45% though!
6	W h y are you calling me out
6	YES WHY CAN'T I JUST GET UP AND TALK TO THEM???\n\nI feel so understood
4	I'm almost crying because of thid right now, thinking about the friendships I didn't with the coolest people I've met
5	I do this sometimes when I‚Äôm waiting tables lol kind of, less stare-y though. I‚Äôll want so badly to comment but it‚Äôs super inappropriate/unwanted so I‚Äôll just end up pouring refills real slow for enough time not to warrant any attention/be a complete weirdo just so I can eavesdrop üòú
3	Yup...that‚Äôs about right 
3	I get you. 
3	Sooo true! üòÇ
3	This is absolutely the definition of reddit for meüòÜ
3	stop it hurts
2	My roommates are so similar to me and I always hear them talking about stuff I'm into as well but I'm too scared/don't know how to start a conversation
2	Lol
2	Yes! lol!!!
2	me\n\n&#x200B;
2	And thinking how great friend you would be
2	ISFJ and I do this too lol
38	an observation about you guys?	im an ENFP and i have a few INFPs that are close to me. 2 of them are in my family and 2 of them are my friends. i won't talk much about the 2 in my family because i think both of them are unhealthy INFPs and it would be unfair to stereotype INFPs based on them.\nhowever, based on my two INFP friends, there's a few common traits i've observed.\n\n1) get along with everyone. they don't beef with their acquaintances and dislike conflict.\n\n2) either very emotional or very detached \n\n3) kind of self-centred. not selfish, they can be generous, but a lot of times they're mostly looking out for themselves (compared to my other friends), and doing what's best for them\n\n4) unwilling or reluctant to compromise or change their ways (esp. to accommodate sb else) \n\n5) is liked by almost everyone who knows them\n\n6) unpredictable at times, it's hard to set a particular date with them, kind of (not really) flaky. \n\nedit: 7) INFPs are extremely loyal to one person (or one group). they're friendly to others as well, but once they have found their soul mate they don't really seek to find others that may be on that level too. \n\ndo y'all see yourselves in these traits? take note, i'm not saying that all INFPs are like that but my INFP friends are quite alike in these areas and im curious if they're an INFP thing. 
23	I connect with all of these. \nNumber 3 is interesting and I like how you worded it. It took me awhile to realize how self-centered I was, I think INFP has some innate perfectionism they hold on to. This causes them to constantly consider how they act and how they can improve. This is more (from my perspective) an attempt to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù to an ideal, and not a dismissal of others. Imo, its more trying to constantly be better for others and ourselves.\n\nSo it doesn‚Äôt have selfish intention. But I‚Äôve noticed too much of this inwardness and ideal chasing can make you blind to others wants and needs and expressions, which can come across as both self-centered AND selfish. 
9	This is pretty much me. Whenever conflict *does* arise between acquaintances, I prefer to keep myself neutral and try to understand both sides, doing my best to not get into the fight.  \n\n\nFor #2, I think I'm detached; I don't really see myself as a very emotional person.
5	Seems like the whole package.\n\n1) Yeah, getting along with everyone is a good idea because it is like achievement of harmony\n\n2) True :3\n\n3) It really depends. Some are self-centred in a healthy way vs in a unhealthy. Who in this world doesn't look out for themselves?\n\n4)Yes yes yes, I hate it especially when I get told in an authoritarian tone to do something as if I'm a dog being trained for obedience and fueling others' egos.\n\n5) :3 Yes won't you like me? UwU\n\n6) Not sure if it is a general INFP thing, I am known for being flaky but that is only when I'm hanging out with you so often that I need my own time. Generally my ISFJ friend who asks me hang out, I always have the time for them and set aside time for them and I EVEN prefer setting aside time and date for them.\n\nFor sure these generalisations have a point but there's always an exception to the rule.
4	Yep, I agree. \n\nI think self centered is how INFPs get after years of being taken advantage of. I could never say no and spent many years of my life bending over backwards for the people I love. And sometimes, even for people I didn‚Äôt really like.\n\nI‚Äôm older and wiser now. 
3	I think that only a little of those apply to me.\n\n1. I really try to get along with everyone but sometimes there's friction with some personalities. In particular, anyone with a J or some T's. Sometimes there are fights and it really frustrates me that it escalates to that but it doesn't happen often. I try to avoid them. \n\n2. Yes, I used to be almost only super emotional. But the emotional detachment thing started to show up gradually in my life ever since I started school.\n\n3. Focused on myself, yes. Doing what's best for myself? No. An individual but not an individualist. I don't put myself first. It's not that I don't put myself first in terms of life necessarily. But in terms of relationships with people I put them first. That's a big reason why people don't like me. Ironic. \n\n4. In the big picture? Yes. Small things? Sometimes. Daily life? Rarely. \n\n5. No way, almost nobody likes me.\n\n6. Maybe a little in terms of dates. In terms of unpredictability as a person, for most people, extremely unpredictable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
2	I disagree with 2. And 4. \nI'm willing to change my ways. However I won't change for other people because it usually goes against my values... Also makes no sense why I should be the one making the changes and not the other person? (Despite saying this I'm usually the one compromising to keep the peace with loved ones) \nHowever, I'm willing to change after informing myself (but not when people tell me to change) if that makes sense.\nFor the rest of your points it's hard to hear but I think they're mostly true.\n 
2	1 Yes, everyone likes me i‚Äôm great!\n2. I am very detached. I always score very high in assertive on 16personalities, and people sometimes mistype me as an IxSx type just cuz i‚Äôve adapted to fitting in with other guys as a first impression\n3. Nahhhhhh man. I grew up around people who were self centered, and that‚Äôs one quality i can‚Äôt stand. Yeah i look out for myself duh i have to keep on living lol but i‚Äôll help anyone. \n4. I do like to do things my way, but as long as whatever method works i actually don‚Äôt care enough to argue. But! I will not change my values for anyone, unless i hear a very good argument. \n5. Yeah I‚Äôm great!\n6. Oddly, out of all of the extroverted friends i have, i‚Äôm often the one trying to do new and fun things \n\nAll in all, pretty much yeah. 
2	3 is a good point. I can become very defensive or even passive-aggressive if I feel like people are trying to "take" from me.\n\nMore importantly, there's a bit of momentum to this. Like if I've been having a bad day the perfectionism kicks in and  I want to catch up to my goals/wanting to feel accomplished for the day. If someone comes by later in the evening, while I'm feeling this pressure on myself, I may react negatively when they want me to do something else. I'll see them as part of the big ball of distractions I need to push away before I can truly "focus."\n\nI'm also glad you feel like we get along with everyone, because I feel like I'm just boring and non-confrontational to the point of having no personality. :P
2	connected w all of them but especially being flakey. I always want to make plans w everyone but once I do I‚Äôm forgetful/don‚Äôt actually have the energy to commit to really doing it so I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm  really bad at planning/ making a schedule for myself without it seeming too overwhelming. \n\nI can schedule in my work shifts but anything outside of that is really difficult and overwhelming so I tend to just go with the day to day flow of things and that seems to be less overwhelming. if someone asked me to hangout day of I totally would, but if it‚Äôs a week in advance I‚Äôm going to flake for sure hahaha. damn INFPs and our inability to be good planners. our energy levels can be soooo low at times. \n\nalso INFPs are self-centered because we value Life and we know that what we are living is SOLELY for us and we want everyone else to be just as into themselves as we are. we definitely are constantly giving to others but will not compromise what we need in order to be happy, even if that means being selfish sometimes. 
2	1) yes I hate conflict I'm a big people pleaser, I hate being in situations where I can feel tension between people, I want everyone to get along\n2) Yes we tend to be fairly emotional, sometimes when its a lot we detatch, on the surface we can appear very calm and aloof\n3) yes unfortunately we are self-centred, we pride ourselves on our individuality, kinda play the sad loner and put ourselves first (most of the time)\n4) hmm not sure about the compromise thing I think we can very easily do this as long as it doesn't compromise our values\n5) I hope I'm liked by people that know me, I don't give anyone bad vibes and I can't be angry at people\n6) not really that flaky most often on time for things\n
2	Yes to two. No to all others. \n\n&#x200B;
2	All of these ring extremely true with me, especially #6. I‚Äôve had people directly describe me as unpredictable.
2	1. I absolutely hate conflict. It's such a hassle, so I'd rather put on a happy face and try to keep things amicable even if I'd really like to get away. I'm a good mediator though.\n2. I used to be really (even overly) emotional until I got hurt really badly in a relationship. I'm more detached now; I can tell my SO would like me to be more emotional but it's hard, it feels like I've put on a mask I can't take off and would be mortified if I did.\n3. After the aforementioned relationship, I realized that I was putting my ex on a pedestal and never allowing myself anything. I've learned to embrace not being outright selfish, but being nicer to myself and allowing myself more space to be happy. I guess that can be considered self-centered in a way, but the way I was going before, it was self-destructive. It's not selfish intention-- it's more a concept of spreading yourself so thin for the people you care about that you have nothing left for yourself, so unless you sometimes put yourself first, you'll be completely miserable.\n4. I do tend to have a bit of a perfectionist streak when it comes to some things. I've noticed things like that when it comes to my SO moving in with me in the close future, and a lot of the time it's over dumb stuff but it matters to me (example, using fresh garlic while cooking instead of buying pre-minced garlic). I feel stupid but when it comes to cooking I feel so stubborn. It feels even more stupid to write it out.\n5. It comes with the territory of being a people-pleaser at heart. I can honestly admit that the opposite is true on my end-- I tend to dislike people more often than like them (usually before I get to know them), but you'd never know because I'm pretty good at compartmentalizing. Trust issues are also a thing that contributes to that, it's not all personality.\n6. I wouldn't call myself particularly unpredictable. I like routines, but I do have my impulsive moments when it gets too boring. I'm not flaky, but you should never, ever, ever set a particular time for meeting with me. If you do, tell me to be there 30 minutes before you actually want me there because I'm perpetually late. That's more an ADHD thing and less a personality thing though.\n\nI hope I don't sound mean saying stuff like that. I'm not a mean person, I swear. Just kinda distant for personal reasons.
2	Yeah these are mostly me. With 2, I think that can be because of how little I usually show, whereas under major stress its too hard for me to hold onto it. Also 4 is more of a case of "I make no attempt to control you, so expect resistance if you decide to attempt control over me", but of course my definition of control is a bit broad admittedly.\n\nFor me personally, I can't relate to 6, I keep good time, usually 5 minutes early to everything (of course then I stress about whether the other person might flake for that 5 minutes, but that's another story)
2	<3 your list my Ne oberlord.\n\nPretty spot on. \n\nAppreciate your time and consideration.\n\nJust one I would like to touch on.  I will do almost anything to accommodate people.  But not on things that *matter*.  It is also a way to find out what they are really made of.  If you start habing to accommodate in ridiculous ways or they don't really gibe a fuck about your opinion in any case...ya drop that shit like your new single.  Also it helps them perhaps strengthen any impression they may habe that I am a moron and will be easily tricked.  Kinda a "security through like completelly going along with unholy asshattery to find out truth through one's own honest ebil intentions, encouraged by hiding not-moronic perception and cognitibe ability that actually exists, although it is debatable."\
2	Honestly your observations here are more accurate for me than professional summaries
1	I don't agree with some of that. I strongly agree about the avoiding conflict but the selfish,unwilling to compromise I think is really off for me. I am usually letting people ahead of me in many situations where I see non infps walking all over me for it. As far as compromise, If it is a moral/deep issue I might not compromise but mostly I want peace, I want everyone to be happy, I respect others beliefs and will listen to them and validate their feelings. Also I don't feel liked I feel like I see through people and I'm weird and they don't like me. 
1	Yes.\n\nI get along with everyone, except the people I care about. I feel a responsibility to tell them when I think they're making a bad choice. If I care more about you than I care about avoiding conflict, then I care a lot.
1	To some extent, yes.  Highly emotional and self-centered.  I‚Äôm a recovering addict.  Over the years I have matured some and have worked on my defects.  Lol.
1	I don‚Äôt agree with 1 or 6 I get into a lot of fights and am a pretty angry person.
1	Omg yesss my that‚Äôs exactly how I feel with my INFP bestfriend!
1	For #2 I feel I can be either one (but yes **very**)\n\nFor #3 I feel that that's kind of the natural INFP state, but when there is someone to care for the INFP becomes too involved (and/or selfless).\n\nFor #6 I'm the opposite but probably just me\n\nThe rest are spot on without a doubt
7	Weird	I feel like a bit weird for liking the concept of abs and striving to get them. I value Longevity but I don't know whether I'd exercise to the point where I have abs... I need to make a diet now
2	I also want abs, might as well be in good physical condition if Im gonna be here. 
1	I know that feel, I'm getting there
7	A rock song I wrote and recorded in my living room.	
1	Hell yeah! I really liked this :) Nice job!
5	coworker harassment?	.
2	Did she accept your friend request?  I don't think you did anything wrong.  I've had coworkers look me up and do that before (that I didn't know knew my full name or anything).  Some people also just ask not to close cause people don't like closing... it might be that.  Especially if before she had been showing some interest, I think it's normal and okay that you friend requested her!
2	I think you may be overthinking this.  You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.  It‚Äôs perfectly normal to try to coordinate breaks and look someone up on Facebook.  There are lots of ways you could have found her full name, too, so if I were her ‚Äî I wouldn‚Äôt be phased by that at all.\nIt‚Äôs not a big deal.\n\nIs it possible her schedule changed due to the start of Winter Semester?  Even if she‚Äôs not in school, a lot of the other cashiers might be ‚Äîwhich could cause schedules to get shuffled around a bit.  \n\nDid she accept your friend request?  Did she seem to enjoy chatting with you during your breaks?  If so, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.  You could maybe even reach out to her on Facebook and ask her out.  :). If not, just be friendly during the times you do work together and let it go.
1	Ya don't let this make you crazy.  My adbice is to find something really cool you know has no intention of gibing you mixed singles.  There are sick and twisted people eberywhere.  You don't know if she is or is not, but her actions habe indictated she is bery confused, or is gaslighter.
12	interested in seeing if anyone would like to be INFP friends	I know we all really value like-minded people and I can‚Äôt get on with anyone well enough to open up other than other INFPs. we can just message each other everyday and talk about life and support each other. idk.... I need support in my life and I need to feel like I‚Äôm not crazy/someone understands the things I am going through. \n\nI am a 19 y/o F and would prefer to be friends with someone around the same age. :) \n\nEdit: just send me a message if you wanna be friends :) I don‚Äôt know how hahah 
3	It feels like I wrote this üòÇ 
3	Hiya
2	I'm interested. I don't think I've met many if any INFPs and I'm trying to push myself to experience as much as I can soo, Is a 16 y/o M too young? 
1	Hi, where are you from?
1	hey...i‚Äôm down. 
1	In it, if it's not to late lol. I'm 21 by the way, is that too old ?
2	I am by no means fat... but I got somewhat of a belly... it‚Äôs just the belly. What would be the best way of going about losing it? I‚Äôd rather not work out, but if it‚Äôs necessary, I‚Äôll do it.	
4	You should just workout in general Keep your body and mind healthy 
2	I've lost 60 pounds and when it comes to weightloss diet is 9935279449 times more important than working out (although I would recommend working out just for general health). [Fill this out](https://www.active.com/fitness/calculators/calories) and then eat 300-400 calories less than that per day.\n\nThe most annoying part is having to look up how many calories are in each thing you eat.
2	Quick example: There are 3500 calories in 1 pound of fat. If you work out for 30 mins on the elliptical, let's say, you might burn 300 calories. In 12 days you burn one pound of fat then. \n\nExercise is critically important. It also helps with metabolism. \n\nNutrition is critically important. No more high fructose corn syrup. Lots of vegetables and fruit. Maybe a Mediterranean diet. How many calories you take in (as a previous poster mentioned) vs how many calories your body uses per day, is also very important. \n\nTl;Dr diet and exercise are both important. \n\nSource: This is how I got in shape. =) 
1	I recommend jogging a few miles, a few days per week.\n\n&#x200B;
1	You could do yoga exercises or walk more often
1	Eat few meals low in calorie and rich in most things your body needs and moderate sustainable exercise. People who do those very fast-sweat-inducing-seizure-like activity is taking the wrong approach that I believe lead to more wear and tear on the body. Just walk for like 2-3 hours a week if you're lazy and that would be acceptable although working your other limbs in just as mild of an action can be more beneficial too. You would eventually experience small senses of euphoria after these "workouts". It shouldn't be called work. You should be able to enjoy it. And if you're just focused on the self-image you're taking the wrong approach. There's a much bigger picture and you're only focusing on that one flower amidst everything else beautiful about it.
1	Work out full body weight lifting 3 times a wrrk and then do a couple days pf cardio on your off days.

19	INFP boyfriend - what is helping you guys?	Hey Guys,\n\nMy boyfriend identifies with being an INFP. \n\nI don't know If you guys really have the same problems Like He has but I thought it might be worth a try.\n\nHe is a really gentle, cute and creative guy but He can't stop feeling sorry for himself. He is afraid of everything, especially of standing up for himself. \n\nHe is an idealist but He doesn't recognize it. He longs for being recognized by like-minded people but He is afraid of getting hurt so He never opens up. \n\nCurrently he is very unhappy with his Job, but he doesn't change it, because he doesn't know to where and what He wants to do. \n\nI keep telling him to just jump into anything new, If He is unsure what He wants because I think that it IS more helpful to simply try new things to find out what you want than to Just try to figure it out in your head by yourself.\n\nHe is actually a Software Developer but wishes to be something Else but doesn't know what.\n\nDoes that sound very INFP to you? Do you have any suggestions on what I could do to Help him. I am really at an end here. I keep telling him, that he has to decide to be open and do new shit, but He doesn't seem to get it the way I am telling it to him.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nPS: I seem to be an ENFP. If that helps in any way? ü§∑\n\nEdit: thank you all, you wonderful people. I really got some insight today! You are great, guys!
7	I think it‚Äôs sweet that you‚Äôre reaching out to us.  Your bf reminds me of myself many years ago.  Ironically, I was a software developer.  INFPs are often good with language, and computer programming is a language.  However, working as a cog in the machine or for a paycheck did not fulfill me.  I quit that gig to pursue being a singer/songwriter.  But then I had many more mountains to climb.  But I digress...this is not about me.\n\nHe needs to try new things and get over the fears.  He probably has some creative gift that he uses to express his innermost thoughts.  He may also be a good therapist or teacher.  I‚Äôm not sure what his passion is but he needs to follow it.  Perhaps that‚Äôs where you can encourage him.  \n\nMy friend is an INFJ and he sent me some youtube vids that helped me.  Try these on him.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/R9Df2Nrdn8U\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bSUgYPJ8A0Y\n\nHope this helps!
6	I had to check your profile to make sure you weren't my bf because your description sounds exactly like me, like every single point you listed. My bf is even an ENFP like you :)\n\nIt sounds like he needs to make some major decisions. He is also going to need to make these decisions on his own, otherwise they won't feel authentic to him. Unfortunately, decision making is not our strong suit as we tend to get overwhelmed by all of the possibilities out there and instead freeze up.\n\nYou telling him he needs to do new stuff isn't what he needs to hear. It's coming from a good place, but he already knows that and it's probably stressing him out. What he doesn't know is *how* to do that, and that's where you can help.\n\nI'm going through job searching as well and what's worked for me is taking things slowly, one step at a time. One day working on revising my resume. One day writing the outline for my cover letter, another day for filling it in. One day applying to 2 or 3 jobs that sound interesting, and the next day applying to 2 or 3 in a different field. It may have taken longer than if I had done all of those in the same day, but I've felt less stressed and more positive about the process than if I had done everything at once.\n\nYou should definitely talk to him and first see if finding a new job is something he really wants. It might not be a straightforward answer - I'm not in love with my current job, but the pay is much better than anything I've been able to find, so I'm willing to endure it for now while keeping an eye on job postings. If he's serious about it, then helping him set goals that he feels he can handle is definitely helpful. Be flexible in what he is ok defining a goal as, he may want to start small at the beginning. And that's fine, once we see progress and momentum toward the goal it's much easier to find motivation.
3	I wonder if he's on a journey to self realization yet ? If not he's on the path to it. He needs to find out who he is and what he wants. Sounds like he may or may not be in tune with his feelings. I can only speculate with what you gave me.
3	Oh look, it's me.
3	As an INFP I can relate to not wanting to open up out of fear of getting hurt. Only because it hurts like a bitch n we start questioning everything. I think he will learn in time that everything can be scary, and it will be scary, but he‚Äôs strong enough to beat anything up until death so. He will figure his own shit out but he will face his fears and be okay afterwards. Just stay by his side and keep being supportive. I know we can be whiny bitchy fucks sometimes but just let us figure it out ourselves. We like to take things in and figure it out. 
2	Some good advice here already, but I think it's also helpful to show him that you have the same insecurities. I really love it (and as an ENFP, you're the same type as my best friends!) when others are able to relate their experiences to mine. Whether that means sharing your own goals with him or just agreeing and going along with it when he complains, that sometimes is just as important to us as giving interrogative, practical advice. He needs to know that even if things aren't perfect right now, there's a bit of wiggle room and he can still enjoy his day-to-day life. It's important to not give up on things he enjoys even when larger feelings of aimless come into the picture.
2	>He is a really gentle, cute and creative guy but He can't stop feeling sorry for himself.\n\nIt‚Äôs okay to be disappointed with outcomes, but feeling sorry for yourself is a form of learned helplessness. Positioning ourselves for success is just as important as our intentions. Time and chance happens to all, as Ecclesiastes says‚Äîone doesn‚Äôt know whether this will succeed, or that, or both, or neither. So it‚Äôs best to throw spaghetti on the wall and see what sticks and count your losses and move on asap when it doesn‚Äôt seem to stick.\n\n>He is afraid of everything, especially of standing up for himself.\n\nIf he isn‚Äôt standing up for himself, he won‚Äôt stand up for his family when they become as familiar to him as he is to himself. This is also tied in to him feeling sorry for himself. Self-respect is more important than his altruistic behaviors towards others. He‚Äôll learn to love others better if he starts from a place of self-respect.\n\n>He is an idealist but He doesn't recognize it. He longs for being recognized by like-minded people but He is afraid of getting hurt so He never opens up.\n\nBeing regarded well by many is one of the biggest factors of an INFP‚Äôs happiness. If he‚Äôs not going to open up, he is one of his biggest obstacles to his happiness. There be dragons, but the dragons are the ones guarding the treasure.\n\n>Currently he is very unhappy with his Job, but he doesn't change it, because he doesn't know to where and what He wants to do.\n\nINFPs are extremely critical of what they \*want\*. They know what other people \*want\* better than they themselves, and this is actually wired into their cognitive functioning. It‚Äôs not hypocrisy, it‚Äôs just how they are. A better question for INFPs to ask themselves is ‚ÄúWhat are my needs and what should I do to meet those needs?‚Äù It makes the question more related to taking dutiful responsibility for the self and not about wish-fulfillment. INFPs are critical about their own futures, so telling them to focus on a goal/particular outcome will have them jumping to extremely assumptive conclusions, whether positive or negative. (edit: I see that there is an example of this in him turning down job offers. This is critical Ni, if you're familiar with the eight-function model of Jungian typology. You'll find more comments on this in my other post I linked below.)\n\n>I keep telling him to just jump into anything new, If He is unsure what He wants because I think that it IS more helpful to simply try new things to find out what you want than to Just try to figure it out in your head by yourself.\n\nYou are right. INFPs need to try new things without being obsessed with a particular outcome and assess what they actually like after the fact than before. And not just trying something once, but sticking to something for a sustained period of time so they have enough data to post-process with accuracy.\n\n>He is actually a Software Developer but wishes to be something Else but doesn't know what.\n\nTry new things to learn more about what you are. And I argue that an INFP learns more about themselves by making wrong choices than following successes.\n\n>but He doesn't seem to get it the way I am telling it to him.\n\nIf you‚Äôre an ENFP, good luck obligating an INFP. INFPs want what YOU want. Not what YOU want for THEM. They need to feel sincere obligation to approach something as a duty and not desire. They need to be dutiful to themselves for self-respect.\n\n>Any ideas?\n\nI made a long post here for an INTP trying to get an INFP out of a rut. Parse what relevant info you can from it.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/aj102y/how\_do\_you\_cheer\_up\_a\_friend\_after\_a\_breakup/eetdfgx](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/aj102y/how_do_you_cheer_up_a_friend_after_a_breakup/eetdfgx)\n\nThat's all I have for now. Best wishes.
3	I hang myself for the devil	
2	M'kay. What's this mean?
7	I do this really awful thing as an INFP...	I like to date new people... A LOT because people are so complex from each other and also I‚Äôm just needy. \n\nI make everyone fall super hard for me and then I totally syke out and pull away SUPER randomly after I‚Äôm already invested into them and we‚Äôve established a 1-2+ months period of hanging out/ ‚Äúdating.‚Äù \n\nThis really confuses the person and leaves them very insecure/unsure of themselves. \n\nI don‚Äôt know why I do this? \n\nMaybe love feels too real and it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt understand yet?? (I‚Äôve always been uncomfortable saying I love you to ANYONE, including my parents) \n\nMaybe I find the flaws and fixate on them? I know I have a habit of creating a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù world with the person at the beginning of the relationship and as soon as that idea is shattered I get paranoid. I‚Äôm almost CONVINCED I‚Äôm going to find a ‚Äúsoul mate‚Äù where it just feels like everything fits, but everyone tells me that‚Äôs not the case. I refuse to settle though???? \n\nMaybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm simply too self-Involved and focused on what I need to be happy. \n\nDoes anyone else do this? Please enlighten me if you have the answers. 
10	This is a really hurtful thing to do and those people probably carry that hurt into every relationship they engage in. Instead of asking others if they do that to justify your behavior, ask what you need to do to improve and never do this to another person. Maybe you need to talk to a counselor or be open about your past with all your partners. Maybe you have personal baggage that needs addressing before you date again. There is not one single toxic behavior that is ever excusable because of your Myers-Brigg type
3	I met an INFP gal about a month ago.  \n\nIt was electric.  I was really kinda in shock that this wonderful and stimulating woman was really interested in me, really appreciated my listening to her, understanding, it was awesome.\n\nThen she kinda was like as you said.  Long story short.\n\nI kinda am where I miss her greatly.  Like I miss her really really bad.  But I habe been on these roller coasters dozens and dozens of times, and I am bery much not insecure, in more than I did question strongly my sanity in not pushing her away, and had that usual dread eberything is going to fall apart, as it did.  That moment.  That one moment.....you know eberything from this point on is going to hurt.   And it does.  It is beautiful. :)\n\nThank you for your post.  You help me balidate my own self-esteem.  What there might be of it.  Which being said I do habe positibe self-esteem.  :)\n\nbut no b key
5	I do this a bit too, I desperately want people to like me and then as soon as they try and get close I tend to very quickly shut them off. I think I'm very picky with who I let in to my life, I'm used to keeping people well away haha. If you have an idea in your head of a perfect partner I'm sure you will find that person in time, INFPs strive for this "soul mate", I think as you mature as a person you're more likely to find someone like this? I don't really tell my parents I love them very much either it feels odd to say. To be honest if you are needy and enjoy dating I'd say keep doing that and enjoy yourself within limits of safety, maybe just let people know you have a hard time letting people in? And let them down gently at the end? Maybe try in the future to get a little less invested yourself and remind yourself what's happened in the past, and also the people you'll meet in the future will make you forget about them. Don't know if this makes sense but I relate to what you're saying
1	Are you afraid of something? I have a long standing habit of avoidant behavior I'm trying to correct. Stuff like this tends to be rooted in fear. But sometimes it's masked as well so you can't even admit to yourself you're afraid.
1	My first ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship of 2 years was founded upon that fabled ‚Äúsoul-mate connection‚Äù people claim INFPs make up in the haze of idealized youth. \n\nNow, don‚Äôt get me wrong- true love isn‚Äôt perfect but it still has that transcendent other-worldliness to it.  One shouldn‚Äôt  settle for any less than sunshine, butterflies and rainbows at the beginning. \n\nAfter healing from that breakup for a year and getting back into the dating scene again, I‚Äôve found myself feeling the same way as OP. I invest my all into every relationship I find myself in with the hope we‚Äôll be able to forge that same kind of connection. However, if the sparks aren‚Äôt there in the first month or two don‚Äôt push it.\n\nBy then, the men are always head over heels. There‚Äôs always guilt in letting go, but ultimately you can‚Äôt confine yourself to a relationship you don‚Äôt feel fulfilled in.  \n\nI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre afraid of love, OP. I think you just haven‚Äôt found the right person to love.
