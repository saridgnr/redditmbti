Well I'd say memory is not that relelvant to Si, but it's very common they have a good memory. I can still remember many of my dreams of many years ago in great details, I can still recall the feeling of foods on my tongue that I've tried years ago, I can recall lots of moments and feelings that I perish and loved within that moment, which is why I'd be happy to experience many types of moments and can often live in the past because I can suffer certain nostalgia for certain sensations or emotions.\n\n   I'm pretty stubborn and kind of hate change too, mainly the political or sociological one, for example how the word nigga (at least in MY AREA) suddenly became offensive. I strongly state that I don't care what you suddenly find offensive (disclaimer I don't swear much anyways though), you loser were using this word all your life and I will not change just because you suddenly became a pussy. Same goes to most SJW related topics.\n\n   Something that I do not find relatable about most Si users that they're really good or useful for is how they care about wisdom, or learning from past mistakes, I'm too impulsive and don't really care to "analyse" or "think about" my past, like yeah I know shit happened, but who cares, I want to experience and do this thing right now, and whatever happens happens, I can fix it anyways and it won't probably be my fault anyways.\n\n  Oh and I easily notice it when people look different too, even if it's a minor change.\n\n     Written with much love and greatness,\n       Nora
5	Holy shit, Nora. Get over over yourself.  
5	This post was good and informative till the 3rd paragraph, at that point you sound very idiotic and uneducated.\n\nThe word nigga is offensive due to history of whites saying it on racist terms and implications to blacks. Get over your self and off your high horse, not everyone is pussy people just have respect.
1	>I strongly state that I don't care what you suddenly find offensive, you losers were using this word all your life and I will not change just because you suddenly became a pussy. Same goes to most SJW related topics.\n\nHAA GAY!!!! üòÇ ü§î
-2	Woah, you're on here!  Hi dude!
5	When was the first time you realized you loved someone and how did you know?	
3	When words failed me.
2	I'm generally over confident and rather loud, when I was first in love, I got awkward as hell, I gave myself zero attention and made sure the girl I loved was my top priority. I actually felt jealousy whenever she didn't talk to me (I shrugged it off though bc we all have a social life and I can't be too possessive).\n\nI was 17, our relationship could've lasted years, I had no issue in sharing a future with her, especially since we didn't really have any conflicts. (I was only uncomfortable by her over display of affection which overwhelmed me bc I didn't know how to act or deal w it).\n\nAnyways, she cheated on me which my lame ass shrugged off bc I kinda expected it as it was a common behavioral pattern from her.
1	lol. "love." It's so frggn frustrating and headache inducing when I feel like I'm not in control of my feelings, especially when they seem so illogical. That's when I knew I was in love. I was like how is it possible to love this seemingly unspecial person and yet they're so freaking special to me and they're presence brings me so much unexplainable joy and happiness. We're still dating and plan on being each others forevers lol.  
0	ENTJ/ENTP ‚û° ESTJ	Hello! \n\nWhile in college, I took the tests and constantly got either ENTP or ENTJ. I majored in computer science. \n\nNow that I'm out of school, I continuously get ESTJ. What might have happened to me? \n\nAlso, I used that site 16personalities.com for these results. I am not sure if it it provides the most accurate test or not. Please show me da wae. :)\n\nThank you!
2	You answered the questions differently.\n\nOR\n\nYou used a different test. (Which would  be strange, as 16presonalities.com is known to give iNtuition out like candy)\n\nOR\n\nYou are on the edge in regards to Sensing/iNtuition and Judging/Perceiving. One tiny mood swing and the letters change.\n\n >  I majored in computer science.\n\nHey, so did I. Man, was it a rough awakening, when job interviewer asked questions like: "Well this functional programming sound interesting, but can you make a password-checker in Java/Javascript?"\n\nAnd they even were explicitly searching for  people with a master degree in software-engineering. 
1	just wondering how ESTJs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
4	I'm estj and these set of questions bother me :(
4	According to Wikipedia:  \n\n>Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought.\n\nWe take this as our premise.\n\nSince the act of murder lacks justification we can conclude, that murder is per definition unreasonable. If there was a reason to kill someone, there also would be a  justification or  valid excuse to do so. Logic is systematized reason, therefore  all murder is illogical.
3	This does not seem very scientific. 
1	Survey on Flirting behaviors and personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	Describe your experience with the Te/Ne loops, or Fi grip	
0	ENTJ or ESTJ?	Hi everyone, I posted this on the ENTJ forum and some come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãESTJ and I would like your opinion\nMy test results are ENTJ, in some ENTJ with Loop (Te/Se).\nWe know that the tests are not completely reliable so I have studied the various functions, I have made my own idea and now I write here to get some confirmation.\nI am 23 years old, I did Scientific High School because as a child I wanted to be a doctor, but after seeing that the hospital is not my environment, probably lack of empathy, I opted for Business Studies.\nI have made this choice because I am interested in the "position of control and power", have more knowledge because I am mainly interested in starting my own business, or, if it goes wrong, being hired to play a senior role (if you have thought of the CEO congratulations you‚Äôre right). \nAlways aim to have a main role in a group, organize, say what to do and I can‚Äôt stand that others are too relaxed, slow or don‚Äôt take things seriously, but at the same time I also know how to be humorous to ingratiate them.\nI tend to be among the most organized and I want things to be done with principle.\nPrinciple that often turns out to be my point of view in fact I tend to do things ‚Äúon my way‚Äù.\nYes, I‚Äòve been defined arrogant or as a "I do everything" or "what I say is law", and I don‚Äôt like others told me what to do.\nDespite this I like to discuss ideas and theories, but I always tend to the pragmatic side of the thing and hardly change my mind if I'm not totally convinced.\nA black or white situation.\nI am quite "future oriented ", but at the same time I‚Äôm interested in the present moment and act for what I want.\nI make decisions quickly, but if it‚Äôs very important, I prefer to have as much information as possible.\nI‚Äôve been called selfish, unable to put myself in others shoes, I'm not good with my emotions or those of others, but I'm ready to help when you really need, even without being asked.\nWhat makes me doubt I really am an ENTJ?\nThe procrastination in the study: I ‚Äã‚Äãhave always done and I continue to do it at the University.
9	ESTJ or EXTJ isn't just about control and power. Honestly, that's not really connected to us at all. \n\nThe only thing I might get from your post is that you are Enneagram 8. But you could be ESTP for that matter. \n\nWanting a controlled environment is not the same as wanting control over every single person in our lives. \n\nESTJs aren't really the type of people who want to rise to the top and be in control. We like being in charge because we often times see ourselves as strong problem solvers. We are good at planning ahead and calculating different outcomes and how to respond to each of them. \n\nESTJs are commonly found in middle management. We don't want to oversee people, we want to work in the middle with them. It's not that an ESTJ wouldn't end up as a CEO, it's just not likely. A lot of ESTJs are okay with being somewhere in the middle. They work really well on teams, they just might prefer a management position so they have some control and say in how things are done. \n\nYou came to us describing yourself and the only thing any of us are getting from what was written is that you're someone who likes to be in control and have power. That's all you seem to want in life. There is so much more to ESTJs, and all personalities for that matter.\n\nThere are people who want control and power, and people who want to be leaders. One of them is respected and the other isn't. One of them is earned and the other is often times taken. \n\n\n\n
2	In my experience, ENTJ have a common style of conversation where they will have difficulty balancing conversation with other people. If an ENTJ starts talking, it's very normal for me as an ESTJ to only get in an ok when appropriate, but not my own thoughts. They'll often change topics multiple times and we won't return to the original discussion too.\n\nIf I need to leave, I'll have to interrupt. They'll acknowledge but if they start talking again, they'll keep going until I leave.\n\nI think that the actual problem is that they have trouble closing off their thoughts. This is especially annoying to ESTJs as we want other people to listen to our views too and are very conscious about using time efficiently and stating our thoughts clearly and succinctly.\n\nOverall, they are still good friends and I just realize that it's a personality conflict and not something personal between us.

5	I get annoyed when food bloggers/reviewers do not include dish prices. Is that ESTJ related?	Hi,\n\nWhenever I am reading review of the restaurant (tripadvisor for example), I get annoyed when a person describes the dish, but does not mention the price of it. To me it is absolutely crucial information and I do not understand how it would not be for anyone else.\n\nLet me explain why - you read a review about the dish, see its photos. And in order to decide if that is a good deal (and if you'd consider visiting) you must know the price. Simplified example to get the point - lets say the average price of x dish in the city is 10 euros. So depending on the pricing you would know if it was a good deal (and worth visiting) or not. If it is 15eur, then maybe skip that place, if it is 7 eur - super deal and priority visit.\n\nRestaurant reviews without price mentioning is almost useless to me, because how would you know the value?\n\nCan anyone relate? I am curious if this is something of ESTJ thing, or just me thing (I value everything via price/quality ratio).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPs: I also get a facepalm moment when someone writes "price for two with drinks was X". I am like - wtf, do you know that drinks have various pricing and you di not even mention how many of those you got. It is completely useless information, how can anyone not understand that when they write it.
2	Well, I don't really trust reviews, to begin with. \n\nPeople aren't thorough or detailed about why they gave it 2 stars.\n\n- Didn't like the color (2 stars) That has nothing to do with the product. What about the quality? The fit? \n\n- Ordered the wrong size (1 star) Again, YOUR FAULT. Or when they say they ordered small and they complain it was too tight, like I'm sorry you lack the ability, to be honest about how big you might be. Not trying to sound so negative, but some people just cannot accept they are bigger than they think. \n\n- Didn't know this was part of the jacket (1 start) --- You FAILED to read the description about the \narticle of clothing, that does not warrant you the right to give it one star \n\nAlso, you can agree with a review on Amazon or say you found the review helpful which I find very misleading because all you need is an account, not proof of actually buying the product or knowing anything about it. So you could get a bunch of people agreeing that the product sucks when they have NO knowledge regarding the matter. That's a great way for competitors to come in and ruin reviews. \n\nI just have serious trust issues with reviews because I rarely have issues with items I buy. And having a background in business I know companies will pay people to do reviews, both good and bad. \n\nAnd don't forget Yelp. The most untrustworthy of them all. \n\nSeriously I could go on and on about how much I hate product reviews. Leaving out the price isn't that big of a deal, it's not understanding how to give a fair review that I hate.  
3	I couldn‚Äôt agree more with this post, I‚Äôm all about that price/ quality ratio! 
4	Wanting to read a new book! I‚Äôm going to the library to pick one up today. What books do you ESTJ‚Äôs recommend?	Has anybody read 1984 by George Orwell? Thoughts? 
5	Ender's Game or Replay by Ken Grimwood. Both pander to different ESTJ fantasies.
3	Watership Down, by Richard Adams\nThe plotting, strategy, and struggle are fantastic.\n\nYou won't be able to find them at a library, but The Twelve Kingdoms fantasy series is translated from Japanese and was everything I wanted in terms of character development, world building, and characters. Read it online/ ebook at www.eugenewoodbury.com\n\nThe X-wing series in the Star Wars legacy universe were Reddit favorites from that canon. They're hilarious (the Aaron Allston ones), well plotted, and have great characters.
2	The Dresden filed by Jim Butcher. The first one is called Storm Front. It‚Äôs an urban fantasy about a wizard P.I. In modern Chicago. 
1	The defining decade by Meg Jay was a powerful book for me. Got me out of a rough spot in life \n
1	Educated - Tara Westover\n
1	The last science fiction novel I enjoyed throughout was Old Man's War: The Ghost Brigades. It is the second book in the series, but the first one was good too. 
0	Hey can you all look through my post history?	so I have lots of posts up there. I don‚Äôt know how many. but people can see what I write and say. I wouldn‚Äôt say I am much different besides maybe being more social and talking to a lot of people in real life.\n\nSo I would really like someone who is an estj to go look through my profile. Do I seem like you or one of you folks?\n\nThanks please explain.\n\nDo you folks think I have fe?
1	Have you considered ESFP? I've read through some of your history and everything seems to point to that.\n\nThis site may be helpful for you [https://www.typeinmind.com/sefi/](https://www.typeinmind.com/sefi/). I've pulled a quote from this site that seems to fit your use of Te quite accurately under the ESFP description demonstrating Te as your 3rd function instead: \n\n"In a lot of cases, Te is the protector function of the SeFi. When one of  their values comes under attack, they rely on a direct, matter-of-fact  Te communication style to defend it. When they feel so strongly about a  subject that they know they must take action on it, they tap into this  part of themselves that is powerful and commanding to take a stand for  that what they believe is right." 
1	I would say you are a feeler for sure, not just based on your comment and post history (which definitely spells out F to me) but, [feelers tend to be religious](https://www.truity.com/blog/religion-and-personality-type) more than thinkers. 
4	I retook the test and went from an ISTP to ESTJ. What are the differences?	
3	Well, I just retook a test and went from ISxJ to ESTJ. Like others have pointed out, it could be a manifestation of taking the tests on a bad day.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget, it‚Äôs near impossible to objectively type yourself. \n\nEdit: Grammar is hard.
2	Pretty sure ISTP is ESTJs shadow stack and vice versa...were super stressed the first time or are you super stressed now?
2	Yeah, it‚Äôs the shadow stack.\n\nMassive differences.\n\n\nAre you more process over outcome or do you care about your outcome more?\n\nHow many goals do you set and how many do you really actually complete and accomplish?\n\n\nDo you have a winning urge? Do you care to win all the time?\n\n\nHow good is your memory?\n\nAre you attracted to environmental details? Do you tend to notice many details in your environment?\n\n\nDo you use comparative type of languages. This is like that, this isn‚Äôt like that?\n\n\nWhat is your leadership style. Do you like to lead groups and are you a good leader?
2	What is your sense of humor like? ESTJs like dry humor, understatement, wit, puns, and subtlety.\n\nWhat characters do you like and what personalities do they have?\n\nIn a debate, ESTJs focus on understanding the other person. They're usually looking for a logical contradiction that even their opponent will recognize.
1	same. made a program that has 70 questions from the kiersy temperament sorter scale II, and twice, i got estj, other tests claimed istp, and istj (once). unless i fucked up somewhere
6	Opinions on Conservatism/Right-Wing Politics	I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ESTJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there?
9	I‚Äôm about as far from conservative/right wing as you can get sooooo
11	I‚Äôm no expert on the matter, but I believe that ESTJ‚Äôs are commonly mistaken as rigid due to our auxiliary Si. It‚Äôs viewed as something that clings to ‚Äútraditional views.‚Äù Having said that, I personally believe that most other types are overlooking the way ESTJ‚Äôs use it.\n\n\nFrom what I know about myself, I‚Äôm by no means Conservative or Right-Wing on most issues, with the exception of guns and balancing the budget. I believe my Si is more a tool that says ‚ÄúHey, this works and it‚Äôs proven. So, why change it? \n\n\nThe flip side of that: I see things that don‚Äôt work, for example, privatized healthcare and see that single-payer and multi-payer systems in other developed nations works in reducing costs, covering more people and increasing access across the board. \n\n\nI don‚Äôt cling to tradition for the sake of thing not changing. Instead, I cling to proven solutions and struggle to change if I believe it to be unnecessary. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask me any questions.\n\n\nSorry if that was long-winded.
6	That's a very broad question. However as for me I am very conservative by my country's standards. And I definitely connect that with my SJ-personality. I am pretty earth bound and find most left wing policies to be rooted in utopianism. I also trust my own judgement very much, which I guess count's for the "very" part. I like hierarchies, strong morals and authority and would like to see more of that, not less.  
3	Personally, I see myself as a moderate. \n\nThat said, I actually sympathize with the philosophical aspect of conservatism, as in "don't fix what is not broken", "reformation instead of revolution", "change? yes, but just one step after another", "Power should be decentralized and decisions need to be constitutional", etc.\n\nI can't stand most right wingers though. From my point of view, they want to experiment with the system just as much as the left wingers do. Forcing their unworldly ideologies upon everyone of us.
1	Yes
1	I wouldn't consider myself right wing or conservative. I consider myself moderate and somewhat traditional, especially within my own party (registered Democrat). I'm not against change, but I do place value on how things have traditionally worked and advocate for moderate reforms vs. radical change.\n\nFor example, I'm not into overhauling things such as the electoral college, a complete ban on the 2A, or handing out "free" things like college education. To the latter, I'm over this pro-socialism wave (and I am a Democrat millennial) which ties back to my ESTJ personality of believing that hard work will get you far and you should work for what you earn.\n\nI think there's definitely validity in tradition but I also think progress can be good, in moderate steps with attainable goals. I don't believe in overhauling the system that's worked since inception, but I believe there's lots of areas to be better in. I should add that I work in lobbying so I work a lot with both Ds and Rs which definitely contributes to my "moderate" views and willingness to be bipartisan on things.
1	ESTJ values tradition, things that should be that way because of tradition etc. So they would rarely be "progressive".\n\nAlso they value logic, facts more than average (as some left wing policies are objectively anti logic).
1	Okay yes it‚Äôs the si part si is not actually rigid but it‚Äôs seen as that way because no one really knows or understand si. I am far from rigid just common sensical and pragmatic. I may go for the old or something I am familiar at first but I can change. If I change I can become scattered but I will do it. I will answer your question, but I‚Äôll give you a real life example.\n\nI was going downtown today and I assumed it was opened. I was going to go there because I‚Äôve ordered from there and it was good. So the familiar. I was half way there and took a look. They were no longer in business. Okay now what? I was taking buses. So I looked up lunch spots. And then thought about it, hmmm. I don‚Äôt really want mexican today. I wasn‚Äôt opposed to it. I was going to go to a vegan place at first so I looked up another one. And how to get there. On the process I got off and on a total of 4 buses. Three changes. Because si no longer works I have to use nae. I am okay but not the best at it. I got off and on really quickly at consecutive stops all of the buses stopped at all three stops so I was good actually. But i ended up going to a vegan place. Not a big deal I didn‚Äôt go to my first choice of restaurant. I am often like that there is a default but if that default does not work I am okay and sometimes I will try other stuff if recommended when I feel up to it. Some times more some times less. I get use to new environments really quickly. After I tell you what I am going to tell you maybe you‚Äôll be surprised by my lunch option.\n\nI also don‚Äôt want you to generalize. STJs are widely distributed I don‚Äôt think all of us are one party or another. I also know a conservative ENTJ and she knows ENTJs who are on all sorts of stances. So yeah. Also s types doesn‚Äôt mean conservative and neither does the for si aux or dom types. I‚Äôve actually seen more liberal xstjs on here or xsfjs and it‚Äôs not uniform. I‚Äôve also seen all types of religions for xstj and xsfjs.\n\nPersonally though. I am super conservativve, very much so yes. I am an american conservative. I am closer to tea party though. I am a conservative Christian too. Some people would call me a fundamentalist. I subscribe to right winged ideals in the government. I think for one that prayer should be still in schools. We do it in congress. I support trump. My candidate of choice was CRuz who‚Äôs actually NOT ESTJ he‚Äôs ENTJ. I liked him for his ideas though and I hope he‚Äôd run again. I am a political science major. I am now in contact with the trump campaign in Los Angeles county where I live. Yes a really blue area. I hope to volunteer with them. I am working with a conservative woman who‚Äôs running for senate seat here. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ESTJ. Hahaha! I am an extremely outspoken conservative.\n\nPlease remember it‚Äôs only some of us.
6	What are some qualities you look for in a partner?	
4	The qualities I look for in a person heavily depends on the path I'll take in the future. My path meaning goals, plans, circumstances, etc. After all, I want someone who I could live with, someone who won't heavily disagree or interfere with the structure of my life.\n\nMy opinion is not to represent all ESTJs since MBTI is just a description of thought process (cognitive functions), not too much about personality. Though I'm sure that if we gather enough answers from here then put them all together, we can find the main traits or general qualities most ESTJs look for.\n\nI will also add that the biological or psychological needs differ for each both sexes and three sexualities. (Anyone who said there are more genders or sexualities is a moron)\n\nAnyways, here are the qualities that I look for:\n\n-I want my partner to be interesting, knowledgeable, and clear about her beliefs \n\n-I want my partner to be fully open to me, as that's a responsibility if you're in a relationship\n\n-Too emotional or sensitive people piss me off, but so do emotionless people with no character. I like a balance\n\n- I'm actually really loyal and supportive, and I fully expect the same from my partner, a relationship to me is considered a trial for a bigger purpose aka marriage, and it's important to always be available for each other no matter what\n\n- Honestly as a quality is a MUST\n\n-I get bored very easily, I'd love for my partner to be very outgoing and exciting yet predictable or at least tells me what she's about to do. I dislike ambiguity and not knowing what to expect.\n\n-On top of everything, I just want my girl to be reasonable, factual, and mostly relaxed yet fun to be with
4	I don‚Äôt really look for certain qualities/have a long checklist-I feel like it‚Äôs kinda a package deal-no one can be perfect. But bottom line for friends and people I‚Äôm dating-honest and loyal. \n\nAs for SO, I‚Äôd say I have a ‚Äòtype‚Äô that I usually go for-stable, down to earth, reliable (routine-based/predictable), reserved-if we‚Äôre talking about MBTI, ISxJ-current crush is an ISFJ if that helps üòä
4	How do you view other estjs?	Do you feel that the general hate you receive from the mbti community is warranted based on your interactions with other estjs? 
5	We receive a lot of hate, but I think I am surrounded by an amazing family and awesome friends. If people hate me, I am oblivious to it. \n\nMy dad is ESTJ and he is the one person I hold the most respect for. He has always been a good dad. Worked extremely hard for the family, and did what needed to be done. But no matter how hard he was working, he made it to all 4 kids sporting events. He made a point to show up. He even helped and worked as coaches or volunteered for any events. He wanted to be as involved as possible and now he has 4 kids who might struggle at times, but they know they can count on their dad for anything. \n\nWe lived in the country and any time it snowed he would take his tractor and plow our driveway and every single neighbor within a half a mile.  Every weekend he was helping his dad or siblings with any help they needed. He is someone who gives his time an never complained, it's just what he loved doing. \n\nPeople just don't dislike my dad, and if they do, they still know how good of a man he is so their hate doesn't really last or they keep their mouths shut.  He works extremely hard at every job he has, if there's one person who could get a good recommendation from any previous job, it's my dad. \n\nMy dad worked as a garbage man for a family business and their son was awful. He would scream and yell and make mistakes and refused to take the blame. My dad loved the job but he knew it was time to go. He planned it out and he told them if your son lashes out one more time I'm leaving. And the son went bonkers so my dad left. My dad put so much energy and time into that job and was always getting them business. He helped them so much that when he quit everyone else cut ties with the business too. They figured if my dad of all people quit, there was a good reason and they weren't going to support the business anymore. And the business went under shortly after. \n\nMy dad has spent his entire life building his reputation, which is exactly what his father did, who I think was XSTJ as well. So he saw the example and followed it. And that's what I want to do. \n\nESTJs are amazing people, so fuck what anyone says. \n\nUnhealthy types exist in every kind, and if you want to judge an entire group it says more about you than them anyways. 
5	I think (mostly) everyone on this subreddit is pretty cool, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve met another ESTJ is real life tho. I can‚Äôt really make a judgement, but I think I could be friends with another ESTJ, but not live with or date one :) \n\nThere‚Äôs always going to be unhealthy ESTJs, just like every in every type-so I understand if people have a bias against ESTJ due to past experiences. If you don‚Äôt want to be friends with me, why would I want to be friends with you? 
2	I don‚Äôt have issues with most of the people here. I know another eSTJ in real life. We‚Äôre both really political and we both love each other. I like the guy a lot. I mean if you push his boundaries. Obviously. Yeah. He‚Äôs probably not going to be likable but most people like him, most people don‚Äôt push his boundaries. They are very reasonable.\n\nHe‚Äôs my professor and serve as a city counselman. He was the mayor at one point.\n\nSo I think both of us are wildly loved in our communities. Just the opposite of the descriptions. We both know everyone and lots of people.
2	She recognized me even before I was familiar to the MBTI. My 7th grade teacher would always tell me that I am very similar to her. Many years later --after I took the MBTI test, studied the cognitive functions and concluded I was an ESTJ-- I asked her what her type was, and she said she's an ESTJ! LOL\n\nI love her and respect her. I still contact her to this day. She's very down-to-earth and extremely organized (which I LOVE). I remember when we'd have class trips, she would give everybody a task (a detailed one) and the plans would come together really well. She was really caring too, made us write down our birthdays on the class calendar and would write a note for each of us on everyone's birthdays. When I consult her of personal issues/problems, she'd always speak the truth, very honest & direct. \n\nShe's an healthy ESTJ, and I'd consider myself as a healthy one too. We got along well :-) 
2	ENTP and ESTJ as friends?	Hey it‚Äôs that ENTP again ... this is kind of a follow up on the other post about understanding ESTJ on a personal level.\nIt‚Äôs almost been 24 hours since I posted that and my ESTJ friend just acted out of character ... like shit.\nI‚Äôve always had difficulties with my friend, we initially bonded over interests, aspirations and morals and I always found her reactions amusing. I‚Äôm very assertive, my other friend is aggressive and she is quite passive. We usually hang out as a trio. But I always found my ESTJ friend quite insensitive and lacks the ability to acknowledge other people‚Äôs efforts and sacrifices for her. That was usually our main conflict, her not putting in the same effort as we were, she‚Äôs very oblivious to the fact that we care about her but I don‚Äôt think she realises our efforts. She doesn‚Äôt notice things until they come up. I‚Äôve always admired her work ethic although she is not academically smart and tries to play it off as if she doesn‚Äôt study or works as hard and we‚Äôre similar in the way we don‚Äôt express our feelings a lot and look for effective and rational solutions. Everything I said up until this point in normal behaviour.\n\nThe problem is she got a boyfriend. I‚Äôve discovered that TODAY. She‚Äôs been dating him for A MONTH. Now I won‚Äôt lie but I do feel betrayed at the fact I was not worthy enough to know from the start, and she told this friend that I don‚Äôt know that well before me. She is my best friend but once I found this out I was questioning if she thought the same, but I didn‚Äôt express my anger to her because I needed to collect my thoughts and I needed to be sane for her to listen to me, my other friend found out before me. THIS IS A VERY LONG STORY.  If you want to know the full story feel free to message me. But in summary she used my other friend for herself disregarding my other friend‚Äôs feelings and efforts, displaying no remorse for my other friend. She used her for her boyfriend who doesn‚Äôt even treat her right, and has a toxic relationship. I always thought she was rational but she is a complete slave to her emotions when her boyfriend only shows lust.\n\nMy friend (Not the ESTJ) and I are very disappointed with her and she is so blind that she doesn‚Äôt see it. She thinks that everything is okay between us. My other friend believes we shouldn‚Äôt openly express our feelings to her until the time is right, but I feel like scolding her right now because I always kept it in when she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge us but she crossed the line with this one.\n\nTo clarify, I do not hate her at all and have no interest in cutting her off from my life. I‚Äôm just irritated and frustrated that I always have to point something out for her to realise. \n\nI‚Äôd like to know your thoughts. \n\nAs a bonus, I feel like I said so many negative things about her that I‚Äôm going to talk shit about myself to kind of balance it out, I am cold and rude and I purposely say things to incite a reaction, I take pranks to far and laughed when I discovered she had a boyfriend because I didn‚Äôt think it was possible that someone would want to be with her. \n\n\n
5	I think you ought to stop relying too much on this personality thing. Remember that this isn‚Äôt a perfect science. Every person is an individual and while some people may share *similar* traits, they can and will act under their own steam. No one is a perfect image of their personality category. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like some high school drama that you‚Äôre dealing with. And I‚Äôm not trying to down-size that, it really really sucks to go through it. It‚Äôs good that you took the time to think before talking to your friend. But you may want to think from their point of view. Despite what it may seem, it might not have anything to do with you. \n\nTalking to your friend and expressing how you felt in a NON-ACCUSATORY way would be a good option. And remember, any personality can get along with one another. There are so many other factors that go into it. I‚Äôm an ESTJ and my best friend‚Äôs an INFJ. Just as an example. 
3	Okay, I'm going to give you a different perspective. \n\nI cannot tell you how many guys I've been interested in and got all excited only for it to end in a few weeks making me feel like a dumbass. So I might tell casual friends but I won't tell my closest friends because I don't want to get excited about something that isn't very serious. \n\nI also think my efforts go unnoticed ALL THE TIME. I'm actually having roommate problems right now because no one thinks I do anything around here. And I purchased half the house when I moved in because no one wanted to contribute anything. So I took everything I purchased back. And I can easily live in my own space without sharing, I was only sharing and helping out because I thought it would be a nice thing to do. And now they are all flipping their shit because we don't have dishes, trash cans, towels, toilet paper...etc. And I couldn't care less. You want to be ungrateful and bitch, go right ahead but don't ask for any favors in the future, because the answer is no. \n\nSometimes you need to take a step back and try and see what other people do. Because we can easily see things from our own perspectives and it looks like people don't care, but they do, they just care in different ways. \n\nI actually have an ESTJ dad. And he fills up our gas tanks when we visit home and checks our oil. He does so much to help other people out and never asks for anything in return. He sees it as his duty and that's how he shows people he loves them. But is he going to sit and talk about feelings with you? No. Is he going to comfort you when you're sad? No. Because it's not his strength and instead of getting mad at him for what he can't do, I thank him for what he can. \n\nAnd one last thing. I am a fucking moron at reading peoples emotions and problems. Unless you say it, I just won't figure it out. And when people lash out at me for not figuring stuff like that out, I get so angry and because you couldn't communicate to me the problem I have a hard time feeling bad for what happened. Lashing out at me for something that happened 3 months ago isn't' going to get my sympathy. You suck at communicating and expect others to just figure shit out like we're all capable of reading minds. \n\nBut ESTJs aren't perfect people and we can really suck at times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
1	How do you know she‚Äôs even an ESTJ?\n\n\nYeah, I would be kind of perplexed myself, I usually tell those I know well, and if I didn‚Äôt. I simply forget and it‚Äôs like oh sorry and there‚Äôs a reason, didn‚Äôt get to you too busy. And I mean it. If you see the work I do you‚Äôll know hahaha! I am now getting more. Hahaha!
1	I'm not an ESTJ. I'm an ENTJ female who's been around the block more than a few times with toxic people and friends' relationship drama with toxic people. \n\nIf I'm reading between the lines correctly, your ESTJ friend is in a very bad situation with this guy. A big red flag to me is that she's saying how much she *loves* this guy even though it's only been a month. Her secretiveness about the relationship is another huge red flag. That's really not a good sign. \n\nFrom my experiences with situations like this, you won't be able to talk her out of it or make her "see reason". \n\nHer bad behavior is also not about you. I know it feels personal and I know from experience how much that sucks, but it's not. She's all wrapped up in this, she can't really see anything or anyone else right now. Her perspective is skewed and she's not going to be capable of having a rational discussion about this for awhile if I'm seeing this situation accurately, though of course I don't have all of the information. \n\nYou and your other friend are taking the correct approach by not confronting her. It will *not end well* if you do that. I cannot stress that fact enough. \n\nIf you want to message me about this privately you're more than welcome to. This really sucks, I've been in this kind of predicament before. It's not fun. 
1	Let me explain a bit about ESTJ dating.\n\nWe often leave relationship status ambiguous for a while, especially if we're talking to INFPs. INFPs seem to be especially cautious about dating. Meanwhile, we're comfortable just figuring each other out for a while and not declaring things a date.\n\nI've known several friends who hung out for several years and eventually decided to just make it official and start dating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilarly, ESTJs like stability and don't like having to update people on things like "we just started dating!" One week later, we break up and now we have to update all of those people and it feels silly. We'd be much more comfortable talking about people that we've gone out on dates or are interested in than that we just started dating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother issue is that we get concerned what other romantic interests we have might think if we took someone else out on a date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, we often separate romantic interest from specific questions about the relationship. These questions include things like:\n\n"I have kids and she's indicated 2 years ago that she doesn't want to deal with that. Would she make an exception for me?"
1	My best friend (honestly best friend is not an adequate word, she's my soulmate lol) is an ENTP and we always get along. If I didn't tell her something / if she didn't tell me something like that, maybe we'd both be a little disappointed, but we'd express it to each other directly (i.e.: "why didn't you tell me? :( but I'm happy for you! blah blah etc) and get over it right away lol. We know that things happen and we can't always update each other right away. I think we have that basic trust that we'll never betray/hide something from each other on purpose. But also, I don't think I'd not tell my best friend such news for a month...\n\nI also agree that it might not be a personality thing. Altho my soulmate's ENTP and ESTJ, and our interests aren't exactly the same, we grew up in very very similar backgrounds (similar family dynamic, socioeconomic status, etc). Sorry if this didn't help, but nah, I don't think it's a personality thing. 
5	What‚Äôs your enneagram?	What‚Äôs your enneagram? And please answer if only you are an estj. For anyone else find my post it may be under u/estj136 and answer that one, it asks for type and enneagram. But I am really interested to know what type all the other ESTJs are here.

1	Counterphobic 6 (easily mistyped by others as 3 or 8) but that basic motivation of safety/comfort and providing it for others is DEFINITELY still the core...\nalso with the in group/out group stuff and the admiration for what we think is ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù authority/structure while completely devaluing/ignoring what we think is ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù or ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù authority/structure, I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt more ESTJ counterphobic 6s.
1	I am 3w4. :)
1	3w2
5	Wanting know ESTJ on a personal level	Hey it's your mortal enemy, an ENTP.\nI've been researching about this type because I'm curious to see if it really matches with my friend.\nBut most of the description detail how an ESTJ is professionally. But I'd like to know how they are in their personal lives.\nThe good and the bad.
8	My husband is ESTJ - maybe this will be helpful from another perspective? \n\nHe‚Äôs outgoing and will talk to anyone and everyone but mainly because he really receives a lot of assurance from people liking him. However he doesn‚Äôt love people flat out. You have to fit his particular requirements for him to bring you into his inner circle. Once you are his person, however, he is incredibly loyal and protective of you. \n\nHe is very fact based, to the point, and sometimes lacks empathy when the situation doesn‚Äôt relate to him, or is illogical. \n\nHe is very regimented which means he‚Äôs extraordinarily reliable, however on the downside, inflexible. \n\nPerhaps it‚Äôs just him, but he‚Äôs incredibly coachable. You have to be someone he respects or loves but he will take it heart and immediately start applying that feedback.\n\nI‚Äôm an ESFP - I think we balance each other really well. I think our shared E&S means we perceive the world the same and have the same kind of language but I have more of a free heart-driven approach vs his scheduled head-driven approach. It‚Äôs a wonderful way for us to bring both sides to the world and meet in the middle.
6	Outside of work and school I pretty much keep to myself. I like spending time alone and don't want to be all that active. Which has led me to have quite a few introverted friends. I'm actually best friends with 3 INFPs. I honestly don't know how I keep finding them, but I'm just so drawn to them and I feel like we really click. One was from my a job, one was my roommate and the other I met in class. \n\nThis might sound a little weird, but I don't like sharing my friends. I want time alone with them. If they have a hobby or favorite activity, I'd rather make it more personal for them. Instead of getting a bunch of friends together, I'll find time to hang with them alone. I do have friends I hang within groups, and I enjoy that time, but one-on-one is what I prefer. And I think that's why I get along so well with introverts. \n\nI also really care about family. I try and visit when I can, even relatives. I grew up with a big family and we always had gatherings so I know my relatives pretty well, so any chance to catch up and meet them, I make the time. \n\nI care about work and school a lot and can seem very serious at times, which has rubbed others the wrong way. But I promise, the second I clock out, I'm no longer on work mode. Work stays at work, and I am really good at separating my work life from my personal life.  \n\nMy weak point is I sometimes get really frustrated when those I care about don't live up to the expectations I have for them. My (INTP) brother dropped out of college for a year and I was so mad at him. I felt like he was so close to graduating. It ended up being really good for him and he did go back and found something he's passionate about. In hindsight it was good for him, I just had a hard time accepting that. \n\nThe INFP who was my roommate is the exact opposite of me in every way possible. I honestly don't know how we get along so well.  And she needs to be given the space to be her own person. She's brilliant in my eyes but struggles academically. She's read so many books and is so creative, but if she isn't passionate about something, she struggles to find the motivation. She's taught me that most people aren't like me. They don't want the same things as I do, and I need to learn to back off and let people figure things out for themselves. \n\n\n\n
4	Oh my GOD. Your description is literally like reading about my own life (also ESTJ). I live with my best friend who is an INFP (also someone I find to be BRILLIANT but dropped out of college and hates school) and also prefer one on one or one on 2-3 time with my close friends as opposed to giant groups, despite being very extroverted. DAMN. My INFP friend makes me a better person because she forces me to recognize how normal it is to sit down and take breaks, and to back off from trying to problem-solve when it‚Äôs not something others explicitly ask for (I have a tendency to offer solutions to problems because it‚Äôs how I show I care, but i don‚Äôt need to research the best migraine medicine for her if she doesn‚Äôt explicitly ask me to lol). I also have a trigger point at the concept of ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù‚Äîif other people (esp in the work setting) are displaying what to me appears incompetence, I will feel RAGE towards them. (Kind of a ‚ÄúYOU HAD ONE JOB!!!!‚Äù Sort of thing). I think I take a joke pretty well and have a lot of self-deprecating humor myself, but even JOKES related to my own competence I will shrivel up and die on the inside. Getting older I‚Äôve learned how to not react destructively to that but it still STINGS. Unsurprisingly, there‚Äôs not a lot of situations where friends joke about my competence because there‚Äôs no material for the jokes-lol. But when they do it‚Äôs usually about social competence and I internally just lose my shit. Trying as an adult not to lash out irrationally at that üòÇ
3	Male ESTJ here.\n\nI often don't know how I think or feel about something unless it comes up as a topic or someone asks about it. Then I'll organize my thoughts extremely quickly and answer as if I had something prepared. Sometimes I would have to write about a book in school and my answers were terrible because they were generic because the prompt was generic and I didn't know what was important. Then we'd have class discussions and I'd do amazingly well and my teacher didn't understand why I could do one and not the other.\n\nI crush on INFPs really easily. I'll try to hang around and talk with them for a while so it looks like it's happening naturally and gradually. I actively seek out TV shows, movies, music, art, and comics with INFP themes characters, and writing.\n\nWith some people, I'll talk for hours if I can pick through their mind or I like their stories. With most people, I'll get tired of it within 30 minutes or an hour and want to play a game or something. This is especially the case at parties. This is comparable to other people preferring to get together with 2-3 best friends. It's easier to control things to do your favorite things and have good conversations.\n\nI have witty, dry humor. I like teasing people just a tiny bit and getting a big reaction out of them. I have a friend that I got really good and he says he'll hate me forever for it. We're still best friends and whenever he brings it up I laugh so hard and tell him I love him for it.
2	You can get to know me if you want, just send me a message. I love to talk! School is starting so yeah, may be more prudent to trade numbers or e-mails or I add most anyone on facebook I have mostly the blind community on there. I am a blind ESTJ. But I don‚Äôt say anything important I treat it like another forum and I just post up some thoughts here and there, welcome to join and we can talk on messenger. But what I am suggesting is find me outside of reddit but message me here first.\n\nI think it depends on eneagram.\n\nI am a 3w2 317.\n\n\nI am really social outside of school and I imagine work. I‚Äôve done a few things. And when I do volunteer and called to mentor and stuff I am quite different. But yeah, outside maybe you can tell maybe you can‚Äôt. I act no different then I do on here. Well maybe, I answer mostly questions on here but yeah. I am very relaxed. I think it‚Äôs harder to see te really at work. I don‚Äôt know what you see. You see it more in a laid back way in my speech and interactions but yeah. Not sure. I don‚Äôt know what function is dominant in outside of work fun conversations.\n\n\nMy 7 of my enneagram tritype comes out really well after work or not in school or doing mentor consulting type of stuff.\n\nI can be a show in itself. Hahaha! I talk a lot. I can be really entertaining in my own way. But my 3w2 is still very prominent. So it‚Äôs not a pure 7 thing. But I have some fun too. Silly jokes like being goofy.\n\nI can‚Äôt see so now if I run in to someone to make light of things I say.\n\n‚ÄúOops, I forgot you were solid sorry.‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt joke around or blatantly tell joke after joke, but that type of humor comes out.\n\n\nI am very jovial and talkative. I can talk someone‚Äôs ear off. Hahaha! I talk aboutn the other person a lot or a shared interest.\n\n\nI am also a 3 so I blend in to the environment type of conversation. Whatever interest them. Ah, yes. Si is probably the function I use most in social interactions. I try to match you in conversations.\n\n\nI had an ENTP friend and still kind of do. He‚Äôs an interesting character. Apparently he and I share a bit of similar music, I use jazz only when studying. And he likes that stuff. He use to chase me around twitter and debated anything I posted on there. I got tired of that. I never said no for a while. But I sometime saw Geoff‚Äôs name and just never got back to him for a while. I was with a controling ISFP boyfriend. For a while and I finally blocked him. And then later it‚Äôs like this is really stupid? And then I unblocked him. We sometime talk but it‚Äôs rare we didn‚Äôt talk for a while.
3	Estj and memory?	So how good is it really? Do you agree si makes you really good with memory? Of course everyone will say they don‚Äôt have bad memory but just wondering. I know a few of us seem to have it. Here‚Äôs a question.\n\n\nremember back to your school days or if you‚Äôre in school it‚Äôs the question for you. Do you have to study? Or do you just pass tests and don‚Äôt study? Even if you‚Äôre in university?\n\nIs it just me or is it a stj thing or an sj thing, so si, that we have superb or near photographic memory.\n\nFor instance I am at a university and I an studying political science it‚Äôs my 8th year in school, and I have really never needed to study, really. I just remember stuff. I don‚Äôt study and the lowest grade I usually get on tests are b grades. If not even a. I get a grades often enough.\n\nI am not trying to brag I just want to know if it‚Äôs all of us, if it‚Äôs si. Or maybe it could be si te.\n\n\nAlso if someone tells you a password or a number can you remember it? My sister gave me her password last summer I think. I haven‚Äôt forgot it. I went to the apple store to basically trade in her phone so I could get a new one because I gave mine to her. And I was able to remember her password, not the exact one but the letters not how it was capitalized. But she was shocked. My father told me what his gas numbers were for his car and I am sure I still know the number. I should make a way to forget it because it‚Äôs useless information. Sometimes I feel like a walking textbook because I know too much and remember everything. \n\nAnybody else?
2	Yup-I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not only the memory for test recall (classic non-studier A student here) but also for pattern building‚ÄîI work with severe persistent mental illness and I will recognize behavior patterns very quickly in new clients or even acquaintances that remind me of an extreme case. In a way that might easily be mistaken for intuition. And I still go back and verify, like I would never cite my Si as a reliable credible source but I will say that it allows me to bypass a lot of analytical or learning processes, as long as I‚Äôve analyzed or learned them at some point before! When I first found out about the MBTI I assumed that pattern building was because of N and was very confused that I had a preference, however slight, for S??? \n\nAnyhow my brother is an ISTJ who also middles pretty hard on N vs S but the slight difference between us (me leading with Te followed by Si and he leads with Si followed by Te) plays a huge role in the career fields we‚Äôve chosen‚ÄîI like to help develop larger scale interventions and in school for public health, he‚Äôs in medical school and happy as a clam to memorize facts and figures all day! 
2	My memory is amazing. I remember everything, but the ability to remember everything can kinda suck when you have traumatic events happen, or we're a victim of a bully. I can recall almost every single insult anyone has ever said to me, and where I was when they said it. \n\nI don't have a planner because it's not necessary. I just remember dates and times and my schedule after looking at it once. \n\nGive me a list? I'll remember it all in the exact order it was given to me. \n\nI love my memory, but there's a lot of stuff I wish I could forget as well, and sometimes I tend to relive certain situations over and over again. \n\nI do really well academically too, but sometimes I can get a better grade and still feel dumber than everyone else around me. Remembering things doesn't necessarily mean I understand it. \n\n\n
1	I'll remember discussions that I've had, especially other people's positions on issues and arguments, often years later and better than they do.\n\nFor tests, if I can really absorb a concept, I'll remember it. My understanding might fade if I don't use the concept though.
2	Your experience (s) with Ni	Hello everyone. I'm going to keep this short, sweet, and to the point. \n\nWhat do you all make of introverted intuition, and how, if at all, have you utilized it in your life? \n\nThis question to me seems like an interesting one, since we all have PoLR Ni. \n\nI'm on a quest to figure out how it works, and thus far, I cannot understand in depth. 
1	Aren‚Äôt we just blind to it? I‚Äôve been chasing this idea for a while. We just don‚Äôt use it and we don‚Äôt really know what it is. I do now just by observing but it‚Äôs still a little bizarre to me. I don‚Äôt think we use that function or anyone use their 7th function or am I wrong? I know that my INtJ friend for instance don‚Äôt know and dont really like fe that much. And probably doesn‚Äôt like it too well.
1	I like to think of Ni as intuition of time. \n\nI often find Ni acts as a stressor for me, and it manifests when I have a sense or have a gut feeling of how something may unfold. I am vulnerable to uncertainties ‚Äî This vulnerability, I believe, acts as a stressor that causes me to get started on things early (or be proactive rather than reactive) so that I can somehow exert some degree of control over the unknown future.\n\nMy conscious use of it is poor and without confidence, but subconsciously I think this uncertainty nudges me to act on my goals if that makes any sense...

7	My ESTJ BF brags a lot.	My ESTJ boyfriend is an amazing person who is loyal, good to his family, responsible, fun, successful etc etc. \nOne thing that I don't understand about him though, is that he brags excessively. \nIs this a typical ESTJ thing, insecurity or possibly something else? 
6	I jokingly brag a lot, I‚Äôll say something like ‚ÄòHD student right here yada yada‚Äô but we all know it‚Äôs a lie haha\n\nI guess it depends, but either he‚Äôs really proud of his achievement (and it comes off as bragging, when really he‚Äôs just excited, I‚Äôm always scared I‚Äôm going to do this-so I only share my achievements with people really close to me), but maybe it‚Äôs just your boyfriend idk 
3	I am an estj 3w2. And I use to do it. It‚Äôs an ego thing. I don‚Äôt do it as much anymore. Haha! You don‚Äôt have many friends if you‚Äôre too brag heavy. I use a lot of it for motivational stuff but otherwise I keep it more humble. But it‚Äôs a ego issue. We are often really proud of our accomplishments though. And we talk about how it works a lot of times to give examples that it does work or to motivate others.
3	I spent years doubting myself and feeling really down about myself and my abilities. \n\nI ended up watching a TED talk that honestly just flipped a switch. And the more I said good things about myself the better I started to feel. \n\nI am so much more confident now and just all around way happier and I have a tendency to brag in ways. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say I do it excessively but if I‚Äôm proud of myself for something I‚Äôll tell someone. I think sharing your success can sometimes come off as insecure but some of us are just proud of our own accomplishments and want to tell others. \n\nNow doing it in every single conversation would be weird. 
5	Pragmatic differences between ESTJ and entj?	I have done my research. I know what the functions are, I can type people fairly well. I can recite definitions but I am not going to do that. I can go with how the function stacks look in my dreams. Hahaha! Anyway. \n\nI know what Ni and si are. But what are the differences pragmatically? In real life? Give examples caused by Ni and si differences.\n\n\nAlso here are some odd questions\n\n\nDo you think as estjs we are louder or brasher or both than entjs?\n\nDo you think it‚Äôs easier to tell what we think then with entjs?\n\nDo you think that ESTJ and ENTJ tends to express there te differently or how much they are willing to exercise it?
3	ENTJs argue a lot more, and they‚Äôre much quicker thinkers so they‚Äôre good at it. 
3	I think our Si makes us less likely to take risks. \n\nI see a lot of ENTJs being entrepreneurs and honestly there is nothing remotely exciting about that to me. My old boss put all of her savings into her business and thank god she was successful because I couldn‚Äôt think of a worse disaster. \n\nI also have seen ENTJs to be a lot more open on social media. Active every day always posting something new. Sorta too open in ways. And I haven‚Äôt logged into Facebook in a year and only use Snapchat to send videos and pictures of my cats and Instagram to send memes. \n\nIn a way, ENTJs actually intimidate me. I think they come off way more confident and sure of themselves and their ability to put themselves out there makes them more likable. \n\n\n
3	Help! Is my mom an ESTJ?	Hello! INTP here. I'm fairly new to this system and I'm having trouble typing the types I'm not familliar with.\n\nI gave my mom (53) multiple tests based on functions to get a basic idea (I know tests aren't to be trusted, but I needed to start somewhere because she's very confusing). She scored as ESTJ multiple times. I then read the description to her and she agreed with a good part of it, but I'm still not convinced.\n\n(I'm probably going into stereotypes here, but I barely know anything about this type, so I apologize)\n\nFirst of all, I was almost sure that she was a feeling type just because how emotional and irrational she can be, especially in comparison with me and my brother (INTP and INTJ). But while she was doing the test, she always ended up choosing thinking over feeling options, especially the ones related to Te. \n\nAnd now that I think about it, her Te is strong when it comes to her job, I think? She has also been a manager for 15+ years and stepped down only because it was too stressful and she got tired of fixing what other people messed up. The thing is, everyone there respects and loves her, and even now they want her to be a manager again. She is both nice and demanding, very annoyed with mistakes but won't punish anyone unless necessary, knows how to do her job but often ranting about those who don't. She's good with everyone but won't be fake nice (says she dislikes those who put on a fake show?).\n\nShe loves to be in the right. Often when she tells a story, she needs to pinpoint how the other person told her 'yeah you are right'. She's proud of how rational she is. And now I'm thinking she's probably a thinker indeed, but it's different at home.\n\nShe has been a wonderful mom to us. This is where I'm most confused. We lost our dad at very young age so she tried her best for us to live well and she managed it. Both me and my brother made it a standard to do well in school so she hasn't had a chance to be demanding and stern. In fact, she's quite lenient and we get along really well. The only times we fight is when we don't show enough emotion/compassion or when we say something sarcastic or accidentally harsh.\n\nWe have it, of course. When my mom is sick or tired, I'm deeply concerned, but I fail at showing it. Then she sulks for hours and I can't communicate it with her. Her usual sentence is (in calm and emotional voice) 'you have to understand me'. She is never hysterical but often has such moments where it's like she's requesting an emotional response. She doesn't have actual arguments, it's just her feelings being hurt. But maybe this is just mom behavior? Or maybe she's lonely? Does it have anything to do with ESTJ?\n\nShe has a few good friends but doesn't have much energy to meet them often - she comes home from work tired and doesn't like having guests over for too long. But she likes it when it's people who are very fun or if she hasn't seen them in a while. At those times she's very outgoing and cheerful.\n\nShe takes pride in being very independent and says she will never remarry because she would hate it if a man came into our house and started ordering around. She always minds her own business with people unless asked for advice.\n\nShe isn't too intellect-oriented or a researcher; she wishes she had a hobby but never starts anything and is pretty stagnant. She is interested in history but won't make active effort to read about it.\n\nI won't make this even longer lol I hope I gave you enough insight to try and confirm that she is an ESTJ or deny it. Thank you in advance!
4	I resonate with a lot of things you said, but I suck at typing sooooo\n\nI guess the only thing I feel like I should probably explain is this and ESTJs reasoning behind why we do things\n\n>This is where I'm most confused. We lost our dad at very young age so she tried her best for us to live well and she managed it.\n\nWhen people are relying on me, I see it as my duty to do what I have to do. Everyone has been through shitty things, but the world doesn't stop just because those horrible things happen. People need us, so we can't be focusing on the past-we need to help those and look after those who need/are relying on us-hopefully that makes sense.\n\n&#x200B;
4	Absolutely ESTJ
3	I suck at reading, didn't read all that.  But if she is I will pray for your immortal soul.
3	A mom ESTJ here! Your mom sounds very much like me. I think women ESTJs often present very differently than male ESTJs because we are often a lot more feeling and less demanding. The ESTJ descriptions you often read seem to describe the men more so it can be a little confusing. 
2	Goes on /r/estj:\n\n>First of all, I was almost sure that she was a feeling type just because how emotional and irrational she can be\n\nYep, INTP lol
2	Can‚Äôt be sure she is. What do you mean by irrational. I mean I think all the time even at home. Possibly ESFJ?\n\nI am rather good at typing so maybe we can figure it out.\n\nI mean lots of people are good at some of the stuff you‚Äôre saying.
3	Describe your childhood?	What were you like as a child? Let‚Äôs here some accounts?\n\nWere anyone really overbearingly te? Bossy and controlling?
1	[deleted]
1	ESTJ dad and INFP mom. old ESTP brother, younger INTP brother, younger ESFJ sister. \n\nSo I usually kept my circle small. I had one best friend from early on and we pretty much spent every moment together. Until sometime in middle school when another girl came around and kinda fucked it up. Then I ended up meeting a new girl who I sorta latched onto and we became best friends shortly after. \n\nWith my siblings it was alright. It's a lot better now that we are adults though. My ESTP brother was a bully, he loved being the center of attention and getting a reaction out of people. He often times bullied me in front of people which really hurt me. Honestly, he was nothing but a jerk and even to this day he is still an asshole. But I'm much more successful and in doing way better than he is and that's what eventually made his words towards me meaningless. \n\nBut while all this happened I also had a cousin who was my exact age and bullied me to extremes. It was rough and got to the point where my parents helped me transfer to a new school. Growing up in a small town I felt like people who didn't know me were judging me and I felt like my life would be defined by this small town that I grew up in. \n\nI wasn't popular, I was actually pretty awkward. I liked my small group of friends and spent a lot of time by myself. I was very independent and happy. \n\nFor me, one of the struggles I dealt with was trying to be my own person while feeling constantly judged. I was definitely weird and by trying to be myself I had some pretty awkward moments but I did eventually figure it all out. I guess I'm glad I was able to be independent and not end up letting the expectations of everyone around me define who I became as a person. \n\nWas I bossy and controlling? I'm not exactly sure, but I was a take charge type of person. I volunteered to lead and had no problem being in charge, and honestly, a lot of other students weren't comfortable, so I sorta think I was doing everyone a favor. \n\nBut I got in trouble A LOT. I was a good kid and really didn't like getting in trouble so I was a teacher's pet. But when I felt like my friendships were being threatened I got mean. I once wrote a letter to a girl who "stole" my best friend. It was bad and I got into a lot of trouble. I think they knew I was just 12 and didn't know any better and the visit to the office scared the living shit out of me. \n\nLearning to control Te is rough. I was quite outspoken from an early age, and it took a few fuck ups before I learned to chill out. I was fired at 16 for sending what was classified as a harassment text. Honestly, this was 11 years ago and texting was brand new and I don't think the company had the right to fire me over a text like that. But regardless I was fired for it. And then at 19, I had a job where I also "spoke my mind" and got into some trouble too. Honestly, looking back I really struggled with learning when to speak and when to shut the hell up. \n\nMy mom said I was the hardest kid, and thank god I had an ESTJ dad who knew how to handle me. He honestly was a huge help for me growing up. He understood my crazy mind and he knew how to deal with it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 
4	Does estjs talk a lot?	So, I have heard this a few times. And stuff but I don‚Äôt know how true it is.\n\nDoes ESTJs not talk a lot? I have heard that now from a few people. I had an impression that was not true. I know ISTJs don‚Äôt talk a lot. Do you enjoyy talking?. But the truth is I don‚Äôt think I know many estjs.
13	YES!!!!!! i cannot keep my mouth shut if i'm with people i'm even half comfortable with bc i have to verbalize everything that goes through my head
6	Absolutely yes! And we have an opinion on every goddamn thing on the planet.  It used to be that if it was in my head then it's out of my mouth with very little filter. I'm old and it has taken me a life time to learn to stfu and focus on what others are saying. To this day I have to be careful with free form conversation and only truly let down my guard when I'm around friends that have experienced my mouth for the last 30 years and are still my friend.
12	I do. \n\nBut I also have had some negative experiences with people who claim I dominant conversations. And that honestly hurts me to a point where I simply won‚Äôt engage with you again. \n\nI had a friend who claimed I never asked questions about her personal life. So when we would talk it was mostly me. And I hated feeling like she never shared anything with me not knowing she just wanted me to sit and ask her questions the whole time. That ended up really hurting me because she made me feel like I needed all the attention. \n\nI love talking but I tend to notice when people make faces or don‚Äôt seem interested and the second I sense that I shut down. \n\nI‚Äôll sit and talk with you for hours but I need to feel like you are equally sharing and are engaged because otherwise I get self conscious and those horrible thoughts trickle in. \n\n\n\n\n
3	I always wanted to answer questions in school.\n\nOur questions tend to be very specific. I like using the Socratic Method and playing Devil's Advocate.\n\nI hate interrupting and talking over people, though I'm more willing to than some other types.\n\nIf someone disagrees with me and won't cede me any points, I'll just leave the discussion.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone listens to me, our conversation can last for hours.\n\nMy ideal conversation has each side stating their thoughts clearly and succinctly and returning control to the other person. We usually start talking about a new topic in order to better understand the previous topic and have the intention of eventually returning to it. Our conversations feel like a stack where new topics are added and removed in an attempt to empty it.
3	You guys got the best handwriting? I bet all of yours is super neat.	I'm an ENTP, and mine is THE WORST. 
13	Mine is garbage--but it's fast and efficient!
6	I have really neat handwriting, yeah! I‚Äôm kind of neurotic about it though. Like I‚Äôm inclined to pull out pages from a notebook and start again if I make a mistake. 
4	My handwriting is atrocious unless I put forth serious effort and that‚Äôs not always efficient lol
2	I thought we all just type now?
2	I might be bias haha, but I don‚Äôt think my handwriting is that bad lmao
2	Yup...won a superlative back at my college job for "best handwriting" hahah 
2	I barely even write anymore. I generally just move the pen in a general up and down motion after the first letter of a word. \n\nI‚Äôm so stuck on typing or TTS that using a pen feels like a serious burden. 
1	It's true, I don't hand-write many things, but when I do, it seems to be a toss up. Sometimes it's neat, sometimes it okay. It has never been god-awful, however. As for typing, I use the Dvorak keyboard layout so I can type faster and therefore be more efficient. 
1	I tend to get compliments on it! But my ISTJ Mum‚Äôs is even neater.
1	My handwriting looks like a grade schoolers, all of the letters link together with swirls and I usually can‚Äôt even read it myself.
3	Has anyone ever dated a female ENTJ? What are some of your thoughts on them?	I am currently seeing a male ESTJ. It seems as if we are very similar so far. I wanted to know of any of you had any experience with dating a female ENTJ. I was curious if our dominant Te and inferior Fi would clash. 
3	I‚Äôm an ESTJ female and I think the biggest difference between me and my ENTJ friends is that they‚Äôre more impulsive than us, and can cross social barriers without feeling bad due to their intuition. I think ENTJ‚Äôs are more insecure than ESTJ‚Äôs and that they lack control haha. ENTJ‚Äôs freak me out a bit.\n\nMy boyfriends a INTJ, and often because of his intuition, I feel that he really struggles with prioritising consistently. Might be the same with and ENTJ girl.  
1	Prepare for fireworks. 
1	My ENTJ friends can easily start talking and just not stop for hours. This makes me uncomfortable as I want a more balanced discussion. The friendship works better when it's organized more around activities like games or a movie.\n\nWe also generally ignore each other's life advice.\n\nOverall, there is enough good stuff to make up for that. They're very generous and willing to hang out for activities, which are important to us.
5	would it be a bad idea to tell an estj that i like her?	male infp. is there a viable way to approach an estj? what do they want?
11	Go for it. INFPs are dope. \n\nBut we usually have it decided whether we like someone or not. So if she sees you as a friend she might not see you as more. \n\nBut she probably wouldn‚Äôt end the relationship if you made a move. She would just say no and move on from it. Which can be weird to some people. \n
15	ENFP dating an ESTJ. I don't claim to have any expertise in this, but I would suggest you be direct and provide logical suggestions as to how you could initiate a relationship together. \n\nESTJ's value logic and things that "make sense". They don't like anything that prevents them from reaching their personal goals, so if she feels like you will threaten her personal goals she won't want to start anything. They don't like to show their feelings, and sometimes have a hard time accepting personal feelings as a motive for anything.\n\nGood news for you is, my ESTJ really likes INFP personalities, so you may have a decent chance. Just be yourself, be honest, and be realistic.\n\nAlso, don't let her run over you, because she can, and she won't feel safe in your relationship if she thinks she can control you.
7	ESTJ female here-- I would say the opposite, it's a good idea to tell her how you feel and where you're at. ESTJs like myself greatly appreciate straightforwardness and knowing where we stand. We also appreciate people opening up and making the first step in showing these kind of emotions. I don't mind discussing feelings, but I would never be the one to initiate, and be prepared to have kind of a practical "so what are we" or "where do you see this going" follow up question. It's not that us ESTJs aren't romantic, but we're also realists at heart. I recently had a guy straight up tell me he liked me and I appreciated the honesty/directness so much. Hell, I appreciate directness even if it's the other way too (tell me you don't like me, don't drag things on) haha!
2	Uhhhh, for me personally, it depends on your relationship. Are you friends? Acquaintances? \n\nIf someone straight up tells me that they like me and I haven‚Äôt had time to form on opinion on the person, the answer would be no. But it depends
1	Yeah, just ask her directly. Tell her how you feel and don‚Äôt go around in circles. She could say no.
4	Need help. ESTJ female dating ENTP guy	hey. \n\nIm new to all this but wanted to get some advice really. Im an estj female in my 30s and have been seeing a entp man for just over 6 months. although its fairly new, the relationship grew quickly and we are exclusive. Neither of us tend to just jump into relationships so i hope that helps understand how quickly we bonded. Like he will often talk about our future, having children, etc. Basically planning ahead for the future including meeting his mum in nyc and i've just spent xmas with his family who have never met a previous gf before as he has been single 10 years. However, on the other hand, was very weird at the start about even holding hands in public, going to his place, going on dates, etc although he spends like 3-4 days of the week at my house.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I mentioned to this entp that i really don't like lying and whatever happens always tell me the truth. I felt he was doing this at the very start which was great, then started to feel like he started telling me half-truths or not being fully honest about things. He is pretty secretive about thing too as he considers himself 'private'. I have noticed some holes in some of the stories he would tell me. I also noticed he was flirting and chatting to some girls over FB messenger but lying about it or saying that they have been friends for years (although i know for a fact they haven't). The last convo he has with one girl was asking her 'what her type is' to be her matchmaker but i dont feel he had any intensions of being a matchmaker and just wanted to get some sort of ego boost or know if he was her type.\n\nI feel pretty uncomfortable about all this as i'm very very honest and loyal. I have tried to discuss my boundaries in general and why these are important to me prior to all of this happening so i almost feel hurt by this behaviour as its overstepping my boundaries. I was just wondering if there where any ENTPS do similar things, should i be concerned, and if you have any advice for me?\n\nI really don't want to end up in a situation where I have invested in further to this relationship to find out a few years down the line i've been messed around. 
4	Yeah, I am 26 and ESTJ. Yeah, that relationship just doesn‚Äôt sound right. Just ditch him like a bad habit.
3	I'm 27 F ESTJ and this reads NOPE NOPE NOPE.\n\n>I also noticed he was flirting and chatting to some girls over FB messenger but lying about it or saying that they have been friends for years (although I know for a fact they haven't\n\nRED FLAG\n\nAsking if other ENTPs behave like this is just trying to find an excuse to write his behavior off when deep down you don't think it's okay.\n\nSit this man down and tell him he is either exclusive or he isn't. You are older, you are an adult whose time isn't going to be wasted by someone who isn't looking for the same things as you are. \n\nI get that there is this period of time where you haven't decided if you're exclusive, but at some point, it needs to be discussed. If someone was spending multiple nights a week at my house but still wanted to flirt with other girls over messenger, I would be pretty ticked off. \n\nAnd please don't let people try and convince you that because you didn't talk about exclusivity that it's still somehow okay for him to behave that way. Without having the conversation you knew you reached a point where you were going to be loyal and just talk to him. You chose to be exclusive with him. In my opinion, at 2-3 months of spending multiple nights at each other's places, you have reached that point of exclusiveness where talking to other girls/guys would be questionable behavior. \n\nHe sounds like he's afraid of commitment. So sit down and talk with him and say that his behavior is questionable and you aren't about to have your time wasted so he either needs to be more open with you or it's done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n
1	Copy and paste this to r/ENTP \n\nI would like to answer this but im really bad at relationship advice. Being a ENTP myself I have FI trickster which makes me unaware of the good and bad in situations. Also being logical doesn't help to much here. The most I could say is just be truthful and confront him sutley he might be unaware of the situation like me or something else. If you present him with true or false questions he is likely to understand.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4gj-khTW2Mg
1	Being an ENTP, would suggest you just talk to him about what being exclusive with you means. Let him know what he needs to do if he intends to keep you .  Tell him he needs to be truthful. Obviously you are important to him so he needs to know your limits.
1	{I saw you posted this twice and felt that if you ever delete the previous one I'd at least have my comment here too, excuse the extra notifications}\n\nAight I'm an ESTJ too who'd pretty much never cheat who's loyal and honest and blabla. \n\nYou're dating an ENTP, aka a person with superego Fi, the ENTP will unlikely care that what they're doing is wrong since they often do not have any values or rules thanks to NeFe, their dominant and tertiary function.\n\nNeFe: There's so much to do in this world! Everyone could do anything they want! As long as I'm seen nicely, that's all what matters!\n\n\nBut what the ENTP forgets is that they have inferior Si, aka a poor focus to details, they could get so caught up in their ideas and world of possibilities that they forget what they once were saying, they don't notice how inconsistent their lies get. And as long as the person they're talking to doesn't notice or doesn't call them out, the ENTP feels confident in what they're saying.\n\nIn order to avoid these types of moments, the ENTP might just try to make everything they say sound super vague. This way when they're stuck, they say that at least they didn't lie. This is a bubble easy to pop, just keep asking questions and force them to be as clear as possible. Then they got the chance to either own up or may end up lying like pussies. (I alwaus saw Fe as a pussy function)\n\n\nSuperego Fi is pretty damn annoying, you could read more about if here https://www.instagram.com/p/BlNWasng7vh/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=14qrtb5x8mlfx\n\nForce the ENTP to be more honest before the relationship gets meh, don't leave them space to be wishy washy, make them open up to you and learn more about their insecurities. Maybe if he opens up to you, he may be more honest. So yeah. Good luck.
1	I am ENTP and other ENTPs are known for their flexibility with all the other types. Why? Because we live and let live mostly and most of the time. We don‚Äôt have grand schemes or specific plans for specific people in our lives and we do NOT want to manage anyone or plan their days and weeks and months and years for them. ENTPs want to just drift in the river of life having only a destination (pillars in their life like education, job, marriage, kids, house, pool, etc). Other than that, ENTPs don‚Äôt like plans and don‚Äôt like to be controlled by someone else‚Äôs plans. \n\nENTPs do NOT flirt with others although it can appear so. They are actually making conversation and trying to be interesting. That‚Äôs it! ENTPs will come off to people who don‚Äôt know them as flirting, but they won‚Äôt even notice that. You can read about that in many articles online. \n\nI think that you know that about your ENTP already. Also, I think that you came here to the ESTJ forum to look for reassurance from other ESTJs to help give you a push for the decision you already made. \n\nYou and your ENTP will have some problems down the road about plans, management, taking control of your lives, and wanting the ENTP to follow your rules and guidelines. They wouldn‚Äôt. Even if they pretended and promised they would. They still wouldn‚Äôt. \n\nIf you love him enough and if he loves you enough then you two CAN make it work. Try to look the other way when he improvise things as he goes. And tell him to do some important things the way you want him to do it. I think it could work like that. 
0	As an ENTP, I would say that my primary gripe with ESTJ's is their rigidity and inflexibility.  They can often be oriented toward the black and white type of thinking - "It either happened or it didn't"...and as someone who can be fragmented and outside the box, I despise being interrogated or judged to be lying because it doesn't all flow in a neat straight line.  I would suggest gaining his trust in the way of being open to the way his mind works and making him not feel like you are going to interrogate and judge every thing he says with a need to make a judgement at the end.  Just as you express wanting to trust him, he needs to trust you.  He also needs to trust that you will be open to ideas and discussions without judgement or needing to do something actionable at the end.  If you can appreciate how his ways will challenge you to think outside the box, he will probably not lie to you.  ENTP's often lie as a means for survival, from childhood we find that coming out and saying everything that is going through our heads typically ends up in being misunderstood.  We don't want to be misunderstood and misjudged.

1	When you're wearing rose coloured glasses, all red flags just look like flags.\n\n
6	Female ESTJ: would you date an INFP? (read)	1. What things do you dislike about INFP?\n\n2. Is there any other type that best meets your requirements?\n\nI'm not looking for anything, I'm just curious.
5	1. The INFP would be too worried about how I'm feeling, as a result, I wouldn't date one, because who knows? They could just be saying something to me to make me feel better, which as a result, actually doesn't. I need the blunt truth, not 'you're a great person BS'. I don't know how to describe it, but some INFPs are very airy fairy-but my best friend is an INFP and we get along quite well. INFPs and ESTJs for friendships, but not relationships\n2. I'd say ISTJ, I want someone who is down to earth and stable, that will call me out when I'm being erratic etc.
5	This relationship has always looked great to me.
6	Female ESTJ dating a female INFP. We've been together for 12 going on 13 years. It's surprising, even though we are like polar opposites, we rarely fight.\n\nThe things I'm not so good at, she's great at and vice-versa. I feel like we compliment each other. She has tons of ideas and I have the drive to make them come to life. I keep things super organized, while she does the cooking. I tend to do all the maintaining. \n\nI have a tendency to get into those "gotta do all the things" moods and have a habit of forgetting about taking care of myself in the process. She helps me with that. \n\nHer support allows me to continue to push myself further and further while keeping me grounded at the same time. And I feel like I provide the support to get her to push herself into elements where she would normally feel uncomfortable.

1	I know a bunch of infp people. I don‚Äôt know if I want to date them for various reasons. I am not sure how long our relationship will last and how much push they can take. I have an older INFP guy telling me he wouldn‚Äôt mind dating me but meh, I don‚Äôt really know. Just not my type of person to date. Be friends with fine. I don‚Äôt know exactly but istj wouldn‚Äôt be bad another ESTJ would probably be fine. Maybe esfp but depends on who. Maybe entj?
1	I‚Äôm an ESTJ and definitely would have dated a INFP when I was in my teens. Two of my closest friends were INFP‚Äôs. But as I‚Äôve grown up and lived a little, I wouldn‚Äôt consider dating that personality type. After dating my current boyfriend who is an INTJ, I‚Äôd be focusing more on finding someone who isn‚Äôt intuitive (makes me feel like I have to control the situation as he doesn‚Äôt rely on fact) and I‚Äôd prefer someone whose also an extrovert. I think most ESTJ‚Äôs want to utilise life to its full potential, and don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòslowed down‚Äô by someone who thinks in a completely different way. I think INFP‚Äôs make great and interesting friends though.
2	Who are your favorite fictional female ESTJs?	Labrys in Persona 4 Arena\n\nDianna Soreil / Kihel Heim in Turn A Gundam\n\nYang Xiao Long in RWBY\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOthers I know of include\n\nRangiku Matsumoto in Bleach\n\nTriela in Gunslinger Girl\n\nSochie Heim in Turn A Gundam
2	"Others I know of include..."\n\nNot trying to be an asshole but how do you know?
2	I‚Äôm pretty sure Hermione is an ESTJ. \n\nAnd I see Leslie Knope as one too. People say esfj but I think she‚Äôs just an extra positive ESTJ. But I could be wrong. I just don‚Äôt see esfj and I know it‚Äôs a character which they can make however they want. \n\nI also always saw Brennan from Bones as an ESTJ. \n\nWhich just leaves me with me with 3 fictional characters who are extremely different from each other but I somehow relate to stronger than anyone else. \n\nBut what brings them all together and makes me believe ESTJ is their work is always the most important thing to them. And that‚Äôs why I believe it‚Äôs ESTJ. Other than Leslie they aren‚Äôt as social but our extroversion allows us to work long hours without burnout and that‚Äôs why I think we are so hard to type. We will work 50-60 hours a week no problem but getting out to go out and be social and party just doesn‚Äôt interest us the same. Unless it‚Äôs work related in which case it makes Leslie even more likely. Everything she does is revolves around her job. \n\nIt‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt enjoy being social and usually once I‚Äôm done with work I make sure to give those most important to me my utmost attention and leave work at work. But at the same time if work calls I can still show up and I usually will want to. \n\n\nHonestly I can see how they might be typed differently but I still believe they are all ESTJ. \n
2	Princess Leia! 
2	Yeah, mc‚Äôgonagall and hermione. There is also different type of ESTjs. I am estj but I am closer to percy. I am a 3 as well.
3	ENTP/ESTJ friendship	Hey y'all.  I'm an ENTP, and I recently moved back to my hometown.  A childhood acquaintance (ESTJ) ran into me, and has since decided that we are bff's.  She *seems* sincere, but she hardly knows me!  All of a sudden I know all of her life secrets (and family secrets), and she always wants me to come over, hang out, or chat.  Is this for real?  I'm usually a pretty good judge, but she genuinely seems to believe that we are close friends now.  I'm reeling a bit from the suddenness of it all, since I usually don't consider someone a friend until at least a year has passed.
5	Probably a sincere act, but also severely lacking in boundaries. Whenever anyone shares too much too soon, I become very careful in how I choose to interact with them. In my experience, over-sharing personal problems right off the bat is unhealthy behavior (think codependent Enneagram 2). Once intertwined,  it's hard to extricate yourself from the situation without drama. Trust your gut. Always. 
3	I also think it‚Äôs a boundary issue. My best friend is ENTP and it was nothing like that, haha
1	How soon are you talking about?\n\nI get on with ENTPs but at a distance I think I do but yeah. I know this guy who is and he use to stalk me all over twitter and debate absolutely everything. He‚Äôs a marxist or close to it and I use to be a libertarian center right but I am more along the GOP lines. But still haha! Interesting is all I can say. I liked my entp teachers but not a lot of entp friends.\n\nApparently the entp I am talking about shares musical tastes.
4	Crushing hard on an ESTJ guy	Hello, I am an ENTP guy and I m crushing very hard on an ESTJ guy and... I dont understand many things about him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile usually giving a real compliment to someone else should make them happier, the guy sometimes answers "cool, so what?".\n\nI am quite vocal and touchy-expressive when it comes to my emotions and while he says it doesnt bother him, he also says "it's just unusual".\n\nWhile cuddling, I always ask for a few more minutes of cuddling and at some point, he would get almost angry and just gets away saying that we should get ready.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could interpret this as a lack of interest but it doesnt seem to be the case either. (his cuddles are the bests)\n\nLikewise, he keeps describing what he is (very unprecisely) and I am supposed to pick up the meanings in terms of likes or dislikes. He doesnt say everything, seeing many things as "obviously" true while I never assume so...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTruth be told, I really dont know how to view it. Whether he seems interested, what kind of behaviour he is expecting?\n\nAlso, what should I do specifically in order to make him happy?\n\nHe is one of the first non female ESTJ I ve met so there's plenty of things I dont know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
7	1) Be yourself. (We sense and respect authenticity.)\n\n2) Set and adhere to personal boundaries, and do nothing just to "make him happy". (We don't typically respect people who don't respect themselves.)\n\n3) An inordinate amount of physical touch may feel clingy or suffocating to him early on in a relationship. Give him time and space to feel that comfortable with you.  If this doesn't evolve to your liking over time, he may not be for you. \n\n
7	I just want to make it clear I‚Äôm not a guy, so this may not resonate and these are just my opinions \n\nOk, so, compliments are nice, however actions mean more to us. Compliments are simply empty words if you say them all the time-it sounds harsh, but I‚Äôm saying it the way I see it. If we‚Äôre talking love languages, I‚Äôd say quality time and acts of service are more important.\n\nI don‚Äôt like hugs or much physical affection, unless it‚Äôs from a few very specific people. It makes me uncomfortable and irritates me, it feels somewhat clingy and like my personal space is being invaded. \n\nUm, he probably views cuddling as wasting time, as he could be using it for other things. It gets in the way of his ‚Äòplan‚Äô for the day.\n\nWhat was different about dating an ESTJ male and ESTJ female? 
2	I am an ENFP and I told my little brother, ESTJ that I missed him and he said, "Thanks." lol. Then again, an ESTJ friend I know loves cuddling with his wife and is very touchy feely, so I don't have a broad answer for you regarding ESTJs. But hope it helps to know some real life examples from my life of ESTJs and that they're not all the same. 
1	Well estjs we are matter of fact so complements are nice but they have to come naturally don‚Äôt try to go out of your way. I had a friend do this and I was like erm okay. Is that all or are there other motives? What‚Äôs up with this guy?\n\nEr. Be direct. Also the matter of factness is a thing and not wasting time.\n\nOtherwise it‚Äôs been pretty well covered. Also estjs have a few variants. I am a estj 3 some are estj 1 or 8 so it all depends.
5	Is it weird for an ESTJ have a hard time talking to girls? My ESTJ friend usually gives up quickly on people if he feels the relationship doesn't take off right away.	
6	I've grown tired of waiting for people to come around, so if I'm not able to determine interest fairly early, I don't really bother anymore. Doesn't stop me from crushing on them still. Been crushing on one girl for near three years now. Likely never going anywhere though. Never much of a problem talking to girls though. I can walk up and talk to them just fine. It's more of a "is it worth my time".
7	I‚Äôm female but honestly same. I can pretty quickly tell if a relationship is going anywhere and I‚Äôm not big on wasting my time. 
3	I don't give up quickly, but I have noticed that I get bored quickly with people. I had this pattern of talking to guys for a month before I was over it. It kept happening and I couldn't figure out why. Then I met my current partner and we've been going strong for 6 months. \n\nI personally think ESTJs have this ability to see things in people that others might not notice. We might see recklessness in someone and we'd know that isn't something we want. We see laziness or someone who isn't very motivated and we know that bothers us. ESTJs are one of the last types to want any of their time wasted so any indication of a potential relationship not working out and we won't even bother. \n\nI had so many of my girls say I was too picky and judgemental about relationships but I just kept watching their relationships fail and it all seemed pointless to me. Not to mention the one who would never shut up about me having too high of standards is already on her 2nd husband before 26.  \n\nFor me, there has to be a point to the relationship. I'm not just going to spend 3 months with a guy if I don't see a future with them. And I do hookups or fwb but none of those are ever with people I'm remotely serious about. \n\n
2	I‚Äôm a girl, I don‚Äôt have a problem talking to guys I like, but I do get discouraged if they‚Äôre not interested right away. The guys I‚Äôm usually into, take ages to make a move-that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve learnt patience haha
2	How to motivate an ESTJ?	My younger brother (17) is an ESTJ. How can I an ENTJ (22) motivate him to work harder and reach his goals?
10	This probably isn‚Äôt useful, but (in some cases) the more people try to make me do something (if I don‚Äôt want to do it), the less likely I will be to do whatever it is they want me to do (we‚Äôre stubborn).\n\nTo answer your question directly: idk
9	A list. Or make them in charge. 
3	If you're already trying to motivate an ESTJ to work harder I think there's a problem. Growing up I always had plans and goals. I was very future-oriented, so the thought that you (op)  are trying to get your younger brother to work harder to reach his goals might just be the problem. \n\nESTJs value their independence and like accomplishing things on their own and I'm sorta getting the feeling that you are trying to assert yourself in thinking it's your responsibility whether he does something or not.  \n\nThe second someone else tries to help me do anything I almost immediately give up. And I'm talking about goals and plans that I have. I like to keep a lot of that stuff to myself and just because you can't see it doesn't mean nothing is happening. \n\nCan I ask what goals we're talking about here? Has he told you them? Has he asked for help? Has he given you any indication that he needs help? 
2	INFPs (Socionics EII) are superb motivators for us. ISFPs too.\n\nOther good things are curiosity. Give us good problems to solve. Good probably means he has some ideas about how to solve them.\n\nWe often get told things and interpret them wrong because we took people literally. Make sure that he's got the right idea for the subjects he's having trouble on.
2	Tell them (that you believe) they can't do something. 
1	So it depends what type of estj I am a 3w2 so achievement is my thing some may be 1w2 and are different or 8w7.\n\nI want to ask what goals your goals or his goals? Maybe he‚Äôs working hard but you don‚Äôt know it? I‚Äôve had arguments as to who‚Äôs goals a lot. I don‚Äôt take interest in your goals sorry. I don‚Äôt want to do this. Yeah, this may be your priority but it isn‚Äôt mine, and here is why. Sometime they listen and sometime they won‚Äôt.\n\nFor example I am busy up to my eyeballs with other stuff and I left some paperwork to my father. I am also blind so filling stuff out is a tedious and b inaccessible. He‚Äôs found a bunch of scholarships but that‚Äôs not my top priority. Am I not driven? No. Absolutely not, but that‚Äôs just not my priority. I‚Äôve also been told I look like I do nothing. What cranking up my music and doing stuff is doing nothing? Okay? Haha! And then there are periods of burn out I am a 3 so that may make sense.

2	What do you guys tend to think of ENFPs?	As the two extroverted types within the Delta Quadrant, I'm very intrigued by how we would interact. I have a few INFPs and ISTJs in my life so they're not as a much of a mystery to me. \n\nI often wonder if I'm an ESTJ with a preference for Ne, but my Fi is quite strong, and my Si is definitely my weakest. I tend to force myself into Ne-Te quite a lot and sometimes wonder if I prefer Te to Fi, although I can find that if I stay in Ne-Te too long I can develop a bit of a Messiah complex, so after a heavy day of Te I deffo need to ethically recalibrate by pondering over my favourite philosophers. I definitely prefer Si-Fi to Si-Te. \n\nI've definitely learnt a lot by examining the ISTJs but as we both have an unbalanced perceiving axis, I feel like it would be more fruitful now to observe ESTJs, I feel like we can help each other as I have the balanced judgement axis, so I like to believe (although this is probably my ego) that I find a perfect equilibrium between efficiency and ethics. But my perceptions man, not only do I find living in my own body and experiences traumatic on a day to day basis, but my memory is the worst so most of what's in my head is just me filling in a lot of blanks, which makes everything very pretty, but not very grounded or down to earth. I feel like I would greatly benefit from understanding the ESTJ, with your balanced perceiving aixs, you can use your own experience to gather facts and details with Si and then draw the necessary conclusions with your Ne. I find that INFPs tend to bring out the worst in me, which is my laziness, and my sadness, but I feel like the ESTJ I would find empowering and motivating. \n\nSo here's a few questions that I have, that if you feel you have any specific insight that you may like to give, would be greatly appreciated:\n\n- what differences do you notice between those of you who prefer Ne to Si, and vice versa? \n\n- what is inferior Fi like? How does it affect you? What do you notice in your day to day lives that shows you have inferior Fi? \n\n- do you ever feel like you wish you could stop moving? When in Ne-Te I feel like a hummingbird that has to continuously move from flower to flower to get sugar in order to stay aflight. I feel like being in Te nearly all the time must be tiring, \n\n- how do you use Si to balance your Ne? \n\n- I feel like we would get on, because of that shared Ne-Te that we may like to use together and may take us on many adventures and I feel like ESTJ company would help me get things done. However, I feel like I could also be very annoying, either because I'm a total Politically Correct, philosophical, & ethical square. Or I can see us as being rivals, I know that I get a wee bit schemish, malevolent, and competitive when someone else who is also very unique and leader-ey is around, ( makes me insecure I guess) \n\n- do you have any other advice, feedback, anecdotes, tips, that you can offer? \n\nI feel at home in the Delta Quadrant, I feel like other quadrants have very different values, but interacting with types with the same functions as me is so refreshing and really helps me to ground my sense of self, and that I'm not a weird freak. Everyone around me seems to have Fe-Ti axis and it really gets me down because I feel like a black sheep. \n\n
6	I haven't got an answer for those questions at the bottom, but I am often annoyed by their unpunctuality and spontaneity.
4	Male ESTJ here.\n\nI love almost all INFP (Socionics EII) music I find, but tend to ignore ENFP. The same with most other stuff like novels and youtube video makers.\n\nI usually like ENFP characters a lot. Sometimes they compete with my favorite INFPs.\n\nIn conversation, they tend to bounce around topics a lot more while ESTJ / INFP conversations act more like a stack. We're constantly adding something new to talk about and figure out with the intent to make it easier to understand the topics before it. Eventually, we'll make it back to the original conversation.\n\nMy closest relationship with an ENFP is my female cousin. We hit it off like magic when we get together, but it's usually several years apart when we see each other in person. I don't have any ENFPs in close friend groups at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Questions\n\n1. I'm a little confused by what you mean by prefer here. My Si greatly helps in my personality typing, even as a secondary trait, as I can feel my own reactions to people and distinguish between them. Ne with Fi seems to like to break the rules of logic in a way that is appealing to Deltas, and it's stronger with ENFP than INFP. I don't know much about using it myself. In the context of Gammas, it seems to be about gauging power / willpower and similar concepts. I find that pretty hard though.\n2. In terms of my own inferior Fi, it's difficult to feel empathy with a lot of people. I'm working on it with the help of INFPs and I've gotten a lot better. Also, it's really hard to distinguish the details in my emotions. Do I feel sad? Lonely? Resentful? I don't know, often.\n3. Mentally, being in our own function is easy. We also seem to have huge amounts of physical energy as long as we are being energized and our extroversion is satisfied.\n4. I'm a little confused here. Secondary Si use already feels situational and Ne even more so.\n5. This depends so much on how our functions interact. I'm not politically correct, but I can follow some of the rules presented to me by INFPs. They usually give an explanation which I need to follow them. As far as leadership goes, I tend to give it up easily and only take it when it is clear everyone wants me in that position. This might be tied to my brother and mother being INTJ.
2	I‚Äôve only known ONE ENFP that I‚Äôm 99% sure I‚Äôve typed correctly, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm allowed to judge ENFPs in general, but we didn‚Äôt get along - at all. \n\nShe would cry often about things I‚Äôd consider minor, she is very sensitive. She wasn‚Äôt a mean person, but she wanted affirmation/validation from her friends and attention constantly - that personally annoys me (my most hated question is: do you like me? NO, THE ANSWER IS NO~I‚Äôd remain silent). We just don‚Äôt understand each other. \n\nAnyway, it eventually blew up, after dropping so many hints about the fact I didn‚Äôt consider her a friend, I flat out told her and you can imagine how that went. The rest is history, we don‚Äôt speak, but she‚Äôs happier now and so am I :)\n\nI think it‚Äôs more a personal preference than an ESTJ thing, but idk 
2	Belated response, but perhaps I can provide some insight as an ESTJ female. I don't know all these inner workings of MBTI personalities, so I can't answer your specific questions directly, but I can speak to my opinion of ENFPs very well. My best friend of 5+ years is an ENFP male. I really enjoy spending time with him because he is so lively, open to new ideas/trying new things, and genuinely engaging with other people as this personality type. He is supportive and encouraging and can read people in under 30 seconds. In general I have a positive opinion of ENFPs as we can spend the whole day together and it's always great.\n\nHowever, the parts of his ENFP personality that do rather drive me up the wall sometimes is that he is completely okay living in the "grey area" so to speak. He def doesn't see life black and white like I do, so naturally we clash on things. Sometimes he is, what I view coming from an ESTJ, as flaky because he'll change plans kind of last minute or change the restaurant etc. We dated briefly and definitely experienced the typical challenges in an ESTJ-ENFP relationship. For example, I wanted to define what was going on, exclusivity, etc. or at least have that discussion. For him, he felt like he was being boxed in. I value tradition on things like Valentine's Day, he doesn't nearly as much. Hence, we are much better off as friends. \n\nWe can occasionally get annoyed at each about logistical things in our friendship which comes from our differences in personalities as I'm routine oriented and like to stick to a plan and he is much more spontaneous. But what friendship doesn't on occasion? That being said, he is one of the most fun people to spend time with and I enjoy his ability to just life life and his understanding of people pushes me to understand that feelings aren't so black and white/logical and to analyze my own emotions.\n\nHope this is somewhat helpful! In short, ENFPs make great friends and I love spending time with them but don't feel it's a particularly compatible dating partner.
2	Estj 3w2 here.\n\nSo what is inferior fi? The most unhealthy think about what our president is doing or does when he gets angry. I don‚Äôt go that far but i can have states of unhealthy fi, but it has to be very far out, and not very often, usually with family. Mostly snarky comments sometimes a few and I pretend you don‚Äôt exist until you agree with me. I am blind and I don‚Äôt mind questions, but sometimes people underestimate me. I usually regret it but I was standing there greeting one sunday at church and someone asked he was a fellow greter you‚Äôre blind how can you greet? I gave him this shrug of the shoulders and like watch me I am sure you can‚Äôt do any better and kind of did it showily. Haha! I usually am more stable and then I felt bad when he said oh well you‚Äôre actually a really good greeter. I held my tongue but I was going to say I knew as much. I tell people to think trump but I don‚Äôt get as bad. But snarky comments can be my thing. I also think trump is an 8 I am a 3.\n\nBut I can lose my cool completely as well, not as bad as trump but think percy weasley. I am a lot more like that too.\n\nI am also one to prefer ne a little for those estj who does it‚Äôs called looping I think. See do see do is the type of thing that happens. Too much on their plates. I think estj with a heavy ne is a big 3 thing. I am fairly intuitive, and have a good ne. I thought I may be entj. But probably not. But te ne loops happen and then I get exhausted because I have 3452671 tasks to do and wonder how I can do them all. They all sound great. I was on the newspaper for a bit, I was a journalism student for a bit, and I‚Äôd take on 6 articles and then I realized I had to interview, transcribe write down quotes and write my story for all these good ideas. Yikes!!! No thanks! Overload is my thing then I wonder why I need so much sleep like today. I‚Äôve gotten like 11 hours, I keep going back for more. And I am not a big fan of sleeping.\n\nSo I don‚Äôt know much enfp personally, the ones I know really seem happy go lucky. I had a notetaker she was a comm major we were on the newspaper together actually but she was the best at what she did. Really chirpy and really in to the werid. Haha!
5	Anyone else find it difficult to ‚Äòtell people off‚Äô?	I‚Äôve always assumed ESTJs have no difficulty ‚Äòtelling people off‚Äô (that‚Äôs what other MBTI types have said). I have no problem telling people what to do, but I can‚Äôt seem say things like ‚Äòyour behaviour is unacceptable yada yada yada‚Äô. \n\nAnyone else? Thoughts? Opinions? Or am I just an unhealthy ESTJ because I prefer to avoid conflict? 
2	[deleted]
2	It depends on a few things, but in general, it's not too difficult for me to tell someone off. \n\nFor example, if I am confident that whoever is on the receiving end of my "wrath" is not going to cut all ties from me afterward, then I have no problems laying into them. \n\nIf I know that there is a sensitive person who would not take it well, then I'm not going to bother. That would put me in a counterproductive situation where nothing would be accomplished. That being said, for me "telling someone off" is less of a personal attack, and more of a "please listen to me, I'm trying to help you see how to be better" type of thing. \n\nI take care of my ISFP uncle by doing the tasks around the house that he cannot do anymore because he is getting older. Sometimes he will stubbornly go outside and lift a heavy piece of machinery and potentially hurt himself. I cannot stand this, so I tell him off. I don't take pride in it, and I don't like to tell him off because he can be overly sensitive sometimes, but I care more about his well being than his feelings. In this case, I don't find it difficult to tell him off because I know that he still loves and accepts me for who I am, and knows that I mean well. We have a... Black and White relationship. We can either get along really really well, or he just bugs me sometimes. \n\nI'm in college, and I study music in a place where there are a lot of my peers who think it's okay to slack off, not practice, skip class and prioritize debauchery over academics. I wouldn't feel comfortable telling my peers off in this instance because they would think I'm a stuck-up goodie two shoes and not want to be around me. \n\n
3	No, I can‚Äôt tell people off. ENTJ employee of mine is much better at it. They‚Äôre more quick-witted and enjoy arguments. 
3	In my experience, ESTJs with more developed Fi are more aware of, and considerate of, others' feelings; making "telling people off" more complicated.  I have seen this change in myself as I've gotten older and life experience has forced growth of my Fi.
1	It depends. And it also depends on what estj you are I am 3w2 so yes. But especially life choices. I know what‚Äôs right but I can‚Äôt tell others what‚Äôs right. Like I have no backbone even if I know that lifestyle choice is wrong to say so. I want to but yeah, I use to be better at it but had less friends. I know practically everyone these days. I‚Äôve had issues of saying no though.
12	Dealing with types that aren't very resilient	Consider myself a healthy ESTJ but my biggest struggle by far is dealing with other types that aren't very resilient or motivated. They go through struggles and don't recover, or they get jealous of other people's accomplishments and never consider how they could do the same. \n\nHad a friend tell me once that they wouldn't survive the things I have, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why. Seems to me we're all capable of growing, learning, and accomplishing things, but maybe not. \n\nAny tips on gaining a better understanding of people that don't bounce back or aren't as motivated?\n\n&#x200B;
14	ESTJ seems to be a type likely to still perform despite difficult circumstances, or even considering the challenges and adversity as exciting and thrilling.\n\nI think ESTJ can be exceptional among the types in that kind of resilience, and that can be a model by which the others learn how to perform better.\n\nStill, the things that motivate the types are likely to vary. Accurately noticing what the motivating factors are would be very important if you want to motivate people.\n\nMy observations: A lot of the time our motivation and reward systems in our brains are hijacked by things like drugs, food, etc. Helping people with those things first is pretty standard in trying to pull people out of their funks.\n\nAnother aspect of it is that sometimes people just value significantly differing things. One wants a lot of money, and another mainly just wants donuts. Which one is right? Both maybe? That kind of thing gets complicated.
12	My ESTJ boyfriend grew up in an abusive household, and he responded as you would expect. ESTJs never let anything affect them, and I‚Äôm in awe of his resilience every day. \n\nHis sister, a more emotional type, didn‚Äôt turn out as well. It completely broke her, and she has been a hot mess for her entire life. \n\nBoyfriend has serious resentment towards his sister because she can‚Äôt seem to get over it and get her act together. I mean they don‚Äôt speak at all, it‚Äôs pretty bad. \n\nI tried to tell my boyfriend that his response to abuse is really extraordinary and that he is an extraordinary person. His sister is an ordinary person, responding to childhood trauma the way an ordinary person would. She‚Äôs not a bad person, she‚Äôs just a regular person. Not a moron, just not an ESTJ. She has a different operating system and doesn‚Äôt measure her life by efficiency. \n\nWe‚Äôre still working on this together. I think the best thing to do is shift your mindset from ‚Äúother people are not resilient‚Äù to ‚ÄúI have much more resilience than the average person.‚Äù
7	I've learned that resilience has to do with your locus of control.  This is the degree to which you believe you are, or are not, in control of your own life.  Those with an internal locus of control can be quite resilient because we believe that we are able to change things.  Those with an external locus believe they are powerless or their efforts will be futile.  ESTJ's are basically the poster child for internal locus of control.  So when you are dealing with someone not as resilient as yourself, just remind yourself that their inborn temperament + their experiences have taught them that they aren't in control of their life to a large degree.  If you have influence over that person, you could help them to have a more internal locus of control.  Read pages like this one for ideas: https://themotivationmindset.com/internal-locus-of-control/
4	Well not everyone is for what we are for and not everyone‚Äôs big thing is achievement and work. I don‚Äôt usually have issues unless they are really just usually unmotivated and throws themselves a huge pity party.\n\nI am a blind ESTJ. And I‚Äôve accomplished quite a bit in life, more than a lot of blind people. In fact I was a representative at this organization because I was the model of achievement what blind people can be. I‚Äôve done everything from navigate a new city, to campaigning and running fliers for a congressman‚Äôs campaigns, being a journalist, attending a regular college. I am basically not blind. I am a normal person and more haha! So in the blind community I am often as seen as amazing and kind of a role model. I want to be like that, but no one really tries. My problem is when people just sit at home and throw themselves a pity party. I don‚Äôt usuallly bother to say too much unless it gets extreme. OH well they can do something sit at home and argue with each other. Hahaha! It‚Äôs really sad. But yeah, I know what you mean, but for most people I just see it as not their goal. I am the busy body blind person. I am also very well liked in my community and involved in it. But yeah,I can get the frustration, but at the same time I tell myself that‚Äôs just not the aim of most others who are not the estj or xstj types.
6	I‚Äôm the same, I find it challenging to empathise in these situations, because I struggle with different things and therefore can‚Äôt understand why others find it so difficult. What I do, if someone says they have anxiety (just an example), I think of it like getting nervous but multiplied by 1000 and uncontrollable. Then I‚Äôm like oh shit, if you need me to do anything, I‚Äôm here. Obviously anxiety and nerves aren‚Äôt the same, but that‚Äôs the only way I can kind of understand what they‚Äôre going through.
2	I have no tips. I don‚Äôt actually believe ‚Äòless resilient‚Äô is a good excuse. Everyone goes through crap, everyone breaks and falls apart. Everyone makes choices. Owning your choices, good or bad,and recognizing your own power is what makes a person capable of striving to pull their shit back together. \n
2	Okay so you have to ask these questions\n\nA: Do you care about this person\n\nB: Dose this persons failure make your life worse.\n\nIf the awnser  to both of these questions is no, then why do you care? If the awnser to\n\nA is yes: Then take them aside and explain how this is hurting you. If they don‚Äôt want to get better this is now there problem. \n\nB is yes: Explain to the person how there hurting you. Offer to help them. If they refuse to get better, try getting other people you think they‚Äôll listen to involved. If they still don‚Äôt listen move on with your life and due the best you can.\n
2	Also, if your going to hold yourself above abuse victims pleas go fuck yourself.

0	ENFP -\nIs the question about stagnation caused by emotion? Surely since you're not an emotional type, you could think that maybe you don't understand what it's like to have emotion running through your brain 24/7? For me, if something is not quite right emotionally, that shit needs to be sorted out, and as fully as possible if I plan to move on with my life most successfully. The stuff that I don't resolve stays with me, eating away at me when I'm alone.\nLooking at rational reasons to null introverted feeling isn't possible since it's my auxiliary function to feel what I'm feeling and find where the problem lies and then deal with it.\n
2	Need some advice with my ESTJ father...	INTJ female here.\n\nWARNING: Really Long! I'm not giving a short version because I actually want good advice. Sorry.\n\nHey ESTJs, I need some advice on how to calm this situation with my ESTJ father. To start out, I don't blame him for any of this, we are very different in the ways we think, so this completely went over my head until he brought up how much I disrespected him. Of course, being the INTJ that I am, I was just thinking logically as to what I should do or not, and I didn't think about how he would see what I did as disrespectful, even though I suppose it was. My mind was in a totally different thinking process than his was, so I just didn't consider it.\n\nMy father (ESTJ) was playing a board game with my friends and siblings. He had just got home after everyone had eaten dinner, so obviously everyone was full and content, except for him of course since he hadn't eaten yet. Everyone was playing the game except one of my friends and myself. \nHe requested that I make him some Venison steak and potatoes since that's what we ate. I know, simple request, I should have just made it and not overthought it.\nI thought that since it was just my friend and I, she'd be left out from everyone if I spent (roughly) 40 minutes making the venison steak the way he likes it, and it's 10:00pm so it'd be late and I wouldn't be able to entertain our guest. \nSo, I decided to give him just potatoes, extra so that he wouldn't still be hungry. This was quick, It was late, I could spend time with my friend so she wouldn't be left out, and I still gave him one of the things he wanted.\n\nMy friend brought up the potatoes to him, and then I went up about two minutes later.\nI didn't think it was a big deal that I just made him potatoes, but apparently it was. \nHe left the game and said he wanted to talk to be for 5 minutes. I got a huge lecture (won't go into detail with everything he said) on how I disrespected and embarrassed him. \nHe does a lot for me, so he brought that up, saying that I couldn't do this one simple thing so I must not care about him. I told him that I do care about him and then I explained to him why I didn't do it, he got angry, only saw it as disrespectful, and then told me he was going to make the venison himself. I blocked him and said I'd make it for him, he angrily barged past and told me that he would make it himself and that I could do whatever it was I wanted to do. \n\nI don't exactly know what to do from here. I ended up telling my friends that he decided not to play, and then I went to bed since my friend took his spot, so I didn't have to worry about her anymore.\n\nAlso I realized that I forgot to apologise during our discussion, but I'm not going to right now because I might accidentally cause a scene and probably embarras him more, as well as myself.\n\nTo me, this wasn't a big deal until he made it into one, and he ended up embarrassing both of us when I don't think anyone else was even paying attention before. I'm not saying I wasn't in the wrong, but to me this is pretty dumb and I feel childish even having to write this.\nAny advice? How would you feel if you were him and how would you want to be apologized to?\nWe just think so differently, I wasn't expecting him to be so mad. I wish it had, but it didn't even cross my mind that he'd see it that way.
2	INTJ (Socionics ILI) is a special case because they are the supervisor relationship to ESTJ (Socionics LSE) in Socionics. It's hard to see how it applies in this situation, but this issue of disrespect might have been building up over time where he feels disrespected through no fault of your own.\n\nI'm kind of similar in that I am an ESTJ with INTJ mother and brother. I don't know what it's like to have that as a child though. The easiest solution to healing these types of relationships is to get some physical or emotional distance. Try to avoid cooperating on things or teaching each other things. Alternatively, get someone else's help in handling a request when you think that there might be an issue.\n\nRespect and control are both important issues for ESTJs, with respect being even more important for guys.\n\n\nhttp://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Supervision
1	It sounds like he was hangry and in retrospect should probably realize that he is a grown man capable of feeding himself and the world doesn‚Äôt stop and tend to him just because he walked into the room. And making you feel super lousy about that was pretty lousy on his part. \n\nI also have an estj father. I‚Äôve spent the better part of my life butting heads with him over stuff like this, so I‚Äôm not sure I can give particularly helpful advice. We are rough on each other and while we don‚Äôt have a horrible relationship, we don‚Äôt have a great one, either. I suspect you have your own unique family dynamic where you don‚Äôt kick him in the pants while he‚Äôs down, which is probably better.\n\nBut it will likely just blow over now that presumably he‚Äôs been fed. When I have an ugly toddler tantrum of an Fi moment, I prefer to leave it in the past and hope people forgive me for being a crabby spoiled baby.
1	To be honest, I feel resentful when my partner (ENTP) and i (ESTJ) get home from work and he heads straight for the computer or sits on the couch and leaves me with cleaning, getting dinner ready etc. \n\nWe do the same routine every day but he still needs me to ask him to do stuff only because he's not routine orientated. It could of been built up resentment or maybe your dad just had a really hard day.  He sees you having fun with your friends and thinks well i just worked all day, and shes been home with her friends, she can do this 1 thing for me. \n\nIt could be about control, but for me it would be resentment. And when you didnt do as he asked he saw it as being lazy and disrespectful.\n\nI would just let it go, you can apologise in the morning if you want, but he'll get over it. \n\nAs long as the person doesn't do it again, i don't need an apology. Actions speak louder than words.\n\nThats my opinion anyway.
1	Estj 3w2 here.\n\nI think I understand where this is going. I do a lot for others myself. I think it‚Äôs the mentality of I do much for you, can you just do one thing for me? It‚Äôs like that with my infp sister sometimes it‚Äôs slightly different and it‚Äôs more of a lack of appreciation. Maybe you could have invited your friend in to the kitchen to hang out? I would simply say sorry I was wrong and I appreciate what you do for me, I will never do it again and not do it. I would be fine with it if it‚Äôs never done again, but if it‚Äôs done over and over and over again, I‚Äôll get tired of it. I have a friend currently in that situation with me. I usually don‚Äôt get this angry but it‚Äôs pushed through quite a few barriers.
1	INTJ Here, I completely understand your situation. My dad is also ESTJ. Although, being in your shoes I would know this was completely my fault. Because I should know what rules my dad imposes and requires. In which case he would always get priority over friends. I would have invited my friend over to the kitchen to make the meal for him together or something. ESTJs on a basic level are easy to deal with, sometimes annoying or frustrating, but easy. They have rules, if you care about them, follow them. Especially if you‚Äôre below them like a case of a parent.
6	Do you actually LIKE to work or are you just good at it?	Please help me understand...who TF *likes* to work?? Why can my ESTJ friend go to work for months without taking breaks?
18	I LIKE to accomplish things. Also I like to be on top of the socio-economic hierarchy. \n\nI am not sure about your friend, but at least in socionics LSE's are (amongst other things) known to be the "Grinders".
8	Both. I like to complete things my way and I don't like when someone "helps" or covers for me while on vacation. Everyone knows ESTJ way is best ;)
8	I‚Äôm good at getting things done and I like the feeling of satisfaction when I check things off the list. I like my coworkers, so work is social for me.\n\nI don‚Äôt like taking vacations, partially because I hate the idea of making someone else‚Äôs week harder so I can sit home in my pajamas. I worry they‚Äôll find the added work overwhelming or screw it up. And I worry that I‚Äôll like doing nothing so much better and it‚Äôll make going back to work massively depressing. \n\nI‚Äôve taken singular days off throughout the year, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve taken consecutive days off since last October.
4	I love what I do for work, and the long hours don‚Äôt bother me. I put in 60-70 hours a week because I find my work stimulating, challenging, and exciting... and I‚Äôm good at it. Sales is a competitive line of work and I like putting in more work (and thus achieving better results) than my peers.
3	I like both, I love making people happy and smile - that makes me feel like I‚Äôve accomplished something. I also love people, so yeah, work is great 
5	I hate working. I would love to stay at home and potter around the house but i work because i have priorities and responsibilities also i get a kick out of knowing that if i didnt go to work, someone else would screw up and it would take me twice as long to get it back to order when i returned. \n\nI work from 8am to 4pm, and at around 430-5 sometimes 5.30-6 my boss is like "why are you still here belindaberry!, go home". I literally cannot leave without finishing what i started. The last holiday i took was sept last year and I always feel guilty when i call in sick.
1	Wow, for months! Lol. Do you realize normal person has like 2-3 weeks of vacation tipe depending on a  country and months without a break is nothing extraordinary.\n\nKnowning that months without a break sounds wow to you says a lot about your type (lazy millenial, lol)
1	I find work fun, it‚Äôs actually my favourite way to spend my time tbh
1	Love to work. Almost never take a whole day off. Had to take a cruise without WiFi to force myself to stop. 
1	late to the party but i fucking love my job.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.\n\ni'd rather be working, or prepping something for work. I'm always thinking about work. CONSTANTLY. and i work for myself so there's "no reason" to stop except that taxing thing called a social life.  
1	Depends on what estj you are I am estj 3w2 and yes I love working on things. Accomplishment is good like other people said. I also like community service type work. The only time I don‚Äôt like work is burnout.
1	I‚Äôm an ESTJ and work hard because work is such a large chunk of my time that I may as well have a good time with it. This means being competent, valuable and a positive influence on my workplace. If I was to be crap at my job, I‚Äôd honestly have a hard time seeing the purpose of life (unless I tried something else). But ESTJ‚Äôs are long term thinkers, and I want a career. I want momentum and reliability. Also the thought of taking time off, and things changing (someone else learnt your role, social dynamics shift) also gives me a sense of lack of control. I wouldn‚Äôt want to come back and be behind either. \n\nI think ESTJ‚Äôs work hard because they big-picture care about the amount of time their working life will take up of their lives.
53	Your ESTJ Care and Handling User Guide and Manual	**Congratulations!**\n\nYou have just selected your very own ESTJ Executive unit! As our most popularly selected unit available you are sure to be pleased. In fact, satisfaction is guaranteed! If you are unsatisfied with your unit simply submit a complaint directly to your unit itself.\n\n## Your ESTJ will come with the following accessories:\n\n* One (1) Professionally Tailored Power Suit‚Ñ¢\n* One (1) Set of lounge clothes\n* One (1) formal outfit for religious and formal events\n* One (1) Laptop\n* Two (2) Cell phones\n* One (1) Gym Membership\n* One (1) Pair of smart gloves for texting\n* One (1) Bluetooth headset (for talking to people while talking to people)\n\n## Software\n\nYour ESTJ comes pre-programmed with the following traits;\n\n**Te:** As the dominant function, this provides your ESTJ unit with unmatched efficiency and a keen understanding of what works in a practical setting. This function provides your unit with high levels of organization and practicality as well as a blunt clarity in communication style that other units may find abrasive.\n\n**Si:** This function provides your unit with a mental database of previously established effective methods of handing situations it has encountered before that can be recalled quickly when needed.\n\n**Ne:**¬†This function provides your unit with a boost to creative problem solving when facing a new situation or when previously established methods are no longer effective.\n\n**Fi:**¬†This function provides your unit with moral indignation and superiority as well as curiously strong attachment bonds to carefully selected partners. As the inferior function your ESTJ will avoid accessing this software as much as possible as it directly interferes with their default mode.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere is no need for a quick-start procedure. Your ESTJ will be fully functional and activated right out of the box. In fact, there is no box because excess packaging is highly inefficient.\n\n## Modes\n\nGet Shit Done Mode (*default*)- When in this mode your ESTJ will complete any and all necessary tasks required for successful completion of the assigned goals. In order to activate this mode, your ESTJ will require suggestion(s) and/or idea(s) to be presented. If more than one suggestion or idea is presented your ESTJ will automatically select the most effective or efficient one and proceed to get that shit done. This mode can be intermittently active for however long is necessary to complete the project.\n\nDo Absolutely Nothing Mode - Automatically activated after completion of a major project deadline. Your ESTJ unit will cease all productive function and instead do absolutely nothing until it is sufficiently recharged.\n\nOh Hell No Mode - Activated whenever someone assumes your ESTJ unit will get shit done but neither asks nor directly informs your unit. When activated your ESTJ unit will express noticeable aggravation towards the assuming person and refuse to complete the task as a matter of principle.\n\nYou‚Äôre Doing It Wrong Mode - When activated this mode has two possible outcomes; 50% chance of activating the¬†‚Äúfine, give it to me‚Äù response. In such cases your ESTJ will assume responsibility for a task which they no longer can observe another unit fail to satisfactorily complete. If this response does not activate your ESTJ will simply watch in smug amusement considering it a fitting lesson. This mode will deactivate after your unit says¬†‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù\n\nTouchy-Feely Mode (*locked*) - Randomly activated by what is assumed to be fluctuating levels of hormones and emotions within your ESTJ unit. Also can usually be unlocked and activated by having your ESTJ unit watch an action movie with a strong emotional component (i.e. Big Hero 6)\n\n## Relationships with Other Units\n\n**NF:** Finds them confusing but likable. Good project partners that provide good energy to a group.\n\n**NT:** Generally very confused by them. Sometimes Infuriating, but your ESTJ is unable to walk away from what it perceives to be a mess. Often surprised that NTs do not walk away first. Confused by their seeming inability to accept statements at face value and instead to analyze everything.\n\n**SJ:** These units make sense to your ESTJ, who considers them to be good people provided they are willing to try something new when the old methods do not work.\n\n**SP:** Frequently cause eye rolling in your ESTJ. Finds them fun to have around but hard to take seriously or respect. When SP units feed your ESTJ it will probably like them, but may still not respect them.\n\n## Feeding\n\nFor optimal performance, provide your ESTJ with food on a regular basis. While it will cook for itself, cooking is seen as an interruption to getting shit done. Cooking is inefficient because you have to cook again at the next meal.\n\n## Grooming\n\nYour ESTJ will groom itself. No need to concern yourself there.\n\n## Sleeping\n\nYour ESTJ will automatically enter sleep mode when the body shuts down. Any attempt to induce sleep prior to shut down will be met with hostile resistance.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n*What is my ESTJ thinking?*  \nWhatever the last thing your ESTJ said was.\n\n*What is my ESTJ feeling?*  \nNeutral unless otherwise stated\n\n*How do I plan a date for my ESTJ?*  \nCome up with a detailed plan and submit it to your ESTJ. Wait for notes providing suggestions for improvement. Follow the notes.\n\n*Why does my ESTJ have so much criticism?*  \nYour ESTJ is not criticizing you - just your plans and ideas. Your ESTJ is simply trying to help you improve your ideas and plans as much as possible.\n\n*But have you considered‚Ä¶.*  \nYes. Your ESTJ unit has already considered that. Thank you for your input.\n\n**Again, Congratulations of your new ESTJ unit! Now go be productive!**

9	Why?!	
8	I feel victimized by this.
5	I think all the types got it pretty bad from google, except for ENFPs
5	Hahaha, I mean, I'm not going to deny the second suggestion
4	In my experience, people have limited experience with ESTJs and think anybody they don't like and tries to control them is one. I was shocked to find out a guy I know was an ESTJ after he took the test. He is very friendly, likes to joke around, minds his own business. Then again, I'm neither a coworker nor employee of his, and he works almost nonstop.
2	They're just jealous, yall are the best <3
2	My ESTJ isn't "manipulative"...she is just constantly optimizing the current and future events for maximum gain for herself and immediate circle, while simultaneously retroactively re-describing the past.
2	ü§î What is the sweetest thing someone has done for you?	AND what is her/his mbti type?
1	I‚Äôm not good at showing my emotions. Whenever someone does something for me, my only response is ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù If it came to a point that someone would offer their kidney for me, the best thing I can respond with is ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù and I‚Äôll just leave it at that. \n\nI like to do grand gestures, and I suppose if someone tops those, I would express my gratitude more openly. But until then, a simple thank you will suffice. 
1	Yeah, I don‚Äôt know if I can remember. There are probably a lot of them. But nothing stands out.\n\n\nSometimes it‚Äôs other ESTJs. Like one of my favorite professor he‚Äôs EXTJ I think I think ESTJ was like are you taking another one of my classes? It‚Äôs like please tell me yes. Haha! I was like yes, I need to anyway. I am quite popular so many things. Honestly. There was a teacher in high school I think he‚Äôs estj or istj. But I didn‚Äôt have much friends in high school there are a number of reasons, but this teacher was like what are you doing out there? I told him waiting for my class. He was across the hall and he said well come in here, why don‚Äôt you, and I hung out ever since in his class. There are a lot.
1	I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶
5	ESTJ‚Äôs & Breakups?	What are some things y‚Äôall do during breakups or tough times that help you cope? \n\nMy roommate recently was dumped by her boyfriend of 3 years, I would really love to support & be there for her but don‚Äôt quite understand her thought process. I am an ISFJ & came here looking for ideas to help her out & to motivate her to go to class etc. I listen to her & try being there for her but is there anything more specific I can be doing?? \nThank you guys :)
10	ESTJs often go to their shadow, INFP, during break ups. I always became an introverted homebody.  Sad music. Cathartic movies. Order takeout. 
6	Do things to take her mind off the break up :)\n\nPersonally-idk whether it's an ESTJ thing or not- but I thoroughly dislike when people tell me everything is going to be ok and 'you're ok', if I'm sitting on the ground crying, I am probably not ok. 
6	All of these are on target, when in pain I tend to want to withdraw but that leads to awful effects for me personally. I agree with taking them out extra points if it‚Äôs something new so they can really get lost in the experience. I also agree I don‚Äôt want to hear patronizing little statements like ‚Äúit‚Äôll be ok‚Äù, I know that what I need is distraction from wallowing
4	Due to our extroverted nature, I think it would be good for her to go out! After my breakup, I went and did things I hadn‚Äôt done before like clubbing. Might help her! 
1	Distractions I usually use distractions.
5	How do you go about liking someone romantically?	Hello, ENTJ here \n\nQuestion: how do you go about in developing a romantic interest in someone? \n\nDetails: \nFor example, I analyze people constantly, subconsciously and consciously. Within the first meeting(s), I can determine what this person can mean to me and if I go towards a romantic path, I can determine if it can work longer term or not. Basically, from the start, I decide if I like this person romantically. \n\nAs an ESTJ, Do you take time to develop feelings for someone? If so, about how long? And what is your thought process behind it? Do you choose or feel that you like this person? \n\n\nThanks! 
13	Fucking it up. That‚Äôs how I go about it:)
5	It took me 8 months to realise I liked someone, the feelings kind of crept up on me. \n\nThen I assess everything. Do we have common interests? Do we have common values? Can I see myself being with them forever? As well as generally how they interact with people and what kind of ‚Äòvibe‚Äô I get.\n\nIf I can‚Äôt see myself with the person in the future, then I won‚Äôt do anything about it.
2	I am an ESTJ and my approach is the same as yours. I know it when I like someone in 1-2 meetings or not. I don‚Äôt take time to develop feelings for someone. Once I figure out I like someone, I plan how I‚Äôll go about asking them out on a date or something
1	I mean same as you I can analyze people very quickly and know where they‚Äôre at on their life path which is usually wins behind me so that goes no where. I think it depends what you want out of a relationship really. I‚Äôve been forcing myself out of my routine to meet people lately because I‚Äôm looking to change my lifestyle. I‚Äôve got one guy right now that after date one I can tell you just needs a female friend to boost his confidence but it‚Äôs probably not going anywhere long term. And I‚Äôve got another that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gonna be purely carnal with.
4	What does an ESTJ actually want?	I ask, "Hey, where do you want to go eat lunch?". They give me a blank stare.\n\nI say, "I want to go eat lunch outside." and they might ask, "Why do you want to each lunch outside?"\n\nOnce I explain it's because of the breeze and sunlight, they'll almost immediately be like, "All right, let's go."\n\nIt's like this for everything. Whenever I ask them what they want, they don't seem to have a clue. Once I tell them what *I* want, they go along with it. What do they really want? Do they actually know? If so, why won't they tell me directly?
16	ESTJ wants simplicity.
7	In my case about the blank stare, I am thinking about what have I eaten before, are certain more places better to diet) suggest for you to enjoy, do I want a drink, is it kid friendly, is it expensive, and is that ok?\nWith the picnic, that is more work, why do you want to make more work. You had a good reason for a picnic so go for it. 
6	ESTJ wants the best.
5	ESTJ wants to stay home.
5	It is characteristic to this type to not know what they want (inferior Fi). They like to serve others.
5	Too many people have told me I'm bossy, so in an effort to not be bossy, I try my best to let others make these decisions.
3	That could mean he does not care where to eat (it is too irrelevant to the quality of his life/day).\nOnce he has a preference (for example at a certain day he craves pizza, he would answer lets go for a pizza).
2	Well, being sensors, they understand your want for the breeze and sunlight, and so they agree as they too would probably like it.
2	Because they have zero anticipation for the future so act like everything in their lives is already perfect. Lol
1	Sometimes I say that but not often, and sometimes I‚Äôll just go with it. So yeah. Sometimes it‚Äôs a group decision. Sometimes the issue is not thought of as important but more than not I have an opinion. Especially where to eat haha!
6	ESTJ husband hates our INFJ daughters ENFP boyfriend	Im married to my husband since 28 years. Our only daughter is 18 (soon 19). She didn‚Äôt started to date until recently as she is very introverted and pretty shy. My husband and I both agreed that we would have allowed her to date far earlier, but she never had any interest in dating. My daughter is great and I am really proud of her. She is not only very smart and conscientious but also really sweet and nice to everyone. I just sometimes wish she would be less shy. \n\nFour months ago our daughter started to date a guy whom I will call Noah. He is really kind and caring and also very understanding of her insecurities. He is exactly what she needs. He is very extroverted and a bit careless but in my opinion he is good for her and totally unthreatening as he has clearly a good heart. Noah is very polite towards my husband and me. And I think he really wants us to like him. \n\nMy daughter is clearly in love with him and he loves her as much as she loves him. They are really cute together.\n\nBut my husband hates Noah. In theory he is comfortable with her dating, but in practice he just doesn‚Äôt wants her to date at all. He is really mean to Noah and basically bullies him. He also often jokes that he could hurt/kill Noah. Noah stays respectful, but its clear that Noah is not too sad when my husband is away.\n\nOur daughter is really offended by my husbands behaviour. She thinks that he should trust her more. And I feel that my husbands behaviour pushes her away from us. (Noahs Parents are both really nice to her.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My husband bullies our daughters nice and caring boyfriend.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Oh dear! This sounds like a frustrating situation for all people involved. Hopefully I can provide some insight, as my mom is an ESTJ and I am an INFJ. It seems that the issue involves loss of control. Your husband is used to being the predominant male figure in your daughter‚Äôs life, so the thought of your daughter placing her trust into another male might be daunting to him. This might be the root of his unreasonable contempt for what you describe as a kind and caring boyfriend. I know that my mom perceives most young people as irresponsible and is highly critical of the people my sister and I have dated. She truly believes she knows best when it comes to dating, even if her assessment of our partners isn‚Äôt actually correct. I think it would be worth having a conversation with him. Let him know that you understand that letting your daughter date someone for the first time might seem like letting go and losing control, but your daughter must be granted a certain degree of autonomy as she grows older. Explain that while her boyfriend is young and lacks the maturity that will come with age, he is still a caring person and has brought out the best in your daughter. Perhaps you should let him know that his comments make her boyfriend feel unwelcome and might alienate your daughter. Although I don‚Äôt know the perfect solution, I empathize with your situation and wish you the best. 
1	ESTJ mom here. Adore my daughter‚Äôs ENFP fianc√©. He brings a whole other dynamic to the family. Just have to get used to a more flighty way of living. 
1	Have you tried explaining why it is both practical and efficient for him to show politeness and respect to the boyfriend?  Analyze it as if all players were robots, and certain inputs (death threats) will have certain results (need to choose between dad and boyfriend).  When I have had ESTJ relationship problems I word it like that and stress the efficiency of cooperation.  Also, since he's a guy, if you can make it seem like his idea it'll always go over better.  I love my ESTJ's but sometimes they need to remember that going around feelings is more efficient in the long run than going through them.  Going through feelings of family members means you'll have to deal with tears and emotions later and it's SUCH a pain.
1	Have you asked him why he doesn‚Äôt like the boyfriend? Is it a personality clash? Is there something he doesn‚Äôt like about the boyfriend?

5	ESTJ under powerful spell of narcissistic but charismatic ENFJ?	INFP here. Can someone explain what's going on? I have a friend who's an ESTJ, who's friends with an obvious narcissist. The N can act friendly and personable, but his real personality is nothing like that. If you slightly get on his bad side, he'll turn other people against you. He openly threatens to destroy people's reputation. Uses moral language to manipulate people and bolster his image, bullies the weak, etc. The ESTJ knows all of that and I've talked to him about it, and he agrees with me...then he goes right back to associating with him. Obviously it's his business, I'm just trying to understand why this is happening. I know my friend isn't shitty himself, he's genuinely well-intentioned so for now I'm assuming he doesn't actually believe that the ENFJ is a complete asshat due to weakness in the presence of Fe and Ni. 
3	ESTJ with a close n-ish friend. We have a great relationship, we stay in our lanes. As for other people, well, I don‚Äôt know how they manage him, but it‚Äôs not my problem. 
4	I like being with outcasts and weirdos a bunch of the time. I'm also pretty good with barriers and think troublesome people need friends too. That said, I don't think that I've ever been friends with a narcissist and I wouldn't be surprised if this stayed as a distant friendship.
2	Loyalty.
2	ENFJ's are very manipulative and clever with it.  Narcissists are very manipulative and clever about it.  That combo is dangerous, and can suck unsuspecting people in like a vortex.  Good luck to your friend, and to you, because he likely won't come out until he has gotten hurt by it.
1	I knew and ENFJ like that. He wanted to be a double of malcom x and called himself blinky x haha! I never like the guy. If nothing bad happens leave it, not sure how you can persuade him to stop liking him, hopefully if the enfj does something realy bad he will see it.
4	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright!
2	ESTJ generally prefer any practical covering for their genitalia and other gonads as long as it is lightweight, durable, reasonably priced, and manufactered with chocolate.
1	You probably should change 'commando' to 'none'. Usually surveys should have no idioms to be as foolproof as possible.\n\nAlso I would abstract the choices to 'sexy', 'comfortable', 'traditional', etc. Some of the choices seem rather redundant ('Bikini' and 'G-String'). 
2	Whatsapp Group for Extroverts	Hi Everyone, it's a very active group and it's super fun! Everyone is hilarious and very friendly. It's equal number Thinkers and Feelers but mostly females so it would be nice to have some variety!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS:  If you're unable to add yourself (Apple users?), PM me your number and I will add you :)\n\n\-----\n\nPPS: Of course Introverts are welcome to join too! (But keep in mind majority are extroverts)
1	Sure, I will join.  Then I will spawn and there will be 2 of me.  We shall cycle and when the time comes we will hear the irresistable calls again and soon, we shall become 4, then 8, then 45, then 173, ad. Nauseum?  We're going to get you, my pretties, and your little dog too!!! *cackles in glee*
1	Er. Okay sounds interesting. Don‚Äôt know if I have time for it though.
24	Wow I'm an infp and I came here to see how the opposite personality thinks, and whattya know this page is just infps trying to figure out estjs	
9	The acronym and metrics are opposites.\n\n|Metric \\ Type|ENFJ|INFP|ESTJ|ISTP|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Introvert / Extrovert|Extrovert|Introvert|Extrovert|Introvert|\n|Intuition / Sense|Intuition|Intuition|Sense|Sense|\n|Feel / Think|Feel|Feel|Think|Think|\n|Judge / Perceive|Judge|Perceive|Judge|Perceive|\n\nFunctions are not.\n\n|Function \\ Type|ENFJ|INFP|ESTJ|ISTP|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Hero|Fi|Fe|Te|Ti|\n|Parent (Aux)|Ne|Ni|Si|Se|\n|Child|Si|Se|Ne|Ni|\n|Inferior|Te|Ti|Fi|Fe|\n|\----|\----|\----|\----|\----|\n|Nemesis|Fe|Fi|Ti|Te|\n|Critic|Ni|Ne|Se|Si|\n|Trickster|Se|Si|Ni|Ne|\n|Demon|Ti|Te|Fe|Fi|\n\nIt's the functions that dictate behavior, among other things.\n\n~~INFP is functionally opposite of ENFJ.~~\n\n~~ESTJ is functionally opposite of ISTP.~~\n\nDepends on which "axis".
6	Nope.  This is sacred territory.  You need to learn more respect for your shadow!
4	Not *just* INFPs here trying to figure that out...
1	Ha ha...and ENFPs too! Us NF types are trying to analyse everyone. Tend to WAY over think things..
1	Lmao that‚Äôs exactly why I came here, I‚Äôm an INFP who is curious about who the ESTJ‚Äôs are
1	Oh my god, I'm so glad I'm not the only INFP trying to figure out these uncanny valley types.
1	There are a few of us lone rangers roaming around haha!
2	Supposed ESTJ took humanmetrics test and came out ENFP	Hi, I have a male friend (33) who was on an acid trip. I have always assumed him to be estj because of how hard he works, and how he barks at me but even though I have a sensitive nature, I have always felt he was trustworthy and does not mean any malicious intent. Anyway I have convinced him to take the human metrics test while he was on an acid trip and it came out enfp. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, is there a possibility that he felt and thought differently when he took the test cause of his trip? I had assumed mbti was failsafe even if you were a little bit stoned. I would've expected istj or estp to come out, but definitely he is far from enfp. I am infp and no way in hell the guy is enfp.\n\nThanks!
2	Wow. Enfp here with an ESTJ gf... This would be an interesting experiment üòÇ
1	Yeah, when you are on substances your personality isn‚Äôt accurate. So we usually tell people do not try to be typed when on something.
13	How do ESTJs show love?	I'm an INFP (How I show love is self explanatory).\n\nMy best friend is an ESTJ. I'm just curious of how y'all usually show love. 
12	My ESTJ provides for me materially. Small gifts, food, etc. She's covered my costs for random things, expecting nothing in return. Bigger things too, like plane tickets for a trip together. She doesn't make more than me, and I have money (most of the time!). It took a while for me to realize the extent, and that it was a way she showed her love. 
9	ESTJ here. \n\nActs of service. (i.e. Taking care of dreaded tasks so you don't have to.)  Monetary generosity. Quality time.\n\nOf the "5 Love Languages", physical touch and words of affirmation are my least preferred.
8	Physical touch, acts of service, quality time.\n\nNot so much verbal shit
5	Acts of service
2	I feel like I show it a lot of ways that I honesty didn't even realize till I saw this post and thought about it... I am not nearly as patient or forgiving with others as I am with my husband. I'll explain things or keep my cool wayyy better and longer with him than anybody because I care for him more than anybody,,, \n\nI like to provide and take care of him, maybe it will be saying I'll go the g very store so you don't have to or you should go play your game while I clean up from dinner... I like to make things special for him or be the sanctuary for him in those ways... sex is one area I'm like that big time. I believe that's part of loving someone, I also try to be very clear and honest with him because I feel a life partner deserves your best in those ways.
1	For me, I show some I appreciate them by praise and by showing interest in their lives. 
1	Service, if that person is needy things, and sometimes even tough love especially in the disabled communities.
4	Does unusual shit freak you out?	I could spend an entire day watching Dark 5 videos on Youtube. Is that the sort of thing you'd want shared with you? Asking for the sake of my ESTJ.
2	No response required. It's not like you're watching ISIS execution videos or anything. \n\n\n
1	Don't read too much into your personality type. It doesn't really mean much.
1	It does freak them out
3	Do ESTJs ever notice INFPs in public?	If so, what is their impression of them?
14	I always think, huh, I wonder how miserable I'd make them after a few months... 
5	How does someone notice a stranger's myers briggs type?
5	I notice them all the time. I don't say anything because I figure that they don't know anything about Socionics. Flirting or talking is usually very easy with them. The girls are usually very cute.
7	ESTJ Gf likes to assert power over me	Girlfriend who got results as an ESTJ, but sometimes I feel like she is an ESFJ.\n\nAnyways, while dating her, she has this common saying where she says:\n\n"I have so much power over you(my feelings, my actions), I like it."\n\n1)Are ESTJs girls normally like this?\n\n2) Is this unhealthy for me?/ Is this tolerable action? \n\nIn addition, throughout this relationship, I've never really set boundaries with her and she is clingy. \n\n3) What is an effective method to keep my stand and set my boundaries as I need to focus on my life?\n\nI wouldn't say this relationship has been the most healthiest relationships. Need an outsider's opinion. Thanks\n\nEdit: Not talking about submissivness is bed but in terms of my emotions. She enjoys being able to control my emotions.
9	    "I have so much power over you(my feelings, my actions), I like it."\n\nThat's super duper fucked up and unhealthy. If she's serious when she says that and that's legitimately what she's saying, you need to get out of there, that's a *huge* red flag if I've ever seen one. It's not normal in any sense of the word, she sounds like she's emotionally abusive. It's very common for the power dynamics to be a bit out of whack in  abusive relationships/relationships which may become abusive. Do you think it's possible to get out of there?
3	Hi, I‚Äôm ESTJ and sexually Dominant - that is to say that I absolutely get off on power exchange. There‚Äôs a possibility that your gf is like me and hasn‚Äôt quite figured it out yet. That happens and is, frankly, not your problem. \n\nSo, here‚Äôs the deal. Crystal clear boundaries and consent are where it‚Äôs at. It is absolutely not healthy for you gf to wield power over you for sexual kicks if you are not fully informed and completely okay with that, it is abuse (abuse does not have to be physical, it can be verbal, emotional, social, fiscal) and if you‚Äôre wondering out loud ‚Äúis this really okay?‚Äù the odds are good that it‚Äôs not. \n\n1) Nah, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an ESTJ thing and as a kink we‚Äôre fairly unusual. I mean, she might just be an asshole. Assholes are ubiquitous. \n\n2) Consent should be continuous, informed and enthusiastic. If you‚Äôre not all ‚ÄúFUCK YEAH SIT ON MY FACE AND MAKE ME YOUR GOOD BOY‚Äù the answer is probably no. Sometimes, we respond to fear and hurt with confusion - because it‚Äôs easier for us to process, and when you‚Äôre in survival mode, that can be the safest  option. It‚Äôs also very common for people in situations that are in violation of their consent to ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù and mentally remove themselves from the situation. \n\n3) ESTJs respect directness, so be forthright with her. If you think it‚Äôs true that she does have too much power over you, then tell her - and tell her that you‚Äôre not down with it. Make time for yourself and your friends, go do what you like doing. Have fun. A healthy response to that is ‚Äúsure thing, babe! Have fun and I‚Äôll see you next time‚Äù. Unhealthy responses include ‚Äúoh sure, fine, go be with your friends and try not to cheat on me‚Äù/‚ÄúIf you spend time with your friends I‚Äôll hurt myself or someone else‚Äù/ ‚Äúyou‚Äôre overreacting‚Äù etc.  \n\nAs an aside, again because you‚Äôve asked a really basic question, I suspect you are very uncomfortable asking for space - which is another sign that you‚Äôre in a toxic relationship. In healthy relationships, it‚Äôs always okay to ask for space and you‚Äôll always get it - no questions asked. \n
1	dude...RUN
1	"She is clingy" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRun away.
1	psycho.  Run.
-6	ESTJs are definitely like that. Being alpha & domineering to the point of being manipulative assholes. But as I have said in the past we need assholes like these in our societies. We mostly got rid of them nowadays then a real asshole like Trump showed up and no one knew how to handle him. It got so bad the system sent over reeling granny Billary to teach him manners and we all saw what happened. This is what society gets when it lacks balance.
2	im trying to understand extroverted thinking?	as an infp i have inferor te.so i want to better myself by tapping into it so i can be more focused on my goals.....anyways what is extroverted thinking from a te dom like yourselfs.is te dropping away personal feelings and emotions to get the jov done?,is it getting to the outcome as fast as possible,is it,accomplishing goals,is it logical or more seeing the best steps to accomplish a goa......how would you describe te as a te dom?
3	The easiest part to explain is that it's about understanding what other people are thinking. For LSEs, this means that I am constantly processing what other people say for proper grammar, coherent logic, ambiguity, and potential jokes. If they break one of those rules, I probably need to have them clarify.\n\nIn contrast, I often need to talk to someone else to figure out what I think about something. Without that, I don't know what things I know are important enough to talk about and they mix together.
3	Te is, at its most basic, making decisions on the currently available data. The background of reddit is either white or some dark gray, doesn't matter how I or anyone feels about it or whether it needs changing. It is very result oriented almost always asking "does this fulfill its desired goal?". In this way they can manipulate rules and such, but they are really averse to breaking them outright. "I want x and y will get me to x ; I use y ; as long as its legal" would be the way of thinking for Te types.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt least that's what Socionics told me. :) 
3	Strengthening your Fi? INFP here!	Hello! I‚Äôm curious, what are some Fi problems that you folks have sometimes? Lately I want to strengthen my Te, so I‚Äôm curious, is there anyone out there who would want to talk about your Te and my Fi? I think we could learn a lot from each other! It would be especially cool if this turned into having an accountability parter for our Fi & Te goals! 
3	I'm an ENTJ so my relevant functions in this conversation are the same.  I find myself best able to access my deeper functions when my mind is "quiet".  It's almost as if each function has a voice of its own.  I can hear my Fi when I have all others shut up.
3	How do you experience and use Si-Fi interaction in your daily lives?	
11	I've always had the ability to remember very small details about someone, it's usually unintentionally. So I've always used it in a way to show others I care. \n\nI think Most ESTJs would agree that they show they care by doing, more than any other love language, so an ESTJ is going to remember your favorite drink/food and your birthday, or a favorite activity, and they are going to use that in a way that shows others they care. \n\nI also really like tradition, and not for dumb shit like religion or politics, but more for little things. \n\nEvery year for xmas my family does the same dinner and then I purchase a game for the whole family to play for that night. It started with my mom doing it for all the kids but one year she stopped buying games and that was always my favorite thing so I brought it back. The rest of the family enjoys it, my mom just didn't realize how much I loved it and wanted to keep doing it. \n\nI personally like creating little traditions for a lot of things. My roommate and I started doing Karaoke every Thursday night. I also had a tradition with an old roommate where we would make homemade french fries and watch netflix at least once a week. \n\nThose little things are always my absolute favorite and it has more to do with the other person than actually liking french fries or karaoke.  My day could be shitty but I always have something to look forward too.  \n\nI order the same drinks at the same coffee shops because I like what I drink but I also love seeing the baristas and building relationships with those people. Same with restaurants, ordering the same thing. \n\nI'm someone who knows that every person I interact with on a regular basis is someone worth getting to know. I'm not just networking for my own advantage, I'm doing it because I like people and if I'm going to want to use you as a recommendation or a way to get a promotion or something else, I want it to feel authentic. So I listen. I listen and I watch. And I pick up on your habits, and when you mention a like or a dislike, I'm going to remember it. I want to make sure I have people to reach out to if I need help, but I also will always help others when they need it. Networking isn't just about making sure I have people, but also making sure these are people I can go to to help others. \n\nHonestly, the simplest way you could describe Si Fi in my life is that I am a very intentional person. I'm not a random person, 99% of the time there is a reason behind what I am doing. The little details in an ESTJs life, are actually big details, it's just not as obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
7	MBTI and Wholeheartedness	Hi Everyone,\n\nThis survey is entirely anonymous. Please answer as honestly as possible, even if you don't like your answers.\n\n[CLICK HERE FOR SURVEY](https://goo.gl/forms/jbXVEyrSwhedbK3C3)\n\nI'm really interested in Brene Brown's work on shame, vulnerability and wholeheartedness. I've noticed that, while MBTI focuses on highlighting our strengths, the discussions in many MBTI communities seem to focus on the struggle to overcome flaws or struggles with vulnerability. It seems that we're all drawn here to tinker around inside our behaviors, understand something important about ourselves, or understand the way we interact with the world. I'm wondering (informally, this is just for fun) if there's a pattern to MBTI personality types, and ease of wholeheartedness/living with courage.\n\nSo, I made this quick survey. Enjoy!(?)\n\nBonus Question: What socially or emotionally vulnerable experience has done the most to define your identity?
23	Thanks for being awesome!	Hi guys, I just want to say that ESTJs are amazing. You definitely don‚Äôt get enough credit for being the caring, principled, consistent, and loyal type you are. And yes, this is gushy but I don‚Äôt care. Just want to show appreciation.
4	They don't get the credit 'cause they are stubborn about their point of view.\n\nAlso they show lack of emotions when it comes to things like discussing things and details.\n\nOthers easily get mad for these reasons and they feel like the ExTJ does not deserve the credit even when they are truly awesome.
1	ESTJs are incredible!!!
1	Agreed.  I love my ESTJ friends.  The efficiency and refusal to get caught up in stupid emotions is beautiful.
4	A sub for relationship advice specific to MBTI!	
2	Maybe the mods can sticky this for a bit so we get some users over there!
5	How to remove yourself from an unhealthy estj?	So, I‚Äôm an infp and I‚Äôve been pretty close friends with an estj for almost 10 years now. She used to be so much fun when we were younger, as long as I didn‚Äôt bring up any topic that wasn‚Äôt purely fluffy/surfacey.  But of course, you can‚Äôt continue that way in a friendship for 10 years. She‚Äôs never been willing to listen to anyone with values or feelings different from her own. Her extreme unwillingness to listen and need to be right and in charge has lead to some really rough treatment of... a lot of people, including myself. She‚Äôs grown some in the past year, but she‚Äôs still very very mean to me. She thinks that she‚Äôs a very nice person. She always says that she‚Äôs a good problem solver in arguments and that she‚Äôs kind, but she‚Äôs neither of those things because of her stubbornness and need for power/being right. I also have finally accepted the fact that she does and says things to tear me down and hurt me on purpose. The relationship has honestly been toxic for years now, but I‚Äôve just been too afraid to end the friendship. I really don‚Äôt even know how to go about it. But I honestly just can‚Äôt stand it anymore and for the sake of my mental health, I just really need her out of my life. As stated above, she won‚Äôt listen to anything. So there‚Äôs no point in more attempts at gentle/civil conversation about how she‚Äôs hurting me. Please help me. I‚Äôm tired of being her doormat. \n\nAlso, I just want to say that I know that not all estjs are terrible toxic people, so please don‚Äôt take offense to anything I‚Äôve said about her! I‚Äôm aware that she‚Äôs an unhealthy person that‚Äôs just completely unwilling to grow. 
9	Just stop talking to/hanging out with her. Make other plans with or without other friends. You don‚Äôt have to have a formal ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù or anything. Just drift apart. 
3	Or you could pick out three statements to honestly and kindly explain that you do not wish to be friends. You've grown as a person by knowing her, but see that you two are growing apart. Express that you are adamant about your decision and that it's final. \n\nBe kind and firm in ending it. If she ignores your demand, then close off communication.\n\nThis ghosting thing is so childish. Adult this one out and be honest. You'd want the same in any type of relationship. 
2	Yikes. \n\nAlright, eradicate your one on one time. If you do hang out with her, do it as part of a larger group. Stop making plans with her. \n\nBe as boring as possible. No opinions. No thoughts. Don‚Äôt tell her about your life or your plans. If she‚Äôs got nothing to use to pick on you, she‚Äôll get bored and move on. It‚Äôs called grey rock - google it for more information. \n\nUse your introversion to your advantage! She‚Äôs a confrontational person and she wants that confrontation with you. Don‚Äôt do it. Say nothing and walk away. Bonus points will be awarded if you do it while she‚Äôs mid-sentence. If there‚Äôs no escape to be had - wield the mighty power of the awkward silence, don‚Äôt respond, don‚Äôt say anything, keep your poker face and embrace the awkwardness. \n\nYou can do it!
1	im infp and you cant do anything about it. Just let it happen. Get busy. 
1	For an ESTJ time is the most precious asset in life. Just tell her you don't have it. She will eventually respect it and you will slowly drift apart if you keep being consistently busy.\nIf not, there's another way to use time to solve your problem, although you're a "feeler" so it might make you a bit anxious. The easiest was to get rid of an ESTJ by using time is to waste theirs. Make plans with them and be late. Cancel last minute. And the worse thing ever? Don't show up, don't pick up your phone, call them two hours later with apology and tell them you simply forgot. That would make her fall out with you instantly 
4	What Are Some Good Affrimations To Use?	*I posted this in r/INTP too if anyone asks. ESTJs have practical views so I ask here as well.*\n\nI saw one affrimation that went like this:\n\n"I always have the power to choose to let go of any emotion."\n\nAnd I'm like "lul I already do dat bruh".\n\nAnyone here have their one positive or rational sayings that help direct your mindset and mentality? Logic is objective but thoughts are subjective so I'm working to make them, at least, more rational and as objective as possible.
6	This might sound more negative, but hear me out. My soothing affirmation is: I‚Äôm a fuck up and I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.  \n\nI feel like it takes the pressure off, reminds me that I don‚Äôt have to get everything right all the time. It allows me to focus on doing my best in the context of being a fallible human instead of constantly kicking myself for not being better. I don‚Äôt have to do everything perfectly; I can just do things and it will be what it is.\n\nAnd it reminds me that I don‚Äôt actually know all the answers, so I don‚Äôt have to be a raging bossy pants. Plus it‚Äôs kinda dark, so it makes me laugh.
3	I like to remind myself that no one is really actually paying attention (I mean, not really) and that helps me to relax a bit and not get obsessive about being the absolute best at everything. 
2	My affirmation is ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù
9	Is it normal for ESTJs to have a lot of double standards?	Examples: \n-Hates being interrupted but will interrupt you to get his/her point across\n-Insists that you answer his/her questions directly (eg., Yes/No) without explaining yourself to give context. But if you ask him/her a question, the answer you get will have lots of explanation.\n-Tells you that you can't always have everything your own way if you make one suggestion/recommendation. Expects you to follow his/her exact blueprint his/her own way. If you stray from it at all, you're being "selfish" and "think your way is the only way."\n\nIs this typical ESTJ behavior or is something else going on here?
7	Even if it is frequent with ESTJ, it doesn't mean it should be tolerated as behaviors.\n\n
2	To answer if it is a typical ESTJ thing, I would say maybe.\n\nThe function stack is TE, SI, NE, FI.\n\nTo start with , their focus is not on being open to others ideas. It can be if they develop NE when growing older, but it is not their natural focus. TE and FI form an axis so unconsciously their main motivation is themselves and how they feel. Their main tool to achieve it is a function that is good at making their own way work. They grab information from the external world to make their own system work. They are not very interested in what goes on within you (or within other people feelings and thoughts). SI makes them a bit nostalgic sometimes (sometimes they idealize the past). SI-NE is the other axis and NE (intuition extroverted) is where you can get some curiosity from them. Mixed with SI, if they remember something positive about you, they will start listening more and being more open to you.\n\nI guess ESTJ is not the easiest type to deal with sometimes. But each person is different and full of nuances.
7	ESTJ Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
1	You know, this guy is the first to educate me about the 4 sides of the mind, i always understood the concept of ego and shadow, but subconscious and superego? It makes sense if you consider the potential for maturing the weaker functions, you would behave like you inverted your function stack if you focused on using them.
10	Fellow ESTJ's, do you believe the main goal in life is to have as much experiences and pleasure as possible?	I tested ESTJ on every test I could find online. I was wondering if hedonism is a common trait among us. The only thing I care about in life is making lots of money and having as much pleasure as possible, eating the best tasting foods, owning luxury cars and new homes, experiencing new sports and activities, going to as many countries in the world as possible, spending everyday happy..etc.\n\nI'm also extremely materialistic, I don't care much about having a family or having family values or contributing to society at all, I just want to live life for myself and doing everything so I have zero regrets when I die, that's all
4	My main goal in life is to take care of my tribe. 
3	Interesting. I'm not sure if these are necessarily traits of a typical ESTJ. What you're describing reminds me a bit of an enneagram 7, actually. Do you feel like you can relate to any aspect of the description below?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As an ESTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.  \n>  \n>ESTJs live in a world of facts and concrete needs. They live in the present, with their eye constantly scanning their personal environment to make sure that everything is running smoothly and systematically. They honor traditions and laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs. They expect the same of others, and have no patience or understanding of individuals who do not value these systems. They value competence and efficiency, and like to see quick results for their efforts.  \n>  \n>ESTJs are take-charge people. They have such a clear vision of the way that things should be, that they naturally step into leadership roles. They are self-confident and aggressive. They are extremely talented at devising systems and plans for action, and at being able to see what steps need to be taken to complete a specific task. They can sometimes be very demanding and critical, because they have such strongly held beliefs, and are likely to express themselves without reserve if they feel someone isn't meeting their standards. But at least their expressions can be taken at face-value, because the ESTJ is extremely straight-forward and honest.  \n>  \n>The ESTJ is usually a model citizen, and pillar of the community. He or she takes their commitments seriously, and follows their own standards of "good citizenship" to the letter. ESTJ enjoys interacting with people, and likes to have fun. ESTJs can be very boisterous and fun at social events, especially activities which are focused on the family, community, or work.  \n>  \n>The ESTJ needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to become overly detail-oriented. Since they put a lot of weight in their own beliefs, it's important that they remember to value other people's input and opinions. If they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with fulfilling other's needs for intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people's feelings by applying logic and reason to situations which demand more emotional sensitivity.  \n>  \n>When bogged down by stress, an ESTJ often feels isolated from others. They feel as if they are misunderstood and undervalued, and that their efforts are taken for granted. Although normally the ESTJ is very verbal and doesn't have any problem expressing themself, when under stress they have a hard time putting their feelings into words and communicating them to others.  \n>  \n>ESTJs value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to do all that they can to enhance and promote these goals. They will mow the lawn, vote, join the PTA, attend home owners association meetings, and generally do anything that they can to promote personal and social security.  \n>  \n>The ESTJ puts forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do. They will do everything that they think should be done in their job, marriage, and community with a good amount of energy. He or she is conscientious, practical, realistic, and dependable. While the ESTJ will dutifully do everything that is important to work towards a particular cause or goal, they might not naturally see or value the importance of goals which are outside of their practical scope. However, if the ESTJ is able to see the relevance of such goals to practical concerns, you can bet that they'll put every effort into understanding them and incorporating them into their quest for clarity and security.

3	I tend to prefer optimizing a chosen experience - quality over quantity. I try to find the best way to do A thing rather than trying all the things. \n\nIf anything, I probably need more hedonism in my life. My idea of a regret is a mistake made out of impulsivity rather than missing out on something because I‚Äôve made a ‚Äòsafer‚Äô choice.\n\nBut I have no idea how typical that might be.
3	Possibly look into ESTP and ESFP profiles too. Not that ESTJs can't be hedonistic. I just hear about them being workaholics just as often if not more.
2	Absolutely not. However I am religious so that may have something to do with it. 
5	ENTP and ESTJ sexual tension?	Sister in law is estj f and I am ENTP m and am trying to understand the funk between us that‚Äôs been going on for over 13 years.  She‚Äôs very judgmental and controlling, she‚Äôs into Utah Mormon social norms and culture and I‚Äôm from Portland and very artistic and intellectual and confusing to social norm types and am uncontrollable.  I find myself just as confused by her, confused by her sexuality and subtleties....so....do any of you have any ENTP connections?  Wtf??!
9	Tell her that her arguments are bullshit, she's not seeing the bigger picture, and she improperly formatted the structure of her everything. She'll freak out, and the problems will be magically resolved.
8	My wife is estj and I'm entp. I think it all started because I didn't understand her and took it as a challenge. Still working on it! :D\n\nShe says she likes me because I'm sexy. 
3	Hey y'all o/	I've seen a lot of the folks talk about music and MBTI and its quite tough to type Musicians as such.\n\nYou ESTJs fill me with hatred and admiration for your dogged persistence. I type Steve Vai as an ESTJ,  He is possibly one of the most talented guitarists there is. \n\nMetallica's James Hetfield, ESTJ again ! \n\nI would love to discover new artists of your type. I definitely think each type is drawn to its own Musicians. \n\nSo I invite y'all to come over to  -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- Post your favorite tunes. I find ESTJs particularly drawn to old school melodies or metal. \n\n
1	I think Steve Vai is technically great, but he kinda sucks in the way that his music doesn't mean anything to me. I think he fakes emotion too much. Like, his music isn't even that emotional, yet he overacts on stage as if it is. Lol.\n\nI prefer anything by Slash over Vai. 
1	ESTJ son with ENFJ mom	I‚Äôm wondering if any of you ESTJs had an ENFJ mom. What are the particular challenges, issues and characteristics of this combination? Any tips? Thanks.
3	[deleted]
3	When an ENFJ thinks they know what's best for you if you choose otherwise they will be very hurt by it. \n\nDo not let them manipulate you into doing something you don't want to do. \n\nI had 2 ENFJ mentors so not necessarily parents, but still older and important to me. \n\nI hate how ENFJ act like they know what's best for others because if you take a look at their own lives, they usually don't have a lot that could even back them up. The two that I know one was a druggie and severely messed up until she got pregnant, that somehow changed her and she made sure her daughter had the best life possible. She is a good mom but has been divorced twice now.  I love her but I don't really think she makes the most logical decisions. \n\nI remember when her daughter who is also a really good friend of mine (INFP) and her weren't on speaking terms and she saw her daughter as bratty and misbehaving and closed off and she was really upset about the whole thing. And because I'm best friends with the INFP I knew what had happened.  One of the mom's friends saw a photo quote on facebook about "being a good daughter to your mom" or some other bullshit and she tagged her in it. So it made the INFP feel like her mom was talking a bunch of shit about her behind her back. When the mom and I had been talking I had mentioned that and she was livid. She knew exactly who had sent the photo and couldn't believe they would do that. So she ended up standing up for her daughter and deleting that friend of Facebook, which was good, but it took her a while to understand that there might be a bigger issue. They have big hearts and care for their loved ones, but INFPs aren't as confrontational and for as empathetic as they are, they can really struggle to take a step back and understand that there's a lot more to most situations than they think.  \n\nThe other one also almost got divorced until God saved her...\nShe was extremely manipulative though and would pressure my mom into doing things and used God as the reason why. When her and my mom stopped being friends she cut me off without even giving me a reason. I've been abandoned in the past and it hurt me a lot. She never really apologized for it or understand how much damage she did to me. \n\nNobody is perfect, but ENFJs could really take a step back before they decide to judge others. And that's really the only complaint I have with them. They love people and helping people and working with others, but they struggle to walk the talk.  \n\n\n

1	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	 I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in r/mbti (unless r/estj would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ESTJs.\n\nThe ESTJ survey link: \n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRRFN36](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRRFN36) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are not an ESTJ please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Thanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in r/mbti once the survey is completed. 
5	INFP dating ESTJ; relationship trouble?	I‚Äôm an INFP dating my boyfriend of 7 years who is an ESTJ.  We‚Äôve been together since we were 17/18 years old so we‚Äôve really grown together. But now that we‚Äôre older, I‚Äôve realized how different we really are and it‚Äôs making me worried if we are truly compatible and capable of having a future together.\nThe other day we had an argument because I told him I believed that kindness is everything and the world would be a better place if everyone just learned to be kind to one another. He disagreed and said he‚Äôs not obligated to be kind to everyone (strangers, people not in his ‚Äúcircle‚Äù).\nAlso throughout our whole relationship he has struggled with being able to comfort me when I cry or have a panic attack. He will usually just say and do nothing or he will get mad and say I‚Äôm overreacting.\nIt‚Äôs hard for him to show emotion (I‚Äôve noticed his whole family is like that as well). I‚Äôve noticed he actually tries to avoid anything that could possibly make him ‚Äúfeel‚Äù anything. For example, he refuses to talk about death, tragic events, even our relationship when i try to tell him when I‚Äôm unhappy, etc.\nIt‚Äôs tough because we are literally complete opposites. Any insight? Any way of helping me understand his way of thinking/feeling? I really want to make this work.
18	I definitely don't agree that Kindness is what this world needs more of. I believe in being respectful, but kindness seems a little much. \n\nAlso, ESTJs imo are better than any other type at taking care of their people. They see it as their duty and will work overtime just to make sure their loved ones have a roof over their heads and food on their plate. So they might not have that same heart for strangers, but that isn't always a bad thing. I personally believe in taking care of my people before strangers. \n\nInstead of looking at what your ESTJ hasn't been able to do for you, take a step back and try to see what he's done. \n\nESTJs love through actions. Taking care of basic needs, doing what's practical. They might not be the most romantic, but that doesn't mean they don't care. \n\nAlso, not wanting to talk about death or tragedy is more likely because we ARE sensitive to those kinds of things and don't want to talk about it because it's actually uncomfortable and something we aren't really interested in. \n\nMy mom and dad are INFP and ESTJ and have been married for 30 years and have a rock solid marriage. My mom has shared a lot with me about what it's been like for them. I personally think their differences complement each other. Because I have had friends who seemed to be dating people who were too similar and they seemed to have unexciting relationships that end because there is no gain from being with someone who adds nothing new. \n\nMy dad does appreciate my mom's feels and emotions but doesn't always agree with them. But my mom will stand behind what she feels 100% and that's why my dad loves her. ESTJs don't like people who crumble under pressure or change their minds because we don't agree with you. I like that you're so passionate about what you believe in that you're willing to fight about it. Sometimes ESTJs disagree not because we actually disagree but we wanna see how much you actually care and how much of a fight you're willing to put up. Half of the political arguments I have are simply because I wanna see if you actually know what the hell you're talking about. I wanna see you push back. I do it because I feel like I am surrounded by a bunch of people who only believe what they believe because that's what everyone else believes. And it's pathetic.  \n\nI bet you anything, you're ESTJ loves you for who you are. He might think your kindness argument was dumb, but he knows how big your heart is. \n\nYou aren't going to get that emotional gushiness from an ESTJ, but I'm willing to bet, you actually don't want it as much as you think you do. I think the stuff you want from your ESTJ boyfriend are actually things a girlfriend would be better with dealing with. Do you have girlfriends you can share that stuff with? Is there a reason you want it from him? Do you want it from him because you can't get it from anyone else? \n\n
10	It's not doomed because of your personality types, if that's what you think.\n\nI'm an INFP and I've been struggling silently with similar concerns regarding an ESTJ in my life, who's my good friend but we'd be in a relationship if it weren't for specific circumstances preventing it right now. But I have a message to any INFP going through this...your greatest strength is looking inwards. We are extremely emotional and idealistic people, and it's very rare to find anyone who can understand us, which feeds our sense of loneliness. In reality, the reason we are continually disappointed in relationships is because we hold unrealistic expectations for our partners. What we need, we already have within us and no amount of external search can alleviate our longing to be understood. When you are at peace with yourself, your thoughts, feelings, and opinions...then you can love someone for who they are and not who you want them to be. And once you can love someone for who they are, you are completely free. You hold no expectations. You are able to love people unconditionally. It's a wonderful gift. So, you have a dedicated partner of 7 years but you disagree on certain things, and he's bad at providing emotional support. None of that is truly terrible unless you *choose* to see it that way. I say, cherish your differences. He wouldn't be him otherwise.
3	Lol you two dorks are just made for each other. You keep going on with all the security theater and him cringingly going along the whole nine yards like nope nope nope! Its like trying to give my two dogs a bath. One likes the water so much it won't stop playing with the damn toilet and the other one has already run off locked itself in its carrying cage.\n\nOne question though is there like a significant height difference between you two? Because I've heard and theorized a bit that INFP are probably kind of short and youthful looking. Which reminds me of this funny video I saw online this tall fellow buys his gal a little happy meal. She rages so hard beating him with an ice cream cone. And there ain't no dodging an ice cream cone that mess gets everywhere. Maybe you two should stick to going out for coffee and avoid the ice cream... \^\_\^
5	Are you materialist, shallow, bossy, controlling, rude, manipulative, stric, lack of respect/regard for others...?! Am I blind in love?	\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nHe said he is ESTJ but I don't know him well. we are dating for about one week. He said I was his crush for 6 months! My ESTJ is very caring about me and his family but to others... A bit Less than I expect. He loves me, I love him And I see the low potential to be the harsh person that people saying about ESTJs . Are you change during long-term relationships? What's your opinion about volunteering in critical fields? Since you guys are T do u prefer F or T-girl for relationships? Because I have a great feeling about him but I'm not comfortable to reveal entire my love for him. 
8	\> My ESTJ is very caring about me and his family but to others... A bit Less than I expect.\n\nINTJ here. Just thought to drop by and comment on this particular aspect:\n\nESTJs either men or women are natural born leaders. And you'd better get used to it because you are going to stumble upon this aspect of theirs A.L.O.T.\n\nI'm saying this based on the way you phrase his lack of empathy for anyone outside his "team" and/or his "territory".\n\nESTJs might be bullies indeed but believe it or not I've come to the realisation that this is not necessarily bad. In the words of Chris Rock:\n\n"We need bullies. This is how Trump came to power. We got rid of bullies ... Then a REAL bully showed up AND NOBODY KNEW HOW TO HANDLE HIM!"\n\nESTJs have the ability to be the bullies you like in situations such as the above. They are survivors that are tough AF - you have to give them that. They know how to get their hands dirty and come off clean while staying on top of things in the end too.\n\nIf I were you I would promptly state all of the above to that guy, recognise him for what he is and appreciate his psyche with all its pros and cons, hoping he's going to turn on the light side of the force.\n\nJust my 2c.
7	Like what the other INTJ said here, ESTJs are the worst when it comes them evaluating your work. That's as bad as it gets. As long as you protect the structure they create and what they value, you can pretty much do anything else and it won't get on their nerves.\n\nPersonally, I find ESTJs to be pretty sensitive and want acceptance, especially from people on their "team". That's why they're so nice to their team and so able to be harsh on everyone else. They get their support from where they need it or where they can get it so they don't need it in other situations. These other situations tend to be the ones they have to be tough in and what they consider to be productive (Te-dom), like work. It's pretty cute.
4	As an ESTJ I personally think most of those are stereotypes. I can't speak for all, but I'm genuinely nice, caring person and value personal relationships a lot more than I do being successful.\n\nHowever, when it cost to empathy I do lack in that department. It's not that I don't care, I just don't know how to express it and when it comes to being honest or sparing someones feelings I'm more likely to he honest and straightforward with that person.
4	ESTJ are assholes with hearts of stone. Also they say really mean things and they don't give a shit about your feelings. Actually to them your feelings don't even exist and should never be considered. But they care about their own feelings and want you to care about their feelings. ESTJ are quasi-psychopaths. And they don't like people in their family to spend any money or time on their own hobbies and interests or having any fun. To them it's just a waste of time and money and they don't care about your mental health. Basically they are shitty people you should stay away from. And yes they are bullies. They can never admit they did anything wrong or were wrong about anything. And they don't give a shit about the quality of their work. They just want to get things done quickly, with the minimum effort. You can't get any emotional nurturing from an ESTJ, just as you can't squeeze blood from a stone. Like EVERRRRRRR. You can know an ESTJ your whole life and they will never give you one tiny drop of  nurturing and kindness. If all you want is someone who works hard and takes care of responsibilities but is a mentally abusive asshole that will make you depressed and miserable, then choose ESTJ. And the same goes for ISTJ's. They are the two worst & most hated types as parents. They  will be mean, cold, and abusive to your future children. And they will also deny toys, games, and hobby supplies and basically anything fun to their kids. Another thing I hate about ESTJ's is that they are ignorant people who think they are always right. They think they are right about everything without ever having done the slightest bit of research. They frequently have the wrong idea about something and then they are stubborn jackasses about it and you can't change their mind. This is because (1) stupid people don't like to learn, and (2) stupid people think they know a lot more than they actually do. They're too stupid to realize that they lack knowledge about something. Extroverted Sensors are the 4 most stupid & ignorant personality types. ESTJ's only learn the absolute bare minimum that they need to do their job and get through life. ESTJ's are a constant pain in the ass. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Really? Let‚Äôs say I have a friend that sick but won‚Äôt see a doctor even though they cannot recover from this illness. I will start out nice and suggest going, then it will go to dark foreshadowing of how much worse it will become, then if they‚Äôre far away it will become guilt tripping about how poor everyone will be without them, then it becomes straight up I will come over and straight up drag you to a doctor kicking and screaming.  
7	ESTJs, how do you react to *being controlled*?	Could be a nitpicky coworker, an overly critical partner...how do you typically respond? Has anyone ever "outcontrolled" you?\n\nLet's you think their concerns are legitimate, they're just being a little too over-the-top, even for your tastes.
8	Ignore. Deflect. I usually just go ‚Äúok‚Äù and don‚Äôt do what they want. However, my partner is really good about not being too nitpicky. He‚Äôs really the only one that I would submit to 
5	There is a difference between being given direction, and being controlled. If it‚Äôs genuine and I understand why it needs to be done I have no problem being told what to do. I‚Äôll even go above and beyond if I can think of ways to improve it. On the other hand, if it‚Äôs power tripping bull shit with no purpose I will either openly disagree or agree and find ways to get out of doing it/improve it so it‚Äôs worth my time. \n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being stubborn. Just realistic. 
2	I had a job once and had someone who wasn‚Äôt a manager but had extra duties and would go on massive power trips. \n\nShe started micromanaging me to extremes. Get on me for things while practically ignoring it when others did it. Would follow me around constantly asking me what I was doing and then say I should be doing something else. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt sleeping and every thought of working with her  made me sick. \n\nI also got her in trouble before it got worse for texting others behind my back and encouraging others to boss me around. No one had that kind of authority over me. \n\nIt was at a Starbucks in a Target and I basically pointed out to them that they made drinks wrong. I was trained in a real Starbucks. They were making huge mistakes and I just pointed it out. They didn‚Äôt like that. That‚Äôs what led her to micromanaging me. \n\nI fought back a little bit. Sometimes I would just walk off the floor since she made me feel like I was in the way. And honestly I just worked as hard as I could. \n\nI didn‚Äôt really do anything though and it just led up to me quitting. When my boss went on vacation I miraculously got an approved LOA for the same time. I knew it would be hell on earth with her there as the manager when he was gone. \n\nI don‚Äôt really care about being controlled. As long as I‚Äôm still given freedom. When my freedom is taken away that‚Äôs when I realize I need to either find a new job or find a way to fight back. \n\nUnrelated to work. I do NOT respond well to being controlled in relationships. \n\nWhen I was 18 my parents said I had to go to a certain school and do what they wanted or they would take my car keys and stop paying for me. I handed everything over. It lasted less than 24 hours before my dad (ESTJ) changed his mind. The more you try to control me the harder I push back. \n\nI just don‚Äôt like the thought of others making decisions for me. Let me fuck up on my own. Let me just learn on my own without you trying to decide what is best for me. \n\nEven if you are right I still just wanna do it on my own. \n\n
1	I‚Äôve never been ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù
1	Not well. My stubborn side kicks in. Sometimes, I get snarky.
1	If I get the sense that my spouse is trying to "control" me (this could just be having a really strong opinion on what they think I should do about something - my spouse doesn't ACTUALLY control me), I immediately want to do what I want to do even more than before. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it's at work, depending on the person's hierarchy in the company, I react in different ways. Above me: I'll do as I'm told and do it even better than they were asking. My equal (or possibly below me): fuck off. I'll take the time to hear them out but if I ultimately end up disagreeing then I'm doing what I want. 
3	Who are some ESTJ YouTubers, if there are any?	
3	An estj and a youtuber is kinda contradictory. Too unpredictable for a career don‚Äôt you think?Aren‚Äôt they all in business schools or some shit? Or even if they aren‚Äôt they are probably busy doing chores around their or someone else‚Äôs house
1	Haven't gotten all the way into it yet, but I've been dabbling here and there. Mostly streaming. But planning to ramp up some when I move out in a few weeks.

9	Is it typical to have zero empathy for strangers?	The only people I care about if they get hurt is my immediate family, aside from that my emotions don't sway along with my friends or strangers. I felt nothing when my friend got dumped, I feel nothing when hearing tragedies on news ..etc
8	I think this is probably fairly typical for the ESTJ. In socionics, both Feeling/Ethical functions are weak in the ESTJ, and I think a case can be made that empathy (as well as sympathy) primarily stems from these functions.\n\nInterestingly, however, there seem to be slight differences between the two two kinds of "empathy", namely the type that stems from Fi as opposed to the type that stems from Fe.\n\nFe's brand of empathy is closer to what people often call "sympathy". It is a very direct and visceral "mirroring" of another person's experiences in the self. When you witness another person's suffering, you experience a sort of "shadow" of it yourself. A variant of the same phenomenon is when a person starts experiencing a visceral discomfort because the collective mood in the immediate surroundings is tense or sour. For the ESTJ, Fe is the role function and therefore rather weak. This suggests that while the average ESTJ can sense and respond to other's emotions in this way, it is going to require conscious effort and is likely to be rather draining. In socionics, Fe is also one of the ESTJs unvalued functions, so the average ESTJ might often not be inclined to bother, because the collective mood might seem like a pointless triviality to them. An exception is when a new acquintance is made, and it is typical that a strong conscious effort is made toward displaying aptitude in one's role function, which happens to be Fe for the ESTJ.\n\nFi's brand of empathy is more concerned with abstract phenomena like the human condition and suffering in and of itself. Fi empathy is closer to what the Dalai Lama talks about when he speaks about "unconditional love". It has a tendency to be directed toward whoever suffers the *most*, irrespective of how *visible* their suffering is. Because of this, it kind of has its own built-in sense of justice. Fi can empathize with a person or other creature they have never even met, simply by hearing about something horrible said person or animal was subjected to. Being Fi-dominant, I know from personal experience that this response can be every bit as strong and visceral in a Fi-dom as the Fe-dom's direct empathic response to *seeing* suffering.\n\nHere's where it gets particularly interesting for the ESTJ, though: according to socionics, Fi is an extremely weak *but extremely highly valued* function for the ESTJ. This implies that the average ESTJ has virtually no intrinsic negative emotional response to seeing or hearing about injustice, but the*y value justic*e *itself* as a moral ideal as well as people who *do* demonstrate this emotional attenuation towards it, like the INFP, the ESTJs "dual" in socionics.\n\nIn summary, I would argue that your experience in this may be fairly typical for the ESTJ. What seems more important to me, though, is that, in the case of Fi-brand empathy, this is a deficit that the average ESTJ may be keenly aware of and not entirely comfortable with, which is supported by the fact that you asked this question to begin with. In short, while you may not feel like a very empathetic person, if you did not *value* empathy, this would probably not have bothered you enough to ask if it is normal. And I personally think valuing Fi is every bit as important, if not more so, than actually demonstrating aptitude in it, because the valuing of functions is what allows them to spread and flourish on a collective, cultural level.
8	Some people were having a roadside memorial. I was irritated that they would put on such a distracting display at a busy intersection that literally just killed someone, increasing the chances of another accident. \n\nSo yeah, I‚Äôm not good at empathizing with strangers. 
5	AFAIK this is normal. I feel ‚Äúsorry‚Äù for people when bad things happen but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm real torn up inside or anything 
4	I‚Äôm a ESTJ and I feel the same way.
1	That's weird, I heard ESTJs are supportive in friendship and relationships. U have the same feelings for your gf or your wife? 
1	Am I the only empathetic ESTJ alive? I'm not a psychopath, of course I feel empathy for strangers. I guess it just depends on what it is? 
1	Is it typical to confuse empathy for sympathy?
0	I'm an INFP and I'm rarely emotionally invested in strangers but I know their suffering is wrong and unjust

We have active general chats, channels for psychology, philosophy, typology (of course), feels channels, and much more! More importantly, we have a diverse and inclusive community, no matter how many members we have. (more than 1500 :p.) We also are newly focusing on spirituality, and would love to have your input! \nMeet us at: https://discord.gg/UkJ4yYD
5	I love my ESTJ brother.(a lot)	but he doesn't love me back. We hit off in the form of episodes. Every once and a while we turn into luis and clark, but most of the time he's just yelln' at me. Like, it's the typical sibling rivalry, but one sided. \n\n\* Attempt to hug \*\n\n"stop it."\n\n"Why are you soooooo mean"?\n\n"shut up. That's gay stop it. STOP IT."
6	Hugging your brother is not gay, unless you‚Äôre hugging his penis. I‚Äôm assuming that you‚Äôre not hugging his penis in this instance, so the conclusion here is that he‚Äôs just not a cuddly person. \n\nAnd that‚Äôs totally cool, but you‚Äôve got to meet him where he is on this. There are loads of ways to show him that you love him without hugging. 
5	He loves you. 
5	I‚Äôm ESTJ and I‚Äôm not physically affectionate with my brother I‚Äôm female if that makes any difference. My favorite thing is when we hang out and talk and lately that‚Äôs when we run around town playing Pok√©mon Go. 
14	ESTJs and extroverts	As an ESTJ most of my close relationships are with introverts, other than my previous relationship that was with an extrovert I've never just been to fond of other extroverts. It's not that I don't like them, but most extraverts tend to push me away and turn me off (not in a sexual way).\n\n I'm curious if this is just an individual trait that I have developed because I primarily hangout with introverts, or if other ESTJs feel the same way.
11	I‚Äôve only dated introverts, so I suppose that I share that preference. When I‚Äôm with another extrovert, there‚Äôs a constant building of energy, like every topic is met with ‚Äòyes, and...‚Äô so it‚Äôs just more more more, revving each other up until one person cracks. Which can be fun, but also exhausting. With introverts, things feel steadier, and I can make a bunch of noise or just be chill. There‚Äôs more room to breathe. 
7	Yeah I like Introverts a lot. Dating an INTJ and adore him. Also really good friends with INFPs and they are some of my favorites. \n\nI put my energy into work. So I don‚Äôt want my friends to be huge into parties and bars and stuff like that. It‚Äôs fun on occasion but not every weekend\n I like coming home and doing nothing or just chilling. And I like one on one interactions A LOT more than groups. Which is why I prefer to date introverts. 
5	Hm that‚Äôs a good observation. I suppose you‚Äôre right. I do have a couple very good friends that are extroverts. But I think two ESTJs especially would butt heads. And ESTJs typically like to be leaders, so perhaps with introverts they feel more in charge or the outward leader/speaker of the group. And other extroverts could be seen as competition or something. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm explaining that well. 
2	I wonder how EJs tend to feel about other EJs
2	I generally get along well with other extroverts but less so with ENFPs in particular. Everyone else is pretty much equal, provided they're not a caricature of their type.
1	Estj metal musicians	Anyone know of any estj metal/rock/punk musicians?
4	Would you rather see your child grow up smart or kind?	
28	If you‚Äôre smart enough you‚Äôll be kind. Smart and rude people aren‚Äôt truly smart. 
7	Smart.
9	Kind. Being a good person can sometimes bring you more opportunities.
2	So what this question is implying is that if my kid is kind they‚Äôll be stupid or if my kid is smart they‚Äôll be an asshole. And I have to pick one or the other. And if I pick kind I‚Äôm more inclined to test as a feeler and if I pick smart I‚Äôll be a thinker. \n\nThis is why 16 personalities is the worst test, which is where this question came from. And why most people think mbti is a joke. \n\n
2	Smart, although a trade off between the two traits can potentially yield disturbing extremes. Smart + totally unkind can yield an intelligent sociopath; a kind + totally not smart person will likely fall for a lot of scams, etc. Then, you'd have smart + neutral in kindness, and kind + average intelligence... hmm. Maybe kind but of average intelligence isn't so bad, but being smart and just not an asshole isn't really bad, either.
1	Smart. If s/he‚Äôs kind the world would take advantage of him/her. If s/he is smart s/he will take advantage of the world.
8	The ESTJ / INTJ social chemistry	INTJ here. Just wanted to ask your opinion about a pattern I've noticed:\n\n\- My father is ESTJ. The man which he holds in the highest esteem -among everyone he's ever known- is an INTJ colleague of his. He used to talk to me all the time, about the conversations they where having and the opinions he has formed through them. In one way or the other I guess he unconsciously did everything he could to shape me, his son, in his friend's image.\n\n\- Some of my best friends are ESTJs. I get the same kind of vibes from them.\n\nI've noticed that ESTJs open up to me so naturally even though for some of them I'm barely an acquaintance. I guess they see something in me that I don't quite readily grasp. Is this common? What's the deal here?
6	Because ESTJs are naturally compelled by the thought of an INTJ's approval. Well, that's basically what a Relation of Supervision boils down to.\n\nYour dominant Ni is their blindspot. You're both making decisions in the same way (Te), but the knowledge you are accessing to make that decision, the ESTJ is unable to access. It could be the powerful foresight associated with Ni. It ends up looking like the INTJ has the upper hand.\n\n
6	I‚Äôm currently with an INTJ and have pretty much loved every one I‚Äôve ever met. \n\nEvery one I‚Äôve met has been brilliant in my opinion and none of them give themselves enough credit. \n\nI had a lab partner who was one too and I always wanted his opinions on things because he could explain things to me without making me feel like an idiot. And he would do it in a way that made me even more interested in the topic. I don‚Äôt like talking to people about politics or social issues because it always gets out of hand but with an intj I can ask questions without them making assumptions about me. I like playing devils advocate and getting as much info but some people automatically jump on you when you want to understand something from both sides. \n\nI‚Äôm not asking because I disagree with you I‚Äôm asking to better understand. And when you assume it just shuts me down and makes me less likely to wanna ever open up again. \n\nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so attracted to INTJs. \n\nOn my first date with my INTJ I opened up quite a bit. We had some of the best conversations. And I was able to open up about something that is a pretty big secret to most people and not something I wanna share on a first date. To me INTJs are very open minded and not as judge mental as others are. \n\n
4	INTJ  Here, popping in to see how you all think and respond.\n\nSince you asked a question about  ESTJ / INTJ Social Chemistry, I could not resist answering this question and I wanted to weigh in with my two cents. \n\nMy husband of 38 years is an ESTJ.\n\nI still think he may be the smartest man, that I have met.\n\nI was smart enough to recognize his/your fascinating  qualities and hang on for the ride.\n\nWhat a ride!  You guys may be d\*\*k's sometimes but geez, I could not have chosen better and had a more intellectually stimulating ride.\n\nMy answer to your question is a bit simple.\n\n In my experience, when an ESTJ notices someone with talent or smarts, an ESTJ will seek to utilize him or her. \n\n They,  or in my case, my husband will recognize that talent, treat the person as an equal and expect that person to be on the exact same page as the ESTJ is.\n\nThey will not nurture talent because why, and that is not a question.\n\n They  don't need someone to nurture them,  and why should you. Again, not a question.\n\nIn other words, an ESTJ can be funny and smart and a big time A\*,  who is very very bossy.\n\nThe moral of my story is to be flattered if ESTJ 's are drawn to you. They recognize you and include you.
3	As an ESTJ, One of my old best friends is an INTJ. He's very good at brainstorming and having abstract thoughts. He knows I tend to be self-centered at times, but we both respected each other. While I was more authoritative and rigid, he was more relaxed and had a big imagination. Granted he was suffering through depression and I cared about him deeply. Love INTJ's because they are good at planning just as much as I do.

Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
5	convincing an ESTJ	How do we convince an ESTJ of 100% trusting you? I am an ENTP and need to convince an ESTJ business owner that I am right and am the right person for the subject. But I am always full of ideas and all over the place and I certainly don't follow many rules. I'm afraid that the way I am make him hesitant. There are also a lot of nuances in what I have to present and it could play against me that nothing is black or white.\n\nedit : I posted this in r/mbti also.
15	Deeds. Not words. \n\nMeet your deadlines. Show that you are organised and efficient. Honour your commitments. Own your fuckups. 
3	I tend to only believe what I see. So if I see you acting shady or being unclear I will not trust you. I already dont really trust anyone but if they burn me, that's it. I feel we all show who and what we are. So my thing is, show me. Once you've shown me, ok now I see. Estjs can be judgy but are also as fair as they can be usually. Just be real and then the realness will show. They are already skeptical so dont give a reason to be and you'll be fine. 
7	How do I (INFP) improve my relationship with an ESTJ? He sucks with emotional stuff & his blunt directness is often rude & offensive. I've told him this & he doesn't care because he thinks it's a good quality & I should change to be more like him. How do I improve my relationship with him?	I'm INFP, he's ESTP/J. Leaning more towards ESTJ, but he could be either one. As you can tell, we're basically polar opposites. I'm super conflict avoidant, he's extremely confrontational and loves picking fights with people. He genuinely enjoys pushing people's buttons and trying to get under their skin. To him, he says what he feels and views it as "telling it like it is." He views this blunt directness as a positive trait, and to him people who aren't like this need to change. Problem is, he genuinely doesn't care if what he says is hurtful, and it often is. Yesterday he thought it was funny to say "wouldn't it be funny if I could give you an eating disorder" then spent the rest of the day calling me fat. I'm actually super thin and not remotely fat. He doesn't know this, but I've actually had some issues with disordered eating. That's just one in a million examples of him being super mean & confrontational. I'm sure I'm on the more sensitive side, but in the majority of these conflicts it's just him starting crap for no reason. He seems to want me to change my personality to be "less weird" and more like him, but why can't he just accept me for how I am? INFPs normally feel like weird outsiders anyway, but combined with an ESTJ/P who frequently says I'm weird, I'm really feeling frustrated and hurt.\n\nI never pick fights with anyone, I always try to diffuse these conflicts ASAP. I'm sure my fellow INFPs are the same way. I've told him I hate when he starts fights & intentionally starts drama/conflicts, but to him he thinks it's funny and genuinely gets a sadistic kick out of it. He's said I'm super quiet (I am) and the only way to get me to talk to him is if he picks fights & tries to get me riled up. Idk why tf he thinks this, cuz I'm happy to talk if he's nice. But a lot of the time I just want to be left alone, and we don't even have any common interests to talk about. We literally have nothing in common, and our personalities are polar opposites. I really do want a good relationship with him, but he makes it so difficult even though I've told him countless times that I'm always happy to talk to him as long as he's nice and doesn't start fights or deliberately tries to be mean/annoy me. \n\nHow do I (an INFP) improve my relationship with him (ESTJ/P)?
12	Wow, there's a lot to unpack here.\n\nFirst off, just because ESTJs look at things from a logical perspective, doesn't mean that we're assholes about it. Frankly, it sounds like he's an asshole. Especially if you've talked with him about it before, he should really be able to see the errors in his ways if he really cares about you.\n\nI'll admit, there was a time in my life when I was a lot like that. I enjoyed challenging people's beliefs and getting under people's skin. It took a girlfriends breaking up with me over my "exhausting" personality before I realized how intolerable I could be.\n\nSecondly, he wants you to change to be "less weird"? You don't have similar personalities or common interests? He isn't nice to you? These are basic fundamentals of a relationship, and honestly, it sounds like he might be taking advantage of your passive personality. I hate to be so cold, but you might want to seriously consider your future with him. No one who gets a kick out of hurting someone else's feelings, much less their SO, should be in a serious relationship imo.
6	You‚Äôre not ‚Äúweird‚Äù, you‚Äôre not like him and that‚Äôs a good thing. He sounds like such a prick. Why would you want to improve your relationship with this absolute cumstain of a person? \n\nIt is entirely possible to be honest and forthright with grace and tact. Our directness and honesty comes from a place of valuing integrity very highly. It‚Äôs not an excuse to bully or harass - and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on here. \n\nI doubt that he is behaving in the same way to people who are more at ease with calling out his bullshit, he targets you and other less confrontational people because he knows he can get away with it. \n\nYou absolutely do not owe it to this fuckwit to entertain his nonsense. If every interaction with him is a roll of the dice as to whether he‚Äôs going to behave with a modicum of decency and respect, then it‚Äôs not a relationship - it‚Äôs a social mine field. No one has time for that. You have confronted his antics by telling him you‚Äôre happy to chat if he‚Äôs respectful and he‚Äôs repeatedly elected to ignore that. So, fuck it. No need to make any more effort on his behalf. \n\nWe become like our friends, OP. Surround yourself with people who value who you are and who raise you up - not this repellent fuckstick. 
10	Um yeah hi, I would never treat a stranger much less anyone I cared about in the manner you are describing. You cannot improve a relationship by yourself it takes two and it doesn‚Äôt seem he‚Äôs mature enough to care for another person. 
4	He is being emotionally abusive. You are not being too sensitive. You are reacting completely appropriately to someone being mean to you. The "getting a sadistic kick" out of starting fights and finding them funny is a sign of narcissism. Narcissists are not going to change without therapy and most narcissists will never accept that they have a problem - like your partner they think their ways are positive and better than others - so don't count on him going to therapy to be a better person. If anything he'll act as thought *you* are the one with the problem who needs to change: "Stop being so sensitive! I'm just telling it like it is and you need to handle that! Get a thicker skin! You need to be less quiet, then I won't have to treat you like this! It's for your own good!" VOMIT. \n\nIf you have told your partner their behaviour upsets you, and they refuse to change they are making it very clear they don't care about you or your happiness. What do you think is going to happen? You've brought up the issues and he doesn't give a shit about you enough to work on them. He is showing you his true colours and it is a red flag for sure - it's only going to get worse, not better. If he does show kindness this will only be for a while to get you to stay, then the cycle will continue and he will go back to being an asshole. \n\nIn a healthy relationship both partners care about each other's happiness and make an effort to listen to each other and stop any hurtful behaviours and work on unhealthy ones. \n\nIn a healthy relationship your partner will not see you as "weird" and want to change the core of who you are. They will love and appreciate your quirks. \n\nTrust me when I tell you there is someone 100% better for you out there.\n\nThis is *not* an ESTJ thing. I am an ENFP (definitely a bit "weird" myself) and my most recent relationship was with an ESTJ who loved me and admired me exactly as I am and treated me with kindness and respect always. \n\nDUMP THIS FUCKER. You can and will do better. \n\n
3	Being blunt can be a good trait. But he is confusing bluntness with rudeness.

5	ENFP + ESTJ relationship assistance?	Hi, I‚Äôm a ENFP dude, currently pursuing an ESTJ for a romantic relationship. To start off, I know relationships and compatability aren‚Äôt defined by personality types, but they do give a good baseline for how people think and behave. However, I felt it would be really helpful in consulting other ESTJs in how I carry conversations with an ESTJ. Despite having a really good first date where talked for about 4 hours, I find that many times it is difficult to talk to her about more big-picture things and emotions, which is fine. But I‚Äôm  having a hard time finding topics we can easily talk about, and running into roadblocks in conversations... thankfully, I‚Äôm quick enough on my feet to have fun conversations. I‚Äôm curious to what is interesting to talk about and why.\n\nTL;DR: Me ENFP, her ESTJ. What do ESTJ‚Äôs like to talk about? Why?\n\n
10	So happy to find someone else like me! I am an ENFP (25m) and have been dating an ESTJ (20f) for about 6 months now. The internet has so little information on ESTJ-ENFP relationships (actually ESTJ relationships in general).\n\nIm definitely no expert, but here  are a couple of things I've learned:\n\n1 - ENFP's have an amazing talent of saying things in the nicest way possible. Often this means saying something in an indirect way. This is almost perfectly opposite of ESTJ's, who like to bluntly say it how it is and they don't care who they offend. They simply don't understand why you would want to "beat around the bush". When telling your ESTJ how you feel about something, use your Te instead of Fi to say it as directly and openly as possible. Tell her what you actually actually feel instead of how you think she thinks you should feel. This may seem disrespectful to you (at first), but perfectly normal to her.\n\n2 - don't let her (or other people) run over you. ESTJ women get really bothered by men who just let themselves get pushed around. She will try to test you by manipulating you with her natural intimidating nature. She will say things just to be contrary. When you let her run over you and do what she wants (even if you don't really care), she will see that as weakness and won't be able to trust your judgement and leadership where it counts. Along with this, don't let her convince you to do things that don't line up with who you want to be. This will be hard at first because you are tolerant about most things and pushing back at her seems intolerant and offensive, but in reality this will help her be able to trust that you are being honest with her and taking a stand about the things that matter to you. ESTJ's have deep-rooted convictions and don't feel comfortable trusting someone who doesn't stick to their own convictions.\n\n3 - don't act like you agree with something that she says unless you actually do agree. ENFP's have a weakness where they just agree with someone to be nice. ESTJ's pick up on "fakeness" really really fast, and dislike when people don't agree but just say they do to be nice. Also, never lie about any past experience to build rapport with someone.\n\n4 - educate yourself on cognitive types, functional stacks, and the strengths and weaknesses of each type. The "Personality Hacker" podcast is a great way to start. Look especially for the episodes about ENFP types, including \n-ENFP personality advice\n-Ne-Te cognigive loop\n-developing Feeling (Fi) as an auxiliary function\nOne warning - never assume that you know her just because you know her type. Knowing each other's types and functional stacks is helpful in identifying causes of behavioral differences, but won't help you predict exactly how the other person will respond about something. It's really easy to assume that "well, since she's an ESTJ she probably thinks this". Your personalities are so different that you won't be able to identify what she likes and dislikes unless you ask her.
8	I‚Äôm an ESTJ and my best friend is ENFP, we‚Äôre both female, she can drive me nuts because I feel like she lives on another planet sometimes... I would say in your dealings with her, be 100% transparent, be a straight shooter, don‚Äôt be evasive or she will view you as shifty and untrustworthy. You don‚Äôt have to avoid certain topics or anything ...be natural and be yourself just apply the things I mentioned up there and it will be great. Personalities I find don‚Äôt necessarily affect interests...but she will be passionate about things she‚Äôs into and will most likely take them seriously, not lightly. Just be a stand up dude and be honest about everything. Once you lose our trust it can be hard to get it back. 
7	I guess I can give the perspective of an ESTJ who does not pair well with quite a few ENFPs. And I will share what went wrong. \n\nThe first ENFP friend I had was also one of the first real friends I ever had. We met in homeroom in the 6th grade. Right off the bat some of the main problems that started arising was that she was all about groups of people and making sure no one felt left out, but I wasn't. I wanted to only be with friends I liked and felt like she was always just leaving me behind in order to include everyone else. Fast forward to 13 years later and I can honestly say that was one of the biggest issues we dealt with which constantly hurt me.  \n\nENFPs are huge group people always wanting to hang with everyone and make everyone feel special and included. I am literally the exact opposite of that. I don't want to be friends with everyone, I want a select few and I want them to be the most important people to me. \n\nI am a social (networking) butterfly and can connect with just about anyone, but at the end of the day, I have my few friends and they are the ones I want to spend the most time with. And I'd prefer if I wasn't constantly fighting for their time and attention. \n\nI also met another ENFP in high school and we were besties, it was a group of 4 (ENTJ, INTP, and ENFP and then me) I was probably closest to the ENTJ but had a lot of time after school with the ENFP and we were total goofs together. After we graduated and moved on she pretty much did with every ENFP tends to do and just leaves you in the dust. We have the hardest time catching up, and she's always "busy" but is constantly posting pictures on social media with other people (we also live in the same city). And I'm just convinced that if you are apart of an ENFPs life by a class, a club, a job, church.... or something similar, you'll be spending plenty of them with them, but if your lives are different and you have to catch up with them, it's nearly impossible to get with them. \n\nI had an ENFP mentor who I was in a small womens group with her and she was amazing, and again, when I was in the group we always were able to go out to coffee or lunch and hang and she made me feel so special and then I moved and she never responds to me on facebook or anywhere else and it just sucks. \n\nWhy do ENFPs just leave you once you are no longer apart of their social circles? Why can't they simply answer a fucking text or message asking how they are doing? How come if I don't see you regularly I become non-existent? \n\n3 times it's happened to the point where when I meet another ENFP I keep them as far away as possible and don't even bother getting close or personal to them because I know it won't last. \n\nI work with one now and she drives me insane and I know I'm not easy to work with either, but she's 6 years younger than I am so it's a very distant relationship anyways, but I love her creativity and really appreciate working with her.  \n\nI have an INFP best friend who lives 1500 miles away and we talk almost every single day and have for the past 4 years, either facetime, memes or just messaging. She makes a point to keep me in her life, and that's why I have such a problem with ENFPs. I am not holding them to unattainable standards or expecting too much from them. \n\n
5	I am an ENFP female who is totally in love with an ESTJ man.  It's really hard sometimes and fair communication and space is HUGE.  It's really important to try to understand the differences in our personalities.  ESTJs will show love through actions - helping you do things that need to be done.  You need to appreciate that, it is important.  We hit roadblocks because I tend to approach conversations in a way that says you are doing x and it is making me feel y.  This is not a good approach for the enfp / estj pairing.  It is better to say I am feeling this thing and sometimes things you do make me feel this way and I am not blaming you but could you work with me on it.  ENFPs will also struggle believing ESTJs because sometimes they will come off as uncaring because they are direct and relying a lot less on emotion than we are, so when I feel like he should be apologetic about something and he does not believe he did anything wrong - we hit a wall.   However, honest talks that allow both people to honestly evaluate their own roles in the roadblocks are hugely helpful in my experience.  My ESTJ is the best.  It is not easy but no relationship is and we really bring out the best in each other and in good times, admire and appreciate the other person for embodying the things we struggle with.  I also find that when you try to consider the ESTJs actions and let them know how much you appreciate them for the things they do and are good at, they are MUCH more willing to discuss all our crazy theories.  My longest best friend is an ESTJ too and it's crazy how similar the issues and wonders are in those relationships and I do anything I can to nurture the connection with them, I hate the hate ESTJs get - they are awesome people.
1	My husband (ESTJ) and I (ENFP) typically don't talk a ton about deep emotional stuff, I mean, we do when we need to or if one of us is feeling particularly like we need that connection, but we do goof around a lot and have inside jokes. We really don't worry about the lighthearted nature of our  conversations. Ithink it's more of the fact that I can't rely on him completely for my emotional support. I really need a lot of connection from friends and family so I don't overwhelm him.
0	An assessment and missive for the supervisor, by the inferior INFP	Hello Boss.  There are a lot of things about you I can respect.  Your efficiency, your ability to push on that tender area to get people to react and do your will, your absolute adherence to the logical, to the numbered list.  Your passion and your absolute devotion to be the best you surely are.\n\nI have one message to deliver to you, boss, and I know you have the wit to understand.  \n\nBasically, you are obsolete.\n\nYour model has been the sexiest of the sexy, the fit guaranteeing the fittest, the sharpest amongst the pointedly stabbing.\n\nBut you deserve to be informed, that your model has had it's time and is deserving your glorious time off you generally won't consider you deserve.\n\nI am faster than you, I am more efficient than you, I actually have a utilization of logic that isn't self-cannibalizing.  I can lead other men without making them want to deservedly stab me in the throat, I can speak to someone without being patronizing, I do not have time for your sadism or your disregard.  In the same vein you look at a person and can quickly sum up their value and their worth to you, I am saying to you now, there is no use for you in a world that never asked you to teach it a fucking lesson.  The lesson you have to teach is that of cruelty, of disregard, or of lack of even the understanding of what you cannot understand or possibly comprehend due to your configuration.\n\nBasically, it comes down to this.  The next time you decide to flex your superficial power to hurt either myself or my compatriot, it's over.  I'm not only ripping out your jugular, I am taking out that which you love.  I am grabbing your wife by her pussy, and giving your mother a throat transplant.  I will speak the language you understand, you mother fucking masochistic piece of shit, and I will take you to that place you are too much of a fucking pussy to ever venture at any time due to lack of guts or anything resembling endurance, or basic tolerance.  I am your doppelganger and your nemesis, and you have taught me well.  You will scream like an utter bitch in absolute disbelief as I give you that which you have begged from me since my inception, and I will assure you, you will be satisfied with my performance.\n\nHope you have found god, you worthless cocksucking waste of any fucking resource with absolutely any fucking worth whatsoever.\n\nSo take it easy, enjoy the day, spend a few minutes sniffing the rose bush, but know that there is absolutely no animosity here.  You will not suffer, nor will those you love.\n\nIt's time for payback, mother fucker.  Open up and say ah :)  Daddy is coming home.
13	This is a weird sub.\n\nNever knew infps had such hatred inside them. 
10	Oh for goodness sake, grow up. I hope this was cathartic for you because nobody in this sub cares. 
9	Seek professional help. Really, this is bizarre, and I highly doubt that you're exclusively having this reaction due to "ESTJs". Not trying to sound "patronizing", but I hardly think this post deserves a long, eloquent reply detailing a bunch of resources. Hope you get better.
3	Kinda harsh to point directly at ESTJs with this. My bro is an ESTJ while I'm an INFP and he is legit one of the nicest people out there, actually nicer than me.\n\nThere are many assholes out there. Just learn to stand up for yourself  and you will be rewarded in the end. Hierarchies of power never worked and never will, these people will go down soon enough.
4	Whoaaaa... I guess you do become what you hate.

3	Should ESTJ‚Äôs become parents?	Everywhere online i‚Äôm always seeing people complaining about how their ESTJ dad or mom has ruined their life in some way or how they have a terrible relationship with them. As an ESTJ who would like to be a mom one day, reading all this has really made me wonder if I should just not be a mom at all. I would never want to have a child if my type is just generally not made to be a loving parent. Does anyone out there actually have a positive experience with an ESTJ parent or is it hopeless? 
9	Omg do not ever let that stuff make you second guess if you're going to love your kids.\n\nI say take a look at all of it as excellent anecdotal tools to help you prepare for any conflicts in case your children turn out to be really sensitive feelers (NFs). I have an Estj stepfather and lemme tell you, I'd be some spirally dreamy depression biscuit if he didn't bring some semblance of order and discipline into my and my ESTP mother's life üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nThe common thread I see for gripes with ESTJ parents are those who lean HARD on Si and close off any Ne. If you listen, communicate, and compromise with your children where necessary, while still keeping your head level about what boundaries NEED to be asserted, I have great faith in you. 
5	I've actually seen quite a few posts on the main mbti sub where members actually had really good things to say about their parents.  It surprised me too. \n\nMy dad is an ESTJ and the funny thing is, although he was man of the house, he was no where near what people claim ESTJ parents to be. \n\nHe was amazing and is my role model now. He was very involved with our lives, he got us in sports at a younger age and that was something we all stayed with until we graduated high school.  He coached all of us and went to as many games as possible and would even take off work so he didn't miss us. \n\nAs far as being those controlling parents, he wasn't even close to it.  My dad was a strong believer in letting people fuck up and suffer the consequences. Because we all played sports we had a lot going for us and my dad said we could party and drink all we wanted to, but if we got caught and in trouble, that was our own problem.  He wasn't constantly hounding us wanting to know where we were or what we were doing. And all 4 of us stayed the hell away from those crazy parties, and never really did anything horrible. He gave us the freedom to do whatever we wanted, and none of us did. My ESTP brother was the oldest and pushed the most boundaries, but he also had the most to lose and my dad would always remind him of that.  \n\nThe only thing I wish my dad did differently, was to help us out a little bit more financially.  He sorta threw us out into the world and wanted us to learn how to be adults, but quickly learned that it's not the same as when he was younger. He also didn't want to contribute to our educations at all which set us all back further than we wanted. \n\nMy mom is INFP and we had an awful relationship for at least 10 years. We never got along and she always assumed she knew me when in reality she had no clue. It's much better now, but I still have a lot of trust issues. \n\nAs far as my mom and my dad parenting together, my mom was a lot more open to allowing us to try new things and was good at convincing my dad that it was okay. They made sure every Sunday we had a family dinner and did a family vacation once a year but other than that they weren't too involved in our lives. I think they did a really good job. 
3	Also, keep in mind that because of the overlaps between the common ESTJ stereotypes and the actual job of parenting, it‚Äôs hard to know how many people actually have ESTJ parents and who just has parents.  If you think anyone who enforces a rule is an ESTJ and you‚Äôre a kid whose gross experience with rules has been with parents... Not everyone is an expert at typing.\n\nPlus, people rarely go on rants about the things they like, so you hear more negative than positive.\n\nAll parents screw up. It doesn‚Äôt matter what type you are, you‚Äôll mess it up one way or another.
1	My sister is an ESTJ mom and she absolutely loves her son.  She works grueling hours to provide for him.  (Of course she's a boss) hahaha
2	I Need Help Understanding my ESTJ Girlfriend	Hi, I'm a 25M ENFP who is dating a 20F ESTJ. She has been gone for about 4 weeks at a summer training program, and I am planning to drive out to visit her this weekend. \n\nSome background - we are both from a fairly conservative Christan setting, and have individually committed to be celibate until marriage. We have been dating for about 6 months now.\n\nI just got a nice card in the mail today (we snail mail each other on occasion) that just said that she feels nervous that I am coming to visit and she is afraid she won't be a good host for me, in basically so many words. I thought it was very sweet, but I'm a little confused as to what she is trying to accomplish by sending this - obviously it was important enough to her to go to the bother of going to the store, buying a card, and mailing it to me.\n\nWhat are some things that would motivate an ESTJ to go to so much effort just to share something like this?
7	She is explicitly telling you her feelings. That's pretty nice of her. Believe her, don't look for subterfuge. Reassure her that you are sure you'll have a great time because all you care about is seeing her and being with her. Like you said, it was effort for her to do this, reciprocate with some emotions. 
1	The ESTJ does not know how to optimize towards a goal, for not everything is optimizable yet it is the ESTJ's instinct to try to optimize with Te.\n\nThis is really a Fi thing, but Fi often finds an outlet via Te, (they are each other partner after all), but the normal Te outlets will not work for there is nothing to optimize.\n\nThus your girl has to find an outlet in another way and that is sharing her Fi feelings, and she wants you to acknowledge her Fi feelings and for her to feel seen, but at the same time do not rub her nose into it too much for she is feeling vulnerable and nervous.  Instead just hug her and say she is great / grand and then list a reason or two that she cares so much.  Let her know that she is seen both that you see her nervous feelings but you also see her in other things where she is less nervous, all her optimization, but sometimes ESTJs feel no one ever see them and all their caring and i tis this caring that drives them to optimize.
3	Took official test but...	Looking for some help. I dont like asking for help normally but sometimes its needed.\n\nI have taken the actual mbti test and scored ESTJ.

2	Out of those options, it sounds like you could be: ESFP, ESTP, or ENTJ (leaning towards the first two)
3	INFP in need of ESTJs for character study.	If anybody is willing to answer a whole bunch of questions, that'd be awesome! 
7	We are nothing if not reliable subjects.
1	I'll bite!
1	I‚Äòll answer questions!
1	I'm willing to answer questions but not the questions someone with a name like "fuckwad9000" has. 
1	I‚Äôm game for it if you‚Äôre still up to this.
1	I‚Äôm curious to know the results of whatever answers come from this study :) 
4	Wife not interested in sex. What would you do?	ESTJ married for 15 years with the last 10 almost sexless. We have sex once every 6 weeks in the morning. We have 2 children 12 and 10 who are thriving. Therapy many times, wife not interested in sex any longer. Accepted she just doesn‚Äôt like sex and this is who she is. I love my wife and do not want to leave the marriage. I believe in our commitment and we complete each other in all other ways. Made the choice to keep my marriage in tact, outsource the sex. I no longer feel guilty for this as I have been faithful in our marriage and have tried over a decade to fix any issues. \n\nESTJ‚Äôs have any of you experienced this situation? 
7	IMO, there are two reasons a woman's libido goes from average to nil. (I'm a woman.)  \n\n1) Illness. Women's motivation for sex is heavily driven by hormones. Hormonal imbalance is a huge problem and often undiagnosed.  Depression, grief, thyroid, and other health  issues should be examined.  This was my first instinct until I read some of your comments.\n\n2) You've hurt her emotionally.  She no longer wants any foreplay or affection ever. In my experience,  that only happens when I am emotionally hurt or just plain over it. I would suspect that she's not as into your marriage (emotionally) as you think she is.\n\nHave you considered the thought that she may be seeking affection/sex elsewhere too? üôÅ
15	Y'all are fucked up. You should have at least told her that that's where it was going. She should know the options, that's how solving a problem works. By having knowledge. \n\nYou don't seem to understand what 'faithful' means. Nice job convincing yourself you're just 'outsourcing' sex when you're just doing this out of spite and resentment. Congrats for cheating on your wife, your kids are better off with you guys divorcing. You didn't try to solve the problem, you just acted on your selfish feelings.
6	Mostly I wonder what you‚Äôre teaching your kids through this. Are they learning what a healthy marriage looks like? Are they learning what self respect looks like? Is this the kind of marriage you would want them to have? \n\nAlso, your wife sounds depressed, like she‚Äôs given up on herself and her own happiness. Or she‚Äôs stepping out on you too. Would that change how you feel about the situation? Would you be relieved or upset?\n\nPeople are quick to judge, but these situations can be very gray. And I think Si and Fi both have a habit of staying the course long after the turning point.
3	 I'm not a woman, and don't claim to be an expert on women, but I do have a relationship with an ESTJ. Maybe your natural tendencies to do what is functional and efficient are keeping you from actions that make you sexually attractive to her? Some personality types are more likely to need a deeper motive for sexual attraction then ESTJ's naturally provide. Read "the way of the superior man" by David Deida.\n\nAlso, you pretty obviously don't know that it is basically impossible to truly hide the fact that you're cheating from a woman. Even if she has no proof, she will still feel a little bit leery. Women are defonitely not sexually attracted to someone who makes them feel betrayed or unloved.
5	I'd do what you did. Is she aware of the outsourcing?
4	How does she not expect you to go elsewhere for sex? If she isn‚Äôt going to give you it. \n\nShe can‚Äôt be that stupid. \n\nI personally would at least share with her and be like, you either allow me to have sex with other people or we separate/divorce. \n\nSex isn‚Äôt something you just take out of a relationship and expect the other party to be cool with it. \n\nI‚Äôd honesty just end it. I don‚Äôt want someone to stay and have sex because I need it. I want you to at least enjoy it and want it. If you say we either have sex or we get divorced she might just have sex just so she doesn‚Äôt have to end the marriage but that‚Äôs even worse imo. \n\nI‚Äôm female btw. And sexual compatibility is a must. 
2	A few questions.	I have some personal questions specifically for ESTJ.\n\n1. Do you like debating? Why or why not? Do ESTJ dislike this? When maybe or when won‚Äôt you ebate?\n2. What is a Te-ne loop like? Do you know?
3	My gut reaction is no, I don‚Äôt like to debate because it tends to get heated and I don‚Äôt like myself when things get heated. But I also debate constantly, with other people and with myself. I can‚Äôt help it. I think aloud so if I disagree with something, it just happens. Give me a theoretical debate and the answer is definitely yes.\n\nI‚Äôve never been particularly satisfied by descriptions of Te Ne loops. They‚Äôre usually described as being kind of ‚Äòdoing without thinking‚Äô, leaving things incomplete or not taking a moment to factor in things you already know. Alternatively I‚Äôve heard it described as trying to find short cuts, hopping from thing to thing hoping one will be the magic answer when the real answer is to pick a thing and keep at it. \n\nPersonally, I find myself attempting to satisfy Te with Ne, so I‚Äôll brainstorm possibilities and tell myself I‚Äôve made progress on a thing, when really all I‚Äôve done is dick around on the Internet. It probably happens because I know what I need to do but I don‚Äôt want to do it so Ne kicks in to look for alternatives.\n\nI think ESTJ gets shafted a bit on these descriptions because it‚Äôs not one of the popular types and people don‚Äôt bother exploring it very much. 
1	[deleted]
1	1) Debating? No. I like telling people what they're wrong about and moving on.  The great thing about truth is that there is no debate! \n\n2) No I don't know. 
1	1.  I would tend to say that yes, I enjoy debating, but most of the arguments I get into with people are just that.  Arguments and not debating.  I find the biggest difficulty with healthy debating is that, especially in this day and age and especially with my generation, people aren‚Äôt open minded enough to hear other points of view.  Bigotry in certain circles is on the rise.  So while I might mention it offhand I at the very least try to avoid anything political or that might be construed as controversial in the company of people I don‚Äôt know or know aren‚Äôt mature enough/stable enough to handle those ideas/such discussion in a healthy manner.  \n\n2.  I burn out.  When I‚Äôm in the Te-Ne loop I can get somewhat paranoid and haphazard in my methodology.  I know I need to do something but I can‚Äôt force myself to do it so I end up getting sidetracked.  I feel the subconscious need to batten down the hatches and micromanage my environment to ensure success and a reduction in vulnerability, volatility, and lack of control.  Usually I‚Äôm healthy enough to realize when I‚Äôm in this loop but it‚Äôs a shed habit to break.
1	I don't particularly enjoy debates, especially political ones, because I get unnecessarily angry.  I dont believe we ever convince people to change their minds in these scenarios, so I've wasted my energy. I look at it as a boundary issue akin to: "I get my vote. You get yours."\n\nI will, however, debate work-related or personal-related topics at home (more so argue) because I feel like I can and should have influence on those outcomes. \n\nOn the flip side, if someone really comes at me in an aggressive way, I will use my anger to fuel my laser-focused argument and hopeful takedown. I try not to go there though. \n\nTl;dr  I dislike debates, but am generally good at arguing.
1	In my experience with my ESTJ brother, he really hates arguments. He just terns into a cocoon. HUGE headaches, as he tells me. 
1	Could you compare and share the differences between your experience with INFJ and experience with INFP?	Friendships, relationships, etc.
6	INFPs are probably my favorite type. I have 3 best friends and they are all INFPs.  Considering how different we seem to be, somehow they are my perfect match. \n\nThey are also the pairing of my parents (ESTJ & INFP) who have always had a rock solid marriage.  \n\nI get along with INFJs, but don't have a lot of them in my life, met a few on different Reddit communities that I've gotten close to, but don't know many in my life right now.  \n\nI personally don't mind them, but the connection is nowhere as close as it is with INFPs.  I feel like I find INFPs wherever I go, and always make friends with them.  They crack me up and they just get me in a way that makes me feel understood and special.  \n\nI used to work at a coffee shop and there was a girl there who I strongly hated, we never got along and she ended up being one of the main reasons I quit.  She made the environment extremely toxic to a point where it was affecting my life outside of work.  I was always upset and the thought of going to work made me sick.  Apparently, she was an INFJ, I wasn't sure, but that experience has always left me with a negative opinion about them.  \n\nI've met the other INFJs online and never really dealt with them in my life, but the one I did was so negative that whatever type she was, I hope to god I never have to deal with someone like that again. \n\nFor me, I feel like INFPs are weird and quirky but they own it.  I've never come across an INFP that I felt was mistyped or didn't actually embrace it.  That's my favorite part about them.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n
3	I think I get along with INFP better.\n\nI think this friend I had in high school may be INFJ and this guy I know somewhat.\n\nI think INFPs seem for me to be easier to get along with. I suppose as a perceiving type they don‚Äôt mind my dominance and assertiveness. Seem to be a much more easy going friend and we talk a bit less. They are much less decisive and is okay with much more.\n\nI feel like the INFJs I know hang around longer and want a deeper conversation, but is faster on the burn out. More readily to point out that it‚Äôs my fault for things or ask more analytical questions. Hmm. I dunno, both seem fine, just that INFP seem to mesh better with me.
3	I don't know, most of my INFP experiences have been negative while INFJs more positive. \n\nThe INFPs I were friends with were pretty whiny and would give me very long essays about their life and what they think and what philosophy they want to discuss. I sort of found it annoying because I can just feel the angst/whydon'tanyonefeelthiswayorknowthis in these long winded messages that it turns me off and I ignore them sometimes. I understand they are trying to articulate their feelings in a verbose way, but I can't handle it sometimes because tbh I really don't care too much and lack experience talking to their feelings. They are very trustworthy though so I like them. It's just that there's some strange distance between us that I can't really connect it's just there.\n\nThe INFJ I was friends with was very cool and collected. Although quite similar to the INFP, he does get to the point quite quickly and he also helped me emotionally become centered with myself. He was also very chill and we could talk about anything and he was very receptive. It was very fun being with him as it was like he understood me and my own personal space somehow, and he also respected my time talking to him and when we can meet up again and talk about more things etc. Although academically he wasn't the best and dropped out many times, there was something about him that I really liked even though I was frustrated a bit to why he is very lazy and doesn't bother to do well in school that I was concerned for him. However, it's like he knows where he's going so it's cool.

1	Thanks for the resource. It seems interesting and helpful. I appreciate it. It looks good too.
1	ESTJ Telemarketer?	Hello! I am an ESTJ-T that is 53% Extroverted, 47% Introverted. Essentially, an Ambiverted ESTJ. (Not to be confused with an ISTJ. The description and definition of that type doesn't match me)\n\nSo basically, I was just given a job offer by a family friend, who is the owner of a brand new StateFarm branch. I would be doing daily 4 hour shifts as a Telemarketer for the insurance company. Convince them to get a "free quote" and then transfer the number and move on to the next call.\n\nMy question is, has anyone else here with the ESTJ (or ESTJ-T) personality had experience with Telemarketing?\n\nI am wondering if this is a good job for an ESTJ, or not. \n\nI only have 2 concerns.\n\n#1: My ability to "move on" to the next customer. I have noticed in myself that after a conversation, my head gets a little "clouded" with thoughts on the convo, until I allow myself a short time to "gather my thoughts" or "mentally process" the convo or interaction. I can BEST move on, after that point. I figure it would likely take me around 1-2 minutes after each call, unless I trained myself to do better than that.\n\n#2: Another concern is what people think of me. I worry a bit too much on the opinions of other people. If I were to have an extremely negative reaction over the phone, I may likely find it really hard to move on to another call. Especially with confidence/enthusiasm.\n\n\nBesides those 2 things, everything seems fantastic about this offer. It would basically be my first job, and I am nearly 18 years of age. And as I said, the employer (and most of the employees) are friends.\n\n\nThanks so much guys, it means alot to me that you read all that.
3	UPDATE: I got the Job!!!!
1	Honestly I hate talking on the phone and have had some awful jobs where I had to do it. \n\nThe only job I liked talking on the phone was when I was guest services at a gym. If people‚Äôs cards expire or don‚Äôt go through we call them letting them know and have to charge a $10 fee. \n\nMy boss ended up giving me responsibility of it because I did such a good job. I wrote myself a script and just did that. Some people got pissed off but I do surprisingly well with angry people. \n\nBut when we had to call people to ask how their membership was going I flat out refused. And just made a deal that I would do all the phone calls for the cards that didn‚Äôt go through. \n\nI also was an intern for a big company that does a lot of recruiting so I was constantly making calls for that. I hated it. \n\nHandling phones are a toss up for me. Sometimes it‚Äôs great and other times I can‚Äôt wait to hang up. 
1	And, what do you find on it?\n\nI find as an ESTJ Te type that I would be to blunt to be persuasive, my issue with marketing or Pr work. I am too direct and honest.
1	I don't think it's a bad job as an ESTJ in some respects. I worked in my university's call center for all four years making alumni relations/giving calls (basically chatting up alumni and asking for gifts). In some ways it goes with the ESTJ personality because you follow a script, I assume, and it's a very routine after a while. My campus job also had a clear cut structure of moving up, so I became a student manager, which is definitely right up the ESTJ alley. In general I think ESTJs, from what I've read and know about myself, can be fairly adept at separate emotions from the practical/logical knowledge this is a job.

3	A question for ESTJs	I‚Äôm curious on knowing how ESTJs are in relationships. It would be great if some of you mention in the comments the following:\n\n\n1) What do you see in an ideal partner\n\n2) The main reason your past relationships didn‚Äôt work out
9	What I look for in a partner: sense of humor, good at stuff (hobbies, sports, etc), independent (not clingy), active (not sedentary). I like to laugh, I don‚Äôt want to be your mom, and I need someone who can match my athleticism. I‚Äôm bi and these things go fo men and women. \n\nPast relationships: my only serious relationship is the one I‚Äôm currently in; I‚Äôve been happily dating someone for 3 years. A problem that I‚Äôve encountered before this relationship and during is that I expect a lot from people, sometimes impossibly so, without realizing it. Just because *I* can or would do something doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs feasible for someone else, and I struggle with that sometimes. I also have a low tolerance for fucking up and am generally competitive, which can make me seem like a bitch to people I don‚Äôt know very well. 
4	I‚Äôm 26 and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship\n\nI‚Äôm female too. \n\nFor a really long time I just didn‚Äôt feel good enough. And honestly I still feel that way. But I get extremely uncomfortable when other people take care of me so I really want to be successful enough before getting into a serious relationship and I also want a partner who sees me as an equal. Nothing more nothing less. \n\nI also am very confident and straightforward. Which does rub some the wrong way. \n\nHonestly it‚Äôs really hard. I would love a partner now but all the guys I talk to just want me as a friend. \n\nWhen I get rejected and feel alone I put all of my energy into my success. Going to school and being the top student, honor student involved in multiple clubs. being an athlete that competes and working my way up the corporate ladder currently. \n\nI suck at relationships but I‚Äôm good at everything else I do. \n\nI guess my ideal partner is someone who is chill. I don‚Äôt want to be with someone who is more extroverted than I am. I really like inxps. \n\nSomeone who is honest with me. Can say the truth even when it hurts. Someone who knows who they are and makes no apologies for it. Someone who is a hard worker and wants to be successful. Has that drive. \n\nSomeone who is fit and understands the importance of health. I compete in triathlons and would love a partner who also competed in something athletically. Or at least was active. I like tall slim guys or muscular but not too muscular. I hate muscly guys. \n\nAnd someone who doesn‚Äôt wanna live in a small town for the rest of their lives. Because that‚Äôs how I grew up and refuse to be like that. I wanna travel and move and explore this world. \n\n
4	Someone who is competent. They are well educated, and are able to hold a good conversation, and bring up intriguing points. Someone who isn't overly sensitive, that shit doesn't fly with us. \n\nAs for past relationships, they're usually just too sensitive for my liking/attitude, or they are just not high achievers, which is fine, but as a high achiever myself, it's hard to want to be with someone who doesn't want to do better in life.
3	I‚Äôm glad that you get where I‚Äôm coming from, lmao. I think I was half-expecting someone to rant on me about how girls shouldn‚Äôt have to wear makeup and bla bla bla. Ultimately, that wasn‚Äôt why we broke up, but like I said, attraction makes a difference, and it‚Äôs illogical to bring up the fact that we haven‚Äôt had sex for a while, while taking it personally that she doesn‚Äôt want to get dolled up for me. As a guy. I like to think I have a really good fashion-sense. My outfits always match. I cut/color my own hair. I‚Äôm not opposed to wearing a small amount of eyeliner and stuff (I have kind of a Billie-Joe Armstrong look). And I enjoy doing it. Fashion is fun. And to have my girlfriend just dressing kind of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. And yeh, the feminine thing makes sense. I love girls that wear dresses, have gorgeous hair, and take care of themselves. \n\nThanks for the input ^^
3	All the other comments are straight up novels so I‚Äôm gonna keep it short and sweet haha. Btw I‚Äôm a straight girl.\n\n1. Look for someone who is independent, intelligent, funny, and fun. Spontaneous is a plus bc ESTJs like myself struggle doing anything that wasn‚Äôt previously planned haha. Good to get out of the comfort zone sometimes. I also don‚Äôt like guys that are emotional bc I‚Äôm not haha. Ideally i want a guy that will sit there and listen when I finally do open up, but I don‚Äôt want someone who wants to dwell on it or pick my brain about it. I said it, it‚Äôs done, let it go.\n\n2. Last long relationship ended bc my boyfriend was an egotistical asshole who was emotional and unstable. We also had like hardly anything in common. I also don‚Äôt think he was super intelligent, and when you think your SO is inferior brain-wise it‚Äôs hard to respect them unless you‚Äôre Mother Theresa or something. He cried when he was stressed and that made me uncomfortable bc I‚Äôm terrible at comforting people/empathizing with their pain haha.\n\nSry that ended up longer than expected hahah.
2	1. Someone who can lead. Good sense of humor. Mature but can loosen up at times. Somewhat bright, clever. Open minded, chill. Good at communicating, open, loyal, good at taking criticism and learning from it. Someone who loves and respects me the way I am.\n2. INTJ - Nope did not work out. Worked out initially but never realized how very emotional they are about their core beliefs. We have the same hobbies but he would take my advice as some direct form of criticism and think I am cold and unfeeling when I clearly see it as a way to help him improve. INTjs can get very clingy about these core beliefs which they will fight over endlessly unless proven otherwise, and they usually take full offense to anything opposing it. I find INTJs to be somewhat sensitive about certain things such as what their SOs think of them personally even though I'm being honest they will try and steamroll me about the flaws I tell them I can observe. It can work out, but if there are clear guidelines between each other instead of the other person interpreting the other wrongly. I always attract INTJs for some reason like flies to a yellow light and I really do not know why.\n\nISTJ- Worked out definitely. We tend to have the same exact mindset except I'm a bit more aggressive to opportunities than he is. I generally get along with ISTJs pretty well, but i find most of them close minded, passive, and shy which turns me off. The one ISTJ in particular I went in a relationship with was very bright and open minded about a lot of things, but it didn't work out because my parents didn't approve and it was highschool and I wanted to graduate first before getting into a relationship. We both understood each other though very well. \n\nENTP- I really wish it could work out. I love ENTPs and they meet my ideals. It's just that they seem to lose interest in me after a while and find someone else who will provide more feed to their banter which I can't always do which is disappointing. Also it seems like we have some kind of "wall" between each other when we communicate. He is somewhat in his own world while I am in mine, and he can get quite emotional about things and lose control of it quite easily. They are very cute though, I hope one day I can marry an ENTP and we can get along.
3	Ideal? Super fair skin with raven black, or pastel hair. Fit/petite. Highly intelligent. Her jokes are as good as mine (and she can appreciate my humor/pithy puns, haha). She likes to cook, has lots of tattoos, and is good at art. She loves talking about philosophy. Doesn‚Äôt take things too personally, if I suggest she try something different. If we have kids, she‚Äôs a really, really good mom. She‚Äôs super hard working, but also knows how to have fun.\n\nPast relationships? I‚Äôve dated a lot of INFP‚Äôs that were way too sensitive, and couldn‚Äôt handle criticism. They got super reactive during conflict and was hard to reason with them. The ENFJ I dated refused to wear makeup (NOT that that‚Äôs a big deal), but attraction is important, and she resented me for wishing she would make an effort, in general. The INFP‚Äôs were really insecure, and people like that tend to come with a shit load of problems... one was extremely jealous. Yeah... that‚Äôs about it. 
4	Any ESTJs struggle with their INFP parent?	My mom is an INFP and I've recently realized that I basically mothered myself growing up. I look back on my childhood and can't list one thing that she actively taught me about life. More often than not, I remember occurrences of me helping her when something was upsetting to her -or- us (my ESTP brother and I) having to handle something parental  because she was overwhelmed or unequipped. \n\nI think it was really hard on me and am bummed to just now realize this. I struggle to get along with her today, especially when she tries to "mother" me now. (I'm 37.) Anyone with a similar experience?
3	INFP here and I'm sorry this happened to you. The amount of stress someone has to take on when the other person is so in their feelings and unequipped for practical real world things must be hard. It makes me think I probably shouldn't have kids because there wouldn't be anything I could do for them when being so selfish. 
2	I found that to be the case with my dad until I moved out, where he seemed to realize he'd never done that much particularly parental, but after I left we both decided he didn't have to be and we've been much more able to connect since that expectation was lifted. But until then it was a lot like what you're describing.
1	Was she raising you on her own? Many women who end up raising kids alone say that they feel incredibly overwhelmed, as a result their kids don't get enough guidance and attention. You have to take care of yourself, go to work, take care of both kids, and you're not even allowed to fall sick or take any breaks because there's nobody else who would do all of this in your place.\n
4	How do you guys find out what someone else is?	I can't even know for sure I am fully ESTJ cause I might also be an ISTJ but that may also be from lack of self-awareness but I wouldn't even be able to guess what other people are, so how can you know that girl you have a crush on is ENFP or INTJ or whatevs? Not a native english speaker so excuse any mistakes.
6	I usually compare people. If I know my friend is an INFP then it‚Äôs easier to pick out other INFPs. The more I know the easier it is. \n\nI‚Äôm honestly not that good at typing people though. Some are easier than others but even if I know someone really well I still sometimes struggle to figure it out. \n\nI‚Äôve tried guessing and sometimes I‚Äôve been way off. \n\nIt took 4 years to learn I was ESTJ and that‚Äôs because the descriptions of us are just bad.  \n\nWhat I find kinda funny though is that I‚Äôve always known my dad is ESTJ. And I‚Äôve always had a close relationship with him, even being a girl. And my mom has always said we had similar minds. He is the one person whose always understood me. \n\nNow that I‚Äôm older and know I‚Äôm ESTJ I can see how we are exactly the same. And I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt see it before. \n\n\n
2	Introvert vs extrovert is usually pretty easy to see. Either they‚Äôre really energetic, and think out loud, or they‚Äôre more withdrawn and keep to themselves more/are slightly more quiet. Sensory vs intuitive is the hardest one... I find intuitive tend to be more like hippies... sensors tend to be more like businessmen. Thinker vs feeler is harder for me. I tend to generalize most men as thinkers, and most women as feelers, which may be the most prevalent, however, I‚Äôm not as good at picking up on male feelers and female thinkers. Usually, they‚Äôre just more feminine men and masculine women. As per Judgers vs percievers, this is the easiest for me. Percievers are usually kind of chaotic, disorganized, are late a lot etc... and aren‚Äôt good with deadlines. Judgers are very organized, are good at planning, like structure and are pretty tidy, usually. 
1	Does it matter what type they are if you like them? I met a dude online whose written profile was so appealing I decided that I'd expand my MBTI romantic preferences to whatever he ended up testing as. He tested twice as INTJ, a type I was iffy about as a romantic prospect. Now I'd totally give it a chance especially since his goals are 100&#37; in sync with mine. 
5	ESTJ men, how much do you care about your SO's partner count (if at all) ?	
7	Don't care at all. I haven't asked, don't really care to know. Has nothing to do with me or us. We're clean, happy, and sexually fulfilled together. Everything before we got together is a part of the equation that makes us, us. 
4	My SO‚Äôs body count isn‚Äôt very high, but I knew/met two of their exes and they were positively revolting. I couldn‚Äôt believe that they‚Äôd been together, and it was definitely strange. However, they‚Äôve matured as a person and obviously began making better decisions (leading to us dating haha) and everyone has done regrettable things in their youth, so I‚Äôm no judge. We never speak about exes or past hookups because they are irrelevant and were just part of high school/college and growing up. 
2	I had a conversation with my girlfriend about this recently.\n\nEven though I was her first, anytime she mentions guys that she made out with at parties or stuff similar to that, it really gets to me. I brought it up to her, but I really couldn't get to the source of why it bothers me so much. I have a pretty long sexual history compared to her, and we pretty much started dating right after we met, but it really gets under my skin. \n\nI've found if they were in a relationship, I'd rather not hear about it, but it doesn't really stick with me. However, thinking about guys hooking up with her really makes me uncomfortable to think about. \n\nIf someone could offer some insight as to why I feel this way, it'd be appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Just realized I hijacked your thread without really answering the question lol. I guess what I'm getting at is that the amount doesn't really bother me as much as the context of the relationships.
2	Try not to think about it, but it kinda bothers me a bit.
5	The Fair & Just ESTJ Umpire	A Sith Lord is at bat.  He hits a long fly ball in left field towards the fences, but several feet foul.  At the last minute the ball suddenly breaks right and goes over the fence in fair territory.\n\nDoes the ESTJ umpire throw him out of the game for cheating or just let this one slide?
5	ESTJ umpire announces that the Sith team has forfeited the game, because they were already warned for pulling the bats out of the hands of the Jedi players at bat and force-choking the outfielder so they could get a home run earlier in the game. \n\nESTJ umpire also warns Jedi team that their mascot, Jar Jar Binks, is not permitted on the field and must stay on the bus next time. 
5	Any of you date or married to an ENTP guy? How was it? What would be needed to make it work well? Etc...	
5	ESTJ girl here married to ENTP guy. He's the love of my life. He's brilliant, funny, kind, and I love the way his mind works. He keeps me open to life's possibilities, and makes me a much less narrow-minded person than I would otherwise be. His people skills are way better than mine, and he genuinely brings out the best in everyone around him. (I joke that he keeps me open to the possibilities in the world, and I keep him in washed and ironed shirts.) \n\nIt works for us, in part, because we're both older. (It's a second marriage for each of us, and we both admit we'd have killed each other in our twenties.)  Also because we work really hard at appreciating each other and appreciating the differences in our perspectives, and the way we both influenceone another for the better. \n\nTl/dr: it works because we both respect each other and appreciate our differences. \n
3	If it helps, I'm an entp guy dating an estj girl. If you have questions ask away
2	Cool thanks! How did it compare to other types?  What did you like / dislike.  Did you feel like you really understood each other/ clicked? What would be keys to making it work from both sides?  Do you think both sides could stay true to who they are and be happy or would someone end up changing a lot?  Take your t√Æme. I appreciate it! 
3	Am I ESTJ?	Hi guys!\n\nSo far people are saying I'm ESTJ, I just want to see what you guys think. I've reposted my self description to different MBTI threads:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8jpag9/am\_i\_a\_lazy\_ass\_entj\_or\_something\_else/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8jpag9/am_i_a_lazy_ass_entj_or_something_else/)\n\nr/ENTP says I'm not ENTP. r/mbti says ESTJ. r/ENTJ says I'm some ISTJ or ESTP. \n\nI'm just very dissatisfied with how inconclusive most of the typing has been so far. I just want to confirm my suspicions that I'm ESTJ since that's what most people are saying.\n\nI'm still available to answer any questions!
4	Looking over your posts, ESTJ seems like a good fit.\nI see you asked questions quite a few times. We're very big on the Socratic method.\n\nOne good test between ENTJ / ESTJ is that ENTJ's will ramble on and I usually have to talk over them to say anything. ESTJ's tend to have more balanced conversation.
4	Are you a sexy beast? :/ 
2	Others have already confirmed this, but I also think ESTJ sounds like a very good fit for you. That would've been my initial typing even without knowing you suspect yourself to be one.
1	They're all inconsequential, whichever you feel yourself drawn most to or you feel will help you grow as a person is the one you probably should identify as.\n\nThe first time I took the MBTI test I came up as an ESTJ, the subsequent tests I took came up INTP and the most recent actual "official" test I took came up with me being an ENTP. My point is, there's only as much stock in MBTI as you put in it.
1	**ESTP**\n\nFirst: your username alone is pretty aggressively *not* Te (and just as equally aggressively very Ti, so I started off pretty confident you were xxTP)\n\nAlso, I see a.) almost no indication of Te that isn't also Se, b.) no indication at all of Si (except you saying you dislike it), c.) very high indication of Ti and d.) very high indication of Se\n\nFrom your other post:\n\n* Pretty much all I see from start to finish is Ti-Fe... "annoyed" at others, "logical," "meme lord," "I do care about people and I refrain myself from cursing/yelling/etc."\n* Se: "going outside and exploring places," "real world application," "physical activity," "the heat of the sun," "camping," "I get annoyed by pure theory... want to apply it to something useful," "I can catch a dragonfly with only two fingers," and "I signed into a competitive water polo team without knowing how to swim and now im still alive and can chuck a ball at your face"... are all very high Se, especially that last one\n* I don't see any indication of Ni, except "I also have some kind of subconscious that tells me if I'm feeling good or not" which is not a strong example of high Ni, and exactly the sort of way Se-doms talk about their Ni\n* I also don't get a strong indication of Si (and, on the contrary, you specified "I dislike monotonous routine and use these to make me feel less bored (I get bored easily). Although I understand routine is part of life sometimes you need to break it to make yourself feel better... LOL" which really isn't something an ESTJ would ever say.)
3	INFP with abusive dom-tert loop ESTJ father, and I NEED advice, please.	This dude thinks that he‚Äôs changed types numerous times throughout his life, and he says this without knowing anything about type shit because he says to me that I‚Äôm trying to label him and that it‚Äôs meaningless. I‚Äôm sure you all have met a guy like this. He has an issue accepting that I‚Äôm smarter than him (when really it‚Äôs just INFP being better at ‚Äúreading people‚Äù than him, but he wouldn‚Äôt accept this because he would see this as me being smarter than him, though he‚Äôd never say this, he‚Äôd just reiterate that this ‚Äútype stuff‚Äù is bullshit.)\n\nI hope I‚Äôve given enough detail that someone knows exactly the type of guy I‚Äôm talking about. Yes I‚Äôm saying that was the point of the previous  paragraph.
6	As an ESTJ, I'm going to need more details. I am an ESTJ and INFPs are usually the easiest to get along with. Right now, the easiest explanation is that he's been mistyped.
3	>This dude thinks that he‚Äôs changed types numerous times throughout his life\n\nIt‚Äôs common to be unsure of ones type/mirror other types at certian points in your life.  I consistently test as either an INFP/INTP for the entire time I‚Äôve been in MBTI and a lot of that has to do with peacocking.\n\n>I‚Äôm trying to label him and that it‚Äôs meaningless.\n\nTypology *is* a system of labeling people whether you believe in its validity or accuracy or not.  So yes, you are labeling people when you use it.  As for it being meaningless or not, I think that is a subjective issue that changes from person to person.\n\nTbh the information you‚Äôve provided is so vague that it‚Äôs hard to tell if he‚Äôs truly an ESTJ or whether that‚Äôs your personal perception of him.  I do believe you when you say he‚Äôs an ESTJ, but I‚Äôm not really sure what specific behaviors you‚Äôre upset about, because the ones you mentioned that I answered above are pretty valid feelings tbh.\n\n>He has an issue accepting that I‚Äôm smarter than him (when really it‚Äôs just INFP being better at ‚Äúreading people‚Äù\n\nCertian ESTJs can be extremely adept at reading people even if they don‚Äôt let on.  That being said, if I were to assume he was an ESTJ this would likely be his opposing Ti.  Though intellectual insecurity is not something specific to ESTJ, it‚Äôs jusr I feel that we may be prone to that more due to said placement of Ti.\n\n
1	I have a friend who I typed as ESTJ. He was so offended that I somehow had the ability to type him without him taking the test. \n\nHe thinks mbti is a load a shit and people can‚Äôt be categorized like that. \n\nHonestly just let it go. Some people don‚Äôt care for mbti and find being typed an insult. \n\nI can‚Äôt read any description of an ESTJ because it makes me feel awful. There really isn‚Äôt a solid description of us out there. Not that I‚Äôve seen. So imagine him looking it up and finding out he‚Äôs just a bossy controlling person who most people can‚Äôt stand. \n\nI grew up with an abusive Infp parent and one thing she did that I literally hate to this day is making assumptions about me and then telling everyone else.  She thinks she‚Äôs knows me so well but actually doesn‚Äôt know me at all. She would share my problems on Facebook as if she‚Äôs doing me a favor but it just caused me to start lying and hiding the truth from her. I haven‚Äôt shared some thing personal with my mom in years because she gets so damn judge mental. She victimizes herself and then tells everyone. \n\nESTJs can be unhealthy but sometimes we‚Äôre not as bad as everyone thinks. \n\nIdk sounds unhealthy from both perspectives. You do sound like you think you‚Äôre better. 
4	ESTJs, do you suck at reading people's true motivations?	The answer is yes.
14	The real question you want to ask yourself here is, do we care enough about it to ask?
6	I know I can be too trusting at times because I‚Äôm willing to extend the olive branch of peace even when I know the person involved is kind of shitty.  I wouldn‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm oblivious to other people‚Äôs motivations as sometimes I‚Äôm willing to overlook motivations (at least at first) in order to preserve the greater balance/attempt to give them a chance to be better.  Sometimes that blows up in my face.\n\nIt‚Äôs also true that at times I‚Äôve been able to bring out/understand the more positive aspects of a person that is generally labeled as ‚Äúnegative‚Äù by others.  So oftentimes it can be difficult for me to demonize somebody when I can see where they‚Äôre coming from/the reasons why they do the things they do.  So I can at times be too sympathetic to people who don‚Äôt really deserve.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin I also have gotten a lot of shit before for not tolerating people who actually *were* complete assholes but we‚Äôre considered paragons of a specific community.\n\nA lot of these issues arise not from an inability to read people at all I feel, but being able to read people *too* well in certian areas while still missing/purposely overlooking the warning sides *because* I can read their motivations/reasoning.
4	Yeah but I don‚Äôt really see it as this horrible trait. \n\nI‚Äôve been hurt by people who took advantage of me and I‚Äôve been too forgiving at times but it‚Äôs not like I really care. \n\nWhen I realize I‚Äôm being used I just move on with my life and put my time and effort into those who appreciate the help I give. \n\nI‚Äôm not the revenge type. I truly just don‚Äôt care enough to want to get back at people who hurt me. You just become irrelevant to me. \n\nSo many people get so caught up in wanting to hurt those who hurt them and you‚Äôre just wasting time\nAnd energy on the wrong people. \n\nFocus on those who care and appreciate you. \n\nThe best revenge is living your best life. Moving on and being happy. Not letting the hurtful actions of others destroy your life. 
1	No, I think I‚Äôm decent at it. Most people are oblivious and self centered, so that‚Äôs an easy starting point. I‚Äôm oblivious and self centered too, so I usually don‚Äôt care what people‚Äôs motivations are or bother to think about it.
1	Most ESTJS I know in real life are excellent at reading people's true motivations and are balanced with F. They make a great lie detector and good at managing people both emotionally and logically. It's funny because sometimes I'm providing logical feedback to them and they provide me with a useful emotional insight that help us work towards our goal, it almost makes me second doubt who is which lol (I'm an ENFJ). I can understand where the ESTJ stereotype come from as I've seen a minority, but most of them don't fit it. At least not the ones I meet in real life.
5	X-post from Dead-Bedrooms, I'm having major issues with ESTJ fiance; need other ESTJ advice	
3	I'm looking for advice from other ESTJ's here. Fiance is in a dead bedroom and it feels like she's just staying because of tradition/shared past, but is this a limit with you all? Is there actually any coming back from this situation or is this actually done and she's just clinging?
2	Girl ESTJ here. Currently having similar problems with my SO. I would say, the best thing you can do is under promise and over deliver. And take a few days for a getaway and have a good time. Don't expect / ask any sexual activities, just go as best friends. Go for a hike, eat good food. Try to connect, small chats and all. Talk about music, TV shows, places, funny memories you had together. After a while she'll open up. Then, you can talk more deeply about how you feel.\n\nI always do what I say. Especially with people I love, it's like I owe them my words. When my SO doesn't do things he said he's gonna do, I feel hurt because it's so important to me. In your case, if I were your SO, I would say 'you should have thought about this before you promise anything to me'. I would feel I couldn't trust you anymore, hence the avoiding physical touch. We value integrity and when we see that you don't demonstrate that value, we are put off.\n\nShe still loves you. Despite the traditional values that ESTJs have, female ESTJs defy those traditional values anyway. We are not scared to cut people off. The fact that she's still with you means she still sees hope in the relationship. And I can understand her wanting to start over. Don't see this as an ending, see this as a fresh opportunity. Go on dates, no expectations, have fun together, like old times. I think that's what she meant.\n\nSorry if it's all over the place I just woke up and I can't stop myself from commenting, your problem sounds so much like ours and I want to help.\n
2	okay so \nmaybe she isn‚Äôt attracted to you mentally and ambition/ lifestyle wise  so that leads to her treating  you  with distance rather than amicably? \n\nI recall when I didn‚Äôt feel the need to show affection to my bf because I felt it was forced and that we didn‚Äôt connect. I was like yah no goodbye kisses, etc.\n\nso I think she is tolerating you and not interested and you need to find some common ground? \n\nit will be hard to figure out what she wants... maybe. This is because if you randomly try really hard to connect, she might analyze it too much and respond poorly. \n\nI think she needs to view you again in a positive and high regard then she could like you again enough to respond well.\n
2	Monkey in a cage	Do you guys oftenly get into the 'monkey in a cage' mentality since you rely on past experiences?
2	Why do INTJ BOY attract to me as an ESTJ	dont mean i doesn't like them i do like but just wondering why the INTJ kind of person always seduce me lol
6	Because you are attracted to people with that kind of personality.
2	Socionics Supervision relations. INTJ \(INTp\) supervises ESTJ \(ESTj\). You're probably in awe of their dominant Ni!
2	Because INTJ is the "supervisor" type of ESTJ, while ESTJ is INTJ's "supervisee" according to socionics. Supervisor type is in a psychologically attractive and advantageous position to the supervisee, thus it is easiest for supervisor to seduce the supervisee. So for INTJs it is very easy to attract ESTJs: [**ESTJ relationships**](http://www.personalitycafe.com/estj-articles/283-love-types-estj-3.html#post2423173).    \nLikewise it is easy for ESTJs to appear in favorable light before ISFJs, who are their supervisee type in turn.
9	ESTJs are amazing parents	Hello there ESTJs, just wanted to let you guys know I love you all as parents. \n\nI love my mother to the point I'd die for her. This woman has protected me, taught me valuable life skills, I've learned everything I needed to survive from my ESTJ mother. At times I've hated her bluntness, but over time I have come to appreciate it. I may silently seethe for a bit, but I've learned to think about what was said. I appreciate her honesty the most. \n\nAs an INFP I know I was probably emotional and as a teen I was hard on her at times with my storming off and sulking. But man did I learn how to appreciate honesty and have grown thicker skin because of my mom. \n\nI swear as an INFP, I always see you guys as the smartest people I know. Dutiful, clever, no nonsense, intelligent, brave, and fun. \n\nI know there have been infp who hate their estj parents. But I remember when my mom would be strict about something I'd always think she was doing things for my protection and wouldn't think much of it. I swear you estjs are always right about people when it comes to a judge of character.\n\n\nI have avoided some really effed up folks and situations by using my mother's advice. Also if you are an INFP who is reading this, just know that your este parents means well. They are protective parents, their honesty isn't to hurt you but again to protect you believe it or not. They don't see no sense in lying as it wouldn't be helpful to you and that the world will be much crueler in telling you the truth vs them. Also don't take things super personal. I know it's hard, but try to get out of our feelings for a bit. \n\nESTJ parents with INFP kids, just be gentle and understand that we are sensitive. We feel things deeply. Its better to suggest things to us rather than set it as rule. And little bit of some independence. \n\nI swear me and my mom are very close.\n\n\nThe only parent I didn't get along with is my father (ENTP). I know daughter and fathers are supposed to have this "close" relationship. Nope he's cold hearted. Anyways love you guys (ESTJs) as parents. 
8	My dad is an ESTJ and I‚Äôm an INFP. He is so overbearing, condescending, and cold, and has been my whole life. He won‚Äôt change. He‚Äôs the smartest person I know, and yet he‚Äôs still so emotionally blind. Yes, he does have *other* personal issues unrelated to mbti that have made our relationship difficult, but still.\n\nDoes he love me? Of course, he‚Äôs my dad. He would do anything for me. He just makes it so hard to want to be around him. He is so stubborn, and always has to be correct. He has to have the last word, always. 
5	Hey, this is really nice. Thanks for sharing.  
2	A balanced ESTJ is a gift to the world. Salute to my ESTJ mother - ENFJ
1	As an ESTJ I find it strange how you used "the only parent I did not get along" (would make sense if there were more parents) line when there are total of 2 parents. :)\n\n"
5	What are your biggest pet peeves?	Anything and everything from moral offenses to petty infractions welcome!
9	People who meander to the point. Fucking let's go already. 
8	Messy people (especially in my home) and people being slow/dense. 
3	When people take their sweet time. 
6	Probably it‚Äôs not owning what you‚Äôre doing but closely followed by bad manners. 
1	Bad hygiene. Don‚Äôt understand how 24 old guys don‚Äôt realize they smell. \n\nBeing so fucking incompetent that everyone else has to do more work because of you. \n\nPassive aggressiveness. I can easily tell when people are upset but won‚Äôt tell me why. And if I know what‚Äôs upsetting you because you‚Äôve told everyone but me. Then I will purposely keep doing it until you finally lose it and then laugh and tell you you should have fucking told me 3 weeks ago when you first got upset about it. \n\nPeople who make issues out of nothing. They just love being dramatic. \n\n
1	ITT: "meandering," physically or mentally
2	ESTJ outbursts	Do ESTj‚Äôs regret things they say while angry? Is it built up frustration of honest comments \(they meant what was said?\)  I‚Äôm talking below the belt comments that were hurtful and unnecessary. I had a recent fallout with an ESTJ. We were friends for 4 years and started dating casually over the last couple of years. The last few weeks he had been busy with work so I gave him his space. This week, I decided to reach out to him and asked him what he thought about our dating situation as I keep getting hot and cold from him and I needed a little clarity because it was overwhelming. He can come across as emotionally unavailable.  \n\nHe didn‚Äôt respond so I told him I‚Äôd be stopping by after work to talk to him. All hell broke loose from that. I got the most disrespectful text I have ever received from anyone before. He stated that he had planned to see me but that as soon as I said I was going to get in his space and be intrusive by showing up uninvited, he was done with this. I won‚Äôt explain the rest but it is enough that his ugly comments made me not only confirm I don‚Äôt want to date him, he has successfully destroyed 4 years of friendship. I responded that I would not put up with those sorts of cruel outbursts and below the belt attacks.\n\nCould something like my ‚Äúgetting in his space‚Äù really trigger such a response? Was he caught up in the heat of the moment or did he mean all of those hurtful statements? Will he regret what was said later? I will not be around to deal with it, I am just curious what goes on in the ESTJ mind.
6	We ESTJs will get an understanding in our heads of what should be and how it actually is. We'll stress out over it but might not say anything if that is considered off limits. When we get into a bad argument, we'll take that opportunity to get all of the stuff that we've been holding up out. It can be very destructive and we might be especially attuned to making it so without realizing it.\n\nIf someone asks, "did we mean it", we'll be thinking, "do I believe that I told the truth." It's really hard for us to recognize the emotional content of the argument, even when it comes from us. In our heads, its like math or a plan of action. When someone get's upset, we're like, it's just logic. Can't we just agree on that?\n\nWithout knowing any more, you might be able to fix this by telling him that you don't know what you did wrong and offering to listen.
3	Good for you for ditching this moron. I think he felt disrespected and wanted to make clear, who is the boss.\n\nESTJ(s) who loose control are the worst. Luckily we are usually good with stress. But I think it is sometimes just too much to handle.\n\nThat said, I don't look back at my anger outburst with any sort of guilt. I deluded myself in believing that it was all righteous anger and needed to be done.\n\n>Will he regret what was said later?\n\nHe will probably regret destroying the chance of getting in your pants. 
1	What does he do for a living that he would need space for several weeks?  I feel like ESTJs make time for people they want to see. You say casually dating over the last few years, how recently were you dating?  Isn't it a bit aggressive to ask someone to clarify a "hot/cold" situation that was preceded by several weeks of someone being busy and needing space and then taking a non response as an invitation to go to their home?\n\nHonestly, it sounds like he maybe is in a relationship.  Are you sure he isn't seeing someone else and got upset because he was afraid he might get caught with the other woman?  I typically think ESTJs get angry like that mainly out of fear.  You say "dating casually" which I take to mean as having sex?  I wonder if he went cold because he is in a relationship and then got angry because maybe he was afraid you'd show up and cause a scene with the girlfriend.\n\nI find that most ESTJs try to be as efficient as possible with work because they do prioritize meeting social obligations to friends and family so I think the busy with work thing for for weeks is concerning.   Below the belt attacks are never ok but if I was giving off standoffish vibes indicating I was not interested in someone and they told me they were going to show up at my house, I'd be furious because you are somewhat forcing me to aggressively state my peace that I do not want to speak with you or see you.
4	How do you regain productivity after a night out?	You drank and had fun until 4:00 AM. \n\nYou slept until 2:00 PM the next day. \n\nAt night, you cannot sleep because you slept during the day. \n\nYou need sleep to be maximally productive the next day. \n\nHow do you get out of this situation?
11	Take melatonin to sleep at night 
7	I think the trick is not to sleep until 2pm. You don‚Äôt really need to be well rested for the day that you sit around eating hangover food and vegging out. Shorting your sleep will make it easier to get to bed on time the next night.
6	Make yourself tired. Best way for me is to work out. Do something tiring, no matter what it is, just do it until you can‚Äôt anymore,
3	I don't see the problem. So you will fall asleep later and have only 5\-6 hours of sleep.\n\nWhat is the big deal? Unless you work physical labor, lack of sleep for one day would not affect your productivity much.\n\nAs an ESTJ I do not see this situation as even slightest "problem" :\) It is almost literally nothing to me \(and I like my 8 hours of sleep\). 
3	Or you know just don‚Äôt get into the situation 
8	ESTJs, I love you.	ENFP here.  I am finding a pattern in my life that my longest, most fulfilling and most authentic relationships are with ESTJs.  Everything I read says we make bad pairs, specifically in relationships.  I am inclined to vehemently disagree assuming you have two developed / mature people.  I find that we really bring out the best in each other and are instrumental in becoming better versions of ourselves.  The way the internet talks about you guys,  you'd think you are monsters.  My ESTJs are the most loving people I know.  They show it through consistency, action and honesty intended to improve environments.\n\nI love MBTI but I am curious about why everyone seems to think ESTJs and ENFPs could never have fulfilling relationships.  It has not been my experience at all.
3	 ENTP here. One of my best friends is an ESTJ. My dad is also an ESTJ.\n\nBoth seem to really value people in their lives who are smart, honorable and hard\-working. Makes for a very good relationship because even though we don't at all see eye\-to\-eye on abstract issues and deconstruction of social expectations, we respect each other's strengths and I know how to meet their reasonably modest expectations.\n\nBut there is certainly a controlling, stubborn, rigid, self\-obsessed, and overly\-confident side to both of them which can really grind my gears. I can handle them in small doses. Hopefully most mature ESTJs aren't like the two I know.
1	Look into Socionics. ENFP and ESTJ are considered Activity relations and those are some of the best intertype relations according to that theory because they share the same top 4 cognitive functions, in a different order.\n\nAnd I'd have to agree with you... I am an INFP \(INFj in Socionics\) and the ex I miss the most is an ISTJ \(ISTp in Socionics\); we are also Activity relations. There was something about that relationship that was incredibly comforting, warm, and motivating. He got me accomplishing stuff like no one else ever did, and he didn't even have to say or do anything, I just wanted to be the best I could be for our relationship's sake. On his end, he also made several improvements to his life, creatively and career\-wise. It's just a pity he was inclined to cheat and lie, otherwise we would still be together.\n\nI've also been in a short 2 month thing with an ESTJ and it was a different energy \(in Socionics, it's called Dual relations, "supposedly" the best relationship\). Also comfortable, but I felt less inclined to rev up my inferior function usage because the ESTJ could take care of those matters. The best thing about that relationship was the mutual admiration of each other's natural strengths. It was attractive and cute to see him do his dominant Te function thing, and he appreciated my Fi. It was easy to see how we'd make a great team if we had the same vision. But it also felt a bit alienating, because Te and Fi are somewhat opposed to each other too. Whereas with my ISTJ ex, when we were together, we were often on the same wavelength \(Si and Fi loop\) so we could just BE and enjoy the same things without pushing each other too much to be what we were not, if that makes any sense. I should add that it was when we were apart that we'd be at our most energetic, separately tackling our individual goals and projects. When together, we just relaxed and it was wonderful.
1	That's awesome. I was best friends with an ENFP and I honestly just stopped talking to her because the friendship felt so dead. 13 years and looking back I felt like I put way more energy into it than she ever did.  She was my number one and most important person and she treated me like I was nothing. She also threw me under the bus in my most vulnerable point of my life which eventually led to me living out of my car. \n\nI have another ENFP friend and we distanced after high school but have managed to make it work and I've been able to call her out on her shit and she tends to take it really well, but I've seen the same behaviors and patterns when it comes to that type. \n\nESTJs don't take relationships lightly, even friendships.  I get that ENFPs are very bubbly and have tons of friends, but you need to be careful about the people you are interacting with.  ENFPs like to get involved with peoples personal lives and you make it very easy to open up, but then you tend to just disappear.  It has happened to me with every single ENFP I have ever met to the point where I ended up in therapy over it.  I have some severe abandonment issues, it wasn't just ENFPs, but they weren't doing me any help.\n\nYou know those friends that you can call or text and they will answer in 5 minutes even if it's to tell you they cant talk. Those people are Never ENFPs.  I've been in serious emergencies and it has taken some ENFPs 2 weeks to finally respond, some never do at all.  Who the hell would ever want to be friends with someone like that? My best friend is an INFP and that hasn't happened in 4 years of friendship, and we live 1500 miles away from each other.  \n\nI'm ranting at this point, as I tend to get really worked up when it comes to ENFPs.  But if I have anything to say it's this.  ESTJs care about their people, and they don't take those relationships lightly.  If an ESTJ has chosen you, and you betray them, it's done.  
1	ENFP here; married an ESTJ.\n\nDidn't look into MBTI until she had been introduced to it at work.\nIt's tough but can be very rewarding too.\n\nYou're right in that we have to both be mature about it to work and know when to act (not be) immature to lighten things up.\n\nWe can be a fantastic balance, but it is often a task to maintain that balance.
2	MBTI survey results!! - What did the correlations from 1200 answers say?	
2	What are Gen Y and Z ESTJs like?	Title says it all. I suppose I could've just said that.
10	I am not even sure what you want from us. An introduction?\n\nI think this calls for some field research. Find some young ESTJ(s) and observe them in their natural habitat. Talking to them shouldn‚Äôt hurt too much either.
4	Here's an anecdotal description of one for you as someone who's been dating a Gen Y ESTJ for years:  \n\n\n- Happy to be a cog in the machine, but aims for a place high-up in the machine through a mix of hard work, being more intelligent than most people, and being affable enough that nobody notices when he's slacking. loudest person in the office. Picks up mentors like flypaper. \n  \n\n\n- traditional, but somewhat progressive in views. is however a kool-aid drinker and does not want to rock the boat at all costs. would rather convince himself he agrees with something against his principles than burn a bridge until it reaches a breaking point or he witnesses several people he respects jumping ship.  \n\n\n- less traditional in that he doesn't want kids, is athiest-agnostic, borderline liberal\n\n\n- family comes first 100% of the time    \n\n\n- all or nothing on everything, see example below:\n\n\n**by day:** gym bro, eating broccoli, counting calories, sharp dresser, white collar golden-boy with a collection of middle aged women who wish their sons were like him, and every bro-type guy has a man-crush on him.    \n\n\n**by night:** smokes weed for hours every night after work - nobody would ever suspect it. consumes around 5000 calories in two nights over the weekend, and is back to his routine by Monday. rinse and repeat. would have the physique of a superhero if it weren't for the weed. when not able to consume weed for days due to travel, becomes the high-strung micromanager he would probably be if he wasn't a stoner - pretty sure smoking weed helps him maintain an enviable level of low stress 24/7 (his coworkers don't know how he does it). he's delightful when stoned, is willing to entertain more theoretical discussions. 
5	They are less traditional but just as overbearing and aggressive about their pursuits\n\nI've also heard female ESTJs called "gym babes" ?? \n\n(I'm way too involved in this sub for a non-ESTJ)
2	Busy, too much work, not enough time. Time is Money and Money is Time. 
3	Can anyone give me an example of Introverted Sensing. I just don‚Äôt get it.	
3	[This](http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/information_elements/Si) will probably help. \n\nMy sister uses introverted sensing as an ESFJ and she has very vivid and personal experiences with food and music. She can remember any song and the moment she heard it and what she felt about it. She‚Äôs like a human Shazam. She knows what she likes about food and what makes it good to her, and cooks for herself every night whereas I don‚Äôt use that function and all and frequently neglect my physical comfort and health. When she‚Äôs hungry, she keeps repeating ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry, I‚Äôm so hungry‚Äù until she‚Äôs fed. She is very particular about her comfort. \n\nI dated an ESTJ and he was a history buff, can remember details in sequential order very well. He was also super into movies and could compare any kind of movie and remembered the exact year of each one. He knows what he‚Äôs in the mood for pretty much all the time and you can tell he‚Äôs not enjoying a moment by his physical reactions to discomfort. Incredible memory, broke the MCAT by getting into the 101st percentile. This is more of an ability example but for someone to be this good at memory, they must hold those things with significance. 
1	I saw so many conflicting definitions for si, that I think that there is no general consensus.\n\nThat said, I see si (ha) as experience, the head cinema that shows previous episodes of your life, an anti-gaslight function. This sort of thing.\n\nExample: Lets say I would give you an apple and would claim it is a pear. You can tell that it is not an apple by it looking, smelling and tasting different than any apple you have ever seen. And if you had enough experience with pears you could identify it as one.   \n
2	Are you more into f***ing or making love?	Title speaks for itself
13	I prefer sex over fishing, thank you very much.\n\nWhy don't you write fucking? I am pretty sure you don't need to self censor yourself around here.\n\nThat said, I am as passionate as my partner lets me.
4	There‚Äôs a time and place for each. No need to censor ‚Äúfucking‚Äù lol.
5	Definitely both according to the mood.. 
2	More about fucking but making love is nice sometimes 
4	Lifestyle analysis for MBTI survey - 3 minutes to fill, will post results in a week. Participate too!!	
7	ESTJ's opinion on INFP's	Hello! I'm just curious about your thoughts on INFP's. What are some traits you like? Dislike? Would you date them? Etc. Please be detailed. \n\nAlso, how do I know if ESTJ's are interested in me? And disinterested in me?\n\nThank you.

2	In love with ESTJ guy, but...	I'm an INFP girl in love with an ESTJ man (he doesn't know it yet though). I will keep this as concise and straightforward as possible. When we met, he wasn't looking for anything serious because he's separated with kids. He's a lot older than me...I don't have children but even though I love his kids, I would like my own. I can see a future with this man and I think he really likes me, if not loves me. He always makes time for me despite his busy work schedule even if we don't have sex that day. So I know it's not just that for him anymore, if it ever was "just sex". But I don't know what he thinks about going through marriage and children again, and I don't want to freak him out since we technically aren't in a relationship. I think he was just looking for some fun and I stumbled into his life. We are extremely compatible though and feel really comfortable with one another. Why we aren't in a relationship is complicated but mainly it relates with his home situation as he's still married with young children, although separated. He also has various sexual relationships with other women given his separation and I don't think he's ready to be exclusive. I know this sounds really bad or like I'm not important to him, but that's definitely not the case.\n\nMy question is: in light of his past, is it possible he could consider another serious relationship with me, let alone to the point of having children? 
5	He is separated. Not the same thing as divorced. There is still a chance he could get back together with his wife, no? You need to ask him if he wants more kids, since he's already got more than one, kids are expensive, and as an ESTJ he has probably already set out a plan for the ones he's got with the finances available. Maybe ask him if he thinks he could afford to have more \-\- that's not a question he'd be freaked out by if you keep it impersonal. The other troubling thing is, he has other women on rotation? I feel like that's a little disrespectful to you. If he really thinks you're special, he'd have given those other women the boot, and wouldn't have wanted you to know about them for fear of losing you. I've heard of serious relationships starting out as FwB things at first, but he knows you're ok with being one of many casuals, so what makes you think he'll start to see and treat you differently later on? Ok, so you guys are extremely compatible and feel really comfortable with each other. What if he meets someone who he feels the same thing toward but the difference is, she makes it clear she doesn't sleep with nor lose sleep over "unavailable" men and that she'll be interested in him after he gets his act together and loses those other women? I guess what I'm alluding to here is neither you nor he seem to have real boundaries, or standards. Is that a good foundation for a healthy relationship? You SAY you want exclusivity, a serious relationship, kids, the works \(actually he doesn't know that\). Your ACTIONS say you're fine with non\-exclusivity, and him wasting your time potentially. Given this, why would he consider doing anything differently?  
2	Few questions I have for you.\n\nWhy hasn't he divorced? Is he in the process of divorcing? What's the deal with that? If they are never getting back together why are they just separated for now? \n\nI personally think this is going to blow up in your face because he probably doesn't really think much of you. You are just someone to pass the time and hang with and fuck occasionally. \n\nI also don't support people who jump into relationships like this, to begin with.  He isn't divorced yet, so why are you messing around with him? Separation is NOT divorce.  \n\n>He also has various sexual relationships with other women given his separation and I don't think he's ready to be exclusive\n\nDefinitely is not interested in you.  \n
1	As an ESTJ, my concerns about relationships are usually uncertainties. Stuff like:\n\n* She won't want to compromise on this issue\n* That thing she said was being polite but also means she probably isn't interested\n* My life is going to change dramatically in a year and I don't want to force her to go along with that\n* I'm a Christian and want somebody who will celebrate my Christianity with me\n* The dating scene is annoying and I don't know if I'm ready to go back yet\n\nThese are all examples of what might be going through my head as I think about getting serious with someone. Some of these came from my friends.\n\nYou probably have a decent shot at a relationship. There could easily be some deal breakers in there too.
5	ENFPer here wanting to know what you guys think of the Myers-Briggs paradigm? Myself and fellow NFers like it, however, I'm interested to know whether ST's believe it has merit or not.	
4	I'm really big on Socionics and use MBTI by translating from Socionics.\n\nIt gives me a lot of insight into many of my relationships.\n\nI don't trust most other personality typing systems like the 4 temperaments. I haven't done enough with enneagram to form an opinion. Big 5 seems useful but doesn't seem permanent, so that's probably something different.
2	I use MBTI and similar personality systems as a springboard for developing my own ideas that are most effective for me. I pretty frequently disagree with a lot of claims made by MBTI, Socionics, and Keirsey's bullshit \(I hate the impact this guy's work makes on personality discussions\), but I pull ideas from all of them \(except for fucking Keirsey\).  I'm interested in the relationship between letter dichotomies, function axes, Socionic quadras, etc, and developing my own, personal systems with inspiration from all of them. Not in a formal sense, I don't write a lot of it down, but I think about them a lot. There are some aspects I've neglected, though. The conventional "temperaments" \(NT, NF, SJ and SP specifically, I don't mind EJ, IJ, EP, IP\), Reinin dichotomies \(although they have correlated pretty well with my observations\), and a few other things. \n\nHonestly, the only scientifically rigorous personality system I know of is the Big 5, but it all seems pretty obvious. I could figure out if someone was agreeable or not without that system, it rarely provides any insight. 
1	Academic Survey on Personality	Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T2DWFXG
2	I did it. Took forever. 284 questions. And you get entered to a drawing for a gift card, of which 5 are available. 
3	Tell me about when you go off the radar?	At work the other day we were talking about these ESTJ clients we have (just a few). They are amazingly productive people, but we can't figure out why they neglect us so much. When we meet with them, they are buzzing with energy and they have so much to talk about. We make plans, and we carry them out. But outside of that, when we email them, we rarely hear back. When we call them and leave voicemails, no answer. If we send updates explaining that we're done, we get "thanks" as a reply. Anything else we get nothing.\n\nThese are really good people. Hard workers. So what do you think is going on here? I have a non-client ESTJ friend who does something similar, so the curiosity is killing me. I usually think "dutiful person" but when I ask her for a favor and she says "absolutely, I'll do that" and it never happens...is that just killing her that it sticks out on her list, but she can't get around to it?\n\nThese are people in their 30s-50s, in case the developmental aspect matters. Love to get your thoughts.
7	I‚Äôm super excited when I am around people, but if I‚Äôm by myself I kind of withdraw and don‚Äôt really seek out anything. After I get too lonely, I will reach out to people, though. It‚Äôs a weird balance. 
7	ESTJs are a lot less socially robust than they come off as on the surface. When we're \(or at least I'm\) around others and we're making plans, I'm typically incredibly enthusiastic and have an opinion on just about everything. People are then surprised when I almost never contact anyone about anything ever unless it's related to work, sometimes to the point where I really need to contact others but I procrastinate on it. I won't do that if I'm incredibly invested, but sometimes I appear more invested in things than I actually am just because I like planning and expressing opinions. I can't speak for your clients, though. ESTJs are usually direct enough that they'll respond honestly to most questions, so if you have a conversation with your friend \(in person\) you might find something relevant to your situation. If her answers are too personal, your clients probably won't mind you asking why \(but I guess that might be seen as unprofessional\).
6	I feel a little confused by this. If they are clients, how can they neglect you? Even if you‚Äôre asking them a question that needs to be answered before they get the thing, it‚Äôs their thing, right? If they chose to delay getting the thing, isn‚Äôt that their choice?\n\nI don‚Äôt reply to every email I get. I‚Äôm not even sure what more I could do to show my appreciation for something other than saying thanks. Or why I would be obligated to do more than that. I‚Äôve ignored calls and voicemails when I have something else going on, especially if that person calls a lot or if they‚Äôre difficult to get off the phone. Email is better for delivering information anyway, that way I can refer back to it on my own time.\n\nAs far as favors go, was there a deadline? Priority is a big thing for me. I do not tend every task in the order in which it was received. And I try not to ask for favors because that opens up a can of worms that I don‚Äôt navigate well. I do favors, but they are favors, not obligations, which means I do them if it suits me.\n\nThese kinds of social protocols are always very strange to me.
4	I think ESTJs have a hard time feeling how real an issue is if it‚Äôs not physically around them
2	It could be a number of things.  As someone else mentioned, as an ESTJ I‚Äôve found that when a problem/issue is more removed from my life it can be harder for me to get back to it because I expend my energy on so many other issues that are seemingly much more present first.  It also depends on how dedicated they are to whatever it is they‚Äôre purchasing and what they‚Äôre planning to do with it.\n\nI know for myself that sometimes when I‚Äôm purchasing a service I‚Äôll attempt to be socially jovial/helpful because I feel that helps to expedite the process and improve everyone‚Äôs mood, but I may actually be feeling kind of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù over all.  Or I might be focused/‚Äúpepped up‚Äù about the purchase at that given moment but then return to my home and end up going back to my sort of nuetral state of emotianlity/energy due to the change in circumstances (going back to what I was saying about getting distracted/burnt out by other stuff).  Or maybe something happened after I left that made the purchase that seemed like a good thing at the time feel like a bad decision, so I might now be feeling bummed out/lethargic over it.  Either way I‚Äôm unlikely to let the people involved in said purchase in on that fact unless I felt they could assist/were somehow involved/responsible for an aspect of that poor choice on my part.\n\n>is that just killing her that it sticks out on her list, but she can't get around to it?\n\nI‚Äôve done this before and usually it does bug the crap out of me yes.  I feel socially obligated to assist and when I don‚Äôt after having offered to help I feel like a dick.  I‚Äôve run into issues before where I offer too much help to too many people too quickly and I just burn out so now I‚Äôm more careful about this sort of thing.
2	Where do male ESTJs hang out?	And how to get their attention and potentially get asked out on a date? \n\nHere are places I know *some* ESTJs frequent:\n\n- Climbing gyms\n- The great outdoors \n- Hardware stores\n\nAny other suggestions?
13	Don't expect them to ask you out, do it yourself, ESTJs love that.  We also suck at picking up hints. \n\nESTJs are commonly found in some sort of community or group and it's going to be a hobby they probably enjoy. \n\nThey are also very likely to spend the majority of their time working
7	Work, lol
6	Bars, coffee shops, work. Anywhere I can have an intellectual conversation. 
5	This whole idea is so foreign to me. I can‚Äôt imagine sniffing around for a particular type and hoping they want to date me. \n\nI‚Äôm not a dude, but I don‚Äôt hang out anywhere in particular. I go out in the world to do the things and then I leave. \n\nI tend to like people who like me. I would never ask out a stranger and the idea of being asked out by someone who doesn‚Äôt know me at all is off putting. Like, why? \n\nBut I have no idea if that‚Äôs typical or cross gender.
4	What would you do in a zombie apocalypse?	Infp here doing a little social experiment. I'm asking all the personality types how they'd handle the apocalypse. 
10	‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.‚Äù
2	Probably just try doing whatever authorities tell me to do, unless it's spread lighting\-quick the situation will probably be dealt with before anything terrible happens. If I can't do that, I'd try to find my family and just see if we could drive out to the countryside or something and wait for it to blow over, presumably fewer zombies there than in the city. Pretty generic answer but realistically it's all I could do \(then again, we're talking about a zombie apocalypse, maybe I shouldn't be going for a realistic answer\). Honestly, I don't think many people would die if zombies attacked, but I guess "apocalypse" implies a bigger event.
1	Considering that I would certainly die on my own step one would have to be organizing survivors
1	The question isn't relevant.\n
0	In no particular order:\n\n- eat a zombie \n\n- find the necronomicon and become the lord of the zombies\n\n- go full insane scientist and build beautiful creatures out of the zombie-material (like centaurs)\n\n- have sex with a zombie (only after removing the teeth of course; safety first)
4	ESTJs and Empathy (questions inside)	*question 3 was edited in later\n\nI'm back to understand more about my dual!\n\nHere are a couple scenarios...\n\n1) You say something harsh that ends up (mildly) upsetting \n\na. an acquaintance \n\nb. a friend \n\nc. a lover \n\nd. a relative \n\nRegarding your decision to say this thing, which statement(s) usually describe your thought process? (choose 1 or more)\n\ni. "I didn't know that would upset them and I feel bad" \n\nii. "I didn't know that would upset them but I don't care"\n\niii. "I didn't know that would upset them but I'm happy about it"\n\niv. "I did know that would upset them but I feel bad"\n\nv. "I did know that would upset them and I don't care"\n\nvi. "I did know that would upset them and I'm happy about it"\n\nLets say the importance of voicing that thought was neutral, but feel free to explore if the situation was critical, or if the upset was more than mild.\n\n2) You end up in a heated argument with someone \n\na. you dislike and is generally an insensitive person, including towards you\n\nb. you dislike and is generally a sensitive person, including towards you\n\nc. you like and is generally an insensitive towards, including towards you \n\nd. you like and is generally a sensitive person, including towards you\n\nYou end up attacking one of their deep insecurities, shutting them up almost instantly. In the silence that follows, you think (choose one or more)\n\ni. "I went too far and feel guilty now, I need to make this better."\n\nii. "I shouldn't have said that but this will smooth out on its own."\n\niii. "Interesting, I wonder what they'll say next."\n\niv. "Good, I'm winning the argument."\n\n3) You prefer the follow the following types of people\n\na. kind but incompetent vs. unkind but competent \n\nb. similar life experiences but few similar interests vs. similar interests but few similar life experiences \n\nas \n\ni. lovers\n\nii. coworkers\n\niii. friends\n\niv. nowhere in your life\n\nBonus unrelated question: Do you like such compliments?\n\n"I find you so interesting/intriguing"\n\n"You're very creative"\n\n"You have a unique personality"\n
17	I really want to reply, but this structure is killing me. 
7	I often just say what I think or feel and I almost always realize it came off the wrong way.  This has been something I have struggled with my whole life.  People thinking I'm an asshole because I just say what I think or feel.  \n\nI take pride in my honesty, and one of the biggest insults I had ever received was when someone called me a liar.  I have spent my whole life being honest about everything.  In almost all of my jobs, my bosses will come to me regarding issues because they know they will get the whole story.  When people need the truth they come to me.  That is the one part of me that I love, knowing that I am known for speaking the truth. \n\nBut this specific trait means not everyone is going to like me, and most relationships will take time to develop.  I have had to learn it is not okay to just say whatever I feel, and when I've realized I possibly approached the situation wrong, I'll go back and talk to them about it.  I will own up to every mistake I make, no matter how big, even if I know I'll get in trouble for it.  \n\nIf you want to be known for speaking truth, you have to be honest about everything, even when it might hurt your name or reputation.  But I've learned it's better to just take ownership of your mistakes and people tend to be a lot more forgiving if you say you messed up right when it happens versus trying so hard to maintain this perfect image.  \n\nA lot of my closest friends will say that my honesty and straightforwardness is their favorite part about me.  So even though not everyone will understand my intentions and people will dislike me, that's just something I'm going to have to accept.  \n\nMy favorite kinds of people are people who don't make apologies for who they are.  So my best friend is an INFP.  She is weird, silly, passionate, kind and the best person I've ever met.  I love her because she has a personality.  There is a uniqueness to her.  She isn't like every person I meet.  She can be extra and over-emotional, but I love that part of her.  Being different is what she takes pride in.  \n\n\nI like compliments when I know it's genuine.  
4	I say ‚Äúharsh‚Äù things to people all the time without realizing it fully, especially with my boyfriend and my family. I don‚Äôt realize things will be upsetting until I see them react, and when they do react, I don‚Äôt usually feel any different about what I said. Usually these are things are constructive criticism in my mind, but I‚Äôm very matter of fact and direct and I mean well but often say them in ways that are too insensitive for other people I guess. I‚Äôm a no BS person and I say what I mean; if people have a problem with that they can fuck off.\n\nAs an ESTJ, I would like all those compliments, especially that I‚Äôm interesting. I also like being told I‚Äôm competent.
3	If I had time I‚Äôd answer this 
3	Whether I feel bad or not depends on how well I understand why they feel bad in terms of my functions. If someone is upset about what I said for silly reasons, I don't care.\n\nI'm not great at managing my tone with most people. Understanding problems related to my tone is hard. ESTJs tend to want argumentation to be all about the argument and ignore technique and tone.\n\nIf I know what I say is going to hurt someone, such as force them to change their life in a serious way, even for the good, I'll probably wait for the right time to say it. I probably won't say anything unless we have a close relationship.\n\nWorking with INFPs helps as they have deep emotional empathy that I can kind of copy.\n\n"You end up attacking one of their deep insecurities, shutting them up almost instantly. In the silence that follows, you think (choose one or more)"\niii) I might poke around with a question. I won't feel bad until I understand why they were hurt.\n\nI tend to associate with outcasts. These people aren't always outcasts because they are insensitive though.\nI pay the most attention to people who have a good mix of things that they agree and disagree with me on. I usually want people to disagree on different things from each other so I have a variety.\n\nOn compliments:\nI like being found as strange or weird. I like seeing myself as a bit of an outcast.\nI like being seen as creative, but I'd rather people compliment me on a specific work and show understanding of it.\nSimilarly with "unique personality". I'd rather that people show understanding of me and my personality. That is the bigger compliment.\n\n\n------------Edit-----------------\nI noticed this quote in one of /u/happy_crazy replies and it helped put other things into context:\n"I've noticed before personality types that prefer to offend people in certain situations, because they find those reactions entertaining. I suspected that wasn't the case with ESTJs but I put that option there anyways."\n\nAs an ESTJ, I like teasing people to get a reaction from them. I don't necessarily care whether the reaction is good or bad. I like teasing people, though I tend to focus on people that I like. ISFPs will feign anger over my puns but ultimately enjoy it. They take my teasing in a similar way.\n\nSome ESTJs take this to arguing and will troll people in order to get a strong reaction from them in order to prove their argument wrong. This is an extension of our teasing behavior but tends to be more destructive.
1	1\) i. I don't know why I'd ever feel good about hurting someone's feelings. I do hurt people's feelings accidentally sometimes, but I'm not *trying* to do it. If I agree with my statement and think it needs to be said, I'll feel bad about it but I won't take it back.\n\n2\) i or iii. Whether or not I like the person is irrelevant, but if they're generally an insensitive person towards others I won't feel guilty immediately \(unless it's *really* personal\). I'll be interested to hear their response and piece together if they're aware they do the same thing, but if they feel very hurt, I'll obvious have a little bit of guilt. If I don't like them but they are sensitive towards others, I'll feel bad no matter what. It's not their fault I don't like them, they didn't deserve that.\n\n3\) I prefer kind and incompetent people in my personal life but unkind and competent people to work with. \n\nBonus question\) Yes, I like receiving all of those compliments, the "creative" one not as much as the others. It A\) sounds kind of sarcastic \(obviously you don't mean it in that way, though\) and B\) I feel the word "creative" has lost some of its value. It's either "you're dumb, but you drew that picture kind of alright that one time I guess" or "you're very unimpressive but to me you seem impressive because I have no idea what I'm talking about". I like the other compliments because I like to stand out, probably in a competitive way. I want to be known for doing something, and I'm not going to be known for doing something if I'm just like everyone else.
1	Sometimes it's about taking a grenade, throwing it in a room, shutting the door and walking away. I love ESTJs. check this vid out: https://youtu.be/rKEbXXbsb7k

1	It is really hard to answer these with out any form of context. \n\nFor example the choice of who I‚Äôm upsetting is confusing to start with. I may say something that upsets any one of those individuals should I assume the question is asking about frequency as in which of those categories of individual I speak with most and are most likely to upset or upset most?\n\nTo the next question the issue is similar that with a lack of context the question seems to be about frequency. It becomes problematic in that the answers are answering conflated questions, first whether or not you consciously say upsetting things in a binary sense and then a minimal response to how I feel about it. I could not really answer the question because I both consciously and unconsciously say upsetting things to all categories of people and I might feel good or bad about it depending on what was said to whom and why. 
1	I'm a female ESTJ and have been told I have decent empathy "levels". There's always what I really want to say (super blunt and direct) and what I actually say (sometimes blunt and direct, sometimes watered way down). I make this determination based on the other person's sensitivity level/personality type, my respect for them as a person, and what level of peace the environment demands. When I'm talking to my ISTP friend, I'm super direct but respectful. When i'm talking to my ISFP friend, I try to word it more sensitively but am still honest. When I'm talking to an ENTP boss that I dislike, I'll stay "appropriate" but won't sugarcoat anything or be too passive. \n\nI feel free and unchecked when I am speaking with healthy ISTPs, ESTPs, ISTJs, INTPs, INTJs, and even some ISFPs.
2	ESTJs (especially female), do you do anything different around people you‚Äôre interested in?	I really like an ESTJ (51% extrovert, 49% introvert), but I‚Äôm not good (at all) at picking up social cues. I just wanted to have some pointers to look out for, and perhaps help indicate whether or not I should just move on. Thank you! 
7	Typically, I take my time to get to know them and figure out what their relationship status is so I can decide if they‚Äôre a good candidate for me or not. Then when I‚Äôve decided, I either ask them out on a date or just stay mates. \n\nDoesn‚Äôt everyone do this?
6	Yeah same I really make an effort to get to know them so I can see if they have partner potential before I get my emotions involved.  
6	If I‚Äôm interested in someone, I make no bones about it and will make the first move. If I‚Äôm not interested, I will tolerate a person but actively be closed off to them so as not to lead them on. It‚Äôs very obvious when I like/don‚Äôt like being around someone. 
3	As someone mentioned below, I make an effort to get to know them and sort of suss out the good/bad/potential partner quality or comparability. Therefore, in true ESTJ fashion I tend to value traditional dating habits and planned dates that allow for conversation. I also am a traditionalist and do not tend to make the first move when it comes to things such as defining what's going on, but I will drop hints. I work a fair amount and keep a busy schedule, but if I am interested in a guy I will make a concerted effort to text back in a timely way, if I have to cancel plans I always offer an alternate date, etc. 
1	If you can have a conversation with them, especially 1-on-1, and the conversation is easy and natural, that's really good.\n\nESTJ's will respond to your criticism about yourself with support.\n\nAs a male ESTJ, I'll ask questions about your interests and try to get you to talk about something that you care about deeply. It doesn't matter too much what it is.
1	Just make them comfy, state what you want, make them feel good about themselves by saying you think highly of them and provide examples of why. Watch this vid: https://youtu.be/rKEbXXbsb7k
3	estj as a boss at work = extermination of a lawyer or a need to look for a new job?	check that:\n\n Type Four‚ÄîLevels of Development\n\nHealthy Levels\n\nLevel 1 (At Their Best): Profoundly creative, expressing the personal and the universal, possibly in a work of art. Inspired, self-renewing and regenerating: able to transform all their experiences into something valuable: self-creative.\n\nLevel 2: Self-aware, introspective, on the "search for self," aware of feelings and inner impulses. Sensitive and intuitive both to self and others: gentle, tactful, compassionate.\n\nLevel 3: Highly personal, individualistic, "true to self." Self-revealing, emotionally honest, humane. Ironic view of self and life: can be serious and funny, vulnerable and emotionally strong.\n\nAverage Levels\n\nLevel 4: Take an artistic, romantic orientation to life, creating a beautiful, aesthetic environment to cultivate and prolong personal feelings. Heighten reality through fantasy, passionate feelings, and the imagination.\n\nLevel 5: To stay in touch with feelings, they interiorize everything, taking everything personally, but become self-absorbed and introverted, moody and hypersensitive, shy and self-conscious, unable to be spontaneous or to "get out of themselves." Stay withdrawn to protect their self-image and to buy time to sort out feelings.\n\nLevel 6: Gradually think that they are different from others, and feel that they are exempt from living as everyone else does. They become melancholy dreamers, disdainful, decadent, and sensual, living in a fantasy world. Self-pity and envy of others leads to self-indulgence, and to becoming increasingly impractical, unproductive, effete, and precious.\n\nUnhealthy Levels\n\nLevel 7: When dreams fail, become self-inhibiting and angry at self, depressed and alienated from self and others, blocked and emotionally paralyzed. Ashamed of self, fatigued and unable to function.\n\nLevel 8: Tormented by delusional self-contempt, self-reproaches, self-hatred, and morbid thoughts: everything is a source of torment. Blaming others, they drive away anyone who tries to help them.\n\nLevel 9: Despairing, feel hopeless and become self-destructive, possibly abusing alcohol or drugs to escape. In the extreme: emotional breakdown or suicide is likely. Generally corresponds to the Avoidant, Depressive, and Narcissistic personality disorders.

2	An ESTJ likes me, help ‚ù§	Hello! \n\nI need some advice about a coworker who I believe is an ESTJ for a couple of reasons:\n\n- He has a strong presence. As in I sense the dominance and I'm just a little marshmallow. üòÇüëçüèª\n\n- He's very articulate in the way he speaks. I asked him once, "How was your weekend?" And he said, "It was pretty uneventful." I like his word choices though. Also when he talks to people, he's so smooth. The way he can add on to the conversations so easily, I'm shocked. \n\n- His facial expressions can be very... serious. Like he's a serious person.\n\n- He said he didn't believe in ghosts. Okay this one isn't really a trait lol but just wanted to add it in as in he has strong beliefs?\n\n*I thought he could be an ESFJ, but I don't see him as a feeler.\n\nThis is what I need help with:\n\nI've noticed he's taken a liking to me. It really became clear when he asked me about my future goals and rarely anybody ask me questions about me so I was flattered. The way he tries to compose himself with this serious persona but I know he's a bit nervous talking to me. I accidentally flirted with him out of nervousness and shyness of him liking me lol. I hope I not giving him missignals because I'm unsure of my feelings of him.\n\nBut at least he laughs at my jokes lolol. üëçüèª\n\nI'm an ENFP (sometimes I feel like an INFP but idk anymore) and I can't decide to pursue him or not. I've found I dont do quite well with ESTJ/ISTJ's but for some reason I like how he's so grounding and the way he makes me calm. Like I'm going to his level of energy in a way? \n\nAlso, he's transferring in a month and I don't know if I should make something out of it or not. üòï
5	I'm an ENFP(m) dating an ESTJ(f) for 5 years now. Though it has its challenges, it is absolutely worth it. Like talking about anything touchy, feely is very hard for her. On the othere hand, there is a very easy open communication possible between us, which makes things great. Her absolute \n stability is great when I'm being chaotic again. And ESTJ's are great at helping you make choices, which can be hard as ENFP.\n\nSo be open, honest and blunt with him, he'll appreciate it. Just ask him out and see where it goes :), he will probably fall for your childish charm ;)! 
3	Ask him out on a date. Be honest and direct with him.
1	Does this vid sound like your ESTJ interest? https://youtu.be/rKEbXXbsb7k
7	Question about ESTJ dating	I recently met an ESTJ. We have gone on two dates, both of which were good. He was very warm and sweet. He does work very long hours, and the last two times we had planned to meet again, he had to cancel the night before due to increased workload. I was a bit disappointed because I had cleared my schedule for the dates.\n\nIf it were anybody else, I'd think "work" is just an excuse to get out of a date. But given that he's an ESTJ and I know you guys work a ton, I thought he really is just soooo busy.\n\nBut wouldn't you ESTJs prioritize dating if it.were someone you were really interested in? I myself am a busybee, so I get it but don't get it. Haha\n\nAny feedback please?
9	I'm an ESTJ woman. For me, if a work thing comes up it will take priority. However, if I am interested in the person I will indicate it by offering another time I am free. If I am not interested, I will just keep pushing it back due to work till the hint is received.
6	I‚Äôd say let it happen this time, and let them reschedule. If it happens again, boy bye üëãüèº\nESTJ or not, he needs to put in the effort because you‚Äôre worth it.
6	Work over dating. Doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not important, but ESTJ likes to be the leader of what they do, so they‚Äôre always wanting to go the extra mile.
6	Did he suggest rescheduling, or otherwise act enthusiastic about seeing you again? If so, then it's just garden-variety ESTJ workaholism. \n\nI'm better about taking personal time than I used to be, but I'm still not tryna slip up at work, no matter how much I like someone. 
1	Make the ESTJ comfy, always ask them what they feel. Always share your thoughts (not your feelings) and always state what you want so there is nothing left to interpretation. Do not ask ESTjs what they want. Use this vid for reference: https://youtu.be/rKEbXXbsb7k
6	Do demonstrations of Fi make you smile?	Asking because when my ESTJ friend does Te things like send me a long bullet-pointed list of what he learned at a meeting/class via text, it makes me chuckle and shake my head. So it got me wondering if there are things I do as an INFP that make him react the same way. He's already told me I make him smile often, but at what I'm not sure (since we've only communicated by text/phone so far).
13	Honestly, I just love how true INFPs are to themselves.  They are weird and do things that don't really make a lot of sense, but I love it, I absolutely love it.\n\nMy favorite kinds of people are people who know who they are and make no apologies for it. An INFP is almost always just that.  \n\nMy INFP is a vegan and animal lover. It's a passion of hers, and sometimes she does things that make me roll my eyes and I might make fun of her for it, but she continues being herself.  You rarely find people who are like that, they either get aggressive because you don't agree with them, or they change a part of who they are to try and please you.  \n\nA lot of people might think ESTJ and INFP is a poor match, but I love everything about INFPs.  They are weird and a bit strange and I don't want to be like them, but I want people like that in my life.  I want people who are different from me.  \n\nYou also have huge hearts and your feels are the best.  \n\nI went through a really rough patch a few years back.  It was the worst year of my life, and my INFP was amazing through all of it.  She would go to the coffee shop with me and we would get Mochas and then go watch the sunset at the beach. She would stay up super late and watch TV with me and we would make french fries together.  All of those things are just small simple acts of kindness, but it meant the world to me.  She never once made me feel like crap, not the way everyone else in my life did.  She wasn't trying to help me, she was just being a friend, just being there for me, and it meant the world to me.  \n\nI have a hard time expressing how I feel about people, especially when it's directly to them, and every time I do she makes sure to rub it in my face and make me feel all awkward, but I'm okay with it.  I know I'm awkward when it comes to showing affection.  \n
2	Where do you INFPs find these ESTJ guys? So lucky. I'm an INFP and can't find one lol. I'd love to have an ESTJ friend.

4	INFP & Extraverted Thinking	Hello! I'm an INFP and I'm looking to develop my Extraverted Thinking function. I'm coming near the end of my first year of college, which I've really enjoyed so far, and exams are starting in just over a month. While I have found some methods that help me to stay on track and get things done, such as using timetables and to-do lists, I sometimes find it difficult to stick to them. Would you have any advice or tips that would help me utilise Te more effectively? Thank you in advance!
6	It's hard to see if it's even possible for you to use Te in a way that'll make you stick to timetables and such. I'm INFP too. I don't see Te as being like an ESTJ but weaker, I see it as being INFP. I think we do use Te in a different way. And I'm actually sure there are moments when we care so much we will execute something in a very ESTJ way. I don't know what ESTJs will tell you but I will tell you that you will do something when your Fi allows it. So you have to figure out a way to get your Fi to make you stick to those schedules. But who knows maybe I'm wrong and developing Te is how we will become more organised. 
3	It‚Äôs a tough one. I know for me to use Fi productively out in the world, I have to be in a pretty hands-off headspace. Otherwise my Te is looking to Fix Everything and fixing things with Fi is how you get that classic delta dictator tantrum. \n\nPerhaps it might be easiest (safest) to pair it with Si. For example, my day starts with a list of all the things I‚Äôd like to accomplish and then a time table to figure out what I actually can get done and the most efficient order. So, like, if shower and run are on the list, it makes more sense to run first, then shower. 
3	The best way to develop your Te (rationale) is two things:\n\n1. Read non-fiction (I am not even kidding, this is how famous people like Gary Vaynerchuk and Tai Lopez developed their Te child as they are both ENFPs)\n\n2. Don't be afraid of what others think of you.\n\nWatch this vid for reference: https://youtu.be/rZJhg9R1Gag
2	Big 5 Correlations (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ESTJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESTJ) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance! (see below for more info)\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.

I think it's because I select relatively high in some categories like "I criticise other people", but I'm really just doing that in a fun, silly teasing way)\n\nNeuroticism - 46% (a lot of people would probably agree I should've scored *higher* in this, they tend to think I'm very anxious and worrying. I'm actually not that anxious or worried, though, I just come off that way because I'm a super contingency-planner and tend to think of a lot of negative things, but it doesn't worry me too much, I get worried when I *don't* consider possibilities)\n\nCore patterns of thinking ranked:\n\n1. Analytical thinker\n2. Empathic idealist (only slightly below 1)\n3. Logical mechanic (waaaaay below 2)\n4. Practical caretaker (only slightly below 3)\n\nIf I had to personally rank them, I'd probably also start with Analytical Thinker, but then next up would be Practical Caretaker. I'm very much a practical person when it comes to helping people, more in a Te way than a Si or Fi way though. Logical Mechanic doesn't sound too much like me because I pretty much question every solution put in front of me until everyone else wants to kill themselves, and Empathic Idealist just doesn't capture any of me at all.\n\nAlright, that's all the data I get with the free report.

3	ESTJ in love with INTP	I'm an ESTJ in love with an INTP. The more I think about it the more I realize I am just in love with the person I'm when I'm with the INTP and don't really appreciate any characteristics of the INTP. Do other ESTJ feel the same in their relationship?
1	Hey. I'm an ESTJ/ENTJ. My partner is an ISTP. Knowing this helps me understand their needs better. I try not to get too hung up in the labels. My partners ethics/values/morals and behaviours are all ones that I value in a person. We share common opinions on important life choices. If your partner makes you a better person that sounds good to me. I, personally, am not with my partner because I need them but rather because I want them so I may not be able to relate to your exact situation. It sounds like your saying you might love how this person makes you feel more than the person themselves?\n
1	If you feel the love there is nothing about an INTP that should be a reason not to love them. They must be a good person. And considering the MBTI, you would just make each other better people because you are quite different. Love is love. You wouldn't have felt it if it wasn't something worth going for.
1	I‚Äôm an INTP having difficulty with a friendship to an ESTJ. What are some of the things you like best about the relationships dynamic with the INTP? I would like to incorporate that into my approach with them if possible, try new angles of understanding and bonding. 
3	Do you know your enneagram type? If so, what is it?	https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions/\n\n
3	1w2 here
2	8w7 tritype 863
2	8 wing 7
2	Arguing between 3w2 and 3w4. I think 358 for tritype. I've also been told I'm 315 by others. 
2	8w7
1	3w2 and my tritype is 358\n\n
1	1w2, tritype is probably 136 (does order matter? If so, 6 may be more dominant than 3, but 3 sounds more likely).
1	1w2
5	Could you be comfortable with a feeler as a friend? Lover? Coworker? Etc.	Interested in hearing the ESTJ perspective. Do people who are in touch with their emotional side make you uncomfortable or does it balance you out? (not to say only feelers are)\n\nOptional question: does it make a difference if they use Fi or Fe?
6	Of course! Just because we don't base important decision making on what might feel good in the moment, ESTJ's have emotions and feelings too. We're not robots.
5	I like high Fi-users generally. In my friendship group, despite most of them being Fe-users, the ones I get along with best are an ENFP, INFP, ISFP and ESFP. My best friend who I grew up with is an ISFJ, but he has some strong T-traits, probably because a lot of people he hung out with when he was growing up were dominant-Thinkers. However, a lot of our relationship hinges on our past, I don't know if I'd become friends with him again if I forgot who he was. \n\nGenerally, I find communication with FPs quite easy, I just keep heavy decisions away from them. FJs I can become frustrated with. ENFJs, and particularly ESFJs, I can often connect with on the grounds that we're both often Type-A, assertive people, but I don't feel energised hanging out with them, I feel like the conversation is forced and there isn't the same level of openness I find with FPs. I feel like I'm monitoring what I say around FJs, but FPs I can say what's on my mind.\n\nBut yeah, I can absolutely feel comfortable with Feeler friends, FPs more so than FJs, I just might get frustrated with their decision-making and such.
5	If they can explain why they feel that way, open to my questions, and able to have a discussion about it, then nope, no issues. \n\nIt's the ones that yell that it's how they feel that I don't like dealing with. 
4	I have so many feeler friends and I love them all. \n\nMy best friend is INFP and I‚Äôve never met someone more kind than her. When I was going through a rough patch she was the best friend someone could ask for. She understands people in a way I just can‚Äôt. \n\nMy dad is ESTJ and my mom is INFP. They are going on 30 years strong. My mom is a really strong feeler and is dramatic at times and my dad handles it really well. \n\nI‚Äôm dating an INTP but I feel like he‚Äôs way more in touch with his feelings than I am. \n\nI‚Äôm not really affectionate but with my INTP i really am. I love physical touch which probably surprises people because if it‚Äôs not him I don‚Äôt want anyone touching me. \n\nI have no problem with feelers. They usually see things from a different perspective and I think everyone needs that. \n\n
5	[deleted]
3	As an INFP, I don't think my feeleriness makes my ESTJ friend uncomfortable. He personally wants someone who enjoys cuddling (not that Ts don't, since he's a T himself), who's passionate both in bed and out of bed about something, who understands people and is better at reading them than he is, and is better at making Fi-based decisions (i.e. someone who has a strong sense of personal taste as his is all over the place, then his job is to execute it).
1	Personally, feelers make me generally uncomfortable in all aspects. I don't know how to communicate with them and honestly get frustrated if the situation isn't logical. 
1	I have a close friend that is Fe, often we don‚Äôt understand each other‚Äôs motivation but we‚Äôre still close despite that. I believe we‚Äôre only close because I‚Äôve reached a point in my life where I‚Äôm ok revealing my vulnerability, it wouldn‚Äôt not have been possible earlier in my life. \n\nAs for coworkers, I‚Äôm management at my job and it‚Äôs a small independent business, only one above me is the manager who is Te so we get along fine. I‚Äôve never bothered to type the underlings. \n\nI don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd deal with a feeler for a lover. \n\n
1	I like them as friends and co-workers.  I appreciate their interpersonal skills.  My first husband was a pretty toxic INFP (not that all INFPs are toxic, but this guy sure is), so I don't know if I'd date a Feeler again, but anything's possible, I guess. 
1	What do you mean by feeler? Fe or Fi? INFJs are technically thinkers fyi... https://youtu.be/EMPRsQwIJEw\n\n

3	ESTJ's of the world - what kinds of compliments motivate you most?	
17	when someone says i cant do something, fuck them i can do it
11	lmao, people saying they want to be called "alpha" is so weird and bordering on pathetic.\n\nFor me, I guess I like being complimented on whatever I put effort into. It's nice to receive validation for my hard work.
10	Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male. Jackhammer. Merciless. Insatiable.
8	No compliment motivates me. That said, the compliments, which stroke my ego the most, are:\n\ntough, determined, ambitious, alpha, leader, competent, honest
7	Appreciating my intellect.
3	Same compliments don‚Äôt motivate me, but I do love hearing that my work was amazing and that I‚Äôm a total badass
9	Suggestions for ways to make an ESTJ's day.	I (24m, ENFP) am dating an ESTJ (19f) and would like to do some small things every now and then to make her day. The problem is, being an almost opposite personality means that I have no clue what kind of things she would really like. Any suggestions? I'm thinking just small things like a note or small gift once in a while.
15	Do small things. She probably likes structure and schedules so do what you can to give her a smoother day. Don't surprise her with big things or trips out of nowhere. She'll appricate it greatly.
5	We're just new friends but for his 40th bday, I sent my ESTJ a care package of interesting treats and a pair of novelty socks that said "Natural Born Asshole". He really liked it and even wore the socks to his certification exam for good luck (and got a 98/100). Also, he loves receiving and sending pictures by text for some reason. But he's a dude so YMMV. 
1	I recommend watching this video, it provides some tips:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rKEbXXbsb7k
1	I work with an awesome ESTJ, and I think I made her freaking day by offering to do a small task for her which I was dressed appropriately for (it was outside work, a SUPER hot day and I was already dressed down to move dirty boxes all day) and she wasn't.\n\nHonestly as an INTJ this would have made my day too.  
2	Fi & Fe	
3	Probably would've made for a stronger post if you didn't only use fictional examples.\n\nAlso, you can't just "develop" a function. You can try putting yourself in a situation where it needs to be used, but in the end, you're probably just going to be emulating that function rather than actually using it. You could argue that it could be developed by surrounding yourself with high Fi-users, but it's not indicative of very high Fi to surround yourself with fake-friends for the sake of achieving a practical goal as efficiently as possible...\n\n> Plus, Fi and Fe can do some seemingly superhuman things. Did you know monks who are able to punch with the force of a mid-sized car going 20 miles an hour are actually using their Fi as a driving force behind their Te to do this?\n\nYou're gonna need to back that up a little bit. Either way, it's not like you can say that a monk's motivation comes exclusively from Fi. The functions are not objective, biological brain functions, what function someone is using is up for debate.\n\nAll my other points aside, you've come to this subreddit before and strongly criticised ESTJs, going as far to say that they're "indoctrinated". Although I did appreciate how in your previous post about ESTJs you admitted it might be difficult for you to "recognize ESTJs from Gen Y and Z", you might need to apologise if you're planning to come here and boss people around.
4	ESTJs and how they use their Ne	What are some ways you use Ne? \n\nSome ways I've observed in my ESTJ friend:\n\n- Vivid sensory descriptions\n- Humor, puns, wit\n- Playful flirting, innuendos\n- Sexual - Roleplay, D/s heavy sexting :P\n\nSo far, mostly when he's in a relaxed mood. 
4	When I'm working on a project, it's primarily used to serve Te. I'll come up with a bunch of ideas, and Te will say "yes, that could work" or "no, that's unrealistic". It also helps find possible ways that things could go wrong, so I can make sure to plan for all possibilities (seriously, I'm like the ultimate contingency planner).\n\nAround my NP friends, particularly NFP friends, is when it's most developed. I really like exploring different conceptual possibilities and ideas for recreational purposes, just following a trail of thought and see where it goes. However, I become stressed if I have something practical that needs to get done, so this is limited to recreation.\n\nI really like learning new things and just educating myself, but I think it's in a more Te and Si way than a Ne way. That being said, lately, I've become a little obsessed with [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/MindYourDecisions/featured) Youtube channel, which just has a bunch of different math problems to work through with often very creative and elegant solutions (ignore their most popular videos, however, they're mostly clickbait and cash-grabs). Although I've always done well at math in school and such, I've never really been forced to try thinking of creative, novel solutions to problems, and I think it's really challenging and pushing my Ne. Also, if you go down the rabbit hole of math problems like I did, ignore the narcissistic twelve-year-olds in the comment sections.\n\nI think that's about it. Obviously, I use Ne more than that in my life, but I think those are the most common uses.
4	Well, since it's our tertiary function, ESTJs are sort of tardy to the party on Ne because we don't typically start developing it until we're adults. So, as an ESTJ who knows some Ns, I'm well aware that their intuitive abilities are way ahead of mine. \n\nThat being said. based on personal observations, Ne works with our Si, because we are pretty good at logging concrete facts and experiences, and when you notice multiple instances of similar things occurring, Ne connects them and helps you see the patterns in play and figure out the commonalities and why these things occur. \n\nFor example, Ne makes me pretty good at learning languages, because I can pick up on common root words and grammatic similarities between them. \n\nOn a more abstract level, I believe it helps us ESTJs develop people skills and empathy. We're not known for picking up people's emotional energy or understanding motivations that don't fall in line with our way of thinking. But when we see patterns of behavior, Ne can help us connect those to possible motivations in play beyond the ESTJ factory default of "This person just doesn't know what the Right Thing to do is. I shall tell them." (This goes about as well as you would think.)\n\nAlso, I'm funny as hell. Thanks, Ne! 
3	Yeah, I am an ESTJ and I can be pretty relaxed too. I can joke around a lot, usually off work or school, type of thing. Sometimes in school, the moment just when I am not trying to learn. I am currently in school and one my professor I think he‚Äôs ENTP think I am generally am pretty fun to be around. When he points out something I am good at making a joke sort of mocking it or making light of it. Usually when he‚Äôs not teaching or giving an opinion.\n\nProfessor: Well, I see the desks are really pushed back today.\nMe: Perhaps it‚Äôs like a stage. Maybe you could jump some hoops or dance for us? Hahahaha! Or something like, Yeah, good idea, pack us like sardines, maybe you can do something impressive up there Professor Savoie.\n\nOr professor Savoie: tells us something funny. I think someone was asking him something about if we need to tell him when we need to go to the bathroom and he shared with us a story where in elementary school they needed to tell the teacher publically whether they were going number 1 or number 2. And I started laughing.\nMe: hey, professor Savoie, don‚Äôt make me die laughing, now. I think I can do that. I think I am going to die of laughter here. You know my journalism class wouldn‚Äôt be very pleased with you.\nProfessor Savoie: Well, I haven‚Äôt seen anyone die laughing yet, You‚Äôd be the first.\nHahahahaha!\n\nI have to know you well though. There‚Äôs little examples like that.\n\nOh I am disabilied and we were talking and I reached over for the bell.\nJenny: You always come in here and find the bell and you have to mess with it.\nMe: yep, that‚Äôs right. I must.\nThere may have been more said, but victoria comes out.\nVictoria: Oh, I‚Äôve just come to see if you guys need help I heard the bell.\nMe: oh is that Victoria, hey!\nJenny: Oh it‚Äôs just Rachel ringing the bell she always finds it.\nVictoria: so is it just we have to hide the bell from Rachel. Is that it, is it that simple?\nMe: yep, that‚Äôs right, until I find it again. Hahahaha!\n\nOr I sometimes go in there and ask Sandra something like\nOh sandra have you have your dose of salt and pepper pork chops yet?\nSandra: Well, no not yet, \nSometimes it would be yes but pretend she said no\nMe: Oh, well, I think it‚Äôs about time isn‚Äôt it?? You‚Äôre addicted to that thing. I mean. You order it everytime you call that place and order it.\n\nOr It‚Äôs like\n\nMe: Hey sandra, I am going to the salt and pepper pork chop place, have you had your fill yet? Jealous yet?\nSandra: You have a way of tempting me. Hahaha!\n\nSo it depends.
3	It‚Äôs definitely more pragmatic Ne but I use it a lot, I have a bit of a TE-Ne loop.\n\n\nFirstly more expressly Ne, I write, journalism stuff and fanfiction, and creative writing, I am good at creative nonfiction. The journalism stuff the articles not so much the rest more so, especially fanfictions.\n\nAlso, possibilities is a bit one, as said by the other, thinking of all those ideas and trying to execute all of them. I am also a big person on going to make sure everything is working right, all the possibilities.\n\nI am also fairly good at coming up with different articles to write, topics to discuss on a podcast type of thing.
1	Wait, estjs? In a relaxed mood?
3	INTPs	How do you feel about INTPs? I haven't had the best experiences with ESTJs, although the ESTJs I've had were in their 40's if even that, were teachers, and were from Texas. The other ESTJs I've had...Let's just say they didn't seem fond of me...Also, what drove me nuts is the "I just don't get it." moments. They'd think I was rebellious in the same manner as an ISTP...Last I checked, I don't think INTPs exactly fit the greaser type...\n\nIt may be hard for me to recognize ESTJs from Gen Y and Z since A. I live in Texas and B. Gen Y and Z are VERY different.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think I've ever met an ENTJ either, but surprisingly, I've met a few INFJs. I've only come across one INTP, and that was through cyberschool.
7	Did you finally manage to ask how we see the world, instead of forcing a narrative (or accusation) on us? Congratulations (I guess) and it took you what, weeks? I probably should not complain, at least you learn.\n\nTo answer your question: I like INTP(s), for the most part. The ones I have met personally are insightful, humorous  and witty. Although sometimes I want to shout at them things like "Speak up more" and "Stop drinking so much" and "Instead of complaining about your problems, how about you try to solve them".\n\nSometimes I wish I could order people to have a good and fulfilling life.
3	I am in a relationship with an INTP.  A solid relationship, he is probably one of the very few people I have felt close to.  We can talk about anything and everything and the conversations are never dull.  He isn't afraid to call me out when I'm being dumb and I can be myself, and often times a little extra and he doesn't mind it one bit.  \n\nI am very forward and honest about what I think and he always compliments me on that, and I've probably spent my whole life being criticized for it.  \n\nMy brother is also an INTP and we were always the closest.  I've always felt that INTPs got me in a way that others don't.  Even had a best friend from high school that was INTP and we got along really well.  \n\nI have no complaints about INTPs.  Sometimes Y'all seem a bit lost in thought and can be a little spacey, but it doesn't really bother me.  
2	My best friend is INTP. I've also met other INTPs in my daily life. \n\nThey're generally very reasonable people and I appreciate them for all they are. They're also the only ones who get my physics jokes, so 10/10 would find an INFP and ESFJ to high five and annihilate again. 
1	I like INTP but I am not sure what they think of me. My favorite math instructor is INTP but I went to him and asked him one too many questions. This other person online I know is INTP. We‚Äôre thinking of meeting up when she comes over from Denmark in november for a friends wedding. She was the one who retyped me for ESTJ.\n\n
3	ESTJ & ghosting	ESTJs seem to be very direct. Why would they have reason to ghost someone? Wouldn't they just be up front? 
8	Overall you're correct.  I've ghosted people without meaning to because I got distracted by stuff that I find more interesting.  My ENFJ wife calls me an "accidick" when I do stuff like that.
3	I usually don't actively ghost someone (in fact I don't remember any case). What sometimes happens is, that I become so preoccupied with other things, that I forget a person for a short while.\n\n 
3	I've never ghosted, it is a very immature way of avoiding confrontation. \n\nThat being said, I have confronted guys who ghosted me and felt no shame in doing so.  You're an adult, a grown ass adult, and if you can't handle telling someone you aren't interested, I will absolutely confront you about it.\n\nI have a really hard time when I'm not given closure, I just sit and wonder what the hell happened, and I'm aware I was ghosted, but I usually want answers.  And a few of the guys who did ghost me, came back as if nothing had happened, I absolutely gave them a piece of my mind.  \n\n
2	I've been dating someone for a year (no relationship label but we each aren't seeing anyone else) and besides him always being very busy with full-time work and military commitments, things had been okay. I last saw him/heard from him almost 3 weeks ago when he dropped off a Valentine's Day gift. \n\nI admitted to him that I was falling for him. A few days later when I asked if he'd like to see me, he said he was busy with work for the next two days. That is the last I've heard from him. Initially, I asked if he wanted to come stay over. Then I asked if he needed space. It's been 3 weeks. He has dropped all communication. Not responding to my calls, no texts-- nothing. If he were caught off guard by my admission, I understand and I'd even be okay if he said it's not going to work out. Something is better than nothing, which is why I always believed they (at least with my ESTJ) were direct. I feel like I've just been ghosted.\n\nI have reached out a couple of times letting him know that he's hurt me by disappearing the way he did and if he were so busy, I'd understand but I just wanted to be sure he was okay. After what appears as intentional ignoring on his part, yesterday I text that this was my final message, it wouldn't work out for me and whatever this was is done. No response.\n\nI understand very much that ESTJs get busy and even avoid  "emotional" talks, but I don't understand this behavior. Am I overreacting for feeling so bad?  Thank you. - ISFJ
2	The ESTJ I've been getting to know is very upfront about his thoughts on ghosting: he doesn't want others to do it to him, and he won't do it to them. He has told me that if he meets someone he'd prefer to pursue, he will tell me (or whoever else) honestly that he'd like to stay friends but the flirty gestures will have to stop. And that's what he'd want me to do as well. \n\nHe says he does something called "go dark" which is not quite as rude as ghosting per se... if he's interested in someone specifically but things aren't official yet, he'll respond to others but not initiate with them. And he's a pretty consistent initiator, at least in the beginning.
1	What‚Äôs ghosting anyway? Maybe it‚Äôs a new jargon I haven‚Äôt heard of.
5	What does an ESTJ really want when they command someone to do something?	Do they:\n\nA) really just want someone to say Yes and do it without question?\n\nB) want a back and forth discussion until ESTJ convinces other party to do x?\n\nC) want someone to stand up to them and actually do their own thing as long as they have their own reasons?\n\nD) think they're just being playfully bossy?\n\n\nAs the ESTJ gets into a more intimate and involved relationship (ex. cohabitation, marriage), do their expectations of how someone should respond to their orders change?
17	A. The "Yes" is optional, I just want whatever it is fk'in done.
8	Mostly A., but I'll accept C. if there's solid logic behind it or something I hadn't considered. \n\nOccasionally D., if you're close friends/family. \n\nOption B sounds like some NF madness. No thank you. 
8	What I want is for the person to see how all of the things are fitting together and playing out in my head so that they understand and can fill in the things I‚Äôve missed or be able to point out potential problems without me having to take the time to explain everything. \n\nBecause that‚Äôs not always possible, I usually try to explain the why of a thing as succinctly as I can so that they can go do A because they get it, B because they can help implement a better process or C because they understand the pitfalls I‚Äôm already trying to avoid and can do it however it works best for them as long as the outcome is the same. I don‚Äôt respect someone for fighting with me just to bash egos. I do respect someone speaking up if they see a better way. As long as that ‚Äòbetter way‚Äô isn‚Äôt about my delivery because damnit, I‚Äôm trying! I have the most respect for people who can see through my abruptness and don‚Äôt hold it against me. 
3	I don't like A, it often means they don't know why they're doing it, which means they'll probably be worse at it. I want them to get the thought process. \n\nB is usually good. Feels satisfying, the other person gets why I'm doing it, no worries. I'll get frustrated under desperate time constraints, however.\n\nC is dodgy as shit, but I'd rather they do their own thing if what I'm suggesting is incorrect. However, I'd rather they convince me of that first, if it's objectively right, I don't see why they couldn't convince me. If I'm literally incapable of understanding something, however, such as if I'm in a field totally out of my expertise, C is fine (I'll probably be pissed off until they prove me wrong though, lol).\n\nI've become more D as of late, but if it's a serious situation that actually matters, I try to avoid D (unless they're complying, in which case it's a morale booster). I like having silly arguments, but I draw the line eventually.\n\nNote that I'm not always bossing people around, this just applies to when I *am* bossing people around. Okay, I'm bossing people around a lot, but it's mostly all in good fun, lol.
3	C. I actually love when people stand up to me.  My ESTJ dad was always the same way, and I think the reason we always were close was that I was one of the only kids who didn't blindly follow every order I was given.  \n\nPeople who are able to stand up and speak their mind are my favorite kinds of people. It tells me you can probably handle yourself, and I won't have to worry about you.\n\nI don't have a lot of people in my life that I command to do anything.  I usually say what needs to be done, and almost always just do it myself.  I guess for jobs where I was a supervisor, I expected people to know what to do.  I am very clear about what needs to be done and what your job entails so I shouldn't have to remind you every damn day.  If I do make an order, I would expect you to do it.\n\nBut in everyday life with friends and other people, I don't make a ton of orders, unless it's an idea about something.  
2	Usually a and C. C if it‚Äôs good can gain my respect. It has to be good and legitimate. It requires of proof. B sounds very ENTP. Hahaha! If there‚Äôs a good reason, maybe a little, but eventually, I will have to say get to it. I hope it‚Äôs in the spirit of C though.\n\n
2	ESTJs in public relations or the media?	Are these good fits for ESTjs? Especially public relations (pr?) \n\nIs any ESTJS a media worker or works in PR?
1	Suitability will vary from role to role, but generally, type doesn't matter when coming down to skill in any particular role. However, good leadership skills, communication abilities, ability to make decisions under pressure and a generally logical thinking pattern are valued skills in most roles, which are often traits assigned to ESTJs. They don't necessarily apply to you, but chances are they do.
1	I don‚Äôt work in PR, but do work in a media agency. Everyone pushes and is excited by innovative, out of the box projects, just for the sake of being splashy and different, even if it isn‚Äôt the best use of budget. You have to be accepting of needing to do things that are inefficient or ineffective just because the client wants it. A lot of big brainstorm sessions made me feel out of place, critiquing everyone else‚Äôs big ideas while not really coming up with my own. Leadership, communication, organization, and being detail oriented made me good at the job, but I found it exhausting after a while. Most people I know working there are NTs or NFs (though I find NFs also find it unfulfilling after a while). I switched into an operations role in the agency and am much happier leading more of the logistics, improving processes, managing the portfolio, training new members, and making sure everyone is doing their job correctly and systems are running smoothly. I like being in the media world while being on the periphery outside of the people who are there looking for a creative outlet.
1	I am completely lost for what to do!!!!	A few things you need to know first:\nConservative\n\nChristian\n\nESTJ 1w9 3w4 6w7 so/sp\n\nI think I am on the order of very extroverted. Very outspoken conservative I am very conservative. fundamental Christian, that‚Äôs the closest I could think of to describe Christianity. \n\nI live in California.\n\nIn recent weeks, I‚Äôve been viciously attacked in my political science class and a short time as the school‚Äôs political correspondent. As a 1w9 I feel I am a bit of a social changer, trying to perfect society, reform type of person. I am also very extroverted so I am not shy at all in voicing these views. My ISFJ teacher probably SP variant instict has been attacked too, but I feel more in danger because I loudly defend him and stand up for my views. It‚Äôs not like I can help it. I tell myself, not to, I semi-regret opening my mouth, but feel like I should. I open it or raise my hand naturally. \n\nIf they were polite about things it would be different but these people are antagonistic, and on the attack. They get on my last nerves. I feel my 1w9 so and ESTJ just feels like speaking and telling them that their behavior is inappropriate. My SP stuff is arguing with that. I also currently fear my safety.\n\nFor example, last class, I went to drop a bunch of newspapers. A conversation started and I ended up lecturing them on what civil conversation and political debate was.\n\nAny suggestions? If I was to be less opened about it how? What of my learnt urges to speak up, to give an opinion, debate, answer questions?\n\nI also don‚Äôt get emotional, I feel like my FI has been triggered. Also,this type of situation make think I am some of introvert. I can upset and very to myself when I am not arguing with them or defending myself. I am like ultra cautious of myself, and don‚Äôt necessarily want to socialize. It‚Äôs pretty bad. I start feeling as if the world everyone could be like that. I also start to lose the ego in me. E.g. start to feel friendless, unappreciated, no one wants me. Ordinarily I am not like that. Occasionally mass drama can get me like this, but not as bad as this. 
8	MBTI is just a guide to assessing your motivations and how you interact with those around you. You seem to be trying to follow it like a formula and explain everything you do through it. That's not how it works.\n\nIf you're going to actively engage in controversial discussions with your classmates, be prepared for people to disagree with you. That has nothing to do with you being Christian or conservative, it's just part of life that people will disagree with each other sometimes. If you don't like the people in your class, socialize with different people (join a club, or hang out with people from church, etc.)\n\nNobody likes someone who is constantly defensive and arguing. That doesn't have to do with your MBTI or your religious/political leanings. Consider why you feel the need to constantly defend yourself and why you are afraid for your safety and if those are accurate concerns. On the other hand, some people are just dicks and are going to be rude and antagonistic for whatever reason, and that's not about you in particular it's just what they do. If you don't like someone, don't waste energy being around them and letting them antagonize you. 
4	Tbh, I only skimmed, but I think I get the gist. When Te-Fi  goes into an unhealthy place, it usually comes out as something like ‚Äòthe world should be (Te) the way I feel is right (Fi)‚Äô. Te gets dirty when it believes its Fi is fact. Fi gets dirty when it pushes its feelings onto other. That shitty ego-hit wanting-to-withdraw feeling is your Fi struggling with its perception of itself. Fi is a stubborn function, but in a healthy place, it remembers to allow others to have their own Fi, it leaves space for other people to be on their own path to betterment. Because Fi isn‚Äôt meant to be in charge of others; it‚Äôs meant to understand itself and leave others to do the same.
2	Don't regret standing up for what you believe in. Just don't be an asshole who "lectures" other students.
7	Which subtype of ESTJ are you? Sensory or Logical?	ESTJ subtypes:\n\n**ESTJ-Te** - The logical subtype seems impersonal, business-like, dry and correct in interaction. May look strict and unapproachable. Not inclined to make jokes, has a serious and constrained demeanor about him. Usually is not very talkative, but if his temper runs hot it's difficult to stop him. Direct and linear in behavior and conversation. Can be sharp and categorical in his judgments, due to which accumulates many problems of ethical nature. At another end of extreme, he may not say anything, but later build up grudges and hard feelings, and avoid interaction. Uncompromising and stubborn. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/7546-LSE-ESTj-Subtype-Discussion-and-Examples)\n\n**ESTJ-Si** - The sensory subtype is characterized by stability and high capacity for work. Usually energetic, he cannot sit without some task or activity, and waste his time in vain. Interested in new technologies within his field of occupation or study, knows how to adapt them to his needs. Impulsive, perseverant, and pushy, knows how to passionately persuade his partner. Demanding and strict, but sometimes gives in to persuasions. Has a sense of humor. His speech is gusty and emotional. Often, one can see a predisposing although a bit strained smile on his face. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/7546-LSE-ESTj-Subtype-Discussion-and-Examples)
4	I would say I'm more sensory. 
3	Sensory, for sure. I'm a little vain and love beautiful things, and my family laughs at the fact that for all my toughness and bluster, I will cry like a baby over corny things. I tend to act more like the logical type if I'm under pressure or worn down,  though. And I can hold on to a grudge like it's a winning lotto ticket. 
3	Sensory.
3	Logical.\n\nEven though I have to admit, that the description is not really flattering. But then again, which ESTJ description is?
3	My boss is a Logical ESTJ. He started his own company decades ago and he's a 1%er now. He collects antiques related to his line of business. He's very formal in attitude/appearance when he's in work mode, but inquisitive and surprisingly personable one-on-one, often with a playful sense of humor. Definitely a micromanager who insists on knowing and directing the minute details, which can be inefficient sometimes. He's the kind of guy who has an employee sit in his office, waiting half an hour when they could be doing other things in that time, while he grammar-nazis a document lol. He physically resembles a hawk or eagle, very intimidating at first glance. \n\nA guy I'm getting to know right now is Sensory ESTJ. This guy is an engineer, with a background in oil rigs. He looks like he enjoys sensory pleasures, he radiates warm energy whereas the Logical does not. His online profile had a list of requirements and disqualifiers (one of which is a woman who doesn't know or want to learn how to cook), certain sentences were in all caps. He wasn't afraid of saying something "politically incorrect"; he's traditional. When texting me, he is brash, bold, impulsive, commanding, sympathetic, impassioned (ex. when talking about politics), articulate, not shy, honest/matter-of-fact, and witty. I love that he lists off more descriptive words than necessary to cover all the bases, bc I do the same (Ne). In a pinch, he can match me for vivid sensory descriptions, as if there's a bit of a writer in him. \n\nHe's all about action, not talk. For example, I would say to the ESTJ: "You're better-looking than me!" and he would say: "Bullshit. Send me a pic of you, right now". I would say, "No, and that should be answer enough." And next thing I know, he's sent me a pic of himself saying "Me, right now. No makeup. On the floor. Putting together a ceiling fan. Now do it." (Despite my huge reservations, I eventually sent him a no-makeup photo too).      \n\nThey're both toweringly tall with deep voices. They're both pushy and demanding. They both work hard like crazy. \n\nAfter getting to know the Sensory ESTJ, I can't believe I ever thought ISTJ and ESTJ could be mistaken for each other. My ISTJ ex was like a silent immoveable mountain and let people come to him. The ESTJ approaches me like some kind of tornado and leaves me in a tizzy. ESTJ is the opposite of passive, as an INFP, interaction with him is intense, fast-moving, and totally takes over my space, where I have to really draw my boundaries and protest if need be. Also, compared to my ISTJ ex, the ESTJ isn't as generous with compliments. Where my ISTJ ex would say "You're so gorgeous!" this ESTJ will say of the same thing: "Very nice." There's a difference!
2	Sensory, for sure. That being said, I can become more like the logical subtype when under extreme pressure. I also wouldn't say I'm impulsive, I honestly think my tagline could be "not impulsive", but I agree with the rest.\n\nAll of that aside, the logical subtype sounds like a bit of a dickhead, I doubt many people will strongly identify with it.
2	I think I go more for sensory type.
2	I think my husband is the Si type... I'm an ENTP, so maybe that's why our relationship works against the odds (though Si is my inferior function). 
2	Probably logical. I can be somewhat in to talking, I am very high extroversion,. But the end thing is so accurate, I can then be really introverted too or threaten to talk to no one! I can work a lot too... and, I turn more sensory when I am more familiar with people. People are like she has a sense of humor? Hahahahaha!\n\n\nAnd to the other poster, Yeah, I think a lot of time, I am seen as a bit of a jerk. Very much so. I have some friends but only a few close ones. I honestly I intimidate too many to really be close. I am not usually emotionall unless you get me to relate to situations at the end of the post. At that I am not too outwardly emotional either.\n\n.
3	ESTJs, do you prefer not to text during work hours? Even during breaks or lunch?	
9	Dudes I text all day every day, I love the multitasking aspect. 
4	I just don't like texting in general, it's annoyingly slow. I'm a fast typer, but I still dislike not being able to immediately clarify what I say as to avoid misunderstanding. A conversation is much more than just the words spoken, and texting reduces so much nuance that I feel incapable of illustrating my point. I almost immediately lose interest in text conversations, I usually try to squirm out of them when people try to initiate them, sometimes literally just telling them "I hate text conversations, do you want to meet up?" That being said, I prefer texting to calling people when arranging things. I don't like my plans not being recorded somewhere.
2	Depends on who it is and what the conversation's about. 
1	I hate texting in general. Phone calls, too. \n\nI prefer eye contact.  \n
1	100% yes.\n\nIf I can ever call someone instead of text, I am doing that.
1	Update: The ESTJ in my life actually started texting me at work today! So, I guess this one does, sometimes. 
1	Depends on who it is, has to be very close. It also depends on how important, If I am in class and work needs to call or text that is absolutely first.
1	Does my boyfriend sound like an ESTJ?	My boyfriend has taken the 16 personalities quiz 3 times in about two years, his most recent type was an ESTJ. The time before this he was an ENTJ and the first time was an ESTJ again.\n\nIn our relationship he makes most of the decisions but it will depend on the situation. He will often ask me for my input with certain things. He's good at getting tasks completed and is organised. He has big dreams for the future and where he wants to work.\n\nWe often disagree about some things as he is a traditionalist in that way whilst I don't really care what other people think or do in their life. He sometimes has short term goals that can be unrealistic and doesn't listen to my advice until he's gone and experienced it and then realizes I told him initially sort of thing. He's no afraid to talk about the future with me and that's why we clicked Initally as we both could see a future together. I find he doesn't laugh at all my jokes, which upon some reading makes him seem more like an ESTJ.\n\nIf we have a conversation with a stranger he will always ask me afterwards if he said anything wrong, as there have been times where he gets too confrontational but doesn't realise it. He often says things such as he doesn't know why some people don't like me as I am kind to everyone. He's also the one to say sorry a lot and learns from his mistakes. He is caring and kind to me but not overly emotional and I can insult him without him taking it too seriously.\n\nIn every test I've done I always end up an INTP but it confuses me a little. I can be scared of the future and often rely on past experiences to learn and I usually just live my life as each day comes, I just have an idea of the person I'd like to be in the future. My boyfriend is always talking about the future and how I shouldn't be so afraid and says how good things will happen etc.\n\nWhat do you all think? And what are some ques I can look out for?
1	Not enough information.\n\nIs his line of reasoning more concrete or less? Does he like data and facts and seem to go by those?\n\nDo you know much about SI or NI? Can you tell which one he relates to more?

2	ESTJ needing help with too much work/overcommitment	Hey everyone! Hope you are well!!!\n\nThis was first posted in an eneagram forum, but I will try it too.\n\nFirstly, I am properly a 1w9 but 3w4 is a second in tritype, and I think it‚Äôs rather high. My third is 6w7. I am also an ESTJ, Te si Ne FI.\n\nI love to work. I do anything  , and everything. I say yes to a lot. I think I can do well on them, It catches my interest. Besides more to do, more to make perfect, get more credit, why not? Someone needs to do it. I am very enthusiastic. It really doesn‚Äôt feel like too much. I just feel busy. Like most 1w9 or 3w4s or eSTJs my schedule is over flowing. I work 3 events a week, and write articles for them. I am a student journalist. I have to interview and run over a ton for them. I am also on other leadership roles throughout my community, help to bridge the gap. I am doing of a lot of work building membership lists, tracking down people online. ETC.... I also take two other classes, have some work from last semester. I usually don‚Äôt burn out, but I think everyone has a limit. Occasionally I feel I do a little and then get back to work. If I get burnt  out I just do something efficient like come on here and help people. Not such a problem, right? Well, until.....\n\nI start to not sleep, and fall asleep randomly. I am also a student, so I dose off at inopportune times like during lecture. It‚Äôs not boring. If I am awake I love debating and engaging. Listening to a lecture is less hands on and energetic then something else, and my body just shuts down then. It‚Äôs unfortunate, because I don‚Äôt really want to doze off! I also crash. Sleep for a long time. I also have to work until work is done. It also has to be to a very high standard. I also notice it, and as ESTJ and maybe it‚Äôs 1w9 and 3w4 it bothers me. when I start getting close to deadlines because I have to do this and that. If you write on at a university level if not a professional paper, you know one or 2 articles is a lot of work.. I also have to go classes, sleep, personal things, breathe, ETC..... I also try to keep up with people in between otherwise I feel kind of lonely just work and no connections. While messaging people may not be super long. So, I miss articles. Initially it doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot. I like working and keeping busy. So, I say yes, and do them. It‚Äôs natural for me to say yes. I feel like they would help my experience and my career. I like to cover those things because I should be the one covering them. I also pick up the leading because no one else wants to do it. Also, I take on tough articles. Some of these stuff fewer really wants to do. That‚Äôs another reason. I am a workaholic and I love work. I also like the perfection and the prestige of doing it. The goals, the success. It usually doesn‚Äôt feel like an issue. You just keep trucking right?\n\nAny advice?
1	How much sleep do you get per night on average? I'm personally way more productive when I've had a good night's sleep (not that I do that very often, I guess I just like shooting myself in the foot). If you're drifting off in your lectures, that suggests you're not getting near enough sleep.\n\nI know this is kind of obvious, but if you're asking, that's the solution.
1	This sounds a bit like a loop. Te wants to accomplish all the things and Ne gives you endless things to potentially accomplish. Probably time to prioritize some Si things in your life. Make sure you‚Äôre scheduling time to tend the crap you know needs doing but in the short term seems less exciting or satisfying. A reliable bedtime routine might help, and good nutrition, since it seems like your physical energy isn‚Äôt keeping up with your mental energy. 
1	I have no real advice here, just some sympathy. I have been there, too.\n\nWhat actually "helped" was some horrible pneumonia. I was nailed to my bed for months and after it was over I was so weak, that I had to re-prioritize all my obligations. I know take life a little bit more easy.\n\nThat said, I am still "lucky", because another ESTJ I know was destroyed by breast-cancer, before she took life less serious and became more fun loving.    
5	ESTJ men - how do you or did you make a move on your significant other?	Or how do you normally ask a girl out? Or how did you let your woman know you're interested?
6	>Or how do you normally ask a girl out?\n\nBy asking them out. There is no science to this, you like her you will try to get her.\n\n> Or how did you let your woman know you're interested?\n\nBy telling her. Touching, kissing and licking her got the point across also (I hope).\n\nBeing open and upfront about desires helps a lot in this case.
1	A ESTJ guy at my work likes me and he just let me know. He usually chooses to text his feelings rather than say it in life (at work) but he's always extremely upfront. At first he was more asking me how I felt and being a little more timid but now he'll just consistently remind me of his intentions.
1	Introduced her as my girlfriend.
5	Any Disabled ESTJs	Are there any other disabled people who type as ESTJs? How do you view your disability? How do you deal with it or how do you find you deal with it? Personally, I am a totally blind ESTJ, and personally, are usually do not think or notice my disability much. Fortunately for me I had a lot of help, but I‚Äôve also had how to work with my disability figured out. So far I‚Äôve had my share of successes in life and for that I‚Äôm very grateful!
1	Hi there, another estj here. We're you born with blindness or is it something that developed?
1	I was Born with really low vision, and then I lost when I was eight.
1	Hey! Question. Is there any program that allows you to post and get to know what's being posted? 
1	My husband is an ESTJ and dyslexic. Which, in the digital age, is quite constraining. 
3	Favorite Fictional ESTJs?	
7	Regina George is up there tbh
5	What about Minerva McGonagall? She is a lovely Harry Potter Hogwarts professor!
4	Ms Trunchbull haha
1	Sanji, "One Piece".  (intj)
6	Any esfjs ever do this	
2	What exactly is "this"? 
2	You mean step on other people to raise themselves up?
2	No?
1	my esfp friend travels like this exclusively
14	Any ESTJ's smoke weed?	Yes, we do exist!!\n\nFriends often say I'm the smartest and most successful of the group. I own my own business and all that go-getter stuff. I could go on, but all you need to know is that I'm a tried and true ESTJ.\n\nSmoking weed has definitely helped balance me out. Before, I couldn't STAND people who were overly emotional. If someone couldn't respond to logic, I'd find the most polite way to call them an idiot and move on. Lol like straight up. The thought of being friends what that kind of person wouldn't even cross my mind.\n\nNow, I can actually stop and understand people's feelings. Sometimes, you have to allow people to feel emotional and you have to connect with them on that level before you can get them to see logic. This sort of statement would have many types saying, "well duh...you JUST realized that?". But ESTJ's don't naturally feel like that, it's something they have to learn. And when they do, it's usually because the ESTJ is playing an emotional endgame in order to get results out of someone, so the connection isn't exactly authentic. It's very rare to find an ESTJ who can genuinely relate to someone emotionally. I feel like I'm one of those, though. \n\nWhen I took the test high (as in answering questions that pertain to me while I'm stoned) I got INTP. Which made sense because I'd go from super extrovert to major introvert when I got stoned. I liked having conversations with people I knew, but I didn't like socializing with new ppl. That scared the shit out of me because my intelligence is a big part of who I am, and without that I felt like I couldn't be myself.\n\nSo I had to find another way to relate to people when I got stoned at parties. Finally I just told myself "I might not be able to sound like my intelligent usual self...but I can make people feel good about themselves". That's where this all began.\n\nI've come to learn that making people feel good about themselves simply means shutting up and listening to them. Just letting them talk about whatever they want. Believe it or not, people don't wanna talk about politics or business. They don't wanna debate the intricacies of the stock market or of tax policy. Shocker, I know. \n\nUsually they wanna talk about THEMSELVES. About what they did last weekend, how it felt when they did activity X and Y. \n\nBut in order to really know someone, you can't just listen to them all the time. You've gotta give them a piece of yourself too. And that's where everything changed for me.\n\nI realized that I had to give myself the space to EXPLORE MY OWN FEELINGS. You'll have to figure out how to do that on your own. But what helped me was going on long drives down the coast, being around nature, listening to music... All things I did while I was high. I can listen to music for hours when I'm high and I'll never get tired of it. Like that alone is an activity for me. No way I'm doing that when I'm sober lol.\n\nEvery weekday night I drive to the beach, get high and listen to the evening news in my car while watching the sunset. It's interesting because I'm still doing an ESTJ activity, I'm still listening to the news. But I try to surround myself around something beautiful so that I can learn how to open up my heart to it-- something that I DID NOT KNOW how to do previously. But I'm trying. And I've learned that just as real as any fact or statistic can be, a glimmering sunset or a good song can be equally just as real. Again, so many other types would shake their heads reading this...it seems like such common sense. But I'm glad that it happened to me this way. You can either be an emotional person trying to find logic in this world...or you can be a logical person trying to find emotion in this world. I'd rather be the latter because an emotional person is learning logic to survive, whereas a logical person is learning emotion in order to find new meaning in life. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I finally found what I'd been missing all along, I just had to have a reason to look for it.\n\nAnyways, that's my ESTJ perspective on smoking weed. If you're curious to know, I don't do ANY other drugs and I drink maybe once or twice a year. I wanna do DMT or acid, but studies have shown that even one strong acid trip can change your brain chemistry so I'll probably never do it. \n\nNow I wanna hear your stoney ESTJ experiences!
10	It helps me connect with my kids, since I've been built and conditioned(thanks emotionally retarded dad) from birth to lose all emotion and irrationality. It allows me to get on their level, and makes me a better parent. \n\nI'm in a legal state, I don't do it directly around them, and I don't get "fugging ripped". A couple of puffs to "take the edge off" as my wife says, and I'm down on the floor playing trains with my youngest or building a massive city in Minecraft with my oldest. And I make WICKED good snacks.
5	Late response, but YES! \n\nAs an ESTJ I find it very difficult to just kick back and relax ‚Äì there‚Äôs always something that needs to be done right? \n\nA little THC (I also recommend CBD if you‚Äôre not in to or don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòintoxicated‚Äô) is all it takes for me to allow myself to get some much needed relaxation without that ‚Äòbut I could be doing ___‚Äô hovering in my head. \n\nHOWEVER, I do use it quite sparingly. I have been through a few periods of using it every day/night, and that was a bad idea. Not sure if it‚Äôs just me, but frequent use leads to a 24/7 ‚Äòmental fog‚Äô that I just can‚Äôt stand. And as and ESTJ I greatly value my own heath, and to hell with what others say, smoking (or vaping) anything is still putting stuff in your lungs that your body probably doesn‚Äôt want there. \n\nBut anyways, the stuff is great ‚Äì if used responsibly. \n\nHappy highs! 
3	I absolutely agree. I'm cooked now, and it brings out more of my E, while making me super empathetic to the feelings of others. 
3	As an ESTJ, who‚Äôs our best and worst match?	
7	Best match: ISTP. They‚Äôre willing to go with the flow, a perfect complement to you, and also fiercely independent, which y‚Äôall respect. They‚Äôre also super intellectual, just like you, and have a no-bullshit attitude. \n\nWorst match: As an ENFP, definitely us. Y‚Äôall make us feel like shit, and we stress/annoy the fuck out of you. Also we don‚Äôt agree on anything. And since we‚Äôre both extraverts, neither of us will listen to each other. 
6	That's different from person to person, I guess. If prefer someone similar to you, find some who shares your extroverted, sensing, thinking and judging way of living. If you prefer someone to challenge you, find someone who doesn't hold these abilities to the same extend.\n\nNever choose or dismiss anyone based solely on their MBTI type.
5	My wife is an ENFJ and we got along great. She manages to push me to do things that I wouldn't normally be excited about in a way that doesn't piss me off.  She also completely supports any random thing I might want to do even when she herself isn't really keen on it.  It's a good thing we have going on haha.
4	If you want to check out Socionics, in theory, our best match is INFP and our worst match is INFJ. Some people don't want to delve into that, but if you're interested, let me know.
1	Yeah I would also say that infp or infj is probably best, because for me I get along with them the best. I would say the worst is either esfp or isfp! Most of the experiences I have had with them are somewhat of a nightmare!
1	The ideal match is INFP. The worst match is INFJ: [**ESTJ relationship type matches**](http://personalitycafe.com/estj-articles/283-love-types-estj-3.html#post2423173)   \n     \nBest matches are same that share all of the ESTJ's cognitive functions. Sharing functions ensures likelihood of values, emotional understanding, and support. The type that is ideally matches to this is the INFP. Other decent type matches include ENFP and ISTJ (due to shared functions) as well as ESFP, ENTP, and ISFP.
1	All of ESTJ normal traits is sexy in view of ISTP and INTP.

6	Why did you come to the ENTJ sub then?
6	[deleted]
5	ESTJ girl married to ENTP boy. It can totally work, but you have to have a lot of self-awareness and respect for your partner, even when they do something that seems counter-intuitive.  \n\nIt's been good for both of us, honestly.  I have learned to loosen up a lot and just... let some things happen (had to white knuckle my way through that at first.) He appreciates the structure that I bring to life and the fact that he has a no-bullshit, call-it-like-I-see-it person who is in his corner no matter what. \n\nIf you can't trust that the person you're with will handle their business at the end of the day, even if it's in a way that doesn't make sense to you, it won't work, no matter what your mbtis are. But if you can, it can be magic. 
3	ESTJ girl here who dated an ENTP guy for a year. I loved the hell out of him, but eventually found him to be too smothering and needy. The qualities of his that I fell in love with (his knack for excellence, brilliant mind, quick wit, planning, etc.) diminished once we were official, and I asserted my ability to walk all over him because I could. My initial interest in him was due to a combination of adoration and admiration, but he seemed to lose sight of who he was while in pursuit of me, and I lost respect for him. I‚Äôll always have a soft spot for him and wonder if I should‚Äôve tried harder, but breaking up was the right move.
1	What seems to be the problem?

1	I have a friend who is entp.  We get along pretty well usually there‚Äôs been spells of times that we haven‚Äôt talked, but generally I suppose he‚Äôs interesting.

2	Hey fellow ESTJ, here is a little Survey to know more about MBTI types.	
2	How do you feel/Your thoughts on other types acting like you, if it has happened?	One of the common complaints I've seen against unhealthy ESTJs is that they want everyone else to be like them. \n\nThat got me curious enough to ask this question. I do, however, admit that there is another reason. My own mother remarried a few years ago to an ESTJ, and her personality has changed so much, to being like he is which to me is weird, but as long as she's happy, I'm supportive.\n\nAs an ESTJ, if someone did start acting just like you, what would your personal take be? \n\nAs this is an opinion question, there is no wrong answer here.
2	Wouldn't care nor notice, I don't even know how I really am so lul. Personality is so abstract, I do notice however when I'm acting like someone else.
2	I really enjoy being around people who are like me, but not if they're *acting* like me, just *existing* like me. I don't find too many people similar to myself. In many ways, I can be quite eccentric to observers, but I really enjoy being around others who think similarly to me. But if someone out of the blue started behaving like me, I'd probably be slightly creeped out while simultaneously being slightly flattered. \n\nI've never heard of that complaint against unhealthy ESTJs. I've heard of ESTJs who want everyone else to live up to their standards, but not necessarily behave like them.
1	Unless it was unintentional, I would probably be amused and if it went on too long annoyed.  This is especially if I think you‚Äôre trying to act like me.

5	> Could all of humanity be compassionate enough to throw away our money and dedicate our thinking and efforts to compassion and compassion alone. \n\nHey asshole, you did not throw away your money. You threw away someone else‚Äôs money. \n\nCompassion would have been to think, well shit, this could well be someone‚Äôs only remaining $14 and promptly handing it in to Lost and Found. \n\nYou picked it up, dithered for 5 stops and then performed a fucking breathtaking act of cowardice. The only profundity in this incident and your response to it, is how stupid it was. \n\nChrist. 
3	This was really cool to read! It‚Äôs ok to be selfish sometimes, your actions didn‚Äôt directly affect anyone. I think that‚Äôs really really cool and interesting. \n\nIt‚Äôs crazy what people do for money. \n\nSo I‚Äôm so happy that you were able to overcome the invasive thoughts and get rid of the problem in your own way!!! 
3	The odds of that would be too slim and too risky to try.
1	Oh wow! What a waste! Yeah, turning money into lost and found to be futile because that would basically be giving the money to lost and found person to keep. I would‚Äôve either given it to a homeless person who needed it a lot or just of kept it for myself which is probably more likely I just don‚Äôt understand why anybody would throw money in the trashcan! It just seems really foolish and imprudent to do! Maybe is my 3w4 speaking.

3	Is Ni a faulty / dangerous function to you?	Hey there ESTJ's it's your least favorite type, an INFJ. Just wondering your honest thoughts on our dominant function?
5	INFJ isn't my least favorite type. So far, I've had pretty good interactions with them. \n\nNi users have described the processes as ephemeral. They'll know something, or have a strong sense of a thing, but when asked to pull apart why they know it, the details slip away whenever they get close to being identified - like trying to remember a dream.  So the conclusion I've come to is that Ni is drawing from a mass of information, but without being able to pinpoint the details, they cannot verify them, so they may be making an assumption from faulty info without ever knowing it. On the other hand, Si collects only concrete information. It can verify everything, but it's missing a lot of stuff that could also be true, all the information in between that could lend more context. There's room for error in both. So in that way, they are somewhat equal.\n\nI've also seen Ni manifest their conclusions. Because it is so certain, the Ni user can react as if a premonition has already come to pass and thereby create that outcome. (For a really dumb example, if you come to the conclusion that Martha is a jerk, and then you react to her as if she's a jerk, she's probably going to start to be a jerk to you) And then they pat themselves on the back for knowing it ahead of time. Really, they just made it happen without necessarily realizing it. Because every function has its faults. \n\nBut I really appreciate that 'toward the future' outlook. My own 'against the future' can be very limited and anxious and it's nice to hear that more optimistic, or even just more confident, perspective. There's something about Ni that makes me think of faith.\n\nAs for Ni in myself, being Polr, I think that I would immediately disregard an Ni insight, or more likely, I would explain it away with all of my preferred functions. I regularly find myself making a judgment and then afterwards asking myself why. For all I know, my Ne is just coming up with reasons that suit my Si, but in reality, maybe it was a more amorphous Ni conclusion that truly led me there. But without those reasons, I would never trust it or act on it.
3	I don't think it's faulty or dangerous, it's just confusing. That might relate to the fact that there's a tendency within Typology communities to incorrectly conflate Ni with "mysticism" and say that "Ni is too subjective to give a concrete explanation to". I'm not entirely convinced by that, Si is also highly subjective and Ne is also highly abstract, but they get concrete explanations. \n\nIn real life, I sometimes get frustrated around NJs. We're both planners, but we often have very different ideas on how to go about the same thing, which leads to conflict. This also happens with SPs, but they at least sometimes let loose on the reigns. NPs and SJs are much easier to work with. SJs usually have similar ideas on the "right" way to go about something so we plan well together, and NPs, unlike SPs, usually agree with my ideas, they're just pretty chill on the planning part of it. However, they also help come up with and develop ideas in a way that suits what I want to do, whereas SPs come up with and develop ideas that contradict my plans.\n\nThat got off-topic for a bit, sorry. But generally, in real life, I find NFJ's (particularly INFJ's) intentions confusing. NTJs are easy enough to relate to but are a bit too intense for my tastes and we often end up annoyed with each other (this mostly applies to INTJs, I usually get along well with ENTJs, but I feel like they sometimes have a streak of vindictiveness that I haven't really observed outside the Gammas). On a more theoretical level, Ni is the only function I feel like I don't "get". I don't think I could actually explain what Ni is off the top of my head, whereas I could give a rough description of the other functions.\n\nSorry if this comment sounded harsh or offensive, it wasn't intended, these are just my honest feelings on the topic. I think Ni is certainly a valuable function, it just sometimes ends up in conflict with my own functions. Please let me know if I've made any incorrect assumptions about it.
1	>Hey there ESTJ's it's your least favorite type,\n\nENTP?! Even though I wouldn't say the ENTP is my least favourite type. More like, ENTP(s) tend to be my natural enemies . They are still highly entertaining and having a conflict with them teaches me about the limits of reality.\n\n>an INFJ.\n\n???\n\nBut I like INFJ(s). Usually they are allies of justice and mean well. \n\n>Just wondering your honest thoughts on our dominant function?\n\nI once seduced a woman because I was so fascinated with her introverted intuition and wanted to be closer to it.\nOn one hand, I like the perspective it brings, especially because I have problems reproducing it. On the other hand, sometimes it looks like utter madness and nonsense.\n\nThat said, I actually can open my mind eye just fine. I even can solve problems with it. The main problem is just, that prolonged use lets my imagination go wild and berserk.\n\nI get visions about puppets, strings, spiders and so on. Usually I close my mind eye at this point. The last time that I didn't, I had a 'conversation' with society itself. I needed months to get over it.
1	Hey! I actually like some infjs. If I was to be honest, I really don‚Äôt know too much about Ni. I know how it works a bit, but that‚Äôs it. I have friends who are both infj and infp. I actually like both of them enough though I tend to like infps a bit more, but the infjs I know honestly seem a little more stable.
1	I would say my least favourite type is either esfp, isfp, and Intj.. Entps are fine, but at some point I have to tell them it‚Äôs time to stop arguing, because I really don‚Äôt have the time. There was this guy on my Twitter who would debate every tweet I put up that got annoying.
1	Thanks for the responses everyone! I'm having a real hard time maneuvering the micromanagement and conflict with my ESTJ boss and I was just thinking it'd maybe was a fundamental difference in our functions. She has a really hard time seeing my perspective.
1	ESTJs and XNXPs	How do you feel about INTPs and ENTPs?\n\nThe reason is I had issues with ESTJs growing up in elementary school. It was a communication issue, but my Ti had trouble justifying my Ne, and I wasn‚Äôt given knowledge that was actually useful for me.\n\nWhen I did something my way (e.g. the way I formed my letters), I‚Äôd do it in an unorthodox way and do it based on my Ne. The ESTJ teacher would, in short, assert her Si on me and pretty much say (not word for word necessarily) ‚ÄúDo things the traditional way!‚Äù We‚Äôd go back and forth until the teacher would just give up and think I was being stubborn.\n\nThe other reason is, no offense, but I feel like I‚Äôm around ‚Äúold‚Äù people when around/see the ESTJs I‚Äôve been around/seen, although that could just be the ESTJs I see/have to spend time with.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nThe other thing that I tend to have issues with with ESTJs is they (based on the ones I‚Äôve been around) tend to be misinformed and indoctrinated.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nIt‚Äôs not so much that I have a problem with ESTJs nor Si even but the effects of the manipulation of Si. \n\nSince people aren‚Äôt educated on psychology nor sociology, nor have a good understanding of science, TREMENDOUS problems occur. In fact, I think many major problems in society would be fixed if this were fixed.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nAgain, I don‚Äôt have anything against ESTJs. What I have a problem with is how unethical and broken the US education system is, and its effects, which XSXJs tend to be the most vulnerable to.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nYou KNOW the system is flawed when even 7 year olds notice how flawed it is.
8	Really, this felt like more of an excuse to bitch about ESTJs than to ask a genuine question.\n\n> When I did something my way (e.g. the way I formed my letters), I‚Äôd do it in an unorthodox way and do it based on my Ne.\n\nYou don't write letters in an unconventional way based on Ne. "Doing anything outside the norm" is not Ne. If you had to attribute that to any function (which you shouldn't, because it could literally be anything), it would be Se. Manipulating an object based on how it feels right to do so in the moment.\n\n> We‚Äôd go back and forth until the teacher would just give up and think I was being stubborn.\n\nI mean, you were being stubborn. So was she, and being a teacher she should take more responsibility for that than a student, but I don't know how that wasn't stubborn.\n\n> The other thing that I tend to have issues with with ESTJs is they (based on the ones I‚Äôve been around) tend to be misinformed and indoctrinated.\n\nBeing misinformed is quite literally contrary to the nature of Te. Te is all about sourcing outside information to make logical decisions. I'm not even going to respond to you saying they're "indoctrinated", that's beyond an insane generalisation and a bizarrely close-minded statement for an NP.\n\n> It‚Äôs not so much that I have a problem with ESTJs nor Si even but the effects of the manipulation of Si.\n\n> Since people aren‚Äôt educated on psychology nor sociology, nor have a good understanding of science, TREMENDOUS problems occur. In fact, I think many major problems in society would be fixed if this were fixed.\n\nThis can apply to most people.\n\nAs an aside, just an interesting thing in Socionics, the Dialectical-Algorithmic cognitive style is supposedly the types most likely to be indoctrinated into cults and stuff, which does include ESTJ and ISFJ, but also ENFJ and INTJ.\n\n> Again, I don‚Äôt have anything against ESTJs. What I have a problem with is how unethical and broken the US education system is, and its effects, which XSXJs tend to be the most vulnerable to.\n\n> You KNOW the system is flawed when even 7 year olds notice how flawed it is.\n\n\nThe education system *is* flawed, you're correct, but once again, saying SJs are the most vulnerable to its shortcomings is a gross generalisation (I'm noticing a theme in this post). Have you ever considered that it isn't SJs who are vulnerable to being sheepish traditionalists, it's just you who types sheepish traditionalists as SJs?\n\n*****\n\nNow that I'm done with that, I'll answer the question that was originally intended. \n\nI generally like NPs more than I like NJs and SPs, they're capable of loosening up whereas SPs and NJs just worry me. \n\nFriendly and well-rounded INTPs are potentially some of my favourite people. They make for great conversation partners, I feel like when I'm having a discussion with them we understand each other's ideas and they all seem logically consistent but we still have different perspectives. They're difficult to connect with in the first place, but once you get to know them they're great.\n\nENTPs are like that but fix the "hard to connect with" problem I have with INTPs, but I can sometimes find them somewhat vindictive when angry. I generally really enjoy their company, however.\n\nENFPs fix my problem with ENTPs. I sort of become ENFP-ish in their presence, they're just so fun to be around. The only issue is that they get a bit tiring sometimes.\n\nAnd INFPs fix my problem with getting too tiring after a while. More extraverted INFPs are able to make me feel excited like an ENFP can, but can tone it down too. My problem with INFPs is they can get intimidated too easily and be hesitant to share their opinions, or sometimes when they *do* state their opinions, they don't have a lot to back it up.\n\nTo round it off, INTPs fix my problem with INFPs.\n\nI'm happy to answer further questions. Sorry if I sounded too angry at the start of this post, I've unwinded a little bit now that I've switched onto another topic, but I really encourage you to try further understanding the perspectives of SJs in your life.
2	Or, you know, some day you‚Äôll have a job and they won‚Äôt make a lot of exceptions for how you want to do things either.\n\nMaybe that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs trying to teach you, since it seems like it‚Äôs something you need to learn.
1	I know some intps and entps. I like the intps more than they seem to actually like me. And entps I can usually get along with. I won‚Äôt even start on your rambles about your teachers. About the indoctrination, I think it depends on your perspective. I think some people would say that I am, and others would say that I am really fair.

1	ESTJ/ Type 8 wing 7 here. I'm difficult. 
1	I am ESTJ 1w9 3w4 6w7 136 taskmaster. I am rules lady, and the hard task master! I suppose some people boring would call it but I like it!
5	How do ESTJs flirt?	How do you know if they're into you? 
7	If I like someone, I‚Äôll hang around them and spend a lot of time listening to their interests, then make something for them based on what they like. Once I think I‚Äôm in with a shot, I‚Äôm very upfront.
6	Probably start charging at their chosen mate with words and (interrogative) questions as cool as possible, and if s/he can stand it, they remember to do whatever activity their partner enjoys just so they can report back to them and tell them how they felt about it, which is an effort to charm their partner (it kinda always works).\n\nThis is of course the calmest, subtle, most romantic version of ESTJs, usually they're just all up in your face with questions and a direct invitation either to their bed or their bank account as a life partner.
7	My husband is an estj. We first met at a party and I wasn't sure if he liked me. We didn't exchange numbers and we went our separate ways. A week later he found me on Myspace (this was 2006, we were 19) and says "don't I know you?" We hit it off and he asked me out to dinner. We were both not willing to take the first leap and express our true feelings, but I knew he really liked me because he would reach out to me consistently, At least once a day to check in and make future plans. He always wanted me around and he made that very clear. 
5	The way I have flirted I guess is by showing a general interest or by having joking challenges, but I guess overall, my biggest subconscious go to is just showing a lot of interests in their own interest like hobbies etc. 
3	Usually I flirt like a sledgehammer. I am told, that I should try to be more subtle and romantic. But to be honest, I lack the patience for both. Actually I was told, that I lack any sort of discretion.\n\nAlso, I should stop SHOUTING my lines, as in: "OMG, speak a little bit loader and my husband might hear us."-"Why, is he at this party?"- "No, he is dead!"\n\nBut to give some examples:\n\n"You know what would be better than a cat-story? A lap-dance."\n\n<she takes off her top> "I see, you brought your attractive sisters with you."\n\n"Isn't it boring to stand here all alone smoking. Lets make things exciting!"\n\n"You stared at me for the last 15 minutes. Would you either come to the point or stop starring."
5	Very straightforwardly. Fuck playing ‚Äúhard to get‚Äù; if I want something, I make it known. I always make the first move lol.
3	Quality time and good conversations
1	So we‚Äôre Cupid, SWAT edn.? I giggled.
1	Two kitten usernames...do you know each other?\n\nDamn I need an ESTJ. I like guys who know what they want and aren‚Äôt afraid to make their feelings known.
2	Views on INTPs	Hi all,\n\nSome of the online tests show ESTJs as natural partners for INTPs. It so happens that I - an INTP - am envisionning a business partnership with an ESTJ to run a small company.\n\nHow do you guys see your enconters with INTPs? What are the issues that might rise long term in a relationship between these types? Any past anecdotes worthy of notice ?\n\nBest,
6	I love socially-developed INTPs, they're loads of fun to have conversations with. There's one INTP I know who likes to springboard their ideas off of me, tell me what they're thinking to get a Te-perspective on the problem. They loosen me up. \n\nNe/Si is a good point of communication between ESTJs and INTPs. When well developed, both of them should have relatively strong Si and Ne, and will both be quite cautious, meticulous, but open to ideas and new points of view.\n\nYou should probably note that ESTJs can be *very* organised and typically really dislike not having a plan ahead within their professional lives, sometimes to the point of frustrating those who require a level of spontaneity. We're basically the ultimate contingency planners.\n\nHonestly, as long as you're both well-rounded, friendly people, there shouldn't be too many long-term problems that arise, especially if you're good at resolving conflicts. ESTJ-INTP is pretty much the best business partnership I can imagine tbh. ISTP-ENTJ would probably be on-par, but INTP-ENTJ or ISTP-ESTJ isn't something I can see happening with ease.
1	I was in a relationship with an ESTJ female and I‚Äôm an INTP.  We enjoyed each other‚Äôs company but also really got into each other‚Äôs nerves.  Definite sparing between her Te and my Ti.  Plus we both have inferior Fe and Fi.  So she could come off as cold and me not very affectionate.  \n\nAs the other poster mentioned you really gel with your sandwiched Ne and Si functions.  I did appreciate her Te take charge kind of an attitude however it would come after me with a vengeance if I was being unproductive or taking too long to do something.  \n\nBonding occurs with the your shared auxiliary and tertiary functions which are flipped and slightly more developed for each person.  I got her out of her comfort zone and challenged her with my Ne and she showed me more practical ways of handling day to day activities with her Si.  \n
1	I don‚Äôt really see too many honestly, but the fact that some intps can be very avoided, at least in my experience.
10	I‚Äôm the 1000th subscriber. Just thought that was cool.	
5	I think some people unsubscribed just to spite you because we're at 998 subscribers now lol
2	It‚Äôs kind of interesting but it is not that important I agree. I guess my first thought was, okay so what?
2	A new Discord server focused on Sensing types!	Sensor Server is the only Discord server that primarily focuses on sensing types. Members can talk about a range of different topics, and every type is welcome. \n\nDiscord invite: https://discord.gg/E8PP6ME
5	Having To See/Experience It Yourself Before Believing	I've seen people attribute this to ESTJs. Do you agree with it, and if you do, to what extent?\n\nI know an ESTJ who constantly has to physically see things for themselves. This comes in multiple forms:\n\n* Whether something would fit inside another thing (even if it looks like it wouldn't fit at all)\n\n* Scoping stores for items that, imho, obviously wouldn't be found there just in case it is\n\n* Doing something someone else has already done just to verify\n\nI concede that the last one is because the ESTJ probably believes they might know a better way to do something, but the constant verification can be frustrating. At the very least it wastes time and at most I'm constantly being doubted.\n\n
5	Isn't this contrary to the nature of Te? Te naturally looks for external sources of information, often basing beliefs on secondary information and expert opinion.\n\nDespite my previous points, I personally relate to all three of those dot points.\n\nI actually think it's a Ne thing. Ne realizes that not everything is always going occur in a certain way, and SJs often tend to catastrophize what could go wrong if we're not certain of every possibility. That thing doesn't *look* like it fits in this thing, but maybe my perspective is wrong. That store *probably* wouldn't hold that item, but there's always a chance. Maybe that person *says* they did this thing, but what if they're lying to me? What if they were mistaken? What if they did it incorrectly? \n\nNe in SJs often leads to a certain self-doubt, and Si has a need to feel secure, so it makes sense that we'd need to double check everything. I don't think I need to "experience" something per se, but I need to be very sure.
3	I disagree on almost every point. I think it's more about trust. If I hear something from someone I believe is competent I'll believe it unless I have a specific reason to disagree. If I don't think the person is qualified I'll just ignore their input and see for myself. If they were right I'll update what I consider them knowledgeable about unless I think they got lucky.
2	I believe that truth can only be understood trough practical means. And while I trust my senses, I don't need to have seen the Roman Empire  to believe it actually existed. On the flip side, this is the reason why I am an atheist.\n\n> Whether something would fit inside another thing (even if it looks like it wouldn't fit at all)\n\nNot really. Instead of speculating what machine X can do, I rather build it and look up what it actually does. Reality is sometimes stranger than our wildest imaginations.\n\n>Scoping stores for items that, imho, obviously wouldn't be found there just in case it is\n\nThe opposite actually. I usually don't think that elephant meat can be brought on the fish-market. \n\n>Doing something someone else has already done just to verify\n\nOf course. How else would I know if a claim is true or not? And I usually learn something from it.\n\n>At the very least it wastes time and at most I'm constantly being doubted.\n\nThe bigger waste would be to built upon false facts and faith. And what has the truth to do with your ego? If it is a true statement it can be verified and if not, then you can be happy, that the error was found.
1	I think it is true to a large extent but it depends on who tells me what information. I think this is really typical when it comes to religion. I cannot believe it unless I have some sort of physical proof. I love the book of revelations and prophecy fulfilling. 
3	I‚Äôm an ESTJ guy who‚Äôs into an ISFJ girl, can anyone give some advice??	
1	don't try to criticize her (your Te) or feel like you have to play it cool. The "cooler" and detached you come off, the meaner she thinks you are. It's that whole SiFe dynamic she can sense your effort for aloofness and it will probably make her shy away.\n\nAs long as you think before you talk, it's pretty great chemistry I think.
7	I'm not an ESTJ but i just love ESTJs	im just here to say this. what makes you different from people around you that you've noticed. like major key points.\n\nare you really aware of other people's physical presence, random strangers in a library for example without even trying to be? \n\nim especially curious about the guys' perspective, but ladies you are welcome :]
19	I am a female ESTJ. It is a tricky personality type, especially for females. I'm highly aware of physical presences around me, but what I'm really aware of is the competence of others.\n\nI'm an operational director for a retail store, and I CANNOT STAND employees who do not follow the procedures I've set in place. I can't stand employees who start projects and don't finish them. Competence is #1 for me. If I deem you competent, honest, and intelligent, I am extremely loyal and supportive. \n\nIf I deem you incompetent, watch the f*** out. I will cut you with my words and do whatever is necessary to remove the incompetent individual from my environment, whether it be at work or in other relationships. \n\nBut those who are capable of following instructions, offer creative ideas and solutions and demonstrate intelligence are treasured and respected by me. I also really value detail-oriented people, because I'm a big-picture person. \n\nThe essence of an ESTJ: we are doers. We cannot stand inefficiency. We are also quite blunt. We do not, and cannot, change how we are, though I am attempting to mitigate my bluntness when dealing with feeling types. \n\nHope this is helpful. 
11	Can't speak for anyone else but I like to keep an eye on who enters and exits a room. Also if you ask me to do something I was already doing I'll hate doing it.
6	Is awareness of others‚Äô presences a characteristic of ESTJs? I never knew that. But I definitely am! 
5	Totally true. I‚Äôm an ESTJ guy, and the best way I relate is with girls. If a girl I‚Äôm interested in is anywhere near, I can‚Äôt help but be very aware of it. Like if we‚Äôre at a 100+ person event, I somehow locate her immediately. I honestly creep myself out a lot, it‚Äôs like I can have a radar on somebody that I can‚Äôt turn off. It can also be quite stressful, I wish I could just not notice but I can‚Äôt and I end up either feeling obsessed or like a stalker even though I can‚Äôt help it. 
4	I tend to catalogue a room when I walk into it, noticing people placement and activity now that I think on it. I've noticed quite a lot of emotional people around me, who have no barrier to expressing it loud and proud. Doesn't really bode well with me, but they do them. Seen some really motivated and successful people, which earns a nod of appreciation.
2	I am also a female ESTJ. It is deafly interesting, and I do like it but sometimes it isn‚Äôt the easiest. I am not what most females should be, because I‚Äôm very confident and knowledgeable. Yes, I tend to notice people around me, a lot and as somebody says I noticed there competency. I am in the business of media, I am a journalist at the moment a student journalist. I think the people either are too biased, not honest enough, or don‚Äôt go after the facts aggressively enough. I think people tend to like doing that easy, or fun, job, but not the very necessary one. Often in the news room there is a lot of back-and-forth gossiping and really sometimes dishonesty, even some passive aggressiveness, when the point is to get out the truth and to be truthful. I view journalism as serving the public, and informing people of what is the real truth, and that is simply not the focus of a lot of media people. It is either about them, what they think is really cool, some type of attention seeking, or something else. I‚Äôm deafly really task oriented where others don‚Äôt seem to be, and I seem to be working that much harder, and that much more on truth, honesty, and following what theoretically journalism is supposed to be about. Online, I seem to be helping a lot more, and care a lot more about the communities I belong to and work a lot more on actualising goals rather than just talking about them. I am on the site where there was 1 million ideas about getting together and everybody would talk about this, then drop the idea. I actually made it happened and started the trend with sitewide local meet ups. My area was the 1st to have a meet up, it seems so cool to everybody that slowly there were others. Back to journalism for moment, I am currently serving as the schools political correspondent to the ASB. I wasn‚Äôt sure how popular the job was, but apparently because the meetings are boring, political innature, not very fast and exciting, does not usually generate a lot of gossip, more business and administrative, ETC... nobody else wants to do this job, because it‚Äôs not exactly easy either. I know a lot of people want to cover sports, media, fun events, and likes but when it comes to more administrative tasks it certainly isn‚Äôt so interesting anymore. I also noticed I tend to be practically helpful where as some people are more emotionally helpful, or are not helpful at all. I‚Äôve also been told that I don‚Äôt do what is easy I do what is right or necessary. It‚Äôs kind of interesting because while some of the other types may be popular popular as in the momentary fame, I am usually very well respected and appreciated and quite well known throughout my community. I think in a lot of ways I am also very much loud and PR a lot of these communities and groups, which I do not think a lot of people do. I am also extremely aggressive about these efforts.

1	Looking for ESTJs to take my short survey on accomplishments and social media. (Takes no more than 5 minutes) Many thanks from an ENFJ!	
2	I did not qualify to take this survey. I prefer to socialize in person. 
1	done!
1	INTP Female - Please advise me on how to stop being lazy	Greetings to all ESTJs. I have a problem with knowing great things to do, and better ways of doing things - but I don't stick with them for very long. Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thanks. Or any insight into your thought processes that lead you to act on things and remain consistent. 
12	Break your tasks into 45 minute chunks. List them. Cross them off as you go along. Take a 5-10 minute rest between chunks. \n\nMake promises. Remember how shitty it feels when people you thought you could trust break their promises. Keep your promises. \n\nEnjoy!!!!\n\nEdit: hello /r/iamverysmart!
1	[deleted]
1	I guess for me it would be just every idea I think of is something I actually want to do, or like the idea of doing. I think thinking of the end result can be helpful.
1	I‚Äôm INTP and whats made me active is discipline. Maybe we are not disciplinable naturaly but we can pretty able to. As I‚Äôm muslim praying 5 times in a day helps me so muchhh. But only when I do that in time and focused. If you do some tasks in specified time every day this may help INTPs.

3	Why should I join your Discord server over the Discord servers advertised in the previous two posts here? I'm already part of a couple servers, what makes this one stand out?\n\nSorry for the mini-interrogation, but I swear at least a third of this subreddit is just INJs advertising Discords and INPs complaining that ESTJs (AKA anyone they dislike) have terrorized them their entire life. I'm not kidding, someone actually said that to me. I'm just being salty.

2	Personality Test With Cognitive Functions	Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. \n\nIt's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
2	I think you linked the wrong one because that clearly wasn't a cognitive function test. You even gave the results at the end in the form of the dichotomies. That being said, once again, I got ENFJ-A.\n\nE - 49% (for some reason I got E on this despite scoring higher on Introversion)\n\nN - 63%\n\nF - 51%\n\nJ - 62%\n\nA - 68%\n\nEDIT: Ignore this, I found the functions at the bottom. Maybe put them closer to the top.\n\nEDIT 2: That being said, based on my functions, I should've gotten INFJ or ENFP.\n\nEDIT 3: Either way, whether or not I was scored on the cognitive functions, those questions were obviously testing the dichotomies as they weren't tailored to the functions.
5	ESTJ Christmas Gift ideas	I need a few ideas on things ESTJs like to receive as gifts. I have read they like to receive things they can actually use in their daily life. A little about my ESTJ:\n\nThe ESTJ I am gifting for is in his 50s, works in IT, (very long hours) also in the military, and loves football.  His home already looks so well-organized and neat. His vehicles as well. I considered a watch but I know he owns more than 10 of those. Maybe a custom one? I feel like I'm shopping for someone that has everything he needs.\n\nAny ideas for useful gifts would be great! \n\nThank you!\n- Grateful ISFJ
6	Keep it as practical as possible.  Something they need, something they may have specifically asked for.  \n\nWhen I tell people I want socks, get me socks.  Don't try and surprise me by buying me something fun because you think me asking for socks is lame.\n\nYou are right about ESTJs wanting something they can use in their daily life.  \n\nIf you're truly stumped, consider making them food, like cookies or something, or buy them their favorite brand/bottle of alcohol.  Find out a favorite of theirs.  If they are anything like me, they probably have favorites, something they love eating.  If they buy coffee, they probably get the same drink every time, if they drink alcohol they probably drink the same thing.  \n\nI am addicted to Redbulls, those who know me well know it's my favorite treat.  I had a friend who got me a four pack for my birthday, and that was one of my favorite gifts because it showed me he was paying attention to my interests.  \n\nDon't try and impress them either, it won't work.\n\n\n\n\n
4	Have you considered giving him an experience? I‚Äôm at the point also where I have everything I need but I love people to take me somewhere and do all the planning. 
4	Would this type like a sonicare toothbrush? Bc I started using one and I swear by them. Useful and practical.\n\nThis is prob more if their love language is not gifts though. And add something more fun too to balance it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
2	I am not a fan of getting gifts that are objects bc if I want something I get it for myself.  Experiences/meals are nice.\n\nSurprise gifts are fun too.  Hard to do this time of year ik.
1	A Swiss army pocket knife?
1	Thanks for your ideas! He's so private so I don't know his favorites of much. I do know he doesn't drink alcohol nor likes any sweets. I may just get him something of his favorite football team. I was kind of hoping to switch it up this time, but it's rather difficult. *sigh*
1	I‚Äôm an INTP that is married to an ESTJ.  Every year she tells me she doesn‚Äôt want anything for Christmas/birthday because she loves all the gifts I give her year round.  So I‚Äôve learned that there is no, once a year, silver bullet, gift that will work.  You have to pepper them year round with little thoughtful gifts to be successful.  And that‚Äôs what I do.  Whenever I see something I think she‚Äôll like, I give it to her. Five dollars here, $3.50 there, and sometimes, like last night, I surprised her with her favorite takeout for dinner.  \n\n
1	Cash (but not socially acceptable) :)\nNext best thing something that you can use (= you would spend cash on t anyway, so getting it as a gift equals to you getting that cash indirectly by not spending it on buying that thing yourself).\nBottle of alcohol is safe bet if you don't have more insight of what he would need.
5	Why are there barely any people on this sub?	I like checking out this sub but it's really quiet. How popular are ESTJs and why are there not many on here unlike r/infp for example. I just want to know. \n\nAlso this may be a weird question but where do you find ESTJ men? I never seem to find them. Ok that last question was weird. But still.
12	I have noticed that my enfp and infp friends and family are a lot more interested in what others from their personality type think/feel. Whereas I(an estj) don't really feel obligated or compelled to relate to other estjs because they are estj. Don't know if that's completely relevant but there is my 2 cents.
4	I really enjoy talking to others in the MBTI community but more often than not I don't feel like I have much to say.  \n\nESTJs are far more common than INFJs and INTJs, but they have far more members and a lot more engagement.  I'm not really sure why, but I think it has to do with the fact that ESTJs like hanging out in communities/subs that directly apply to their lives.  \n\nMy dad is an ESTJ and he spends hours on wrestling forums.  When my brothers were in high school he would engage with others about who is good, who is going to state, other gossip surrounding the community.  He also spends time in communities talking about tractors, another hobby of his.  \n\nI really like the skincare and makeup subs because I relate to it more.  It's something I like, it's part of my job, and allows me to learn more about something that applies to my actual life.  \n\nESTJs are common in politics, so I can imagine that's where they would spend there time engaging wither others.  \n\nI think the other user pretty much explained it too.  
5	Every ESTJ I know is barely on social media or couldnt careless about MBTI. It's very rare that you find ESTJ on MBTI forums. You can check every ESTJ section of any MBTI  forum on any website, and it is always the least populated. If it has a decent amount, it is probably ISTJs mistyped as ESTJs. 
2	I think ESTJs like to get out there and live life, they love nature and physical activities. So they will hardly spend time here.
2	ESTJ here,\nI just come across this thread while I was studying at the library.\nFor me, I usually spend time studying for a certification in library with a study group or working out at the gym with my friend. \nYou might across with the ESTJ type of person in the study group or gymnasium. Hopefully this helps.
2	Why Do You Think You Are An ESTJ (As Opposed To An ISTJ)?	I'm currently feeling conflicted between istj & estj for my type, so I was curious about what decided it for you all. \n\nI think that answers that discuss cognitive functions & their manifestations would be more helpful to me than discussions of how talkative one is...\n\nThanks in advance!
9	I think I have stronger Ne than I do Fi. I use Ne quite a lot in my everyday life, and though I'm a friendly person (I think), I definitely don't have very strong Fi. I'm okay with other people expressing their emotions, but I somewhat repress mine.\n\nI was also a bossy little shit who tried to structure and organise everything I was a part of as a kid, suggesting my Te was more developed than my Si back then.\n\nEDIT: Also Reinin Dichotomies, if you're willing to delve a little into Socionics.
5	I struggle with it too, I think partially because neither type has been very well explored by the community. We‚Äôre common and therefore uninteresting? \n\nWithout other ESTJ to compare myself with, it‚Äôs difficult to assess. I have a lot of introverted tendencies that I think stem from my inability to deal with how other people are feeling and how poorly I‚Äôm able to communicate how I feel, even though I consider myself quite open and expressive.\n\nI feel like I‚Äôve leaned toward ESTJ because of my tendency, as Moodle put it, to be a bossy shit. I feel like I‚Äôm likely to say ‚Äòooh neat idea‚Äô and ‚Äòfeelings don‚Äôt matter‚Äô, but I know I‚Äôm also hesitant about turning that ‚Äònew idea‚Äô into something real and  I‚Äôm painfully aware of how much my feelings do matter every time people react to me like I‚Äôve said something terrible or selfish. \n\nI generally feel like I‚Äôm unpalatable and I can either lean into it or let it crush me, so I tend to chose the former. Because I‚Äôm also sick of everyone whining.
2	Because I am an extrovert. :P\n\n> I think that answers that discuss cognitive functions & their manifestations would be more helpful to me than discussions of how talkative one is...\n\nBut the manifestations of the functions lead to how talkative someone is. In the case of extroverted thinking (Te) it is more about activity/assertiveness (in regards to extroversion) and extroverted perceiving (Ne/Se) is about excitement seeking.\n\nPersonally I hate sleep, prefer to interact with my environment and like to overcome new exciting challenges. I like competition and rivals. I take the hard path over the easy path, because the easy path leads to boredom. 
2	While I grade as an extrovert, and people who know me would immediately assume so, I'm barely over the line. I need my solitude. 
3	Need some help :)	Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :)\nYou don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is:\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test\nAny comments, ideas, critics are welcome!
1	I got ENFJ-A (which is weird, because it also said I got 51% Thinking...). My results were:\n\nE: 57%\n\nN: 63%\n\nT: 51%\n\nJ: 62%\n\nA: 65%\n\nWell, first of all, I think that the T/F dichotomy is bugged out.\n\nSecondly, I think where you went wrong on the N/S dichotomy is that you predominantly asked if the user could intuit, so you would only get sensing if you cannot intuit, not if you can sense. For example, when you say "I can see the bigger picture", Sensors can use their lower Intuition function to do so, so the only people who *can't* see the bigger picture are underdeveloped or young Sensors. Because of this, well-developed Sensors will likely test as Intuitive. You need more questions where Sensing is the positive focus, not Intuition. I realise that you had questions such as "I'm more practical than creative", but that's a poor question. Would you think an artistically-minded ISFP wouldn't put down creativity, for example?\n\nThirdly, it's pretty obvious you copied 16personalities on a lot of these questions. It's not even the best website to copy, the test is pretty bad, but it's probably better to copy a bigger company which can handle the hit rather than a smaller and more refined test, so I'll leave you be on this one.\n\nIf you're set on making a dichotomy test over a function test, I'd follow [this](http://personalitycafe.com/myers-briggs-forum/222794-descriptions-mbti-step-ii-facets.html) guide to the dichotomies. It still won't be 100% accurate, but it would be better.\n\nAlso, nothing of value comes from the A/T dichotomy, I'd just ditch that all together.
1	iNTJ-A. 3 out of 5, close enough I guess.\n\nYour iNtuitive/Sensor dichotomy asks ability not preference. Just because someone can swim, doesn‚Äôt mean their favourite  sport is swimming.\n\nAnd your Extroversion/Introversion is mainly social extroversion, something modern Big five tests disassociate themselves  from.\n\nA better question would be:\n\n"What do you seek in your free-time?" Excitement/Calmness\n\nBut I think you put this into the A/T dichotomy.  So I am not sure if this is a design choice or not.\n\nedit: I read your post about your A/T dichotomy. I guess I was wrong, still leaving it in. Interesting concept by the way.
5	Do you test as an ESTJ?	On cognitive function tests, I get ESTJ around half the time, but I've never received ESTJ on a letter dichotomy test. Usually, I get ENTJ, INTJ and very occasionally ISTJ. Function tests often give me INTP (I tend to score highest in the T categories, and both Ne and Si score quite highly, so this isn't surprising). The only thing that stays consistent is that I virtually always get Thinking over Feeling, but usually only *just*. Letter dichotomy tests usually give me around 60% Thinking, and it's very stable, whereas my S/N can range from 60% Sensing to 80% Intuition. Once I tested as an ENFJ on John's Personality Test, however.\n\nHonestly, I'm guessing that the ESTJ subreddit doesn't spend quite as much time taking personality tests as I do, but what have you gotten before?
3	I get ESTJ the most, occasionally ENTJ.
3	I usually don't get ESTJ either, the types I get are:\n\n1. ENTJ\n2. ISTJ \n3. ENTP\n\nMy functions usually score: Te > Si = Ne. (Depending on the definitions of the functions even this can vary)\n
3	Hey guys, I'm an INFP and am looking for help as to what to buy my ESTJ Grandma for Christmas...	So I'm a bit of a joker, and am genuinely considering buying Mein Kampf, by Adolf Hitler. Thoughts?
3	Lol no
1	That is the best possible gift for an ESTJ.
8	Help understand ESTJ man [dating]!	Hi ESTJs!\n\nI am getting mixed signals from an ESTJ man I met through friends.. What do you make of this situation?\n\nInstant connection on first date. He showered me with verbal compliments ("pretty," "cute," etc.). He held my hand, went in for a kiss, etc. etc. \n\nHe works in finance (a lot of hours), so I understand that he's very busy. We just had our 5th date, but I had to initiate every one of those dates. For example, after each date, I'd have to text him "when do i get to see you next?" and he'd respond "i'm busy this week, but the follow week is good." This happened three times already, with me initiating the conversation about our next meet-up, and him just following up. He NEVER texts first.\n\nDuring our last dinner date, he spontaneously asked if I wanted to join him to go to his coworkers' birthday party. So I followed along with him, he called me his "date." \n\nWe made out afterwards, but again, after that, he never texted again.\n\nI'm so confused.... I thought ESTJs were straight-forward. Am I just a fling to him???
7	I am an ESTJ guy. I think the best way to find out is to ask him straightforward. Just ask him exactly what he thinks of you and whatever else you want to know. If he's like me, he is really careful (and thus sometimes just quiet) with what he says, we best communicate in, as we fear it to be, in such concise and to-the-point language and tone that it can be uncomfortable or harsh to the people we are communicating to. If you directly ask him, he will likely see it as a great opportunity to open up and talk because he knows you're ready for it. \nHope you find out and all turns out well for you two!  
5	In short, if an ESTJ isn't texting you a lot, you're probably not high on their list.
5	Work is his first love. He's never going to think of you when he's in work mode. That's why he invited you to his coworker's party because it's related to work. Personally, I usually push everything outside of work to the bottom of my list and I don't mean any harm by it. It's just where my priorities lie. 
3	I agree with 4dimentionalflower, the best action is to ask him directly.\n\n> He NEVER texts first.\n\nI never text first, because I hate texting. Face to face conversations are awesome though.\n\n>Am I just a fling to him???\n\nTo be honest, my guess would be yes. The lack of active pursuit on his side plus the fact, that he gets all the goodies without any sort of commitment or effort.\n\nI had such relationships before, and saw the woman in question as a mere lover. 
1	I can‚Äôt speak for all but as an ESTJ I find that the characteristic ‚Äúdirectness‚Äù applies to flirting in more than just words, and sometimes not to words at all. If your ESTJ doesn‚Äôt have a high level of extraversion (remember some don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs more of a middle to low end statistic for them) they probably won‚Äôt straight up tell you things they like about you, they‚Äôre probably a little shy about it. But their actions will prove they‚Äôre interested in you because THOSE will be very deliberate. Examples, listening to a band you mention you like so they can talk about it with you later, making a point of going exactly where you want to go for dinner, making time to be with you and when they are with you (especially if they are super into you) dedicating every second of their attention your way. Not obsessively (hopefully) but body language can help tell you for sure. Examples, keeping their phone off the table or facing directly at you and leaning towards you rather than away from you, etc. \n\nThese sound like common courtesies but if you imagine flirting in a bar setting, it‚Äôs much more comfortable for an introvert to settle into their chair watching the basketball game than to spend the night talking to the guy/ girl next to them. So if they seem quiet but invested in you and your likes, it‚Äôs probably a good sign that this is more than just being polite. Again, not always, I don‚Äôt want to generalize, but from experience this is how it works for me.
5	What qualities of a woman are important to an ESTJ man?	What's important to you in a woman (other than, obviously, physical attraction)? \n\nOr could you give me your insight into your preferences based on the following list? Are any of these deciding points?\n\n1. Feminity - how much?\n2. Passive vs. Assertive \n3. Introvert vs. Extrovert\n4. Intelligence/education\n5. Spirituality \n6. Job/pay/ambition\n
3	MBTI doesn't go too much into this, it'll vary from person to person. Socionics delves into it a bit, however, though you have to keep in mind that an ESTJ in MBTI will most likely, but not *definitely* convert to an ESTj in Socionics. An ESTJ will sometimes be referred to as an LSE in Socionics (L as the first letter means logic [thinking] first, S means sensing second, and E means that the dominant function is extroverted).\n\nHere's a link outlying the four different "romance styles". ESTJs are under the caregiver category: http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/romance-styles/\n\nIf you're curious, though ESTJs will typically share interests with and hang out with mostly STs, the theorised ideal partners are NFPs, especially INFPs. Other STJs are also good, but there won't be much room for development and they might get bored.\n\nEDIT: I should also tell you that if you delve deeper into Socionics, some of it seems kind of, uh, strange, I guess? It's less accessible than MBTI for sure, and a lot of writing on it may make you say "I guess that makes sense but what the hell". Maybe you won't have the same experience I did, but it certainly threw me off for a moment. I don't know if this is clear, but if you do have the same experience as me, you'll understand what I'm talking about when you see it for yourself.
3	I'm an ESTJ guy. \nI'd say, ranked from highest to lowest value:\n1. Assertive over passive\n2. Intelligence \n3. Femininity\n4. Ambition\n5/6. Spirituality / introverted / extroverted
2	I'm an INTP female. I am going to say, based on my observations, that nothing would make an ESTJ man happier than seeing his woman become the embodiment of all the advice or instructions he has given. When he has successfully "developed" her into someone he perceives as better, he would feel that his project has succeeded and he has made a better person out of her. Then, he can enjoy the fruits of his labour - a woman who is very much the way he would like her to be. \n\nNaturally in today's feminist world, this is like blasphemy to some women. But, I guess if you don't like it, you can just find another man. You can observe this phenomenon with many "rich mens' wives" - the wives become the embodiment of everything their husbands consider to be attractive or feminine, down to every piece of clothing and every dramatic wrist movement. The woman is sometimes "transformed" so much after meeting the man that she is barely recognizable. But depending on her personality, she also happens to be at her happiest, and is not at all upset by the huge changes she has undergone, because she personally prefers the polished woman she has become. 
1	OMG someone please answer this! ‚úåÔ∏èI really want to know all these answers too! Estj guy: just answer it from your personal perspective PLEASE  üòá anything would help
1	I guess you mean in a romantic/sexual relationship?\n\nIn a partner it is stability. Someone who can maintain the course without going on a spontaneous rabbit hunt.\n\nIn a lover it is excitement. Good sex, witty conversations and conflict.\n\nIf I put my romantic preferences in MBTI terms, then it is: EJ > IJ > EP > IP
1	In a word, ESTJ's value submissiveness.  But they only respect a partner who can dominate them.
3	If you're into MBTI and want to discuss it 24/7	Come join the discussion!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/s62PNyP\n\nThere's a large community of people who love discussing myers briggs, enneagram, socionics, and general psychology.\n\nWe are looking for fun, interesting people like you
3	conspiracy theories	Hi, I'm doing a little research on personality types and conspiracy theories and if different personalities are drawn more towards certain conspiracy theories or if its just a completely individual thing to follow certain conspiracy theories. It would be great if you in the ESTJ community could respond to me about if you follow any conspiracy theories and if you dont. Thanks!!
6	It's fun to ridicule conspiracy theorists, and they're oftentimes very harmful towards progress in society, but in some ways, I almost admire their tenacity. Being so set on a belief and creating elaborate theories to support it for seemingly no reason requires a lot of confidence, and I find the lengths they go to simply to win an internet argument fascinating. Of course, many likely just suffer from mental illness which may predispose them to paranoia, but their persistence is frankly very impressive to me.\n\nThat being said, I find it ironic that many believe they're the only people left willing to question society's narrative while simultaneously refusing to critically evaluate the reasoning behind their own ideas. They often have plausible sounding theories for *how* everything is a lie, but they rarely stop to question *why* they should believe it. But who knows, maybe they'll hit the jackpot one day and save us all :P
2	IÔ∏è think most conspiracy theorist are idiots and assholes who are insecure fat asses. \n\nJust my personal opinion, open to discussion if someone brings up valid points. 
4	Why do some ESTJs treat their children like circus animals?	My mother is an ESTJ and guilty of this. She would occasionally exploit my talents when family came over so she could show me off for entertainment. \n\nThen when I call her out on it she pleads for me to comply..\n\n‚ÄúHoney, show everyone your amazing piano skills. Do it. Ok now stop. Play this  ___ song now.‚Äù\n\nDoes this behavior look familiar? I was curious what her motivations for this might be and if she realizes how disrespectful it is 
9	Maybe she's just proud of her child and wants to brag?
3	I'm going to preface this by saying that this is common for parents of many types, not just ESTJs. My ENxP parent frequently did this to me, whereas my ESFJ parent was pretty chill on that front.\n\nI quite enjoy having external approval and appreciation of my skills. Perhaps she thinks that you need that external approval as well, and therefore she's giving you an opportunity to show off. I usually enjoyed when my ENxP parent "showed me off". I don't think she's doing it out of malicious intent, she's likely doing it because it's the same thing she'd want to be done for her. \n\nIf you really dislike it, I'd recommend just telling her. Us ESTJs prefer it when people are direct about issues they have with us instead of holding it in like you are. If you bring it up with her in a respectful manner and tell her that you appreciate her efforts, but this isn't what you want, she'd likely stop (of course, I don't know her, she might be very stubborn). Of course, you have to figure out whether or not that's her motivation in the first place anyway.
3	My brother is an ESTJ and he is also a bit like this, he likes assigning roles to people, so he can be in control. With the family we are usually just laughing how he controls the friends like this (telling people where to sit down, to say hi to the sister, basically everything but a lot of these are just for his own entertainment). But he is an amazing and intelligent person anyway so usually we don't mind, especially when we don't take him seriously. Probably when he is going to have a child it is gonna be the same and then it is gonna cause problems or fights 
1	Well, culturally speaking, it's just an asian immigrant thing.  My parents and their friends used to do this crap and I hated it.  I highly doubt that they were all ESTJs.  The worst part is how this would make the other parents in the room jealous.  "Why can't YOU play violin as good as Nelson???  We sacrificed EVERYTHING (not really) and sent you to lessons (that I didn't want), and you shame us!"  Theme of my childhood.  Same thing can be said about piano, tennis, SAT scores, the college I went to, not being class president at school... etc..
1	Because ESTJ, while a valid MBTI type, are developmentally stunted.  They see everything in the world through their Te and Si.  If your kid isn't just like you, torture them.  It's "logical" as fuck.  They hate their own third fuction, Ne, and their 4th and inferior function Fi is a constant catalyst of self loathing.  If your ESTJ parent treats you at all like a valid human being, then you are very lucky.
1	She's probably proud of you and thinks if she doesn't push you you won't show the world your talents. If you tell her you don't like it then that's understandable. Im an INFP and I wish I had an ESTJ to do this for me.
1	Te dominants make the worst parents from my personal experience . \n\nThey treat children in a mechanical way that ruins the childs personal development so badly and creates mental blocks for the child while growing up at a sensitive age . \n
13	The ENTPs are declaring war	Hello, I am an ambassador for the ENTP subreddit and I am here to inform you that we, the ENTPs, have declared war on you and will be invading in the upcoming days. 
24	> Implying ENTPs could focus on anything long enough to actually accomplish something
11	Nobody gives a fuck
9	bring it on ESTJ love war. we are hardened utilitarian thinkers. I hope you weren't expecting any human rights in this war we are going to hollow out the chest cavities of your children and make punch bowls out of them
5	Lol
2	Get over yourselves
11	INFP checking in.	I'm an INFP and I just wanted to say that I love your type. You are my favourite (other than my own). You just care so much and are so strong. Others may see you as harsh and pushy but all I see is how much you care and it's the sweetest thing. 
9	You‚Äôre the sweetest thing, OP. I can‚Äôt speak for all ESTJs, but I really am trying to help people and have realized lately that what I do isn‚Äôt always interpreted that way. I really don‚Äôt mean to come across as cold or bossy, I‚Äôm just passionate about doing what makes the most sense. Learning to balance that passion with showing respect for other people‚Äôs viewpoints is something I‚Äôve been working on lately. 
2	Rather Cold Reaction from an ESTJ I knew well	Hey reddit,\n\nSo this ESTJ I am an acquaintance with, I haven't seen him for like 4-5 months in person, but we have kept in touch through text and phone in between for a long long time (I would say like 30 hours in between). He texted me last week to check up on how was I doing too. \n\nI ran into him today in the workplace. Except I was with my team and he was with his team. I saw him out of the corner of my eye and it took me like a 3 seconds for me to process who it was. I was surprised and said "Oh, hey." I was too taken by surprise to say anything further. He looked at me and didn't say any greeting. I just kept eyeing him. Then he asks me "which team are you on now"? (we rotate teams). I tell him. He doesn't say anything. He smirks a bit, then he looks to his side, rest of his team members arrive, and then they all take the staircase up. No goodbyes or anything. \n\nI thought this was a super strange interaction...I thought he'd be a bit happier to see me. I guess I wasn't too friendly either, but I was honestly too surprised to see him walk out of no where and see him. \n\nIs this normal? I hope the guy's not like angry at me or something. 
3	I agree seems normal to me and would be how‚Äôd I‚Äôd act
3	I agree, this is just weird.\n\nMaybe he is just shy and was so surprised, that he could not handle the situation?\n\nPersonally, I hate texting and phone calls. I prefer to meet people in person. Especially people I haven't seen in a long time, always brings me in entertainment-mode.\n\n> Is this normal? I hope the guy's not like angry at me or something.\n\nI don't know any ESTJ (and this includes myself), who is a silent rager. Usually we are more assertive and expressive. If I would be angry at you, you would know that I want your head on a pike and the reason for it. 
2	I‚Äôm an ESTJ and that seems cold to me. That‚Äôs not how I‚Äôd greet anyone I knew and hadn‚Äôt seen in a while, much less someone I‚Äôd kept in regular touch with. Even being preoccupied doesn‚Äôt seem to cover it. I don‚Äôt know that a personality type can explain all interactions - this one just seems like it was simple rudeness. \n\nEdit: ESTJs do like directness though. If you‚Äôre concerned something is off between you, I wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to ask directly. He should be able to tell you directly. 
1	As an estj, I can understand him and am pretty sure he has zero negative feelings towards you (in fact this would be possible if he felt positive towards you as well).\nOf course that is not how all estjs would do (like they most likely would say hi and "see you later"), but it is not that surprising behavior. I can totally relate to this (although I would be a little more polite wit hi/bye).\nRest assured - he has no negative feeling towards you :) (He would have not texted with you for that long otherwise. Also smirk would indicate positive feelings). It is highly possible that he even likes you as a person, not just having neutral outlook towards you. 
4	As an ESTJ parent, both of your kids are INFJ. How would you feel?	Scenario: \n\nYour SO is an irrational and spoiled stay-at-home ESFJ. Your kids played games at home all the time while you were out working. They type as INFJs. Let's say you and the kids can't have any lengthy conversations with each other because your interests or perspectives are too different. How would you feel or cope?
7	I would try to make their upbringing the best that I can for them, it's not like I'd disown my children for having a unique perspective on the world. Having different interests and perspectives doesn't mean I can't have a conversation with them, I'll try to understand their views and see if they can understand mine. Having a couple of STJ children would be great, but it's not like there would be much room for growth for either of us. I'm their parent, not their MBTI instructor.\n\nEDIT: By the way, this post sounds pretty personal. If you need to talk, whether you just need to rant or want to get some perspective on the ESTJ view of the world, go ahead.
3	The sham marriage is working as intended. Not sure why I had a sham marriage in the first place, but I probably had my reasons.\n\nWell at least the kids are judgers, so I have a real pension insurance. They can work all day while I play games at home. Or better yet, burn the money for hookers. Daddy needs his massages!
1	I'm infp, hey guys!	I think our perspectives operate very differentlyüòã
4	That's true! Sharing valued functions, however, we usually understand each other's motives, but can still provide the unique perspective just right for each other.
3	What do you get on the SimilarMinds Big 5 Personality Test?	http://similarminds.com/bigfive.html\n\nI got SCOAI, and my primary type was Organised.\n\nMy scores were:\n\nExtroversion - 60%\n\nOrderliness - 74%\n\nEmotional Stability - 68%\n\nAccommodation - 50%\n\nInquisitiveness - 70%

2	I'm a 20yr ISTP male, I hear that you guys(ESTJs) are the Ideal match for ISTPs. So in a bid to find out why, ask me anything.	
2	INFPs are actually the ideal match for ESTJs. ISTP's ideal match is ENFJ.
3	INTJ, ENTJ, INTP, or ESTJ?	I've been consistently tested as an INTJ since I first took the test several years ago, the result being the same on all the tests I've taken from 16Personalities, to the HumanMetrics, to John's Test, and to Keys2Cognition. For the years since I first took the test, I was satisfied with the INTJ typing as the description seemed to suit me well. However, I've recently began doubting this as I've began doing more investigations into other types. \n\nMost recently, I've been categorized as an xNTJ by PersonalityJunkie. In accordance with that, I've been compared many times with ENTJ characters from popular media, and they are often my favorite characters to watch as I tend to relate to them quite a bit. Having been praised throughout my life for my ability to lead, being told I'm "remarkably persuasive and charismatic" (something from a friend), and I have this deep motivation for bettering myself and the world around me. I sympathize greatly with ENTJ characteristic of mastering myself and my environment quickly, knowing that I'm in control of those things gives me comfort; feeling like I'm 'going with the flow' of another person's lead makes me uncomfortable. I tend to be a bit theatrical when expressing something I'm excited about, being animated and enunciating my words in a particular and deliberate way, but if my point is misunderstood or rejected without a good reason I can become blunt and insensitive to others, and I know that. It just feels necessary to be blunt in situations such as that. People can also become discomforted by my commanding presence when I'm expressing an idea I've thought about for a long time. Still I hold a strong love for individualism as a concept that I've evaluated on a deeper level, and deemed to be the best way of thinking from a rational point of view. I'm very much both a rational and psychological egoist. Striving only for a reasonable and logical framework to operate in, which collects an abundance of information and then converges toward a single way of doing things through inner deductive reasoning, being harsh and honest with myself by excluding any external influences. I strive to find some universal way of doing things instead of relying on multiple points of view. Furthermore I'm highly self-confident and self-motivated to make the world a better place for others and myself. I don't like being instructed on how to do things and prefer learning it on my own. Making it my own, if you will. \n\nThe INTP typing is more interesting, but I feel less likely than the ENTJ. Mostly because I've been praised as exceptionally mature emotionally and in my way of thinking over the years and tend to prefer single conclusions and a set of well-defined rules formed through assembling my own complex set of ideas, created independently in my mind. In part, I feel that I have a well developed sense of introverted thinking, or at least I'd like to think so. Assessing all the parts of a concept, asking INTP questions such as "Why does that happen?" "How does it work? "Why is it this way?" and so on and so forth to develop a deeply rational approach to everything. However, it unequivocally returns to the question of "How can I apply this to make people understand it?" or "How can I use this?" In a more -NTJ fashion. I do love the experience of learning for its own sake, but it has to be useful to me by either adding to a pre-existing foundation that is rational, or by breaking that one pre-existing one down and contributing to some new foundation. \n\nAs a review, my major characteristics, as I see them, are these:\n\n‚Ä¢Care for the improvement of both myself and the world around me.\n\n‚Ä¢Known to have a commanding presence\n\n‚Ä¢Called charismatic and persuasive\n\n\n‚Ä¢Very confident in my own abilities \n\n‚Ä¢Quite capable of, and enjoys, leading a group toward a particular goal; Leadership is something I'm eager to take up and feel very comfortable in.\n\n‚Ä¢Always keeping in mind some goal or idea for the future of what is the best and most efficient way of doing things\n\n‚Ä¢Zero tolerance for emotional or arbitrary justifications (such as irrational traditions or perceptions); will only listen to arguments based in reason\n\n‚Ä¢Almost always the leader of a conversation when I do interact with others, holding the attention on myself and driving the conversation toward particular points\n\n‚Ä¢Willing to listen to other perspectives so long as they are rational.\n\n‚Ä¢The knowledge I gather has to have some application which is useful to me, either personally in the pursuit of knowledge for its own usefulness, or in the workplace where I can use it to refine or reform my present strategies or approaches. I'm able to adapt to changes if a new idea is better or more efficient than the current one. \n\n‚Ä¢Tend to spend a lot of time alone, pondering new ideas or refining old ones that I've developed independent of external influences. \n\n‚Ä¢Long-term planner, usually with a single, flexible, and complex plan. Knowing exactly how to reach the goal I want to. Not concerned particularly with any one part, but more how the sum of the total amount of parts interact with each other to create the exact function I want. In business this takes the form of stock market investment, a high paying career, efficient management of finances, and capitalizing on my confidence, charisma and calculating nature to reach new heights at a rapid pace.\n\n‚Ä¢Hold myself to a certain integrity or code of honest.\n\n‚Ä¢Creator of my own set of well-defined rules that have been endured the process of being ripped apart by my way of thinking and tested as being rational and legitimate; doesn't like disorder, uncertainty, or arbitrariness in how things are run. Everything needs to point toward one particular goal.\n\n‚Ä¢Fiercely independent and can become discontent or even antagonistic toward a particular way of doing something if it is inefficient or significantly flawed.\n\nMy strongest function has almost always been my iNtuiton, never dropping below 50% over the years, while my Introversion has been the weakest, never going above 30% on any metrics. I have a tendency to sit back and zone out deep in thought often if the current conversation bores me or I just have time alone to do so. Connecting not only to the philosophy I'll mention here as well, but also to the supposedly crude/dark sense of humor seen in Ni types. I have a dark sense of humor and can be sarcastic too. I have a vivid image of who i want to be and where I'd like to be. Which is either being extremely wealthy, living alone, spending a lot of free time studying or writing, and having connections in elite circles, or alternatively pursuing a career in politics by transforming the playing field and striving toward my vision of the most desirable society I see in my mind. I also see everything as being connected in a rational way, often achieved through my passion for philosophy and particularly with metaphysics, free will, ethics, and mind. I also have a strong skepticism to me. Lastly, while I am confident and charasmatic, I have a penchant for sticking to the back of a room and thinking before I speak. Sometimes not at all if it isnt that important. I deliberately set myself apart from the group. Im currently in college, and i sit at empty tables both in class and in the dining hall by choice normally, and prefer talking to the people next to me or small groups usually with a focus on philosophical, political, organizational, or general interests. I tend to be much more assertive when expressing an idea though. Can even be theatrical in the presentation of a grand vision I have. I'm competitive in that I see debates as a testing of both mind and will, and find that experience to be exciting. \n\nI think that about covers it, what do you guys think I am?

3	A little heartbreak with an ESTJ	I am going to be a bit sentimental, I'm sorry in advance!\n\nYesterday, in a pretty confused state, I wrote this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESTJ/comments/71omwi/dating_question_to_estj_men/) about going on dates with this ESTJ. And you guys gave me good feedback. \n\nTo summarize the post - I hit it off with this ESTJ guy, who was sincere, sweet, and very expressive. It was very obvious we both felt the click. We kissed on all three dates. However, he wouldn't initiate or send a text after each of our dates. You guys gave me good feedback, mostly saying that the ESTJ is definitely interested, and ESTJs aren't usually good at texting/small talk. It made sense, so I just took the advice.\n\nToday, I found out that in the last three days, he's changed his pictures on a dating profile. This indicated to me that he's actually not looking for anything serious with me. \n\nI was actually devastated. I know it's only been three dates, but the connection was great and mutual (unless I am totally fooling myself). \n\nI guess I'm just venting because I've never done "casual dating" myself where I get physical with a man but look for other men at the same time. It sucks to know that whatever I had with this guy, he was probably not very serious about.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to vent. Would love to hear any feedback/words/comments... I'm a sappy sad gal tonight.
6	I'm sorry.\n\nYou might be reading too much into it like the other commenter said, but I think your reasoning is grounds to be worried. If I were you, I'd just send him a text to find out where you stand with him. Worst case scenario, you both go your separate ways, which is going to happen if you don't initiate contact anyway.\n\nWishing you the best.
3	He changed his pictures? That's what you're basing your devestation on?\n\nI think you're reading too much into it.
4	Sounds like he likes you but he's still keeping his options open, as you guys aren't a couple. My husband's an ESTJ and he was doing the same thing before we were an official couple.
3	To be honest, from your last post, if he doesn‚Äôt initiate then he‚Äôs not as into it as you are. He might be into it but just not as deeply as you‚Äôre thinking. Of course, it sucks not to be on the same ‚Äúpage‚Äù in the relationship. \n\nSource: ESTJ female. I gladly, gladly initiate and ‚Äúdouble text‚Äù to people who are just friends, let alone someone I‚Äôm interested in. 
4	Infp lurking o.o	Just thought I'd check up on my ESTJ counterparts üòâ
3	hello am also infp >u>
3	INFPs are pretty great üëå
1	Dating question to ESTJ men	Hi, I'm an INFJ woman who's now dated 2 ESTJ men. I kinda get the gist of you guys! \n\nRecently I met another ESTJ man, with whom I had an instant romantic connection with. It was obvious he was attracted as well since he was really engaged in the convo, went for a kiss several times during our first date, etc. He's 32, I'm 31.\n\nWe met twice more after the first date. He was equally very caring and expressive in his interest. Unless I'm fooling myself, I'm pretty sure our interest is mutual. \n\nThe problem is that he's kind of a... "out of sight, out of mind" type. While our dates are REALLY good, he never texts or calls first after these dates!\n\nI initiated texting twice now and already getting sick of it. When I text him first, he does reply relatively promptly. He asks to hang out, too. But again, after we hang out, texts drop. He doesn't intiate, basically.\n\nESTJ men - does this mean he's just not that into me?\n\nNeed a reality check.\n
7	He's replying promptly, so he's likely interested in you. Keep after him. Two things:\n\n- I know that I tend to get busy with whatever's in front of me while I'm at work, and intend to call/text "as soon as I have a few minutes".. but then suddenly it's bedtime and I realize I didn't call/text. "Dammit! Okay, tomorrow for sure!"\n\n- Also, I'm kinda shitty at small talk so I tend to not initiate conversation unless I have a specific question / announcement.\n\nGood luck.
4	Not initiating texting is completely normal behaviour. He's - from what I can gather - totally into you.
3	I think waiting for the other person is the usual estj tactic. Can‚Äôt say it for your position since I‚Äôm a girl estj, but waiting for the guy is easier so looks like you might just have to go for it 
1	Would not worry about it at all
1	Do you play games? If so, what do you play?	What do ESTJs think of video or computer games? Do you play them? What do you play?
3	I love games! I mostly play strategy based games, fighting games and jrpg's. I like Pok√©mon the most. I also play persona and danganronpa. Smash is fun to play with friends.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I am an enormous achievement whore.
2	I mostly have Nintendo stuff. I have a PS4 for good third party games that don't go to Nintendo consoles, but Nintendo games are usually better for entertaining guests and playing with others.\n\nI've been skipping out on more games as time has gone on, but I've played the Splatoon franchise very consistently since the first game came out in 2015. I invested a ridiculous amount of time, like, I think over 1500 hours into the first game. I've been playing less Splatoon 2 than I played 1 when it was released, but the game came out maybe 2 months ago and I've invested well over 100 hours into it and reached all the top ranks.\n\nThere's just something about the Splatoon games that I really love. It's the only game that I've ever been interested in competitively, so maybe it's just the fact that I feel really confident in my skills, which is rare for a shooter. But I think it's more than that. I don't know really, there's just something about this game that makes me so happy.
1	I'm a big sports fan, specifically sports management games. Although not recently, I've logged several hundred hours in the Football Manager franchise. Now, I'm playing Wolverine Studios College Basketball 17. Also a lot of FIFA, GTA V, Rainbow Six Siege, and CS:Go, Day of Defeat, GMod type games. 
2	ESTJ keeps asking me for advice...	Hey Reddit,\n\nThere is an ESTJ who keep asking me for advice. He is a foreign born and isn't confident in his English, and I helped with his grammar in an essay one time (b/c I felt bad for him). \n\nBut now he keeps on asking me again and again for help, it's now going extreme -everything from essay writing to letter writing to interview advice to even social etiquette. It's way too overwhelming - I spent over 30 hours talking to him about all this! I should seriously be paid for helping this much. I can't reject him because technically we are "friends", but it really is too much. \n\nHe isn't very considerate of my time commitments either. I even told him once I can speak to him BRIEFLY about something, but he still ended up discussing with me for 50 minutes. In the middle I kept reiterating ask me later, I can talk to you about this some more after I'm not so busy.  But he STILL didn't get the message, and kept on fixating on his details. \n\nWhat do I do? He just doesn't "get the message" and is what I would consider insensitive.  
5	I ask for a *lot* of advice when I'm not confident in something, as I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly.\n\nDon't tell him you'll help out later if you can't help out later, tell him that you don't have time if you feel that you don't have time. We're a very direct bunch, and we don't like it when people give vague answers, so make sure you're explicit and clear in your intentions.
1	Holy persitant! Stick with what you tell him. If you're busy and you can't talk then, thats that. Let him know as you have been and get back when it's convenient for you. 
4	Do you ever give advice to people without being asked?	I have an ESTJ friend who does it very often. He analyzes my lifestyle and "finds a solution" that would only work if I was him... I mean can only see the world through his own eyes and values... I usually have zero tolerance for such a thing but he is the kind of person that wouldn't mind harshest criticism on his own lifestyle so we get along and express our real thoughts without any feel hurt. I'm an INTJ by the way.
5	When people tell me their troubles, I kind of leap to the conclusion that they *want* my advice. I figure that if they want emotional support, they'll likely just go to someone else. I'll give emotional support when something bad has happened to someone  (I probably will try to start brainstorming ways in which they can help themselves, however), not if it's a problem that they've created in their own mind ("I think this person hates me", "I feel like people are drifting away from me", "I'm worried about the future"), in which case I try to give practical solutions.\n\nTwo people that often go to me for support are an INFP and an ISFP. They both have a LOT of feelings. When I try to give the ISFP my advice, she gets frustrated that I'm trying to give her advice when I don't know her situation, but then I feel frustrated because I don't why she came to me in the first place. The INFP comes to me for advice and *actually takes my advice*. I like helping him out, as he wants another unique perspective on the situation, and though he is a gentle soul, he appreciates the advice I give him and tries to implement it.\n\nGenerally, I could try harder to be more emotionally supportive, but I just get confused as to why I need to be. I'm consciously aware of this issue. However, deep down, I have my issues and struggles and feelings too, I just don't feel the need to take them out on other people, I make solutions. It pisses me off when I get told that I just can't understand, because most of the time, I have similar feelings, I just don't want to bother other people with them. Because of this, they think I'm some emotionless robot and it kind of stings. I'm aware of this flaw in my character, but it still frustrates me.
5	Always. It's difficult for me not to when my friends or family members present a problem. My instinct is to find ways to solve it or tell them what I would do if I was in the situation...not necessarily a good thing, but it's usually my instinct. I'm not a robot, but it's certainly easier for me to propose logical solutions than it is to say "There, there! Cry it all out. Let's all cry." I prefer "Okay, what he did was terrible. You can either do this or this. You didn't do anything wrong, if you look at everything you said, it was right..." it's easier to logically analyze situations and provide advice, even when not asked. For me, at least, that is. 
2	It's Saturday night; let's share some interests.	It's Saturday night and I can't be at home cause I travel for work, constantly.  Ergo, I don't have my normal entertainments with me and am going to reach out to everyone here.  What are some interests we might share?  The easiest place to start might be subreddits.  I don't mean /r/Dentistry because you're studying to be a Dentist, nor /r/dankmemes because.. well, who doesn't like dank memes?\n\nI want to know what the filler subreddits are for you.  The ones you subscribe to because you're interested in them and now they kinda fill the void between the subreddits you mainline, like pocket change you find every time you pull your wallet out.\n\nMe?  I'm a big fan of /r/MovieDetails because I'm constantly analyzing a movie 'universe' throughout films and I like seeing what they point out and/or I have seen/missed personally.  I like to peruse /r/mechanical_gifs because they're fun to watch and I like learning about new types of gears and how things actually work (turns out, it's not all magic...).  I check up on /r/explainlikeimfive cause, frankly, I like learning and understanding new things and lastly (for this post) /r/PictureGame because I'm fascinated with the whole game and, while I don't think I'm clever enough to win a round, I like to see how people decipher and solve each one.\n\nWhat are some of yours?  What are some we all might be interested in checking out?

1	My story	I may be something of a unique situation here, I'm an ESTJ (Phew! Can finally say it!) raised by an ENFP mother, and probably surrounded by other feelers (dad and bro, both Fi driven fosure!) who had such an influence from his mother, that when he tested ENFP the first time he took the test, like a true ESTJ continued to identify with the "ENFP" all his life since (at least a decade), to the point that he Googled "ENFP" and wrote down the points listed under personalitypage's Strengths/Weaknesses when he had to list them out for his first job interview, I still remember them (Strives for Win-Win situations, which I thought was the awesomest part of the ENFP),\n\nand like a true ESTJ made ENFP and intuitive friends with whom he always felt like he was more grounded, not really "like the others", but the ENFP profile said that "they are rare", and they "feel different from the crowd" (something on those lines), well that must be why. Especially the former, ENFPs, they flocked to him, and he bossed them around, with love and practicality "You have such a strong Te" they said with bunny eyes and such innocent faith in the claimed MBTI result,\n\nuntil well he finally began to realize that something was REALLY off, that he was getting along with sensors, better, wanted a traditional wife, valued family, friends, and society, was FAR too stable and grounded, and practical, and began to seriously study the types, until Si led depression (heart break, inability to forgive harshness of self) led him to pursue Astrology for a year and a half, all day, everyday, until he could remember everything, and probably predict your chart just by looking at you (no seriously I will need your details, but I have done it TWICE) because he one day wondered, while dope high (only respite during trying times, after a hard day at work) if the moon could raise the seas, can it not affect us?\nwas convinced by an ENFP friend that he was NOT an ESTJ because she didn't say so, and like a true ESTJ, began to think he was indeed an ENFP with too strong Te, SHOULD develop DAT Fi, spent the Astrology year trying to IDENTIFY self, blamed everyone for nothing, and became a 5 year old (3 as per some estimates) for the next year and a half, DESPITE astrology telling him the SAME thing - Dude your Te SO HIGH, it goes outside this software.\n\nuntil he convinced himself he was an ENTP till last night, took a test on Values (by psychology today), and for the umpteenth time scored HIGH on social, traditional, theoretical, and realistic values.\nSo ladies and gentlemen, as a fully realized ESTJ who can safely say he was on the other side and beyond, hello!\n\nPS - I found this gem of a podcast this morning, (https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/09/17/the-childhood-struggles-of-every-myers-briggs-type/), and an article stating the kind of childhood an ESTJ child would thrive in (https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/09/17/the-childhood-struggles-of-every-myers-briggs-type/), as well as what hell is (https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/05/the-definition-of-hell-for-each-myers-briggs-personality-type/). xD
6	ENTP here! Married to an ESTJ...\n\nMan, you don't sound super ESTJ to me... but maybe that's because you talked about being into astrology for a year, and I know my husband thinks both astrology and MBTI is bullshit. Same with almost every ESTJ I've come across. You seem waaaay too introspective. Maybe because of your ENFP upbringing? For the record, my ESTJ husband tested once as an ENFP and once as an ENTP! So, anything's possible. \n\nYou just don't come across as a Sensor to me.\n\nNow, the functions are all about preferences, not necessarily the conclusions of those preferences. So, not saying you haven't considered these things already, but let me ask you... when you think about a concept, are you interested in its possibilities or its tangible reality? Are you focused on the present, or are you interested in the future? A year ago, we had professional typing done at work. The psychologist broke us into groups based on the dichotomies. She put the intuitives on one side, and the sensors on the other, and asked both our groups to define "time". The intuitives wrote things like "fleeting", "cruel", "illusory", where the sensors wrote "a measure", "clock". \n\nSo, what do you prefer? Abstraction or what's concrete? \n\nEither way, ESTJs can be wonderfully supportive people, forming the bedrock of communities when they're not being nitpicky and controlling. If that's you, use your powers for good ;) But also this ESTJ space is rather dead... I take it many ESTJs may not be very interested in MBTI or self analysis...\n
2	Do you often find yourself using analytical judgement to compensate for a lack of sentimental judgement?	I'm asking this to test a theory CelebrityTypes has that people often use their main function in place of their inferior function when faced with matters which would require the engagement of said function. For example, if a Fe-dom was asked if socialism was logically valid, the Fe-dom may respond "Well socialism has objectively good goals, so on that basis, yes it is logically valid."
4	I don't think you're going to get a whole lot of responses to this question until people here are confident they can give you a reliable and educated answer.  Understanding that my formal education in psychology/psychoanalysis and familiarity with CelebrityTypes is limited to non-existent, I'll shoot from the hip on this one.\n\nI do not agree with using the word 'compensate' in this question, but that may be a personal preference rather than valid semantic argument.  While it may be true that the ESTJ model does not tend to associate inter-personally through emotional display, I don't think that is grounds to discredit the effects of emotion on judgement.  Rather than *compensate* for a lack of sentimental judgement, it is more appropriate to say that an ESTJ would value or rely on their analytical judgement **despite** their sentimental judgement.\n\nI have found in my life that my first check on the validity of something is my gut feeling and emotional response.\n\nSomeone suggests doing something I know is wrong:  how do I feel about that?\n  \n * Scared (of getting in trouble)\n * Angry (that they would even suggest breaking the rules)\n * Helpless (that others seem to agree with the suggestion)\n * Betrayed (that they would be willing to get the rest of us in trouble as well)\n\nNow we move to analytical.  Why do I feel that way?  Cause I was raised that way?  Cause I was taught that way?  Cause my last boss mentored me to trust my instincts?  Why are they suggesting this thing despite it being wrong?  Am I incorrect?  In what way could I be incorrect?  Can't figure out how I am wrong, develop counter-arguments.  Present counter-arguments.  Process responses.  Repeat process (starting with emotional response, depending on the type of response).\n\nSentimental judgement as a decision or reality making process is an *inferior* process to this type, not a non-existent one.  Dealing with my daughters is a constant rollercoaster of sentimental judgement, augmented and solidified with analytical judgment. I believe the most common response you've gotten to these types of questions is that the dominant does not replace the inferior, but rather overtakes the inferior once the inferior has been taxed, threatened, or simply cannot keep up with the demands of the situation.  \n\nIf I, as a response, feel a certain way about something and attempt to use that to develop judgement, that method is quickly taxed (for me in particular) and I will revert to supporting my judgement with further analytical judgement.  Only in the extremes of this, in which cases I cannot find reason in why I feel a way about something, will I cease to feel at all and disassociate my sympathetic response with my analytical judgement.
4	How do you guys joke?	What do you joke about? And do people reciprocate? And were you socially awkward as a kid? 
6	My work life and home life have very different aspects of joking about.  Throughout both though, I'd say that just blatantly stating reality (or perhaps a slightly facetious version of it) at just the right time to get a laugh is my preferred method.  Most often, people do reciprocate, because most often I'm around like-minded people and rarely does it go over their heads.  When I do present that dry humor to some other people I know (like family) they usually just take it at face value and/or seem confused until I tell them "it's ok, it's a joke" and then we can all laugh about it.\n\nOnly example I can think of right now is when my daughter shouted, "I don't care!" at the top of her lungs and stormed off during a work/friends party, it kinda caught everyone off guard for a second.  My boss and I looked at one another and he said, "I don't think she cares," and went back to drinking his beer.  That was a good laugh all around.\n\nAs for being socially awkward as a kid, definitely, even if I didn't realize it then.  I look back and definitely cringe at things I did. It took me until adulthood to realize that I had little to no friends as a child; something I attribute heavily to my parents' style of... parenting.  Causation? Correlation?  I don't know.  I know I had a singular friend I preferred to spend time with and no one else from elementary school until I was almost out of high school though.  I didn't like social gatherings, pep rallies, formals, or just dealing with other people in general.  It was just easier to do my own thing.
2	very socially awkward, but even when people hated me they couldn't resist my sense of humor.\n\nwe joke with all systems go balls to the wall both barrels ernesty at all times. very vigorous and loud. our sense of humor is amplified by groups which we will gravitate to the center of....unles there is anotehr funny man in the group in which case we will fight for dominance and one of us will absolutely be leaving that circle of friends sooner or later

3	ESTJ psychology majors/careers?	Hi, visitor. I'm curious about your thoughts towards majoring in psychology and what career paths you've chosen for those that have studied it.\n\nAre there any of you that chose career in counseling/mentorship roles or leadership roles? how did it help/hinder your progress and role in your job?
2	It seems like ESTJ's would be inclined to be good life coaches.  The thought process involves looking at problems and quickly determining solutions based on data for what has and hasn't worked in the past.  This could be used to help people solve their problems, establish and work towards goals, and approach things from a fresh perspective.

5	How do you dig out when you bury yourself too deep in details? What's the process like? Examples?	I have an ESTJ friend for whom I feel a lot of empathy. The guy is consistently buried by project details at work. He's getting them all done, but he is doing most of them by himself. We laugh and joke around a lot when we hang out, but I'm concerned about his stress levels and I don't really know if he just needs an ever-present pile of things to fix in order to feel like his best self, or if he could use some help fixing the ever-present pile of things to fix by setting some kind of reasonable boundaries. I can't think of another person in the world who could juggle the tasks he does while also holding others accountable as needed, and I'm sure his employer would gladly let him take more time off, take things at a slower pace, etc.\n\nHave you ever been completely buried and then set a boundary with another person or employer to get out of it? Do you do that sometimes? Often? Not much? Thanks.
4	He probably gets a lot of self-worth from these tasks. I know that if I don't have a lot of responsibility at work I feel really shitty... almost as if I'm not important. What happens after that is I start to get insecure about my worth and then I make it my mission to get on top of it all again, usually by throwing myself at ALLTHETASKSEVER! \n\nI don't have good advice here because I'm literally exactly like your friend. Lately, I've been feeling more and more stressed out (I work for a software company on a development team and I'm averaging 50 hour work weeks the past few weeks). I know I need to take stuff off my plate, but the thought of letting go seems not worth it because I believe it'll make life harder for me later. Or even the idea of training someone to help me seems like a waste of time because I could spend that time just doing it. Logically I know it makes sense to invest that kind of time so that I can take a break, but there's something in me that just won't let it go. I've been doing this for about 3 years straight and I'm just now starting to feel like I'm reaching some sort of limit. I'm assuming that's probably a lot longer than others would be willing to go, but I think it's just how I'm wired. The most insane part? All it takes is getting some sort of formal appreciation or acknowledgement from higher-ups and then I'm even more driven and the stress has melted away. 
1	If he does as you say, then he probably will need release when his stress levels hit high, if he doesn't already have a system in place for release, that's probably when he'd need you, or someone who can help him.\n\nESTJs learn best from experience, if you're or someone is there to catch him when he (hopefully not) falls, he will be grateful to you or the person, and will make sure to not let it happen in the future.\n\nGood luck! <3\n\nKeep us posted!
3	My son is an ESTJ	My son is only 3 years old so still quite young but his personality is quite developed for one so young. His personality screams ESTJ. Do you guys and gals have an ly advice on how you would have best responded to being parenting. Like what would you have responded best to (what do you wish your parents did for you/ to you as a kid that would have been a more positive experience for you)
7	LOL are you serious... I would hope that he's not fully developed at three and is still going to go through changes as he grows up. But if you really want to know, I think it would just be nice to have a parent who is there for you, listens to you, encourages you, etc.
7	How do ESTJ's show love and affection?	I am an ISFP and I'm pretty sure my gf is an ESTJ. It's very hard for me at times, because I really feel like she isn't all that in to me. We've made some pretty bold moves that one would only rationally do if they were truly in love, yet she very really seeks intimacy, in words and touch. She is also abrasive and I do feel judged at times by her. Yet, there are those moments where you just know she actually loves you. Plus we enjoy each other's company and play sports, workout, and play games together. So we enjoy all the same things. We rarely fight, if at all. \n\n\nHow, as an ESTJ, do you show your partner love? 
12	If I'm in love, I take my commitment to that person very seriously and will try hard to make the relationship work. I might not say sweet nothings in your ear but you should be able to tell through my actions. I might say things that can hurt your feelings at times or sound judgmental but if I'm trying to help you to work on yourself or trying to make our relationship better, I love you.\n\nPhysical affection and touch are also important but usually only in private. Not big on PDA.
5	In my experience, they're acts of service people. They show love through commitment and actions that make your life more convenient. I find it really adorable.
1	You might want to read about "semi-duality" relations in socionics for some tips (some discussion [here](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/11732-ESI-LSE-Semi-Duality-Relations-(ISFj-and-ESTj)). This is the type of relationship that ISFPs and ESTJs have.   \n   \n> yet she very really seeks intimacy, in words and touch. She is also abrasive and I do feel judged at times by her.   \n    \nI wonder if she is enneagram type 1 or 8. These are the 'gut' types that tend to be somewhat on abrasive and critical side.
1	They don't.\n\n...At least not outwardly.
2	Which non-introvert type pairs well with an ESTJ in a romantic relationship?	I am a pretty textbook ESTJ and recently broke up with someone I suspect was an ESFJ...it was very amazing for awhile. My ex before her was an INTJ, which was a lot more difficult and less rewarding.\n\nIs there a non-introvert type that pairs well with ESTJ romantically? Most of the cookie-cutter guides suggest I types, but they drive me insane.
3	Well I'm an INFP who's pretty happy with an ISTJ. So maybe an ENFP could work for you? ISFPs are also fairly social for introverts. May I ask what irritated you about I's?
5	Well, that depends on what you're looking for. If you want an extrovert, you're going to have to choose if you want Se, Ne, Fe, or Te, and which auxiliary function Fi, Ti, Ni, or Si, you think you would personally pair well with. If Judger/perciever is important to you, perceivers have either Ne or Se with an aux Fi or Ti, and judgers have Fe/Te with aux Ni/Si. Do you think you'd do best with a thinking or feeling type? Do you want an intuitive or a sensor? ESFJs can be a good match, because both tend to be neat and orderly and concerned with practical matters. I wouldn't suggest two ESTJs in a relationship, as it can get competitive and combative quick (Te). However, both tend to be dutiful if that's important to you. If you're looking for perspective and emotional support, ENFJs pretty much pair well with anyone. Upside: ENFJs and ESTJs don't use any of the same functions, so you could learn a lot from them. Downside: you might not understand each other as well as you'd like to if you don't make communication a priority. I would not recommend ENTJs and ESTJs, as I mentioned above it could be too much Te but not enough connection with Ni/Si. It depends on how well developed the Ne/Se is.\nAs far as percievers go, I wouldn't recommend ESFPs who would take Te criticism to heart, or ENFPs who will have big dreams and ideas but not always the desire to realize them (which may frustrate the ESTJ). ENFPs aren't typically good at keeping up with everyday tasks and chores, which might annoy the ESTJ. ENTP or ESTP would be a good match. Both are fun and tend to have witty senses of humor, but aren't usually too sensitive and won't usually get offended by criticism. They also tend to be adventurous and open to trying new things, which helps ESTJs get out of their comfort zones. Overall, I'd recommend EXTP or EXFJ.
3	I love my ENFP bestie and would happily date someone of that type. Just my 2 cents
3	The 'ideal' matches happen along the lines of having same cognitive functions in common. The logic here is very simple: having same cognitive functions means that you and your significant other have similar interpretations and similar values in life, that when you say A they understand A and not interpret it as B, and that they also value A same as you. This increases compatibility in any relationship, from romantic to professional.        \n     \nFor ESTJ the functional set it {Te,Si,Ne,Fi}. The types that match all of these functions are ENFP, INFP, and ISTJ, out of which only ENFP is extraverted.   \n    \nAs for which type is supposed to be the ideal match for ESTJ romantically, it is the INFP. Although it's not extraverted, INFP shares every single cognitive function of ESTJ in exactly yet opposite order, making them be the 'yin' and 'yang' of each other, or two opposing halves of the same integral type. In socionics this relationship type is called duality relations and it is described under the [EII-LSE section](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Duality_observations#Delta_Duality_Relations:_ISTp_.2B_ENFp_.3B_INFj_.2B_ESTj) for INFPs and ESTJs.\n
2	My estj sister in law is pretty much perfect for my estp brother. They have a lot in common, but my brother really helps her relax and enjoy life more. And she provides him with some guidance/structure when he needs it. They're very social, athletic and family oriented and they're able to have a lot of fun together because their interests/values are so similar. 
2	ENTP here married to an ESTJ. \n\nMost sources will tell you it shouldn't work, but I like that we can discuss things and that our relationship is focused on building each other up and not wishy washy mushy stuff. \n\nThe downside is that my sporadic, unconventional, and haphazard thought process and way of behaving makes him uneasy, and his need to correct and control drives me nuts. But, if you are aligned in terms of values and life goals it can work well as we both have strengths and weaknesses that kinda equal each other out. Essentially, I think ENTPs and ESTJs have a lot to learn from one another, but I would only enter into that relationship if you're mature and ready to learn from the other person. 
2	MBTI/Ennegram Server	It's frustrating talking to people who are completely ignorant about personality type and most people are.

13	I really love the CelebrityTypes description of ESTJs	http://www.celebritytypes.com/estj-description.php\n\nI've read a lot of type descriptions for ESTJs, and this one seems to be the best for me. It cuts out on the stuff I usually disagree with ["ESTJs hate being proven wrong and other people's ideas" "ESTJs hate any abstract concept" "ESTJs are hardcore traditionalists"], and adds more depth to the ESTJ character than most sites do. There were parts of the description that gave me a hearty laugh because they were just so accurate to me. I feel like xSTJs, and to a lesser extent, Sensors in general, are kind of shat all over when it comes to type descriptions, so this made me very happy to read.\n\nParts I particularly agreed with:\n\n> Even though ESTJs are extroverts, they can often be a bit more reserved than the other E types. They tend to enjoy talking and engaging others, but can oftentimes struggle with situations where there are no logical parameters to grab hold of, or where emotional self-expression is expected of them.\n\n> They tend to view everything in an impersonal manner, even themselves to some extent\n\n> They tend to dislike ambiguity and unresolved states that drag on for too long, and can at times evince a preference for simply committing to some decision or applying whatever solution that's on hand now instead of waiting indefinitely for a slightly better one. \n\n> The irony is that most ESTJs actually appreciate it when someone drills down with them to discover the best solution. In their minds, it is reasonable to expect that if someone is sitting on a better solution, he or she should speak up and push back a little and not just sit there holding their tongue.\n\n> ESTJs often have a dry and cutting sense of humor, where they make an art form out of stating the plain truth in an exacting, yet tongue-in-cheek way. \n\n> Deep down, most ESTJs know that they are more logical and objective than most and that forcing others to live up to their own high standards would very often just end in tears.\n\n> ESTJs can also often be counted on to break the ice or alleviate tensions in awkward situations.\n\n> It can sometimes be daunting for others to feel that they have to evince these qualities around the ESTJ, but on the other hand, many of those same people will often feel a sense of reassurance with an ESTJ at the helm of whatever they are doing.
6	I've written replies to this post like 6 times, which all meander off onto my own tangents. But yes! It's nice to get away from the whole 'traditionalist' or 'stodgy asshat' descriptions and step a little more into the actual ESTJ experience. Refreshing! And way more welcoming. No one wants to repeatedly read 'you're boring and you're a bully'.
1	I have ADHD and my other half is an ESTJ. Will it work?	I have ADHD and I'm ISFP. I am so disorganised, forgetful and have struggled for years with finances, holding down jobs and overcoming my many shortfalls. \nI've lived with my ESTJ boyfriend for three years - and it's been hell. Sheer fucking hell. He's a nagging, nit-picking, soul-sucking twerp. \nBut we also have the best fun. \nWe laugh our heads off together and he keeps me going because I learn from him and my friends say it's changed me for the better.\nBut is the relationship ultimately doomed? Is it best to go our separate ways now because our dynamic is not sustainable? He gets so annoyed with me for everything while I just get more depressed and go into my own world (until it's the weekend again and we're having fun again...)\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences? Thanks for any words of wisdom x
6	ESTJ here-\n\nThis sounds like the kind of relationship that is good to learn from on both sides, but won't last. If you describe your three years living together as "hell" what about marriage? Having children? Even if you don't do either of those things, "hell" is not a good way to live your life. If you only have fun on the weekends, it's not a good relationship.
1	It can work but it's not just your diagnoses that make a good match. I'm ESTJ and my hubby is both ADHD and INFP. you have to make a lot of compromises and understand how the other person works and feels.
1	I am estj and have adhd myself. I tend to be pretty critical of all the symptoms that come along with adhd, but medication makes me super neurotic and angry. I can deal with it within myself, but if those two aspects of myself *could* be separated, it would definitely be easier. 
1	I'm an ENFP with ADD dating an ESTJ. \n\nMy ESTJ is "in charge" of all of the logistics of our lives, but has never once put me down for being bad at that stuff. She looks at me like I'm a magic fairy that she is so happy to get to be around, and I look at her like she's this captain of competence and success. There's so much mutual respect. \n\nThe problems in your relationship aren't because your boyf is an ESTJ; it's because he's a dick. Tell him that you love the way that he helps you get your life back in order [or whatever], but that you don't want to be in a relationship where you're made to feel less-than and nit-picked. Have healthy conversations about what you need, and hear what he needs from you. If he's not willing to soften his tone with you, though, (or whatever it is you need to not feel soul-sucked) then it's not the relationship for you
7	Hello, new found ESTJ from a friend who told me about this stuff. The profile is scary accurate and I'm really interested in this now. But the main question I have is in regard to marriage and kids. I have absolutely no desire to get married or have kids. Is there anyone else that has shares that?	
3	Hahaha that's exactly what I say, so hopefully I don't end up meeting someone like you (no offense) lol. But
3	I'm personally on the fence I'm not actively pursuing either of these but wouldn't turn them away if they fell in my lap either 
2	I will never marry, don't like the push behind it from the community. And you can be 20 years married, 25 years together and people forget the 5 years before being married. Strange. \nAbout children; I'm a last minute mom. Never wanted them, then I met this amazing safe person with no drama. 
2	Fair enough, marriage is a scam
3	Not fitting ESTJ stereotypes	**ESTJ, Self-Preservation 8w7**\n\nI receive this typing often but those who've typed me don't know that I break some big stereotypes / have some characteristics which most ESTJs don't possess\n\n**Bossy, controlling, natural leader**\n\nI'm good at leading / managing ppl but I don't always want to lead unless I know I'll excel (ie if I suck at biology I won't lead a group project). When I lead I'm not bossy / controlling I just get things done quickly and efficiently\n\n**Blunt and confrontational**\n\nI'm aware of what's rude so I don't have the tendency to say things that can offend others. I'm not all that straight forward to prevent drama. I don't confront / get into conflict with ppl Idk often bc I'm uncomfortable arguing with ppl Idk unless it's online. I believe not confronting others is mainly due to appearance insecurities bc I'm quite confrontational and open to conflict online\n\n**Sensitive to criticism**\n\nI'm often described as defensive bc ppl will say something that wasn't meant to be rude but I'd take it the wrong way and get pissed. Criticism doesn't make me sad it just makes me really mad. I believe this is due to narcissism\n\n**Easily stressed**\n\nESTJs are stereotyped to be very high achieving and can handle working a lot but I get stressed easily and frequently. I find myself most stressed when I can't get things done quickly and have time to relax\n\n**Lazy, slightly hedonistic**\n\nI get all my work done but I just put in enough effort to barely get As. I have all As but I don't take honors or advanced classes bc I want to do little work and enjoy life. Though I want to enjoy life I still take obligations seriously\n\n**Comfortable with my emotions**\n\nWhen I find myself upset I allow myself to cry and wallow in my emotions. I just won't allow others to see me crying\n\n**Can I still be ESTJ (SP 8w7) with these characteristics?**

2	Hello! It is I, an ENTP!	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion? Thank you!
5	This sub is pretty quiet, so I'll bite, but I have no idea if my answers would be 'typical of an ESTJ'. It might just be me.\n\nI'm extremely cautious about romance and I would really need to be friends before I could even drum up romantic interest.  You know that game where you people watch and say yes or no to each person who walks by? I always say no.\n\nFor a friend, just any kind of casual offer would do, I suppose. Because we're friends. If we're both flirting and testing the waters, great. If I smell that someone is interested when I'm not, I tend to keep my distance. I don't believe in feeding the pigeons. I think it's cruel and I avoid it when I can.\n\nFor a stranger, I might be flattered, but no. In fact, I find it a turn off. I actively do not want to have a relationship with someone who propositions strangers in a bar. That screams of an invitation for out of control drama to me.
2	Ahem.\n\nI'm also an ENTP, but married to an ESTJ.\n\nMy husband asked me out. I got the sense he was the take charge and ask the person out type. But he was quite awkward about it. Though, he seemed to appreciate being clear and straightforward and having a date that included an activity. \n\n
2	What description of ESTJs have you found to be most accurate to you?	For me, it's [this one](http://www.bestfittype.com/16Types/ESTJ.cfm) (make sure you scroll down, there's a bit more). There are a couple of little things that I didn't agree with 100%, but otherwise, it almost seemed like something I would write about myself. I'm interested to see other descriptions that you all found to be true to you.\n
3	Michael Pierce's videos [here](https://youtu.be/Y1suo_F7ceg) and [here](https://youtu.be/vsXUHbQQF4U) tickled me and I felt like he covered some things that don't come up often. I don't think I've ever heard a better explanation for my sense of humor, for example.\n\nIt don't know that I would say it is the most complete overview, but man, did some parts of it resonate with me.
1	not ESTJ, but check [this](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSE_Profile_by_Gulenko) out
1	[this](https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-att-us&biw=412&bih=448&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=HtymWZrpHKHYjwSLyIeIDw&q=how+to+win+an+estj+to+your+way+of+thinking&oq=how+&gs_l=mobile-gws-img.1.0.35i39k1l3j0i67k1l2.6375.6960.0.8097.6.5.1.0.0.0.149.496.0j4.4.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-img..1.5.515.3..0.-NHUgMJyKlY#imgrc=OTelGhfIzN5GOM:)
2	What's with the need to tell others what to do?	
7	I'm not sure what you mean. Explain yourself.
6	When I'm working with a group, I'm sometimes very commanding, but only if others aren't doing their share of work to a high standard. If I'm in an environment where everyone is working hard - and well - I don't feel the need to boss people around (though I do prefer to have a degree of authority over the project). I want to succeed, and that isn't going to happen with people who refuse to participate.\n\nFrankly, it sounds like you've read too many ESTJ stereotypes. 
2	Pathetic troll attempt 
2	Cause I know better than others, duh.
2	Are dead bodies sacred?	A lot of people will agree that humans should have complete control over their own bodies while they are alive. How about after death? Is it better to use those bodies (for organ donation etc.) for the benefit of the living?\n\nShould there be an opt-out instead of opt-in for organ donation? How about in tricky situations where the person died really early before deciding?
3	Let them decide after they are dead. Makes it easier on all of us. 
2	As long as it's made very clear that you can opt-out, then I'd support automatically having your organs donated. In younger cases where they haven't had time to decide, I think that it would be better to not take their organs. I personally wouldn't give a shit if my organs were donated without direct permission, but some people might. I haven't heard any opinions on this subject, so I'd like to hear opposing view points.
1	In really tricky situations, the loved ones can decide. And if there are no loved ones, then no one will be around to miss the organs, am I right?
3	INTP who is married to an ESTJ asking for help	Hello dear ESTJ's. I'm an INTP man married to an ESTJ woman. We are having a lot of problems in our marriage and sometimes it seems like we just don't understand each other. Could you guys help? Any and all information would be greatly appreciated. In particular: what makes you most happy in a partner? What annoys you? If anyone is in a relationship with an INTP, how does that work out? What do they do that's great? What could improve? \n\nIt often seems like my wife wants me to behave in a certain way, but it's never clear what that way is. It's almost like she expects me to follow some hidden script that she has in her mind. Does this ring any bells? Is there some particular code that I'm supposed to follow?\n\nAny and all advice would be appreciated. Thanks!
7	Idk if this is fully a MBTI problem but seems like you two have a communication problem. I can tell you what makes me happy and what annoys me, but you should probably be asking your wife about her own needs and dislikes. Take the time to listen to her and share your own desires. If you both can't do that, that's where a lot of the problems lie.
3	I am an ESTJ (female) married to an INTP (male). We actually took legit MBTI tests before we married. The pastor who married us sat us down and discussed with us our results and what it would mean for our relationship. Here's what he said:\nThe T is where you will get along the most, and understand each other the most. If you were not both Ts, this relationship would be very difficult. \nThe place where you will clash the most is in the E and the I. Try to compromise with each other here - noting that the E might go out without the I every now and then. But that it is still important that the I come along for important things. \n\nObviously those tips might differ depending on your percentages for each letter. But I do remember him saying that the SJ and NP are compliments. Which makes intuitive sense, since one of you will ask the questions while the other makes the plans. \n\nMy husband does a really great job at listening to what I am saying and considering it. Sometimes we might dance around the root issue... Often times I don't even know what I am really upset about until I stop to think about it (probably the S in me). But once we get to the root issue, we always come up with a compromise. "I understand you want the dishes done everyday. But, can you try to understand that stresses me out? I can work on doing the dishes more regularly, and being more aware of when you need my help."\n\nThis reminds me of another issue we came across... I would get so mad that he ignored me doing chores to avoid helping. What was really going on; he was just caught up in what he was doing, and didn't even stop to think about what I might be doing, slamming cupboard doors in the other room. \n\nMake sure you are both talking, and both working. If she finds a way for you to be better, great. But she can't expect that much of you. She has got to know how much pressure and disrespect that puts on you. Let her know you are trying, but that you need her support and understanding too. Hope that helps!
2	I have no idea how you two ended up legally bound to one another. The very idea of staying that close to an INTP is a slow, painful annoying death(for me at least). Anyways the advice I can give is pretty limited but I hope it helps in a way. \n\nWhen I was dating an INTP, I think the main problem in our relationship was communication. It was very reminiscent of my younger brother who is also an INTP. He was very independent and felt little to no reason to share with me the decisions he made or even why he made them. I could have, and I did on many occasions, explicitly told him why something made me upset and he would never express that he was "sorry" in a way I could tell was truly apologetic.\n\nThe bit about how your wife wants you to behave in a certain way & having a hidden script is true cause that's exactly what I wanted from my ex. But every time I asked him to make small changes he would ignore it and keep doing whatever he was doing. He would never do or even entertain the idea of changing to better our partnership. \n\nThe week after I broke up with my ex was the most "progressive". He communicated with me like I asked a number of times before. He attempted to include me in his decision making, it wasn't perfect but the step forward meant a lot to me. Ultimately he asked for me to come back. I did and surely enough he did the exact same bullshit. I broke up with him again and he still won't leave me alone. Long and short of it is: I will never go down that road again, fuck all that bullshit. \n\nAnd if I'm being really honest, your relationship is a ticking time bomb before she says fuck you and all your bullshit. I will happily be wrong though, maybe you two have something my ex & I didn't. \n\nNote: Everything I'm saying here is from personal experience. Every ESTJ won't feel the same and vice versa blah blah. 
2	ENTP married to an ESTJ here. I know we are not the same, but as an ENTP I likely share some of your same pitfalls.\n\nI'd say for my husband, the thing he most values is thoughtfulness, and it's really easy for him to interpret my spontaneity and inability to communicate my thought process in a step-by-step fashion as somehow thoughtless. He expects me to behave as a partner and to have his back, but if I think he's wrong I'll tell him so, and I'll debate him on it. That can make him feel I don't put him and our relationship in the central place it deserves. But, I take nothing as sacred. Just because I love someone doesn't meant I'll have their back if they're wrong.\n\nAnyway, I think we had to really learn how not to interpret the others behaviours as being about us, but being about our individual differences. My husband has to accept I'll have his back if I think he's right, but that's not because I don't love him. I have to remember to include him and be straightforward during situations that involve planning or logistics.\n\nAsk me anything you want to know about how we relate to one another. Happy to help.
1	From reading this thread, ESTJs come across as emotional terrorists.\n\nIm going out with one tomorrow and am now nervous lol
1	ESTJs and fear of making others angry?	Do ESTJs have a tendency to freeze up and do nothing if they're afraid of making a situation worse? Do they worry they're bad people and their loved ones will leave them anyway whether or not they apologize/if it's worth it to even try to remedy a situation? At what point do you realize and trust you have others' forgiveness?
4	My ESTJ Ex-Girlfriend hesitated on saying anything "critical" towards me because *She doesn't want to say something she'll regret later* . She was very fixated about saying the wrong things in case I'd be mad or think shes weird. As an INFP I do slightly get insulted at harsh criticism but I'd rather hear it than avoid it. I also never bark back or hold grudges.
2	Most of the people I know have come to respect my directness and don't respond with anger, even if they get a little bit intimidated at times. Sometimes I'll be working on a group project with someone and seem very mad, then come lunch break, and they're shocked to see that I'm immediately back to my normal friendly self. Oftentimes they confuse my honesty as anger when I'm really just trying to make sure we're being the best we can be. However, for people who don't know me well and understand that, they might get mad and try to confront me.\n\nOccasionally I'll have a conversation with someone and they'll think some of the individual things I say are mean, but then when we speak in more general terms they think I'm a very friendly person, so I don't usually take it personally. \n\nSome people do hold grudges against me. A few acquaintances of mine sometimes get mad at me over seemingly small things, and you can obviously tell that it's not directed at that action, but me in general. When I'm hanging out with a group and try to make a helpful suggestion, sometimes acquaintances have a go at me for no good reason ("stop being so analytical!" "who cares?!?" "it doesn't matter! Just stop!"), leaving me and better friends in the group thinking *what the fuck*, and then the other person getting confused at why they snapped and saying "ugh, forget it". Generally, I don't worry about this happening beforehand, but I feel pretty bad when it happens.\n\nOverall, people do get angry at me a fair bit, which I'm okay with most of the time, but feel pretty shit about it when it's directed towards me as a whole. I rarely freeze up in emotionally-charged situations, usually trying to seek out the problem they have with me if they aren't willing to say it. I never worry I'm a bad person and pretty much always think I'll have my loved one's forgiveness, but it still hurts when people attack me sometimes.
2	I don't have this issue at all. I usually have try to choose my words carefully and watch my tone because I can easily be too direct and therefore come across as mean...
2	In my experience, my husband says whatever he wants and doesn't really care how it makes others feel... 
3	ESTJ's what are some of your careers	20 something ESTJ here trying to figure out a route that won't be depressingly boring. Checked a bunch of sites and haven't found anything that excites me so need help. 
4	Project management in healthcare. Population health reporting and work group leadership
3	I work as a receptionist in a medical facility. I love people and repetitive tasks so it works well for me. 
2	Corporate Insurance. Sales. Love it. 
1	Manger at an independent book store 
1	Self-employed/freelancer
1	Management and Marketing - currently going to school for. I obviously enjoy the bossing people around part ;P but really, I like working with a team and organizing tasks, communicating with stakeholders, etc. Marketing is where I get to use my brain more. I am more interested in the marketing strategy and research side, where I can use critical thinking and problem solving, research and work with even another team. I am going to school at a predominantly engineering school, and I am actually hoping to continue working with engineers after I graduate. 
1	Corporate Banking. Lot of procedures and verification to be made but I personally love the job
1	Project manager /traffic manager
1	I work as an insurance adjuster for long tailed claims like asbestos. Insurance is just about the most boring industry I can think of, but only love my job. I read a lot of contracts and lawsuits (and I'm applying to law school), but I like being able to get into the nitty gritty of contracts... it's more fun than it sounds.
1	Military.  I got into the military as a regular 11B Infantryman and shortly thereafter got through the selection and assessment to become an 18E USASF Communications Sergeant.  All in all, best choice of my life as far as careers go.\n\nPersonally, I have a really hard time holding a single hobby for a long time.  I find comfort in some repetitive tasks but only to an extent.  Being in SF allows me to change my responsibilities and expertise fairly regularly, but always with the Communications background to keep me on a comfortably familiar ground.  For example, I've been in charge of UAVs and UAV training; I've been in charge of contracting, money, pay, interpreters; I've been in charge of training and logistics; I've been in charge of drivers training and maintenance on certain vehicles; and on top of all of that I've always been the subject matter expert for pretty much anything that runs on electricity for my team.  It all can change very quickly but, through my own personality and interpersonal relationships, I have garnered longevity in the positions I enjoy.\n\nDon't misunderstand what I'm saying here.  This isn't a pitch to join the Army, this is just what worked for me (without me totally realizing why until fairly recently).  The Army can really, really suck.  I have only seen my daughter for half of her life to this point.  My point is that I have that familiarity of my specialty in commo and all those basic duties from day to day, but I also have the opportunity to expand and change and satiate my need for something new and challenging to persevere through.  That's why it works really well for me and I don't want to kill myself from boredom.
1	ESTJ men in late 20s, early 30s - where do you all hang out?	i have a thing for ESTJ men (i'm an INFJ woman) but i never see you guys! where do you guys hang out, how do you meet women?\n\ni've had 2 relationships with ESTJs in the past.. we met quite randomly at friend's bday and at the gym - haha. does this resonate?
4	INTP here - From what I've been told from ESTJ, INFJ is a bad match. Also, you probably see many. Look for the manager, the one leading a team, and your odds of staring at the ESTJ will increase.
0	ESTJs suck	***TRIGGERED***
17	By the looks of it, you posted to nearly every type just to leave a trolling message. Your life is sad and pathetic. Get a new hobby. 
11	The lack of comments on this in 12 hours speaks for the lack of triggering. Heh, I don't care, I'm an ENTP lurking here to learn more about you strange creatures. 
5	Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends, WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS!
2	Does anyone else think that they were a different MBTI type earlier in their life?	So I'm strongly inclined to believe I used to be an ESTP when I was younger. I was a troublemaker in school  would hate any rules imposed on me and just did whatever I wanted when I wanted. I was all about partying and drugs for awhile. One day I had a near death experience because I overdosed and it forever changed me. I realized that life is more fragile than I initially thought and there was definitely a very high likelihood I could have died that night. I made a conscious effort to not be so reckless all the time. This is when I think I started developing my "J" .I planned every little detail of everything. I made sure to be alot more cautious about what I put into my body. Eventually this also went over into all facets of my life and became alot more organized. I got my act together and eventually attained financial stability and then some. However, there are times when I feel I really miss being a "P". because I feel I was alot happier.  At the same time, I remember the pain in the ass I was to my parents and don't know if I'd wanna go back. Altough I'm alot more successful now as a "J", I know suffer from mild depression that I never once experienced as a "p". What are your thoughts on this? Also, did anyone else think they were a different type at one point?
4	This is an EXTREMELY stereotypical description of an xSTJ. STJs can disobey rules too you know, it's not that I'm physically unable to. Rules /tend/ to matter more to STJs, but if I find the rules completely asinine, I'll just make up my own. 
3	Not an estj, but I've noticed that that kind of behavior isn't unusual for estjs I've known. My father is a textbook estj in a lot of ways but growing up he was pretty wild. He was the leader of a gang, he got into a lot of fights, dated around a lot, but he was simultaneously a good student, a good athlete, and really family oriented even before he had a family.\n\n Some estj's are very straight laced but others have a play hard, work harder mentality. 
3	THIS IS MY LIFE. \n\nHoly balls. I have *never* related to something more in my life. \n\nI was not always how I am now. I believe that my childhood, especially dealing with a narcissistic mother, really changed my personality. 
1	DEFINITELY. I had a really awful experience with an ex which made me realize that I was too trusting and stoned all the time. I stopped smoking weed, started doing my homework, graduated (finally) and started working in insurance.
6	How Would You Best Explain And Describe Your Type (ESTJ) To A Person Who Knows Nothing About Myers-Briggs?	No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ESTJ personality type? Instead of ‚Äútraits or characteristics‚Äù that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. 
5	ENTP here... But I'm married to an ESTJ.\n\nI'd describe him thusly: \n\nOn a good day, he's a superhero. On a bad day, your high school hall monitor. :) 
2	Hey ESTJs, i'm an ENFP girl and i sorta have a thing with a ESTJ but i just don't know what to expect.	So i'm a year younger than my ESTJ and he just graduated and is going to college(i'm an ENFP), i will graduate next year. We've both always had an attraction to eachother even though we didn't talk. We were both in relationships during school but whenever he was in the hall I knew it and would always make eye contact with him. I knew he found me attractive but i thought that was it. fast forward to when we both break up with our significant others, he texted me telling me he wanted to hook up, well i did too but i was having many issues with my ENTP ex, so we left it at that. a month after that we started talking again and ended up hooking up. Since then he's been extremely sweet, showering me with compliments and telling me that he's attracted to everything about me, how he wishes we could go to college together, when i graduate i have to hit him up, how he will take me to new york one day, and stuff like that. The reason we aren't dating right now is because he said he doesn't want to get attached before he leaves for college.  Yet we never hangout, he will say he misses me a stuff, but he only ever asks to hangout at night. I don't know, i guess i just don't know what to expect. I feel like how he says he's feeling can't be real and I don't know if he's being serious when he talks about a future between us. Is ESTJ just having fun for the summer? 
4	[deleted]
3	As an ENFP myself - with a long term ESTJ GF,... take those ESTJ's for their words, and if they finally say something sweet, hahaha, cherish it. That is being pretty vulnerable for them :)
3	Which type do you get along with best?	Not speaking about professional environments, as I think that people you can "work with" and people you can have fun with and get along at the same time might be different.\n\nI'm an ESTJ, but personally I have no clue how to answer my own question.
2	One of my best friends is ESTJ and the other is INFP
2	My husband is one of you guys. I'm an ENTP. It's apparently not supposed to work but we've been together for 10 years. So...
1	My bestie is an ENFP and we've been through a lot together. 
1	My best friend is an ESTP
1	I've found that despite our differences, I tend to attract a lot of female ENFP's (I'm a male ESTJ). My closest male friend is an INTJ and I think the reason we get along alc well is  because I'm intrigued with his method of thinking and I help him with being more productive on a day-to-day basis.
1	Best friend (m) is ENFP. So are two of my other male friends. They are witty, quick in their thinking and respectful. And honest, they will not spare me for the sake of the relationship when I ask their opinion in whatever matter. I appreciate that, it pretty much is what friendship means to me. \n\nMy best female friend is INFJ, very very sensitive. She could easily manipulate me but knows she would loose me - and well where's the fun in orchestrating another person (my ex bf INTJ surely loved that though... ) She is my door to the touchy feely sensitive persons I'm having no patience with. I am the neutral person who can tell her how to react, to practise on me, to guard herself against incoming feelings of other people. She loves to think about revenge when being mistreated and I am happy to think up hilarious scenario's that will have her crying with laughter. \n\nMy longest friendship is with an ENTJ. We are very neutral and business like in our conversations, she talks a lot about people I don't know and will probably never meet but hey, whatever. Futhermore she is a very closed person. But I know she knows she can always count on me. And I can always count on her, no questions asked. 
2	ESTJ description by Victor Gulenko (Socionics LSE "Shtirliz")	
2	Do y'all pine?	If an ESTJ falls for someone they can't have (like, because they live in a different town), is the likelihood of them pining great?
3	We're not machines. We feel loss like any other personality type. 
2	If I like somebody but know I can't have them, or know that I shouldn't want them, then I move on very quickly. No pining.
2	How do ESTJs experience religion?	I'm an INFJ and I've never been able to settle into a faith - probably because I got burned by drinking the Kool-Aid in a fringe spiritual community in my early adulthood and could never trust a group again.\n\nI feel that, in turn, conservative religious people don't trust me when they sense my lack of official alignment.  But I can't lie and go along with something if I'm not actually 100% on board, even if it would be to my advantage socially.  I've had very meaningful personal experiences that I'd call mystical, but they're quite abstract and I keep them to myself.  The resulting ethic is to experience and respect the indwelling divinity in all beings as much as I'm able, which I don't explain to people; I just do it.\n\nHow do ESTJs experience religion?  Is it more about the other people in your religious community, the laws or commandments set down, the subjective experience of grace/redemption/sacredness, or other?  I ask because I realized that I use nothing but feeling and intuition, and have no idea how a person could relate to the ineffable using the other functions; yet I understand that your religion could be the most important thing in your life.
5	In theory, the morality and rules are a comfort....loyalty to god is big and fear of disappointing the almighty keep you on the straight and narrow. :)
3	I think we are just very certain about it. I have been an atheist since I was 9, and I am very certain. \n\nI will say that a lack of structure can create stress for us, so religion may provide that structure if we don't have it in school or at home. 
2	[deleted]
2	Religion is fake.
2	Why ISTP's are seen as a match for ESTJ's ?	I asked the same question on the ISTP subreddit, I'd like to have the ESTJ opinion about it.  https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/6hrgw3/why_estjs_are_seen_as_a_match_for_itsps/
3	It's a mediocre match, called "extinguishment" or contrary relations in socioncs. Most of attraction comes on the basis of 1) both being rational types i.e. dominant in a judging function, thus both appreciate order to some extent, and 2) being in same ST 'club' which increases the likelihood of having some interests in common. The actual good matches for ISTPs are ENFJ, INFJ, and ESFJ types, while for ESTJ it is INFP, ENFP, and ISFP: [ISTP relationship types](http://personalitycafe.com/istp-articles/110040-istp-relationship.html#post3833733) & [ESTJ relationship types](http://personalitycafe.com/estj-articles/283-love-types-estj-3.html#post2423173).
2	Are they? This is the first I'm hearing about ISTPs being a match for ESTJs.\n\nI don't necessarily mind them, but romantically it doesn't work for me.  I tried and after a month I didn't like it. \n\nThe person I felt the strongest connection with was an INTJ.  Or I actually even like feelers.  \n\nMy dad is an ESTJ too and he married an INFP, going on 30 years.  
5	Advice getting my ESTJ husband not to drive like a maniac!	Hey everyone! Given the small number of posters here, I'm only vaguely hopeful I'll get a response, but it's worth a shot to see what the ESTJ hivemind can tell me. \n\nI'm an ENTP woman. I've been married to my ESTJ husband for about 10 years. \n\nWe've been, in very stereotypical fashion, arguing about his driving for a loooong time. Years even. He's an insanely aggressive driver. If someone is going slower than he wants to go, it's not just that he has to pass them, but he has to do it with this super over-the-top "I'll teach you a lesson!" flourish of speeding up dramatically and then nearly cutting them off. He's constantly gesturing at people, flashing lights at them, tailgating, speeding up to prevent people from changing lanes, laying on the horn if someone doesn't change lanes fast enough. It's like he has to correct everyone on the road, but his version of correcting them is terrifying everyone around him, including his lovely wife (me). \n\nI know what you're going to say. "Why don't you just drive if he's so bad?" The problem with that is twofold: 1) He insists on driving; 2) When I drive (and I am objectively a far safer driver than he is) he badgers me about my driving style constantly, I think in an effort to get me back for my comments on his (actually terrifying) driving. Sometimes I grin and bear it and do the driving anyway, but it's not a solution for when I'm not in the car with him or when he really does need/want to do the driving. \n\nAnyway, after years of telling him his driving was problematic, he finally got pulled over and summoned to traffic court for which we had to hire a lawyer and pay about $1,000. I felt like after this experience, he had finally realised that his driving is not okay. And for a brief moment, he seemed to change. \n\nBut now he's back to his old ways. I've tried appealing to his sense of moral duty by telling him what he's doing is breaking several traffic laws and if he gets pulled over again they'll take his license. I've tried telling him it scares me and makes me worried for my safety and his. I tell him it makes him less attractive. I've told him that he can't control everyone's behaviour on the road and to focus on himself not others. I've tried not saying anything. I've threatened to call the police on him. I'm seriously at my wits end. \n\nWhat would resonate with you guys that I haven't already tried? And, like... are you guys all this obstinate and focused on correcting other people? I've noted this need to correct is a theme, not just in the driving, but in a lot of other areas of his behaviour. Sometimes it's good and makes sense, other times it results in crazy terrifying manic driving. 
3	Female ESTJ here. \n\nI'm not sure how much of this is ESTJ behavior and how much of it is just him being a jerk. \n\nI guess I can see why he would want to cut people off with a dramatic flourish (not your exact words, but you get what I mean), but for me, I feel like the potential extreme danger of doing stuff like that outweighs the "ha! I sure showed that guy!" effect. 
2	Show him a car crash Montage and some gore from car crashes. 
2	Does he have any healthy ways to relax? ESTJs put so much stress on their duties, they sometimes need to be told it's normal to vent in a healthy way. Talk to him and see if you can get the creative juices flowing for some projects he can work on. Anything that can give him the sense of control he likes, without harming others.
2	I had an estj boyfriend who had a terrible road rage. If anybody cut him off or drove too slowly, he would get very angry. Also, if anybody drove too closely to our car, he would feel really mad and say some bad words at them in our car. \n\nI always thought of his behavior as hyper-protective, meaning his reactions were over the top because he felt threatened by these cars and needed a way to get past/solve it.\n\nI also think driving must be one of those annoying situations for estj's because practically nobody on the road is under his control. Lack of control triggers all the emotions from an estj...\n\nI'm sorry I don't have an answer, but as this is your husband of ten years, maybe the best way is to challenge him other ways. Like make this into a game/competition that he needs to conquer... Ive been told that when you want a man to do something, make it into a tangible game of something me sort, haha.. good luck!
2	What do you do for recreation?	
5	Lots or simulation games or any video game with a sense of progression ,where I feel my time invested is getting somewhere and picking up random hobbies with a learning curve  (languages, water skiing,paddleboarding), fun to me is feeling im improving and getting better at something.
2	Anyone else crazy about playing games? Like literally any kind of game, if someone wants to play UNO? I'm playing. Someone wants to play Minecraft? Give me a pickaxe.
4	ESTJ dealing with breakups.	Do you get back on your feet easily? \nHow do you deal with it?\n
3	I was broken up with in December of 2016 and I'm still dealing with it. I'm fiercely loyal in my relationships and still think about my ex too much. Just do things for yourself and give it time. It'll slowly get better. Hope that helps.
3	One thing that helped me was to say this out loud every morning when I looked in the mirror: "It's over. She's not coming back. She's happier now." Tough at first but it got easier.
3	Yeah, my last serious break up took me about 11 months to get over, mostly because we would still get together occasionally and it would open old wounds. Looking back now, I think the reason it hurt so much is because I take break ups way too personally and see it as my affection not being reciprocated, even if I know it was for the best.\n\nI would suggest finding someone to talk to about it that isn't going to get too annoyed with you but will also call you out on your shit. Talking about it helped me process it and I don't think I could truly get over the breakup until I fully understood it.
1	I broke up with a boyfriend early January of 2015. I sobbed hard for two days and then was pretty much 100% over it. YMMV. 
1	I broke up with my girlfriend on January 15th, 2017. Felt really down the first day, then started analyzing how she really would be a liability and wasn't right for me. \n\nWas 100% okay on the 3rd day.

6	Request for Advice on dealing with people	I think I am an ESTJ.  At work, I always have to have the last word and my way is the only way.  I am well respected and my colleagues always come to me for help or advice.  But I easily get into fights and arguements with clients when they don't see my point of view.  I regularly have dealings with people that end up becoming heated and I really don't like myself for it.  Sometimes, I have discussions with people and I am really assertive about my point of view, and when I walk away, I think "why on earth did you end up doing that? It was stupid".\n\nPeople accuse me of being disrespectful towards them and I am really not, I just don't share their point of view and if I think something is wrong or isn't being done right, I really can't stand it.  I have to correct things if I think they're wrong.\n\nI often drive home from work thinking "You've done it this time Reg, you're really in trouble as you have really pissed someone off and they will complain".\n\nI was wondering if anyone else who identifies as an ESTJ can suggest a coping strategy to help me to stop and take a moment to think before I speak to people and deal with them in a way where we can agree to disagree rather than pissing them off? I need to be needed when I am a work and I do like helping my coworkers with my knowledge, but I just can't deal reasonably without people when I don't feel that they share my objectives or methodology.
4	Your post had a lot of "musts" and "shoulds" in it (even if just implied). It seems likely that similar thoughts like "things must be this way" or "if things aren't done this way it will be terrible" come to your mind frequently. Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy are specifically designed to combat such thinking when people find it negatively affecting them. So if you haven't ever considered counseling, you might find it helps you if the counselor uses this approach. They'll teach you to recognize these automatic thoughts, challenge them with some sort of rational argument that you develop in  advance, and then feel more relaxed when things don't go your way. This approach has helped me a lot.\n\n[Here](http://stresscourse.tripod.com/id139.html) is a list of the categories of automatic thoughts many people struggle with. And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRA5zCA6M) is a YouTube video that introduces the process of challenging them. [This](https://iveronicawalsh.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/apply-the-albert-ellis-12-irrational-beliefs-and-disputing-statements-to-your-2013/) page has some examples of ways to challenge each category. You don't necessarily need a therapist to teach you to do this. Albert Ellis, the developer of CBT, believed very strongly that people could teach themselves to do this just by reading about it or watching training videos.\n\nIf you want to do that yourself, make a sheet of paper with three columns. In the first column, write the sorts of thoughts that you find floating in your head when you start running into trouble. In the second column, label each of them with one of the labels from that category list I linked above. In the third column, write a short, simple statement rationally challenging each of those thoughts. Practice repeating that challenge statement to yourself whenever that thought pops into your mind.
1	I think it's just a matter of learning to bite your tongue. It's shitty, and I am still working on it but is beneficial sometimes. I work at a restaurant that's open until 2:30am that's next to the largest college campus in the nation and have to deal with drunk people every night and am working on just biting my tongue and not giving people my last thought. I mean we usually regret it in the end if it's over something stupid anyway, right?
1	I used to struggle with this as well. My recommendation is to always ask the person WHY they believe what they believe. But don't ask it in an aggressive manner. You can say "that's interesting... can you give a little more detail about what appeals to you about this solution?" I picked this up from some of the product managers at my old job.. might be beneficial to do some research about poduct management, which is all about taking people's feedback and breaking it down into business problems and eventually potential solutions. Don't jump into the solution right away - try to understand what problem your colleague or client is trying to solve. People don't always see things the same way you do. 
2	[Academic] Perceptions of Self and Intimacy (20-35yo)	Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.\n\nMy dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.\n\nI will leave the survey open until the end of this week.\n\nCheers!\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/F3BXHWN
1	I'm an INTP, but the guy I am seeing is ESTJ. He wouldn't take it but he definitely has avoidance issues (I've been reading about it and I probably have the anxious issue myself.) Good luck on your thesis!
2	Does this sound like as ESTJ? Which response would piss you off the most?	So I have this difficult guy who claims to be ESTJ. He does this kind of shit all of the time. He'll call me and when I pick up he's singing a random song. Or he gives me really vague responses to my very specific questions. Or he just ignores my messages entirely.\n\nThis afternoon I messaged him that I was going to speak English when I felt like I needed to be understood. (His English is perfect, my French is not, yet he doesn't like it when I speak in English.) I sent "walls of text" to explain myself after he yet again suggested I should speak to him in French.\n\nA few hours later he sends me this message (it was all in French I've translated for you guys)\n\nESTJ: Do you drink bourbon?\n\nMe: I drink everything.\n\nESTJ: That wasn't my question :|\n\nSo does this sound like an ESTJ and if so what would you most/least like me to respond if you were the ESTJ in question?\n\n
3	No ESTJ's are straightforward, this guy is simply crazy.\nTbh I dont know why you believed him in the first place
3	Speaking as the husband of one, that is a very typical ESTJ response to the way you answered the question. They ask direct questions and expect direct answers. 
2	MBTI Discord server	We have been working on this server for almost a year now, and at the moment we are staying at the 100+ members. We want to branch out, and that's why we're posting this. You're all welcome, even if you don't know your type. https://discord.gg/csDt8Jg\n
2	It was awesome talking with you guys, I plan to get on a lot more.
2	Any ESTJ smokers here? Why smoke? and how do you stop?	Hey! I've been smoking pot for the past 1 and half, and recently started smoking ciggartes which I don't take pride in..\n\nI've been smoking 1-4 cigs for the 3 months, and I can feel myself become more and more addicted. \nI smoke for these reasons:\n\n1. It's nice to have to roll a cig, it's really fun to roll a fine ciggarte, I like to also grind my tobbacco so it fits really nice!\n\n2. It's a nice addition to my routine, I like to prepare myself breakfast, and before eating and watching an episode of a show, I *smoke* and drink my *tea* while listening to *music* and *observing nature* outside my apartment. CHILL AS FUCK!\n\n3. Friends, a nice addition to a conversation\n\n4. Relax.. My life is very stressful at times...\n\n
2	Do you ever like people, that initially you did not?	I am not an ESTJ. The ESTJ's I know who like me, have just always liked me, we've been friendly from day one. However, I know an ESTJ, who just does, not like me. It would not bother me so much if it wasn't for the fact that his reasons for disliking me, are things that have been disproved. If it was something about my personality I wouldn't really care. \n\nI just think that after having been proven wrong, he'd have been like; "I was wrong about you." or something.\n\nAnyway any ESTJ comments? 
5	Oh, I don't know if this is ESTJ specific, but being one, it is extremely difficult for me to admit that I was wrong. I HATE BEING WRONG. It takes time. In the end, I can't deny what's fact, so hopefully this person will overcome his immaturity. 
3	It happened once, but then they just went right back on my shit list. So, not permanently, no.
2	Once but when I first met him I was looping and disintegrating. 
2	Yes but sometimes I find myself still holding whatever bad first impression they made Afghanistan them.
2	I actually always change my opinion about people. I am a reliably bad judge of character and tend to stay reserved with the people I like right away, because I often hate them later on. 
1	what do you do for work and is it fulfilling? was it planned?	after college i worked at a hospital as an admin and have through the years made my way in to compliance - i feel like it's the perfect job for my personality type. anyone else feel that way and what is it that you do? for me, it was not planned to work in this field, but seems like a natural progression. i oftentimes refer to myself as an adult hallway monitor. 
4	In my spare time I work as a secretary of the church and I am also the secretary general of the church's council and I am loving every moment because I mostly organize stuff and papers and appointments and I am happiest when I see all the work coming to fruition in a meeting or an event
3	I work in credentialing for a PPO. Our department makes sure the doctors in our network have the proper licensing and make sure they haven't had history of insurance fraud, malpractice history, etc.\n\nI basically gather paperwork and do spreadsheets, and since I'm training now I tell others how to gather said paperwork.\n\nIt's very enjoyable to me, but it definitely wasn't planned. I didn't even really know what credentialing was on my first day.
2	My dad is a concrete construction superintendent in Chicago and an ESTJ, and I would say it's pretty fulfilling for him, inasmuch as he is unlikely to think of it in those terms himself. \n\nHe worked on houses as a teen, and I guess he just kept working because it kept paying the bills. His work ethic and attentiveness / care for the work was noticed and he just kept getting promotions... going on 30 years now and the only thing keeping him from starting his own company is, I think, a fear of going out on his own. He's very much a "King's Hand" sort of guy, not as much the King. 
2	I work as a financial planner, and it is extremely fulfilling. It hits all the checkboxes for ESTJ such as being sociable and helping others by helping them structure and bring order to their lives.
1	ahaha ah it's our generation to not be on time... bahaha, at our office its, "if you're on time, you're early. if you're late, you're on time. and if you just didn't show up, you're working from home." kills me. \n\ndoes he find your sense of fashion too far from "classic attire"?
1	ESTJ psyche	About 2 years ago, I was dating someone casually but I had an ESTJ friend who was interested in dating and attempting to do all sorts of things I would consider romantic. We were great friends, but I turned him down and only wanted a friendship at the time. Our friendship began to grow distant over the months but occasionally kept in contact.\n\nMonths later, we sat down to talk about things and he mentioned that I had "really messed up his psyche." As an ESTJ, what would this entail? He's such a strong person, I was taken aback when he said this. \n\nWe are at a point where we are now dating casually and have been for a year, but taking it really really slow, mostly on his part. I want to make things serious, but I feel he has this barrier up in letting me closer. I've told him if he doesn't want anything serious with me, to let me walk away. He doesn't talk about feelings but his actions of spending time with me and doing things, like take care of my house problems or car issues, show he cares. Why then is he taking so long to make a commitment with me? I wonder if a big factor is letting him down by rejecting him in the past.\n\nI would like some feedback from ESTJs. Anything helps. \n\nThanks!  
3	If you find out, let me know. 4/4 failed relationships because I can't open up and trust anyone.
1	As an ISTPish sort of person who has had the best dating relationship ever with an Es/nTJ, I'd say, yes--it's because of the previous rejection. An ESTJ who creates a deep romantic attachment to someone will find themself "undone" by the predicament. 
5	ESTJs how do know when to commit yourself to one person and how to do it?	I'm a 25-year-old female ESTJ and apparently something I struggle with is a common trait of ESTJs: a desire for excitement in relationships. I've been in two serious and loving relationships but I find myself longing after someone else, even though there are no major issues.\n\nSo how have you other ESTJs known when to stay with someone and do you have advice how? Since we like excitement I wonder if having shared interests might be more of value to us than other personality types.
3	My husband is an ESTJ and he's incredibly committed to our relationship. I mean we just got married in July so knock on wood lol but we've been together for 2 1/2 years and he's the one that proposed to me so that's gotta count for something :-P I know in our relationship we make sure we have other interests outside each other. He plays basketball with his friends, I play D&D with mine. We have very very different career paths- he's an accountant and I'm a nanny- so we interact with very different kinds of people. Having interests outside each other keeps us from getting bored and gives us plenty to talk about when we regroup together at the end of the day. We're also always finding fun things to do when we're together! We go to local festivals, try new restaurants or recipes, go see live shows, etc... Not to get too personal but it also helps that we're sexually compatible and we don't get bored of each other in the bedroom.\n\nETA: I asked him and he said I was the first girl he ever brought home to meet his parents. He says when you know you just know.
3	Was with an ESTJ for 11 and a half years.... I'm either ENFP or INFP (can't seem to figure out if I'm introverted or extroverted). We had a great first 10 years, we were extremely content, then her eye started wandering, but I don't necessarily think it's an ESTJ thing.
2	I have no clue! I'm 28 and no one has ever managed to hold my attention for a serious relationship. 
2	Ah gotcha, but that's exactly the difference with ENTP and ENTJ though. Look at both of their relationship styles and then tell me what u think. 
1	Me and my man really don't small talk and we've been together 12yrs. It's everything else that's essential. We can compensate for each other's weaknesses, provide structure and security. He's told me that my presence alone is comforting. He's extremely logical like me, but we have different viewpoints on all matters that always keeps things interesting. Is that the kinda answer ur looking for or am I off? 
1	Well I logically broke it down like this. He has been my best friend since I was 15. No matter what, we weren't gona leave each other's lives. After so long we couldn't imagine it any other way. We had already been to hell and back for each other. I knew we were always going to be there to support each other whether we were a couple or not. If your scared that your going to get bored of one individual for the rest of ur life, then your with the wrong person.

1	Come chat about Personality Typology	Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.\n\nSee you there (:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/6xE4qMt Edit: If that link expires, use this one: https://discord.gg/ct8BRps

6	Help with an ESTJ	I figured the best group to ask would be other ESTJ's.\n\nAnyway I'm a feeler, so it's kind of hard for me sometimes to communicate with ESTJ folks, and the issue right now is an ESTJ I know has this awkward combination of being hypercritical, but when it comes to being criticized, he deflects it.\n\nSomeone says he's bossy, he tells them it's because everyone else is so lazy, and if other people would pull their weight, he wouldn't have to be bossy. \n\nIf he's called out for being controlling, well it's because he just wants people to do things the right way.\n\nHe gets told he has an anger problem, and decides he doesn't have anger issues, no it's that everyone else just lacks a backbone.\n\nThe problem is he deflects criticism like he's afraid of it. As if he's afraid to admit that he's not as smart, or well-rounded as he wants to believe he is. In addition a lot of the criticism he deals out, tends to reflect on himself. For example he's quick to call out people he believes are lazy, and yet he's one of the laziest people I know. I mean when he actually gets motivated to work, then yeah he'll work non-stop, but aside from that, he barely does anything aside from his job, and even randomly takes days off, just to stay at home, and play on his computer.\n\nSo, other ESTJ's how do you approach this behavior from an ESTJ?
3	How old is he? It sounds like he's immature more than anything.
3	According to your description I actually doubt that he is an ESTJ, and the reasoning behind my suspicion in brief would be that no matter how we tend to approach things or how unhealthy we sometimes can get, responsibilities always come first in our lives. However, this should be a minor concern for you at the moment so I will not dwell on it.\n\nSo back to your question: how do we approach someone with such behaviors? Personally if this person is nothing but a liability, I would simply avoid engaging in anything of importance with him. However, if he's not, if I couldn't avoid him (especially if he was my manager or someone of equivalence), I'd try to protect myself first- as in, try my best not to let him throw me under the bus when I don't have time for it, be careful around him and still do what I have to do. Strike him down, even, if the time is right. \n\nOr you could try to change him into a better person. The choice is always yours but I will say this: You know this man is not pleasant to be around (to say the least), and of course he has problems he's oblivious to that need to be fixed, but it's not always your job to do that.
4	Might an ESTJ be passionately involved in activism?	If you're planning on replying "any type can exhibit any behaviour", I just saved you a few seconds. I'm asking for personal opinions and maybe even anecdotes from people who are (or who know) an ESTJ who attends protests, organises strikes, etc., as well as their reasons for supporting that cause.\n\n(X-posting to /r/mbti when it actually lets me)
1	I've known a few ESTJs with a passion for political opinion.  It doesn't seem too far a leap to imagine them lending their organizational and leadership skills to them as well.  The ones I knew just didn't have the time or were perhaps not yet developed enough to do so.  Many politicians are ESTJ, which is similar to activism when you consider the grassroots efforts of campaigning and reaching people with a message.
1	Yes, we are a common type amongst lawyers and politicians, so activism tends to be involved with that. We make good union leaders too. 
2	My friend's doing a design thesis on MBTI in the workplace and needs more ESTJ participation!	
3	How to open up an ESTJ regarding sex?	Dear ESTJs,\n\nSo I've been in an awesome relationship with an ESTJ girl, amazing. Hard working, disciplined, funny, straightforward. And more features I really admire. \n\nBut,... not so adventurous. I for one, as an ENFP, am curious as shit! I have learned my gf to open up more on a emotional level, although I do respect her more closed nature in this. But I want her to share her sexual interests as well. It seems this is very hard for her. We do make small steps. But still, I think there are hidden desires, she has a hard time expressing.\n\nHow can I help her express/open up her self more in this regard? Without disrespecting her boundaries ofcourse. \n\nThanks :)! 
4	MBTI aside, I think many men think that we women have some unshared sexual desires or some fantacies, but.. many of us... just don't... haha. I wouldn't expect to get a lot out from her verbally if she is one of these women. I certainly am, and I think I might even feel a bit pressured if I were asked about it since I really wouldn't have an answer hahaha\n\nSometimes making it about you is less pressure on her. Depending on the person, ehh.\n\nI think you're on the right track, though, for wanting to communicate!
3	One thing I can think of is to make sure she feels very comfortable and not let her feel embarrassed at all. Don't make it seem like you're not satisfied so far, but want to explore new things together. And compliment her on what you've like so far, so then she'll feel more comfortable and more in control to do and want more 
2	I'll be honest, as an ESTJ male I already have a tough time with intimacy and even just talking about sex makes me feel uncomfortable.. Imagining a female ESTJ go through something like that... sounds like a nightmare LOL..\n\nI think using logic is one way to go about it, I mean logically we should be able to discuss sex! it's feelings that get in the way of that, so you could just bring it up by talking about past experiences , or stuff you like to do. It would make her slightly uncomfortable and that is where you have to find out what's wrong, and how to make it okay, acceptable.\n\nMight not be the best advice though, think about it. Honestly I've not idea how to go about this. but I guess you gotta start somewhere?
3	Making characters based on MBTI and ESTJ is second on my list to design.	I'm am making characters based on MBTI. I have already designed ENTP and one of my main goals was not to make a character that was just ENTP stereotypes and I've decided to do the same with other types so I have a few questions. \n\n1. What are some stereotypes to stay away from when making this character? (I am aware of the **Not identifying with ESTJ stereotypes** post I will use it but I believe that question is broader allowing for different answers)\n\n2. What clothing would be the most appropriate for an ESTJ character?\n\n3. What are/were your main goals and struggles in your life that define who you are?\n\n4. How do you interact with ENTPs? (The ENTP character and ESTJ character interact a lot)\n\nThank you for answering and I'm an ENTP by the way. 
1	1. A lot has been said in the said post, so I'm just going to drag a few things out from the top of my head. a) We aren't downers. We don't get in our group of friends and be dead serious. That doesn't happen. b) Not all of us have the essential qualities to be respected by everyone. You might want to beware of how you portray others when they're around the ESTJ character. c) We don't isolate ourselves from people if we're healthy. Quite the opposite, in fact. d) Remember the extroverts.\n\n2. What clothing would be the most appropriate for most people to wear in your world setting? And what clothing would be the most appropriate for the character to wear based on their background?\n\n3. I strive to be one of the best in my professional field and every struggle along the way shaped me up.\n\n4. Needs to be more specific. What is the relationship between the two? How long have they known each other? What significant incidents happened that could have influenced their behaviour around each other?
3	INFJ married to an ESTJ	We've been happily married for almost 2 years now. I've noticed she enjoys when I get a head-start on the chores.\n\nI'm struggling to make decisions on what we should do and the details, especially to surprise her, because I'm too afraid she'll dislike, not so much my initiative, but what we actually do.\n\nAny suggestions? About that or not. Anything will be helpful!
3	Oh I relate to that! It's hard to always be the planner. My favorite thing about my best friend is that she'll take the reigns for me on vacations. Really you can't screw this up, you know what she likes by now and the sentiment goes such a long way, just make sure she has no prior obligations the day you want to treat her :)
2	I just started dating an ESTJ and this would be helpful as I too am an INFJ. 
2	Infj dating an ESTJ man for the second time here. First ESTJ was the love of my life but it didn't work out. This second one, I could tell he was ESTJ the moment I met him. I don't know if I like him as much as the first one yet, but we'll seeee.\n\nSorry, totally not addressing your questions... just glad there are INFJs with ESTJs! Yay for happy marriage!
1	ESTJ here what kind of decisions?
1	ENFJ married to an ESTJ here! And I know planning the details can be so tricky, that's usually his department and he's so good at it. I know my husband's favorite dates are often the more unusual ones like a trip to the museum or going to play laser tag, so I try to surprise him with outings like that when I can. Or my favorite date night regardless of type is to surprise her with dinner then have some kind of interactive dessert like chocolate fondue or something you bake together (with everything pre-measured so it goes quickly) so you have something engaging to get conversation going :)
1	INFJ dating an ESTJ and at at least my experience is that he is not shy at all about voicing his opinions about something, even if I disagree. It's a wonderful thing, because at least for me it is paramount that I don't influence anyone to be or do anything they are not on board with, as long as they're not close-minded (which he is not).\n\nI say go ahead and voice your opinions as often as you have them, and then simply follow with the logic behind why you think/feel a certain way. The Te is very receptive to ideas as long as they are argued well.\n\nAlso what comes to surprises, trust your intuition and knowledge of her. I bet she would love nothing more than to know that you had the confidence, knowledge, and the will to do something for her that is clearly something only you could've known to do. Even if it ends up not being the exact thing they like, they will likely appreciate the effort and thought and organizing abilities above the actual results.
1	Honest, direct communication about any issues you have is really important with ESTJs. This type doesn't like to be surprised in that way, by emotional problems you've left undisclosed for too long. Talk and write to each other a lot. Also, don't be late and don't miss a scheduled date. And schedule your dates! 
1	Are you frugal or stingy? In your minds, how do they differ?	Many of my ESTJ friends and past significant others have been pretty frugal yet have an inclination for finer things in life. However, some were borderline stingy. I really appreciate frugality, but I cannot stand stinginess.\n\nI was wondering how you differentiate between the two, and which one you lean more closely to!
1	The ESTJ I dated was bad with money, even though he was frugal with random things.  He overspent and did not discuss finances with me.  But he made good money, so he'll be fine long-term.  He was just young and stupid.  The INTP I dated was a lot more generous, but just as bad with money.  He also made great money, so he'll be fine too.
1	There must be a fine line between the two, but I don't know which side I lean closer to so I'm just gonna sum it up a little.\n\nI don't get things (buy, rent, get for free, etc) if I don't need them. I don't like useless stuff piling up at my place.\n\nI make sure that I always have savings at hand. Whatever happens I know I can have my back covered if rainy days happen.\n\nI spend good money on things that need to be expensive but try to save on things that don't as much as I can.\n\nI don't really enjoy many things expect for books (I can live without music and movies and video games. I know.) so they don't really cost me much. \n\nSo l guess I pretty much have no personal life to spend money on.
10	Fictional ESTJ characters that don't suck	* Mario\n* Buzz Lightyear\n* Woody\n* Robb Stark\n* Boromir \n* Princess Kida Atlantis \n* Pepper Pots\n* Princess Leia \n* Buttercup from The Powerpuff Girls\n* Mr. Krabs \n* Bagheera\n* King Triton\n* Elasti-girl \n* Robin, Teen Titans \n* Barney Stinson \n* Walter Sobchak\n* Jack Shephard from LOST\n* Turanga Leela of Futurama \n* Lana Kane\n* Javert (Police Inspector of Les Mis)\n\nAdd to the list!
2	Hey no offense, but none of the ESTJs characters suck :P

6	Not identifying with ESTJ stereotypes	ESTJs are stereotyped big time. I'm definitely ESTJ but I'm really not hard to deal with and have a ton of friends and acquaintances. \n\n*Stereotypes* -\n**Bossy** - I'm not bossy, but I do lead by example. I'll either make suggestions and/or use facts to prove I'm right about something. If that doesn't go over well then I'm really not all about anyone's weird emotional reaction to truth so I'll just leave you alone (but I may think you're irrational). \n\n**Hard to deal with** - I make a point of being friendly with everyone. The ESTJ in me sees that as a tactic to success. No one can get anywhere having a ton of enemies. \n\n**Controlling** - I think I want to control things, but again, obviously trying to control everything is always very apparent and usually rejected. I think I control things with charisma and being friendly/trustworthy. I also try to come from a place of facts and in my experience it's worked well for me because it's indisputable. \n\n**Malicious** - No. I may think of 1001 ways to get revenge, but I'll never do it. Maybe that's a really unhealthy ESTJ?\n\n**Heartless** - I don't want anyone to be screwed and I actually have a problem with making people's problems MY problems - as in problem-solving for them. This has not gone well quite often. When someone has a problem I usually see a solution to it and try to help. I've learned that some people don't want a solution, which is extremely hard for me to relate to but I recognize it.\n\n**By the book, rule follower** - No no no. I do stick with my tried and true methods of getting things done because it always works for me, and I know that it's not efficient to rewrite the playbook. With that said, I'm very innovative in the sense that I build upon the rules and in many ways that breaks the rules. \n\n**Uptight/no fun** - No way. I'm always the first to do things and the last to leave.\n\n**Bully** - Nah. When has being a bully actually brought you real success? The kind of success that you're proud of?\n\n**ESTJ WORST NIGHTMARE** - > "They are forced to follow the orders of a messy and unorganized fool. No one around them is allowed to listen to their commands, and they are forced to keep them to themselves. They are seen by everyone as incapable and weak." \n\n^ Yeah, that part is me.\n\nDo you think that ESTJs are just easily identifiable when they're unhealthy?
10	I think it just comes down to the fact that people associate ESTJs with corporate suits aka: the bad guy in like every kids' show ever 
3	ESTJs can be pretty cool and chill outside but inside they are almost all the same 
2	Really don't have to identify with the stereotype to be one. To be perfectly honest I think all mbti types are stereotyped pretty badly in the community.
2	Here's my feedback and observations on my ESTJ friends and past SO's.\n\nBossy - ESTJs do lead by example. I think the bossy aura comes from ESTJs often knowing and expressing what they think should happen in a situation. So they're vocal and actually a bit steadfast in what they think is right. So that could come off to some as bossy.\n\nHard to deal with - Friendly yes. Very friendly, even to strangers. My ESTJ friends and SO's always make an effort to say hi to even strangers, like your not-so-close neighbors you come across in the midst of your morning routine. ESTJs are hard to deal with during friendly arguments, though. In my experience, it's actually pretty easy to offend ESTJs, so I try not to bring up my opinions on things that I know they feel completely different about.\n\nControlling - They're chronic planners. Plan A, B, and C. Reliable. Not sure about controlling. ESTJs do freak out when things don't go as planned, but I appreciate their internal need to be prepared at all times. \n\nMalicious - No.\n\nHeartless - Nope. Babies at heart.\n\nBy the book, rule follower - Uh... I think ESTJs are by the book because they value structure, respect authority and status. Rule-follower, not so sure...\n\nUptight/no fun - Not really.\n\nBully - Hmm.. I do think ESTJs have very strong opinions on people, and when they don't like someone, they really dislike him/her. But I can't imagine ESTJs actually bullying someone or intentionally make their life inconvenient. Being a bully isn't an MBTI thing; it's just a bad person thing.\n\nI do think ESTJ women and ESTJ men are very different, though. Which one are you?\n
2	I'm definitely an ESTJ woman and I suck at being a stereotypical ESTJ. For example, most people would describe me as "really warm and friendly". I care about others, just to an extent and not a gushy way - I'm interested in other people's thoughts and social energy, their wellbeing etc. I think it's all about being balanced. \n\nI have a lot of N friends, too, but ultimately seem to get along more with 1) ISFJs, 2) ESTPs or ISTPs, 3) ISFPs, 4) ESFJs. INTPs, ENTPs and ENFPs just flock to me for some reason and we get along well. I'm not a corporate person: I can be artistic, like exploring and discovering new stuff, and I'm in a STEM field. However, I'm also most definitely an S: quite rigid, very traditional, athletic, notice the little details, focussed on fashion/superficial things, dose off when N-s go on long tangents about some theory I'm not exactly interested in, but *I can and will* engage in the discussions *for momentary fun*, I'm just not taking it seriously.
24	My ESTJ Appreciation Post	My husband has never been great at talking about his feelings, and I accepted that a long time ago mostly because I realized that the ways he does show affection are so meaningful and creative. I hate being cold, and on cold mornings I'll wake up to find he put my clothes in the dryer so they'll be warm when I get dressed. I collect Disney trading pins, so when he got us tickets to see Beauty and the Beast he chose a theatre like an hour away because he read that they were giving out promotional pins that weren't available at our usual theatre. He takes care of me when I'm sick. He's always recommending shows he stumbles across that he thinks I'll like and watches them with me even though it's not his thing. People seem to put a lot more value on what is said than done when it comes to love for some reason, and most of it probably stems from insecurity, but I've come to appreciate the concrete gestures so much more. Anyone can say anything, but actions don't lie. So anyway, I think yall are pretty great, mine in particular, and I think yall need to hear it more often. 
8	That's very nice! \n\nIt sounds like he really pays attention to you and "gets" you. And I can't help but think his love language is actions/serving (but not in a slave kind of way, I'm sure you get what I'm saying).
6	I almost cried reading this because my ex boyfriend was an ESTJ and the man I'm currently dating is one as well.\n\nYou're right, they show affection through action, and there is nothing I value more than actions. And when you realize how meticulous they are with planning things out, I always make sure to thank them from the bottom of my heart! \n\nI love this side of ESTJs as well. \n\nI used to park outside an ESTJ's house when visiting him, and the street was hard to find a parking spot in. He would always move his own car out of the garage and find me a spot an hour before I got there, so I wouldn't have to look for parking at night. It was the sweetest thing ever...\n\nI'm an INFJ and these little details of life escape my brain sometimes. I appreciate it so much!\n\nWhat type are you?
5	You get it!
4	ENTP, I love ESTJs. You guys are always so fun to be around.
3	I have another thread up right now about how I'm an ISFJ who seems oddly drawn to (fictional) ESTJs; the only 3 television characters I've ever greatly admired are all ESTJs. And I admired them independently + didn't know much about MBTI at the time apart from the superficial 16personalities kind of typology.\n\nSo yeah, there must be something pretty great about them. And I do see the same quality of being able to remember minute details and use them to demonstrate love through actions in the characters I like as well.\n\n+1 to some ESTJ positivity c:

7	Why do ESTJs apparently dislike psychology as a field?	**Re-post from r/MBTI**\n\nI have never met an ESTJ that held psychology as a field in particularly high regard. In fact, I have found quite the opposite. From what I can tell, they seem to think that it's a load of nonsense, imprecise, vague, not reproducible, and generally pointless. One major reason I have heard cited by them is that everyone is unique, and therefore there is no point in trying to categorize people or look for patterns. This strikes me as being incredibly narrow-minded, and quite frankly runs counter to everything I believe in, but I still want to understand why they believe this. I understand some studies are better than others, but the blanket aversion to and condemnation of psychology as a field is really surprising. A lot of studies in psych have not been replicated, but that does not mean they are not reproducible. The same holds true in other scientific fields like biology, chemistry, etc. Academics are under pressure to produce new findings as opposed to replicating old ones. Can anyone explain to me the apparent ESTJ dislike of psychology (and probably other social (soft) sciences as well)?
5	I would say because we prefer black and white to gray. Social sciences often have a degree of variability whereas 2+2 will always equal 4
2	It's funny seeing this post cos I'm an ESTJ but I studied psychology. Currently I'm taking my postgrad study in Human Resource Management. We can say that both are social (soft) studies? I think it's one proof that people with the same MBTI don't necessarily share the same characteristics/ interests.\n\nI think, we ESTJs don't like social studies because of the grey areas and uncertain boundaries / classifications. It's quite difficult for us to gain conclusions from something uncertain and see it as a valuable input. If there's no exact conclusions that can be taken, we would automatically disregard it during our decision making process. We prefer clear answers and straightforward results, which is probably why most of us avoid these kind of fields.\n\nIf you're wondering what's driving me into these areas of work/studies, it's my need to harden these "soft" boundaries if that makes sense? Deep down I believe that we can put people in boxes. And by studying psychology I know how to do it correctly. That's also why I love MBTI. It helps me differentiate people and understand them. I also always have this interest for human beings and social issues, which maybe helps too.
2	I was like that, disliking psychology as a field because of the pretentious mythical vibe people like to put on it and act as if they could bloody read your mind when they did 3 years of psychology in school and that could get annoying very quickly. For me it's more or less like when a surgeon brags about how he does voodoo when he cuts up a patient, he instantly loses all respect and credit from me.
8	Ever wondered how many subscribers there are in each of the MBTI subreddits? Well I collected the data in this post. Tell me your interpretation of the results.	general MBTI subreddit: 14,701\n\nall SJs: 8,137 // \nESTJ: 745 // \nESFJ: 732 // \nISTJ: 4,055 // \nISFJ: 2,605\n\nall SPs: 8,137 // \nESTP: 920 // \nESFP: 804 // \nISTP: 4,447 // \nISFP: 2,205\n\nall NFs: 56,097 // \nENFP: 11,243 // \nENFJ: 3,016 // \nINFP: 22,166 // \nINFJ: 19,672\n\nall NTs: 75,270 // \nENTP: 9,400 // \nENTJ: 4,167 // \nINTP: 31,444 // \nINTJ: 30,259\n\nCompare the numbers with this estimated frequency of personality types: https://mypersonality.info/personality-types/population-gender/\n\nNote: I'll be posting this on all of the MBTI subreddits.\n
3	Strong correlation with introversion and intuition. That's too be expected. An interest in the self and a tendency to explore theories would lend one to find MBTI interesting and also to use the Internet to discuss it. The weaker correlation with perceiving I find more interesting. I wonder what motivation along the judging-perceiving axis might cause that to be the case.
6	A short video summary of the ESTJ personality type	Hey ESTJs, :)\nI am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project. \nI am happy to share with you guys the last video of the series:\n(Sorry that it took so long) :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEJJJUDR9Sk\n\nI think I will create some more MBTI stuff in the future (so stay tuned :)\nbecause it I had a lot of fun creating these videos and I love the theory.\n\nI really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think!\nEnjoy! :)
2	cool but INTP - ESTJ is one of the worst 
1	You are German, aren't you?
1	In your opinion, what's the difference between INFJ and INFP?	Any examples? Preferences? With regards to co-workers, spouses, friends, etc.
8	They can't understand the world or make good choices, but only one of them knows it.
3	The most often discussed difference is INFJs use Fe and INFPs use Fi.
1	Coworkers: INFJ > INFP. The INFPs I've worked with aren't particularly good with communication or finishing things up and they want to understand everything before doing anything, sometimes that makes everything a little more difficult than it has to be. INFJs generally do it better, although in a pretty non-direct way.\n\nFriends: INFJ = INFP. Both types are ok to be friends with. When they care they care a lot, except INFJs express it in the most gentle ways and INFPs tend to bury it deep for some reason. Maybe it has something to do with me interacting with them as an ESTJ.\n\nSpouse: INFJ = INFP. Both require extra care and attention, INFPs a bit more than INFJs and a lot more confusing than them as well. Don't really have a preference on this one.
1	Perceiver vs. Judger really stands out in my experience. INFPs are more scattered and unsure when it comes to dealing with the outside world but internally they are structured and have an individual opinion on most topics. INFJs are the reverse: [MBTI Type Differences: How to tell apart INFPs and INFJs - How to Tell Apart](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/316-MBTI-Type-Differences-How-to-tell-apart-INFPs-and-INFJs)
4	ESTJs and unemployment	I'm an ENFJ married to a wonderful ESTJ who got laid off when oil prices dropped (every job in Houston is related to oil somehow even if not directly) and he's had an incredibly hard time finding a job again. I make enough money at my job that we can still pay the bills and keep food on the table, but every time he's reminded of how tight we have to budget nowadays he gets really hard on himself and shuts down. I'm personally fine with him not working and I support him taking time to find a job he enjoys instead of just the first one to come up, but the more applications go unanswered and the more interviews go nowhere the more stressed out he gets and I'm not sure how best to help him. I can tell he feels like he's letting me down and not living up to his own expectations of himself, but I also know it's the one subject he really doesn't like talking about. Any advice on how to be supportive without being overbearing? 
7	This is a tough one for us. Our jobs mean more than a paycheck. It's can be how we show love to our family, fulfill that SJ duty, and ultimately prove our own self-worth. An ESTJ without a job is like an ENFJ without a cause to defend. But I'm probably not telling you something you don't already know. \n\nEnvironmental acts of service are a huge help during dark times for me. Things like a clean house, clothes, etc. (No sexist intentions there, male or female.) Reminding him of the big picture like you're doing is important; even when he doesn't seem to hear it.
7	I think compliments go a long way. Especially because ESTJs are very critical of themselves, it is rare that they receive words of encouragement or compliments. \n\nAlso, I think ST's in general thrive when you asked them to do some tasks. Instead of just leaving him alone to do the job search and spend the rest of the day not doing much, you could create projects for him. We NF's are really good at being creative! So, maybe, ask him to change some things in the house, improve looks of things, or you can even let go of some of your own duties at home for him to take over. \n\nAnd showing words of appreciation would hopefully make him feel better!\n\nGood luck to you and your wonderful husband :)  You yourself seem like a wonderful wife!
4	I couldn't find a job for a long time and got frustrated, and when I did find a job (part time retail) I was so relieved. For an opportunity more than anything else.\n\nHelping them search is probably not going to go well, nor would offering suggestions, if they are like me. Rather, a calm demeanor and encouragement when times are tough is helpful. And once they do find a job, it will likely seem like a huge relief. THAT is when you two should celebrate! If you have the means now, maybe put away $5 or $10 a paycheck and keep it secret, so when they get a job, you can celebrate without breaking your current budget, when both of you are happy and relieved.\n\nMay you both be well, here's hoping soon for a good job to land :)
2	HTX! Whoooo
2	INTP	what do you think about us? 
6	I like 'em so much I married one. ;)

3	Dang. I was here to see what the OP had to say, and it was simply another INTP.

2	ESTJ men: Relation with money and spouse/SO	What is your view on family finances when you're married? Would you be okay with a stay-hone wife? In your ideal world, how would the finances work out between you and the spouse?
2	My wife stays home, and I work. We discovered when we were dating that we both had very similar sensibilities about money. We're both extremely frugal, she probably even more so than me. We both had zero debt coming out of university, both having made our way through on scholarships and working, so I knew I could trust her with money, and she knew she could trust me with it.\n\nOur arrangement is simple: all income in our family is shared equally between us. We have no individual accounts, and both of us take turns entering our expenses in our budget so we know how we're doing each month. I have always filed our taxes, but I talk her through it as I do them so she knows what we're reporting. We both share all our passwords, are each other's beneficiaries, etc. She spends what she wants when she thinks it's justified, and I do the same. We agree on a set amount of no-justification-needed money that we can each spend each month, and if we don't spend it, it accrues so we can each save for big purchases we might want. Anything over that limit, we discuss. I don't think either of us has ever vetoed the other's proposal of what to spend.
1	Was engaged to an ENFP for a while. We had different budgeting techniques and styles and spending habits, but we would always talk about the big things, how much we would each contribute, and would make sure we agreed and knew what was going on.\n\nHowever we both had completely separate accounts. We didn't even have a joint account, and weren't planning on getting one either. We each had methods that worked for us, and though we tried we couldn't find a way to make them work together. So, we trusted each other to manage our own finances in the way we saw best to meet mutual goals.\n\nIt worked out pretty well for us - much better than I anticipated, since I like to be in control of these kinds of things - but it was a good experience for me to cede control to let her do her thing on her own time. And it worked! I still have absolutely no idea how, but it worked lol.\n\n
2	When an ESTJ falls in love...	How do you show it? When do you say it (if ever)?\n\nMy ESTJ boyfriend mentioned during an argument that he would be sad if we broke up because he had "fallen in love with me." That was over a month ago and he hasn't said anything since. If I try to bring it up, he says he's "waiting for the right time to talk about it." I don't understand why he's acting strange since he's the one who brought it up to begin with? Can any of you ESTJs offer some insight?
6	Personally, I'm not much of a verbal person at all. It has definitely caused issues in relationships in the past. \n\nOne thing that my ex and I did was to go to separate rooms then start the dialogue via text message. Once everything was teed up we would discuss it verbally. \n\nHope that helps :/
4	ESTJ girl here. I guess I can say that from our Fi function we have this sense of insecurity and fear of being emotionally open unless we are really really sure about the situation. I've dealt with this too. It was so scary to take a step further with relationships, and I had to reflect over and over again to make sure that what I'm feeling (and telling people about it) is worth the risk.\n\nIf your boyfriend has told you about his feelings (on the spur of the moment), he might have been thinking about it already, and you don't need to feel unsure. ESTJs are tend to always avoid blurry subjects, so I suggest that you wait until he's really really sure about how he feels, because he will tell you when he is. For us, emotional issues are hard to deal with inside, let alone talk about it. It would make us seem vulnerable, and we hate that. Give him time to take it all in, and when he's ready he'll talk. We're just weird like that.\n\nAnother note, we might be so afraid of telling others our emotional side, but we are a fan of grand gestures. We would go the extra mile to make people around us happy, especially the ones that are important to us. So maybe you can observe what he did instead of what he said.
3	I need constant reassurance from my SO probably because of some rooted insecurity or something. I tell him a lot, but I think that the way I show it the most is my actions. I make him dinner each night and pack his lunch-- not because I'm his mom, but because I noticed he was losing weight and not taking care of himself because he wasn't eating right. I wanted to fix that for him with home cooked meals. I'm sure he has something where he shows you.  \n  \nAlso, I'm pretty rough around the edges. With my ex boyfriend, I wouldn't say it until he said it first. I was just naturally stubborn and proud.
3	In my experience, ESTJs are mainly good at showing affection via letters or texts, not in real life.  If that's something you need a lot of (in sex, in person), it will be hard to find.
1	Idk. I'm nice with my actions instead of my words. 
1	hahaha, me and my gf had a metaphor for saying "I love you", which made it much easier for her. She still uses it sparingly, but I know it counts when she does.
3	ISTP	What do you think about us?
3	Amazing. I hate to use this particular word to describe anything or anyone but I've come to realise how compatible many of them I know have been with myself personally.\n\nI like how they could always manage to have the sort of calm but unrelenting dedication when it comes to their work/ hobbies/ the things they're doing. As an ESTJ I'm familiar with "dedication" itself, but what the ISTPs have is completely different. I especially enjoy the professionalism and precision that lie within their actions and thoughts- they make things so much simpler. \n\nI suppose it wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that I'm quite fond of some of their common traits, and when you like a few things of someone too much you become blinded and will definitely feel that some of the flaws on them, although jarring on the others, have become completely acceptable (which is never a good thing.)\n\nSo responsibly speaking, I'm completely biased on the subject matter, at least on this one, I can't tell you much about the negative experience I had interacting with the ISTPs, solely because I don't think there has been any.
3	What's the ESTJ secret to working hard without being overboard?	I am an INFP that said, when it comes to work I like to be organized, have a plan, I hate inefficiency or sloppy work, I want things to be done the "correct" way, just overall I take a lot of pride in my work. I expect perfection of myself.\n\nThe thing is I am INFP. When I'm not working I'm very relaxed, and the reason I do work hard is because my moral code, can't stand feeling like I've let myself, or others down. \n\nThe issue is I apparently turn into a little tyrant, without meaning to. I've actually had ESTJ friends pull me aside, and they'll basically tell me; "It's great that you take pride in your work, but you need to take a breath, and step back."\n\nYou guys, and girls though ESTJ's always seem like you can have amazing work ethic, without going too overboard on others. \n\nI'm not going to stop working hard, so since your type is about the hardest workers I know, naturally I'm wondering what your secret is, to doing so, without coming off like a taskmaster?
8	Care more about results and less about the correct way.  Get things done more quietly.  \n\nThere is surely an art to "rising above" the situation and mastering it.  A good manager can tell his employees what to do clearly and with empathy, but a great manager doesn't need to.\n\nIf I get demanding, frantic, or frazzled, it's usually because I feel out of control of the situation and I am doing everything I can to get control back. The solution for me is instead to find ways to get the right outcomes without having total control.  \n\nMore and more I see the biggest factor in this is trust.  If I trust those I work with, I let them do their job in their way, according to their judgments.  I can nudge, influence, and suggest--if they're good, that will be enough.
5	Who are some ESTJ characters?	A random little list to start:  \n\nAgent Coulson  (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)  \nDwight Schrute  (The Office)  \nHermione Granger (Harry Potter)  \nProfessor Mcgonagall (Harry Potter)  \nWoody (Toy Story)  \nPrincess Leia Organa (Star Wars)  \nMycroft Holmes (BBC's Sherlock)  \nChief Wiggum (The Simpsons)  \nStan Smith (American Dad)  \nCaptain Pike (Star Trek)  \nDetective Amy Santiago (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)  \nDetective Carlton Lassiter (Psych)  
3	Dolores Umbridge (Harry Potter)\n\nSorry :(
3	Jack Shepard from Lost. \nCaptain Janeway from Star Trek: Voyager.
3	Armitage Hux, Star Wars: the force awakens. 
2	Damian Wayne (Batman) (unless you type him as ESTP)\n\nCaptain America (Marvel) (some type him as ISFJ)\n\n
1	Emily Gilmore (Gilmore Girls)\n\nAlison Hendrix (Orphan Black)
3	Good books to read as an ESTJ?	
3	Atlas Shrugged.  That should keep you busy for a while.
2	My favorite book of all time is the Riddle-Master of Hed trilogy by Patricia McKillip. It's fantasy. I also loved The Forgotten Beasts of Eld by the same author.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, is hilarious.\n\nIf you're looking for nonfiction the Narative of Fredrick Douglas is another favorite of mine.
1	Syrup by Max Barry? ESTJ husband really likes that one.
1	I also have to recommend [Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680) by Taleb. Extraordinary.
1	Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol Dweck\n
1	Brave New World
3	ESTJs and leadership abilities?	People always say that ESTJs are natural leaders and that their desire to take charge comes naturally to them. However, is it possible to still be an ESTJ if leadership does not come naturally to me? Could it be that other factors (such as my enneagram) may affect why I'm not a natural leader? Or is it impossible to be an ESTJ if you don't have natural leadership abilities / desires?\n\nI have many Te traits and have been typed by many people as ESTJ, but I don't naturally always want to take the position of a leader and I'm not as blunt / direct as most ESTJs. However, I think I have more Te than Si
1	No, being a natural leader doesn't mean it all comes naturally to us. That statement is really over-simplified, having 4 functions arranged like this doesn't magically give us the power and will of a commander. We do come off as domineering because most of us have this mentality that would make us look like we want to achieve robot efficiency with every task perfectly done, but the way every ESTJ deals with this mentality is very different. Personally I become impatient quickly when anyone in my team makes a mistake or does not understand a point I've explained. And as events as such mount, my impatience would show. In this situation, if I had no right to take the lead and monitor every task they're undertaking, I wouldn't personally feel right about it. And although I've never wanted the power (so to speak), I simply think it's the easiest and safest way to make sure that everything is under control and the quality of our work won't be compromised in any way- and then people simply think that I'm aggressive and domineering. But at the same time, although we share the same thinking process and probably feel the same way facing the same situation, other ESTJs might not do exactly the same thing I often do. Does that make them non-ESTJ? Absolutely not.\n\nSo if you think you've got all these functions checked and in right order, you're most likely an ESTJ. Don't worry about it.
1	I actually don't think ESTJ = natural leader. \n\nI was in a relationship with one and know a few ESTJs, who definitely are committed to work, are great at what they do, and rise up the ranks in their respective fields.\n\nHowever, ESTJs are more efficient than effective from my observations. They are efficient in that they get things done in a timely manner, don't waste resources, and are very reliable with whatever they commit themselves with. If these qualities are what makes a role a leadership role, I think ESTJ would make a great leader. Mostly, though, it's more managerial tasks that ESTJs are really good at.\n\nEffectiveness would involve more long-term future-thinking. An effective person might not be as good at getting things done efficiently and speedily, but may be thinking about how to make a process sustainable. \n\nWhen I think about ESTJs, they are more efficient than effective. I actually wrote about this a while back if you're interested!
1	I wouldn't say that all ESTJs are natural leaders, but I do think they tend to *make* excellent leaders. \n\nMy boyfriend is an ESTJ and he doesn't want to be in a leadership position at all. But he's fair, logical, follows rules, works hard and diligently, is consistent and straightforward. These characteristics cause his employers to put him in leadership positions. \n\nAlso, it would make sense for you to have more Te than Si because Te is your dominant function, Si is auxiliary (if you're an ESTJ).
4	Lukewarm logic.	There are people who like calling our way of thinking "prefer cold logic". But instead of relying on logic we are also heavily empirical, in my opinion, empiricism does not necessarily render anything "cold", does it?
3	Not an ESTJ, but I lurk this sub frequently. I don't necessarily that that empiricism denotes anything "cold," but it can seem cold to other types, especially those whose dominant or auxiliary function is Ni or Fe (possibly Fi too). This is because Ni-, Fe-, and sometimes Fi-doms/auxiliaries navigate the world using their intuition and/or base their decisions solely on the feelings of others or their own personal belief system. Empiricism denies all of those things because there's no scientific evidence to back the claims.
1	Empiricism is basically based on what's happened in the past, so great memory goes a long way when ESTJs use empiricism to determine something.\n\nI think it's a great strength of ESTJs.
7	What do you think of INTJs?	I think INTJs and ESTJs have some things in common, fundamentally, but I'd like to hear what you think. 
7	I tend to collect them, they're the best company I keep!
7	I'm married to one. 
3	I work with someone who claims to be an INTJ and he is overbearing, arrogant, judgmental, and won't hesitate to trash traits he doesn't agree who in front of anyone else. It is incredibly annoying and frustrating.\n\nAt the same time, he is highly intelligent, logic driven, and very, very helpful.
3	I am an ESTJ and have an INTJ mother. She is one of my best friends, but also the one person who can drive me absolutely crazy. She is very controlling and opinionated, and when she believes in something, that is the way it is. Period. However, I do appreciate how objective she is when I have an issue I am trying to resolve with work or someone else close to me. 
2	The ones I know make good friends but not good colleagues.
2	I'm an INTJ and my father is an ESTJ (at least I suspect). We get along really well and always have. Only things I get annoyed at are how he's always pointing out things in the environment that I couldn't care less about. Like "look at that roof it needs repairing". Why would I care about some random dude's roof? I'm guessing this is his sensing at work. He is seriously out of control with this and does it all the time. I don't know how he notices some of the things he points out.\n\nHe also has a tendecy to ramble on and on and I can just tune him out and give the occasional yep and he'll go for hours. I kind of like this though because I am more introverted. And he gets impatient easily and can't stand a lack of care for household items. He'll keep old things forever and try to reuse things whereas I'll spill water on something and want to throw it away.\n\nI think we get along really well because we see the big picture in a similar way. We both like to keep emotions out of decision making and just put our heads down and get the job done. We both absolutely despise manipulative people and can sense them from a mile away. We both love watching shows like shark tank, the profit, and american pickers together. That's about all I can think of for now, maybe I'll add more tomorrow if I can think of anything.\n\n
1	Could use more ESTJs in Typology Server	
2	ESTJ's- Do you sleep a lot?	I know I do.\n\nIs this a trait common to ESTJ's?\n\nI'm certainly a night person, I sleep deeply and have never been a morning person.
1	I can sleep a lot, usually from exhaustion. But I'm a bit of a morning owl. I like to stay up late and wake up early. Bout 6 hours of sleep a night. I just always have something to do! 
1	Nope! I sleep very little! I am a morning person, I naturally wake up around 5-5:30 in the morning. 
1	I'm definitely a morning person especially with coffee. And I am a light sleeper, so I often don't get a very good night's sleep. 
1	I'm in law school... need I say more?
1	Not me, I've had insomnia and have been a light sleeper since I was little. Frankly I don't think I know what it feels like being able to sleep without struggling. 
1	I'm slightly nocturnal, but my career requires waking up at 6:30/7 to get to work on time.  I survive on 4-5 hours of sleep a night, and then catch up once every 2-3 weeks.
1	I do okay in the mornings but I also like to get decent sleep. A while back I had problems sleeping and it drove me insane. 
1	In contrast to other comments here, my wife is an ESTJ I believe and identifies with OP - likes to sleep a lot (though isn't a deep sleeper) and is terrible in the morning.  She will aim for her full 8 hours.
1	Kind of. Although sleep should have a consistent fall asleep and wake up time 7 days a week, I sleep in till 10 sometimes on weekends.  Full time work and part time school encourages the weekend sleep ins. 
3	How To Relax As An ESTJ	One of the weaknesses of an ESTJ is their ability to relax.\n\nI've started proactively scheduling in relaxation time, saunas and do some meditation.\n\nWhat do you guys (ESTJ's) do to make sure you are relaxed and feeling good?
6	I'm glad to see the ESTJ commenters gave short and concise answers so that they could get back to relaxing!
4	Long hot showers, or recreational reading.
3	Smoke weed.
2	a bath
2	Hot water. Long nap.
2	-Relaxing in a hammock \n-Camping (organizing stuff provides me a sense of security and then being close to nature makes me feel peace of mind) \n- Moving \n- Face massage \n- Dancing with my earplugs on some pop music \n- Aromatherapy \n- Cuddling with a dog\n\nPretty much it and pretty much all. \n
1	Massages. Time by myself. I love my quiet time.
1	Find an ISTP to f * ck
1	Run. Watch a fave tv show. 
3	Do you all have trouble with dating?	I find it really difficult to date people since, as an ETSJ, I'm straight up with whomever I talk to, which scares them away.
7	I'm not an ESTJ, but I'm dating one. From my perspective, I think it's ESTJs' intimidating personality in general that makes dating difficult. It's not just your honesty, it's the competitiveness, the need to always be right, the perceived lack of warmth, etc. I'm not saying these are bad things, but introverts and intuitive types in particular tend to shy away from these characteristics.
3	Used to have that problem, not anymore. Some people find it awkward talking to me because I'm too straightforward for their liking but I would say that's their problem. Its been long since I've realised that there are people out there who would prefer me being blunt.
3	I had trouble dating because I can't respect people who won't respect my time.  Don't make vague plans and then refuse to confirm them.  Don't tell me "I'm sorry, I'm running 5 minutes late" for half an hour.  And do not stand me up.
2	Try other thinker types, I'm a male entp with a female estj and I couldn't be happier with my cold little song bird. We both value honesty and efficiency and our blunt communication style matches up so we don't spend all of our time over thinking things, we just say what we want or feel and no one gets butt hurt. Also the sex is mind blowing with two thinker types.  I will warn you, that you need to go for older xntp types if you are going for young or Immature ones they will just torture you with needless troll behavior.  Good luck!   
4	Outdoor Hobbies For ESTJ	What hobbies suit an ESTJ?\n\nI'm an active person and competitive so looking for new things to do outside\n\nAny ideas?
2	Get on a bike! I started with just riding to class, now I race nearly every discipline. It is highly competitive. The community is welcoming. The adrenaline is wicked.
2	Motorbikes and cars
2	Join races and obstacle courses, join a dragon boat racing team, find some good nearby hiking paths, go swimming, kayaking
2	I knew an ESTJ whose passion is rockclimbing and riding his motorcycle. He lives in Colorado which probably helped as well. 
1	Road bike, hike, run, paddle board...depends on what you like. 
1	My ESTJ husband loves paint balling, though as he's nearing 30 it's not as easy on his knees as it used to be lol
1	Kayaking, biking, running while listening to podcasts or kindle books, hiking with friends, swimming (needs to be coached at first).. Basically what everyone said haha\n
3	Time-management/Efficiency for ESTJ	Since learning about being an ESTJ, I've been improving how I work and get things done in my life.\n\nMy favourite book is 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective people.' I've made a lot of progress with organizing my week and "putting first things first."\n\nDo you guys have any tips for an ESTJ trying to be more productive?\n\nWhat works for you?
3	Structure. Get something in a routine and stick to it
1	Enfp invasion ...	Alright well screw the Infps you guys are being full on invaded (and not with wishy washy emotional introverts) \n\nAlright well what do you think of entjs and entps who are basically your evil twin or arch enemy (coming from an enfp)
8	What the fuck did I just read? 
4	Don't have a problem with ENTJs, they are tolerable. ENTPs are generally too much but I don't have to deal with them on a daily basis (fortunately) so it's whatever.\n\nENFPs, on the other hand...\n\nTerrible.
2	Not my arch nemesis but I always get the feeling that they need convincing and you have to appeal to their emotions to get them inspired to do something. \n\nThat's ridiculous and silly in my opinion. They seem like the type that would need a motivational speaker.
1	A description of the acronyms would be nice.
2	An INFP lurking in this subreddit	Hi ESTJs! Lo and behold I am an INFP invading your space :) I am here asking for your advice regarding my closest friend, my mother, who is an ESTJ. We have a very mutual love- hate relationship. My ideas are constantly against her ideas and she always think she is right. So I just follow what she says but it is so exhausting having my opinions put aside. How do I deal with her? Thank you all lovely ESTJs.
4	If you live at home you should follow her within reason. She is your mother. Have a direct talk with her about it. State what you mean clearly, but try to be calm. If she gets confrontational or wants to argue, just continue to stay calm and speak softly.
3	What Do You Do For A Living?	
5	Engineer
3	I do systems and automation stuff for a company. Aka IT work.
3	I steal cars.
2	I'm an Architect.
2	Barista at Starbucks, advertising for a real estate agency, and full time college student. \n\nEdit: BS in Political Science. After graduation I'll be going to law school. 
2	Medical school
2	QA Engineer. 
1	Serious Fraud Investigator  
1	Office assistant for the city.
1	Command Inspection Program - program manager for the Dept. of Defense. 
1	Vice president of property management for an urban development firm
1	teller at a bank\n
3	What do you all think about INTP's?	ISTP here, doing a study for the INTP community. \n\nEdit: figured out that I'm actually an ISTP. 
4	I am am also an ESTJ married to an INTP. It can be difficult at times because I like the to be certain rules for things, and by his nature, rules are made to be broken. \n\nOtherwise I think we help to bring out the recessive traits in each other. He'll suggest we stay in for the night because we have had a stressful week, and I end up enjoying it more than if I had gone out and stretched myself too thin. I make him go out and visit family and friends, and although he hates the lead up, he genuinely enjoys the time out.\n\nWe also have different perspectives. I am more analytical and go over the details of everything before I proceed, whereas he can dive head first into something and stay afloat without being overwhelmed because he can imagine alternative potential outcomes, where I would panic because it isn't going as planned or I can't imagine how it was "supposed" to go and that bothers me.\n\nSometimes it is refreshing and we bring back to earth frequently because of the differing view points.
3	f them right in the pooper, seriously, f them.  
2	I've been dating an INTP for three years and while I can't go into detail at the moment, I can say I love him. There are defiantly struggles as he's not as intimate as I want, but his way of thinking challenges mine and keeps me on my toes.\n\nIf I can, I'll come back and elaborate.
2	Married to one. He's perfect for me. 
1	I can only say about the ones I know. They are ok to work with, overall tolerable.
3	What do you think of INFPs?	We're not quite polar opposites. You guys have the Te-Si-Ne-Fi, whilst the INFPs have Fi-Ne-Si-Te. That being said, what do you think of us?
7	I married one, so I at least like that one quite a bit :)\n\nIn general i like the INFPs that see the good in the world and are generally happy people. \n\nThere are other INFPs that strike me as just having bad attitudes and I really want nothing to do with them.\n\nI like spending time with INFPs for recreation.  I think dealing with an INFP professionally or for business would be very frustrating.
2	Unfortunately the three of them I know are always at odds with me and one of them gets on my nerves often. Good thing I don't have to interact with any of them on a daily basis.
2	I'll flip your question just for fun:\n\nINFP here. Brother is ESTJ. When we try to interact directly it gets a bit strenuous. But just having him around makes me feel cared for and protected. I like how confident he is when he engages with the world, and I usually don't disagree with him I just don't have the same interests.
5	Ever feel irritated when being over-sentimental?	It just happened like an hour or so ago, I noticed that I was irritated (disgusted even) by myself for being over-sentimental. I was told that "this is definitely a ESTJ thing", but was not convinced since there was no solid proof for that. But anyway, it rarely happens since I don't think I'm a sentimental person to begin with, but when it happens I think it irks me more than it should. So fellow ESTJs, have you ever experienced this? And if so what do you often do to get pass the irritation or just try to ignore it and wait it out like I do?
2	Yes. I move often, every year for the past eight years. Every time I feel angry with myself when I want to keep things that are "sentimental". It's just stuff and I hate the clutter. 
2	I like being sentimental. I get frustrated when others aren't as sentimental as I am.
1	I'm not very sentimental normally, but I find myself being so with my kiddo. He's 7 and I get irrationally angry when my husband throws out completed school work/art that I haven't gotten to see yet. You'd probably think, "Well duh! Every parent wants to see their child's work!" But I get upset when I can't even see the truly dumb stuff too.\n\nAnyway, I don't necessarily care about being sentimental, but I do care if I'm being percieved as being irrational/overly emotional. That's humiliating to me and my reaction is usually to be angry about it. 
5	How not to be the tool of an ESTJ	Have some of you been very dependent on someone and "used" them a lot for getting the things you want? How did you guys move towards being more independent? My ESTJ SO is bombarding me with requests for help and assistance on stuff she is very capable of doing great herself, how can I support her in a positive way to be more independent? I am an INTP and I need my "me" time to feel like a human, so this behavior needs to stop or have a drastic decrease in frequency.
4	My ENTJ friend is similar. *How can someone I know be useful/advantageous to me?* is a question that often goes through her head. *Let me see if I can offer them a deal where I'll be able to save money and effort, and they can get something in return too* (but what they get is not as sweet as what she gets). I think she loves the idea of people serving her too much. She's also an only child.
3	How old is she?
3	This is going to be very blunt, but it's not personal, so please don't be offended. I know when I ask for help I want it to achieve whatever I'm currently focusing on and I cannot be distracted from it, and so I often neglect the feeling of the other person because if I had time for that I would have gone through the bother myself. \n\nSo my advice is that do it for her now and quick, but talk about it afterwards. Tell her that you aren't happy with how she treated you like a tool and everything, she's going to feel like you aren't happy helping her out, explain to her clearly what you want, not just lay the problem on her and let her figure out herself. Tell her exactly what you think is unacceptable, and tell her what you want.
2	What's her motivation for asking for all this help? Determining that might uncover a tidy solution. Have you tried communicating in very clear, concrete terms, with examples, what you need and what you want to change (and why)?\n\nPersonally, I've always been a very "if you want something done right, do it yourself" type person, and while I prefer company I don't like to be dependent on others.\n\nIf you really feel she's using you like a "tool" it might have less to do with her being an ESTJ and more to do with her. No personality type gives someone license to treat others badly.
0	Why so boring	You guys are the most textbook people anywhere, one estj who shall remain unnamed is your classic overachiever, 100% top 1% grades, wins competitive sports, music, maths you name it and does every extracurricular out there. (And is top performer in each) Maybe I am salty said estj is so boring in general.  All he does is brag about his newest achievements that is when you get to talk to him. Usually said estj is very focused on what they are doing and is absorbed into studying or whatever OR trying to command the whole room to do their will.(which btw Is always the most boring, predictable "efficient" thing) he has a lot of admirers but not a lot of friends. Is this an estj thing or just him? 
11	Sounds like you''re a jealous asshole. Get some achievements of your own instead of stirring up trouble on our subreddit.
8	I sense you're feeling inadequate.
2	Why so typist?
2	Get over yourself. 
2	In all honesty though, the one who wins is often far from boring.
2	There are assholes in every personality type 
1	I find this post especially interesting because OP comes across as insecure, judgmental, and perhaps believes themselves to be inadequate. Why post on an ESTJ forum attacking ESTJs?\n\nAnyway, I am NOT an ESTJ, so this post doesn't impose on my personality at all. However, I'm responding because I think you are incorrect, OP. ESTJs are "textbook," I guess you could say, in the sense that they are some of the most dependable and reliable people you will ever meet. I've found that most ESTJs don't have to brag about their achievements because, honestly, they usually don't feel the need to prove themselves to anyone they don't care about. And, if they do care about you, it's because the feeling is mutual. You'll already KNOW their achievements if this is the case. ESTJs have a natural commanding presence without even trying. Yes, their notion to believe they're always right is annoying sometimes because they're so damn stubborn, there's no swaying them, but that's only one downfall in a plethora of good qualities. If you can't handle their personalities, don't be friends with them. Jealousy isn't becoming on anybody, OP. 
2	S's: Have you ever cheated?	I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:\nDid you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?
4	Never have, never would. The idea isn't even appealing, it's abhorrent. It would demonstrate a fundamental lack of respect for my partner, myself, and the relationship.
3	I've never cheated and never would. \n\nI'm married, and most of my friends are men including my best friend. I regularly go out with them/crash at their place if I can't drive home or I'm in their town. It has NEVER crossed my mind. I would never break my husband's trust. 
3	Have not and will not. Takes a gun to my head to make me cheat on my so, breaking a promise is against my fundamental moral code.
1	Only once physically but I broke it off with the guy I was seeing the next time I saw him. Slight guilt but the guy and I were in a super new relationship.  I didn't enjoy cheating, per se, but I enjoyed how I felt with the "other" guy. 
6	What is the most important thing in your life?	Don't mind me, just doing a casual survey ;). The most important thing in my life is my spirituality.
10	Unpopular answer: Jesus. 
8	The freedom to do as I please, in the sense that I control my future.
7	My motivation, my drive. I must find ways in compelling myself  through difficult times. My everyday revolves around the desire to maintain a level of progression in all aspects including friends, family, studies and career. 
5	knowing that the work i do can make a difference in the community/ world 
5	My religion and moving towards my goal of having a family.
3	My sons. 
0	ESTJ Special Interview with and INFJ	
2	Does this sound like an ESTJ?	*Disclaimer: I do not think all ESTJs are like this (that's why I'm curious to hear what you think.)*\n\nI've known this person for a few years (though on an acquaintance level). From what I've seen, he fits the cognitive functions of an ESTJ almost perfectly. The thing that surprises me a bit is how traditional he is. I know that with Si as the auxiliary function, of course he would be more mindful toward the past, but he seems extremely  grounded in traditional values and ideas. Just about every time we've had a conversation or I've overheard one of his on public transit, he judges whatever someone else says in terms of old English/Victorian moral standards and ways of living. For example, someone in a class we have together brought up the topic of women working in trades careers that are typically masculine jobs. This guy is not shy about talking in class, so he responded to this by saying that gender roles should be protected because that is what societies are built on, and that more women should be encouraged to stay home to have children. Being millennials, many other students said that he was being ridiculous and too traditional. Does this resonate with you, do you think this is common for ESTJs?
6	Doesn't resonate at all. \n\nProbably because I'm ESTJ, in a very male dominated career, in a very male dominated industry and I happen to have a vagina. I've been exposed to lots of fragile masculinity (that's actually what this is) and haven't really noticed that it's more prevalent amongst certain personality types in comparison to others. \n\nYour buddy is aspiring to the cultural imaginary of traditional values, not the historical reality of them, as a vehicle to excuse his misogyny. Under the traditional Victorian values of education and social mobility, it is highly unlikely that he would be in university at all. Presumably he's opted to neglect that. How does he feel about kidnapping brown people, forcing them to work on cotton plantations and occasionally lynching them? \n
2	Yes it's a super common trait. We are very traditonal.
1	My boyfriend is an ESTJ and, from the very beginning, he made it clear to me that he has duties in our relationship (his words, not mine) that tend to be on the more traditional side. However, that being said, my dream job is a predominantly male career, but my ESTJ is extremely supportive of me pursuing this career and maybe even more determined for me to achieve this goal than I am. I don't think ESTJ men are traditional in the sense that they think women can't or shouldn't be independent, but more in the sense that they have an innate desire to protect and provide for their families. 
1	Yeah, actually.\n\n> *he judges whatever someone else says in terms of old English/Victorian moral standards and ways of living. For example, someone in a class we have together brought up the topic of women working in trades careers that are typically masculine jobs. This guy is not shy about talking in class, so he responded to this by saying that gender roles should be protected because that is what societies are built on, and that more women should be encouraged to stay home to have children*.\n\nAs dumb as that all is, ESTJs rely on what they know to have worked best as a way to know what to do going forward. We typically stick with what we've determined to be the tried and true method. In this guy's case, it's gender roles. Doesn't mean he's right, just for him he's seen this to be the proper way and so he's going to judge everything going forward against this baseline.\n\nedit: random character.
1	What is for you the greatest invention of the 20th century?	"Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression." (Europeana: A Brief History of the Twentieth Century by Patrik Ouredn√≠k)\n\n\nA price of freedom? "Glorious" capitalism; crazy feminism! (What do you think?)

4	ESTJ men: How do you feel about being asked out by a woman?	A friend of mine who is an ESTJ man once told me he loses interest when a woman asks him out first. \n\nIs this true for most ESTJs?
7	I tend to be forward and direct so usually I'm the one asking a woman out. But if a woman was confident and direct enough to ask me out I wouldn't be offended, or lose interest.
2	I like to think that it would be no different than my asking her out because the end result is the same but I love the chase and I like being assertive by initiating. Her asking me out *might* detract from that?\n\nI highly doubt I'd say no, though, assuming I was into her. 
1	I'm a estj women and I expect the guy to make a move.
1	I never met a man who doesn't want to be the pursuer.  \n\nHunter. 
0	My boss is an ESTJ	My boss is an ESTJ,  I am an ENTP....how can I make this work?
10	Without knowing anything about your job... \n\nDo your job to the best of you ability, be serious when dealing with work, keep your work area clean, stay organized.
2	As an entp myself, I'd say don't worry about it too much. You'll get bored and move on to a new job within a year or so. :D\n\nBut for real, it'll be rough. They're almost the exact opposite of us and DON'T know how to have a discussion without being emotionally tangled. Try to think through things before you say them since if it can be taken personally, it likely will. You'll say something that you see as a simple truth and your boss will take it as a personal attack on them and everything they stand for. \n\nWithout knowing your job, I'd try to negotiate for as much freedom as possible to do your own thing. They can be controlling personalities so our... unorthodox means of getting things done doesn't fit an estj who like to grind things out methodically. 
0	what's your height and weight?	Can you please answer that question in [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/PQQOrIHHCAQoyBM63)\n\nWill share the result afterwards.\n\nThanks you
12	I highly doubt there would be any coorelation between height/weight and MBTI type given the near infinite variations in diet, lifestyle, background, etc.
5	ESTJs: Whaddya think about Trump?	
12	Hard pass
8	I despise him.
17	I strongly dislike him. He is a liar just like any other politician. Nothing about him says otherwise in my opinion. 
8	Love him. Especially his attitude. 
9	I voted for Trump, he embodies Americana. He's crude, but a breath of fresh air. He's an egotist, but that drives his success. 
12	Never. 
10	No.
9	Nope, nope and nope! I am also Canadian though,
4	The first victory and a good start in the war against cultural Marxism, far-left ideology, multiculturalism and globalism. 
4	Love him. I live somewhat similar to him. Straightforward, harsh words that may hurt but holds truth.
3	I have issues with people who say unfactual things. Sure, we all do it from time to time, but when presented with facts, he denies it and I can't comprehend that.
3	I'm big fan.
2	Nightmare.  Complete nightmare.   
3	What do you think of other ESTJs?	Hiya ESTJs.  Asking out of curiosity. In your life experience with other ESTJs, what did you think of them? Positive, or negative? Mature, or immature? Life-changing, or meh?  Thanks!
4	Typically I hate them. I find them rude and controlling. \n\nFor example, I work with a fellow ESTJ. Since she has the same position as me, I get highly annoyed when she tells me what to do. It would be much different if she had a higher rank, but she does not. \n\nI enjoy my more "free spirited" friends because they get me to loosen up. A night out with an ESTJ is usually boring compared to my other friends. 
2	I've met and worked with an ESTJ, to be honest I found working with him taxing and vexing most of the time, and I didn't like the inconvenience he brought to me. I held respect for him, though, I understood where he came from most of the time and enjoyed his efficiency.
2	I usually hate other ESTJs and their inability to take other people's feelings into consideration, especially when it is pretty clear that the other side will get hurt by their stupid, rash words.\n\nAlso the 'I am not even gonna listen to your point because I am right and you are not' mentality is driving me nuts.\n\nI feel like I am not a strong T though, my F has been recently developing more and more.
1	I like them!
6	MBTI and video game preferences	I have been playing around with trying assign video game preferences to MBTI types, specifically using the eight Jungian cognition functions. Any thoughts from anyone here?
3	Survey seems like the best methodology, I think. 
2	I used to play LoL and Civ V a lot, but I gave them up to try and be more productive.
1	CoD, FFVIII, Sims, Fallout 3, Skyrim, NFS, MK8, WoW... whatever everyone else was playing at the time. I don't game any more except for with the guys over a drink; we'll play Fifa or Tekken usually.
1	Zelda, Metroid, Smash, Mario Kart, Splatoon, you know. Nintendo classics. Also CIV II. Still play some console every day.
1	I enjoy old school survival games, e.g.: neoscavenger.
3	Is an ESTJ guy good at mind games?	The second question is is an ESTJ guy naturally into science? (not engineering but maths, physics, etc)\n\n
4	Always been into the sciences. I like the methodology and the way it yields reliable results. \n\nAs for mind games (I assume you mean manipulating people to get a desired result). I don't think so at least not in a emotionally manipulative and slimy way. Honesty, reliability, tradition and integrity are large parts of the ESTJ persona. You can't be seen as any of those if you are acting like a lizard.\n\nIf I want something. I will say it. However if I know I can't get it now, I will work / position myself so I could get it if asked in a transparent discussion.
4	Physics, yes, math, not really. But frankly I'm much more into philosophy and art in a pedantic sense than science.\n\nI cannot speak for every ESTJ myself but I do not initiate mind games. I'd play along if I have to, but I'm not fond of them. Of all methods, I prefer actual hard work and precision.
2	My boyfriend is an ESTJ and is an actor with strong interests in literature and philosophy, and falls a bit flat with math and sciences. He does have good capability to understand new concepts, though, but I don't think that's ESTJ related as much as it is just that he's an intelligent person. ESTJs also like directness, so mind games are counterproductive. \n\nI'd say no to both of those questions. 
2	We don't play mind games. Straight forwardness and honesty are cardinal virtues in our relationships.\n\nI personally have a deep love of science.
1	Physics yeah - I was really good at in High School, even got an award for it my senior year. I'm currently in Financial Services, so I'm not a big science person right now. 
1	Pretty much yes for me and like what some of them mentioned, Physics, Math, Philosophy, Politics.
1	I feel at home with my fellow estj brethren 
1	Mind games, good? Depends on the reference point. By istj standards your good but by entp standards youre absolute trash. 
7	I really wish you guys posted more :( especially the ladies. Just sayin.	
9	There is an ESTJ group on Facebook with 4000+ members that is fairly active.  You might check that out if you are looking for some insight into the ESTJ.
4	Because I'm curious by nature, why especially posts by women?
1	Ask away!!
3	Understanding an ESTJ character. (Help)	I'm an ENFP writing a novel, and one of my main characters is an ESTJ. Because I am nearly the complete opposite of his personality type, I'm struggling to understand him and how he would act in certain situations. So, I was wondering if any of you could help me out.\n\nHere's some backstory:\n\n* He is a prince, and his duty throughout the story is to get the princess to fall in love with him so that the kingdom will be protected.\n* The princess is an INFP, so they often butt heads.\n* Neither of them are actually attracted to each other at all.\n\nOk, so here are my questions:\n\n* Would he be able to tell that the princess is not in love with him, even if she accepted his affection and never said she wasn't?\n* If he's able to tell, what would he do about it?\n* If he attempted to change his personality to make her love him, how hard would that be for him to do?\n* How does he act around his friends?\n* How does he show affection?\n\nI realize you're not all the same, but there are of course similarities amongst you all. I'm just trying to get some insight, because at the moment, I feel like his personality has been very inconsistent throughout the story.\n\nThanks.
7	> The princess is an INFP, so they often butt heads.\n> Neither of them are actually attracted to each other at all.\n\nMajor plot hole. We ESTJs are irresistible.\n\n(Serious reply forthcoming)
3	[deleted]
2	My mother is an ESTJ and I'm an ENFP... We argue a lot and I can't stand her personality. The structure and planning is sooo annoying and nevertheless bossing. I think she thinks I have no structure or goals, but I do. Any tips how to make her like me as a person and not just because I'm her daughter?
1	Serious answer, though:\n\n1. Yeah, absolutely. Something would just seem...off with the relationship.\n\n2. Nothing, really. It's his duty to protect the kingdom. Sure, the marriage wouldn't be happily ever after or anything and something would definitely be "off," but the kingdom is safe, needs are being met, and that's what matters. There would probably be a discussion between the Prince and the Princess as to why this marriage needs to work for the sake of the kingdom.\n\n3. Impossible. From personal experience, I've tried to change myself for people before and it doesn't/can't work. I'll never apologize for my fiery, passionate, sometimes explosive character ever again.\n\n4. He always makes sure everyone's having a good time, tends to hide his own problems from his friends so that they always seem him "doing well." He has a few confidants, though.\n\n5. Affection is displayed through actions and touch rather than words.\n\nHow'd I do, other ESTJs? Just tried to see things from the Prince's perspective if I were in his position.
1	I'll try to throw my two pence in, but this is going to be brief as I'm using the mobile app ok enough said lets go\n\n1. Yes\n\n2. Nothing. He only wants to marry her and keep peace in two realms protecting their land, yes? Any ESTJ would make it clear beforehand that it's not for love it's just politics. If the princess tries something stupid though he'd make an attempt to talk her out of it in the name of the law and politics itself.\n\n3. A. He wouldn't. We don't change ourselves try to make something happen. We do it our own way. B. And so if he's lost his mind and tries to do it it would be the most difficult thing on earth.\n\n4. Straightforward, blunt, efficiency-oriented. We can stay out of touch with some of our friends for ages without being bothered and still consider them our friends.\n\n5. That depends. I'm incredibly awkward in front of my significant other/ family members, and I don't do anything to show my affections, but I feel in my own skin dealing with work based relationships. Others might be different on that.
2	Small talk	What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?\n\nI've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp\n\nAlso I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)
3	I do like small talk mainly because I like talking with everyone at a party or a workplace at least once and it's a good way to do that without talking about something "deep" and taking the risk of hearing something painfully stupid. 
2	Small talk for me is mostly with co-workers (because it's socially expected) or if it's functional and/or beneficial for me in the future. I am generally not very interested in other people, so it does cost me more energy then I get out of it...
2	Love small talk, sometimes it can useless if the other person is un-interesting or not talkative or introverted
1	A bit of background: ESTJ girl here, studied psychology so I like people in general.\nI *love* small talks though it drains me. I much prefer to-the-point conversations, but I still do it to keep the good vibe around my social circles, while quietly judge them lol. I also like to socialize and meet new people, which requires me to talk about the weather before I can ask questions about their deep darkest fears.
1	Annoying as hell.  
2	Social norms and Tradition	Are there any of you ESTJs who doesn't give importance to social norms and tradition? or maybe even think that some of them are stupid and maybe should not be followed?
5	I'm with you. I have to see the purpose behind a tradition or social norm before I buy-in. It's gotta make good logical sense. 
1	I'm an ESTJ female, so by default I'm not following the traditional norm of how a girl should be lol. I grow up in a religious and collective environment, and let me tell you how I'm sick of all those nonsense rules. They seem so inefficient and petty. Norms follow function, not the other way around.
1	Or you could go the entp way and just do things differently just to cause a commotion. Troll 4 life
8	Untraditional ESTJs here?	Are any of you here rebellious, innovative, creative, untraditional, and/or willing to dive in to the unknown, anarchaic (and/or meaning even if just one or two of those adjectives apply to you)....\n\n\nRoll Call. Lemme see which adjectives apply, what you think/have done to earn that description and why you're still sure you're an ESTJ despite having these non-stereotypical characteristics
2	The only one on the list I'd identify with is "willing to dive into the unknown." Not that I'm not uncomfortable with it, I am, but I've learned from my very adventurous ENFJ husband that the amazing adventures available somewhere out there are worth the discomfort associated with finding them.\n\nFor example, for our anniversary last week he surprised me with flying trapeze lessons. And I don't like heights. And it was terrifying. And I had no idea what I was doing. But it was also fantastic and I would do it again.\n\nDoes stubbornly and proudly identifying myself as a Super Nerd despite ridicule and peer pressure to conform count as being rebellious?
2	I'm definitely creative and fairly untraditional. I'd like to be rebellious and my mind is definitely that way but it's extremely rare that I actually act that way. 
1	Uhhhh if you want those kinds of people check out the entp or estp (either one) you'll find plenty of daredevil insanity maybe try entj add well
5	Make an ESTJ happy in one sentence	We did [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/53bm6c/make_an_infp_happy_in_one_sentence/) over at r/INFP, and I wanted to know what would make you happy in one sentence. It's also a bit interesting since you're the complete opposite of us :) 
18	"We think you did the right thing."
5	I can't speak for anyone else, but I'm pretty happy when people leave me alone.
5	"You're a good person."
4	* "you are right"\n* "good job"\n* "control me"
7	"I want you to convince me that I'm wrong."
6	"Excellent work."
3	"Congratulations inquisitor, without your dutiful dedication to The Order of the ESTJ and it's most sacred traditions the planet would not have been cleansed of the INFP heresy. 
1	I think for my boss it would be (who is ESTJ):\n\n\n*"it is finished and 100% approved"*\n\nfor me it would be (ENFP):\n\n*"Sharks with shotguns in outer space"*\n\nor, on a more serious note:\n\n*"You are so fascinating, you never run out of crazy ideas!"*
3	I'm making a MBTI statistics and I need your input.	I need more ESTJs to participate in MBTI relationship statistics, because as of now, there's only one ESTJ, whereas other types are crossing 100 limit right now. \n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19k9UrDFdQtci5-kRNeykkR3J4iw7c1A2y0zqirHQtoI) is the form.\n\nI really appreciate your help. And if you are really interested in statistics, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFpUbw92VH_BGrVf-FMngyCdtERYVvvGOEL_T58kw9Q/edit#gid=641219863) is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from "INFP" in cell A3, to "ESTJ" if you want to see your statistics. ESTJ Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs.
3	INFJ needing advice regarding ESTJ dh	I've been married to my ESTJ husband for 23 years. I love him but we have a tremendously difficult time communicating. I understand that emotions/feelings make him uncomfortable but as an INFJ I perceive the world through emotions/feelings. We're going through a particularly rough spot right now because we're both finding it difficult to connect with each other. \n\nWhen my oldest went away to college three years ago, he actually got angry at me for grieving. It didn't make any sense to him because we were going to be seeing her in a few months over fall break when she came back home. But for me, I was grieving the loss of her childhood, of not being needed like I used to be, the end of homeschooling her, the loss of the daily connection we had with each other, the role change of being mom to an adult, suddenly being "unemployed" after 18 years etc....\n\nNext year my youngest will be going to college and I know I'm going to grieve again. It's natural. I want to talk to my husband about supporting me this time and let him know what I'm going to need from him during that difficult period. He is NOT a communicator and definitely shuts down when I talk about my feelings. What is realistic to ask him to do to help me through this process? \n\nI try not to talk about my feelings around him because I know it makes him uncomfortable. But I feel like in this instance, I'm going to need all the support I can get.\n\n
3	ESTJ are effectiveness focused. Maybe tell him you need to process this change and that his support will help you process quicker and more effectively. Also maybe consider sharing the emotions with another friend who can be a better emotional support. Each type is good at different things and no type can be all we need all the time. You already know this but I just want to try to help. Sorry you're going through this. 
1	He is a man and an ESTJ he is wired to solve real problems rationally. Pandering to emotions and leaving the problem unsolved is not how HE would solve a problem for himself, it makes no sense to him.\n\nWhen you come to him complaining and he gives practical advice, you likely say that he's not listening to you (you want emotional comfort instead of a practical solution). \n\nYou need to make it clear to him that when you have an issue you need emotional comfort, not a solution and this is the way you like your problems solved. Give him this analogy to work over.\n\n"I am a woman, when I say I'm thirsty I don't want you to get me a glass of water. I want you to sympathise with how thirsty I am."\n\nHe will think you're insane but now that you have given him a rational (ish) method of solving your problems, he will quickly realize that providing you practical solutions instead of cuddling you is a waste of his efforts.
1	Hi. First of all, I am sorry you'll be going through such a big transition! We love moms like yourself. Moms who take in the responsibility of a mom as dearly as you do. Your children are very lucky!\n\nI'm an INFJ woman, and I'm probably at least 15+ years younger than you are... I've had an ESTJ boyfriend who was very efficiency-oriented and didn't connect/communicate very well emotionally. \n\nBut I think what ESTJs actually feel, when their loved ones are sad, is a sense of weakness. Like, they take it onto themselves when their significant other is sad/mad, and they don't like that they feel that way, so they'll tell you to stop. \n\nOf course I can't speak for your husband, but I wonder if he doesn't want to be freely with you because it feels like a responsibility/duty of his to get it over with. Just a thought. \n\nAnyhow, I do love ESTJ's in general despite their differences. I hope you feel better soon to give us (or me) some insight into INFJ-ESTJ pairings!
1	Hi there! Sorry to hear about your empty nest/communication woes. That's no fun. I'm an ESTJ gal with an ENFJ husband (and lots of other very emotionally driven family), so, slightly different dynamic but I thought I'd throw in my two cents anyway in case it's helpful.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that as I was reading about the things you were grieving, I started feeling SUPER uncomfortable, so while I don't condone your husbands lack of support, I do understand some of the impetus behind it! xD\n\nOne thing I think it's good to keep in mind is how mentally and emotionally taxing it can be for ESTJs to be supportive in the way you're hoping. You said in one of the comments you want him to "just listen," but let me tell you from personal experience, that is one of the most exhausting things you can ask for (I know that seems strange but bear with me here!). When I'm asked to "just listen," I feel counter-productive, tired, frustrated, confused, and like I'm watching a problem spin out of control instead of doing something about it.\n\nI know the last thing you want is a "solution" from your husband, but something that helps ME when someone wants me to "just listen" to them is to, in my head, make it my goal to get to the root of the problem. Not how you feel, but why. I'll ask lots of probing questions, and then privately come to my own conclusions. That way, the person needing me to listen gets to express themselves, but I feel like I'm learning and proactively reaching the cause, which I can then try to fix without the other person knowing. I pretend I'm a therapist and it's my job to get to the bottom of this thing. x'D\n\nI hope that doesn't sound manipulative! But honestly that's the only way I can tune in to someone else's problems without getting exhausted.
0	Enegram & Big 5 Are Not Popular Because There's Nothing Much To Read About Them In Comparison To MBTI?	Why are "Enegram" & "Big 5" test not as popular as MBTI?\n\nI think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the "Enegram" or "Big 5" test.\n\nWhat do you think?
2	That might be the case but since the enneagram is trying to tell us the root of our behavior (anger, fear, or shame), it can be pretty limited. Not many people can relate because the "why" is so much more elusive. MBTI just tells us the results of our behavior and not the cause, which is why I think it can be more relatable to people. You can find people of the same temperament but have completely different values. I think this is also why the enneagram is used in conjunction with MBTI.

4	How to give an ESTJ a decent childhood?	INTP here.\n\nSo, I have a young relative who I am fairly close too, who I am think is an ESTJ.\n\nThe person in question:\n\n* Is outgoing\n* Is responsive to firm, commanding handling\n* Is insensitive\n* Has a good memory\n* Is bossy/manipulative\n* Naturally has formed their own routine\n\nI would especially like to know:\n\n* How do you learn most effectively (by "learn" I mean skills, knowledge, etc.)\n* How, if possible, should one go about getting ESTJ children to be more sensitive?\n* What should I avoid, that would only make their life worse? \n\nBut feel free to add any other comments you think would be useful.\n\nCheers
4	I'd agree with the first paragraph of /u/East_India_Co's post but I would add that just support them and get them out of their comfort zone.\n\nAn unbalanced ESTJ is an awful person.
2	Get him engaged in structured activities especially ones that involve tradition and order. A military style summer camp would be nice as a one off - it will teach duty, order, discipline and comradeship. Martial art and physical based sports I.e. boxing, fencing, rugby, wrestling and jousting. \n\nGet him involved in your cultures traditions (fairs, dances) teach him your culture and cultural superiority.\n\nMost importantly get him and his friends to form testudo and phalanx formations and remove immigrant kids. 
1	Group organized sports. 
8	Did you feel like an outsider growing up?	
3	Yeah. I took life really seriously and it made me a bit judgemental. Luckily I had a really judgemental group of friends who'd I'd spend time ripping on other people with. I still think I take life seriously, but now with a purpose.
2	Yes. I always felt like I fit in better with the adults than my peers, so it was hard to make friends my age.\n\nEdit: Added thought-I am the oldest and lived on a farm, so adults was who I hung out with a great deal of the time anyways, so is it because of that or me being an ESTJ that made me prefer the company of adults?
1	A little 
1	I grew up an ESFJ so it doesn't really count.
3	Short MBTI Survey (2 Mins). ‚Ä¢ /r/INTP	
1	Post a song or a video you think describes us or is relatable to you as an ESTJ	I'll go [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIsv1YOFNys&index=22&list=PLqpaVGVP86ASi4XWmjH-tLF8NtnpoUJJp).\n\n
3	It can apply beyond us, but the song "head full of doubt/road full of promise" by the Avett brothers sums up how I feel about things as an ESTJ. \n\n"When nothing is owed,deserved or expected/your life doesn't change by the man that's elected/ if you're loved by someone than you're never rejected/decide what to be and go be it"\n\nThe first line sums up a lot of how I think about politics... Anti entitlement, meaning I'm willing to work for what's mine instead of hoping it comes to me or thinking i deserve it. \n\nThe second line.... The idea of emotional security, that if you're loved by someone it doesn't matter if you're unloved by another. As an ESTJ I think we naturally find ourselves in positions of leadership and management and you aren't always liked by everyone, so having the security of love from someone else helps counterbalance that; basically, I have friends and family, I do not care if you do not like me for doing the right thing.\n\nAnd finally, the line that really resonates with me: decide what to be and go be it. It speaks to how I think of goals as an ESTJ. There are no frills attached to success, it is simply something to be attained if you are of mind to get it. No magic potion or secret formula, just hard work and elbow grease. 
5	INFJ Here:)	Hi guys.  INFJ's are not known for knowing themselves very well.  What do you think of us?
13	My best friend is an INFJ. Based on my experience with them, y'all are great. (:\n\nYou just keep being you.
9	The ESTJs and INFJs are like polar opposites, maybe even more so than ESTP and INFJ. They wouldn't understand you, and they'd see everything you do as illogical or impractical because they are wired differently.
10	You tend to be irrational idealists that seek undermine established natural order and traditions for mainly emotive reasons. It indicates lack of self-control and logical thinking.\n\nYour idealistic sense of morality often leads to decisions that favour out-groups. Hence you make decisions that are not in the best interests of the community and the tribe. \n\nI consider your type as dysfunctional and dangerous humans and would keep a close eye on or purge entirely.\n\n
3	>INFJ's are not known for knowing themselves very well.\n\n\nThat's.. your opinion but usually we don't know what others think about us/how we come off. We tend to be one of the most self actualized type.
1	As an INFJ dating an ESTJ, I find this post pretty interesting. I do believe that at times my ESTJ finds me frivolous, child-like, too idealistic, and overbearingly emotional for his liking. But he manages to harness his harsh honesty when we disagree, unlike many ESTJs who seem rather unwilling to attempt a friendship or even a mutual acceptance with an INFJ. We both work hard to communicate openly and honestly so as to minimize misunderstandings. 
2	Big fun Reddit MBTI survey	**Edit: I have closed the survey.** Basic preliminary data is available here: [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWpyBCtgq81S03KJZYVzn5tVVhUgbTcJ6lqUhDFb78EQQEtA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm)\n\nHi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.\n\nI also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at [this link to google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/fHSemrg0ey1EYfK63)\n\nIt is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.\n\nIf you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.\n\n**Please don't spoil** the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.\n\n*I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know.*
4	Questions on communication with ESTJs	Please state if you are a male or female ESTJ. It would also be helpful if you could state your SO's type if you know it...\n--\n\n**1) How do you prefer to communicate with your SO?**\n\na. Texting\n\nb. Phone calls\n\nc. In-person\n\nd.

2	> 1) How do you prefer to communicate with your SO?\n\nE) Combination of above (texting and phone calls)\nI'd prefer texting but I do like the idea of hearing my SO voice once in awhile, if we live apart that is (just dont call everyday I won't pick up) \n\n> 2) What's the ideal amount of communication to you?\n\nA) Daily (but not every hour or minute) but daily is a good minimum.\n\n> 3) Who initiates the communication more?\n\nA) I do but Id liked for my SO to initiate it more often.\n\n> 4) Is the frequency of communication ever an issue in your relationships? \n\nA) yess other person never initiates conversation as much.\n\nI am a female ESTJ, people ive date before ENFP, ESFP etc.\nAlso I dont know if my answers will be valid (since I'm not in a relationship right now) but thought Id give it a shot.
1	Female.\n\n1) a combo of a and c, mostly c.\n2) a\n3) it's pretty equal. Depending on the day it could be me or him. \n4) no. \n\nMaybe for reference, my boyfriend is ISFJ

5	Opinions on INFPs?	Hey INFP female here asking about your opinions and experiences with INFPs? \n\n\nI have an ESTJ sister and we get along like a house on fire! \n\n\n\nAny comments would be appreciated, thanks much.
5	Male estj married to female infp here. Really just depends on how mature the people in question are
3	Well I'm not an ESTJ, but I am dating one as an INFP. We just passed the 1 year mark. He's a supervisor/manager at work, but not the business type of ESTJ (Te-subtype), more like the sporty/hands-on/craft & technology-oriented ESTJ (Si-subtype). \n\nWe're very happy together. There were definitely some bumpy times and things I seriously questioned, but we managed to resolve most of them without much conflict. \n\nI don't really know *why* he likes me, but he seems to think I'm "an amazing part of" his life. He recently said he loved me for the first time. I do know that when we are together, things are often mutually understood and peaceful. From the moment we met, he's felt familiar to me and safe. I know that we will never have deep-flowing intuitive type conversations, but I appreciate all his other qualities and capabilities. I find him deeply trustworthy at a gut level. When he speaks to me, I can't ever stay angry at him... I just seem to understand where he's coming from. It's hard to explain.     
3	I have an INFP sister and I love her very much. I just have to remember how sensitive she is, and to not trample on her feelings with reality. I'm often the one who cannot wait to get on to the next thing in life, such as driving, getting a job, ect. I want the same for my sister, and want to teach her the practical skills I have learned over time. This stresses her out, like I'm rushing her into the world when she's not ready. It can be hard for me to realize that she isn't so excited and ready to get out into the world like I am.
2	My dad is ESTJ, I'm INFP. I love and admire him and his personality. He loves me too but doesn't "get" me. If we weren't related he most certainly wouldn't hang out with me. We're just too different. I'd love to hear what some ESTJs have to say.
2	Most of my very best girlfriends are INFPs! I'm of the opinion that if you can't get along with an INFP, you have a problem, cuz they're super easy to get along with.\n\nThat having been said, there are circumstances surrounding those friendships that automatically make me highly esteem them (they're older and more experienced than I am, so I look up to them, etc), and if it were a SIBLING things might be different because I'm more demanding of my family than I am with my friends, and I'd probably trample an INFP sibling with my "cold hard facts" mentality.\n\nSisters tend to fight a lot anyway, right? I have a sister that I couldn't get along with at all (don't know her type), but as we grew older and wiser things got better and once I turned 20 (and she was 31) we finally started getting along. :D Give it some time (and spend time getting to know more about each other's types!) and I'm sure things will improve! :)

2	One of my best friends is an ESTJ (I am INFP), and I see that as I am becoming more comfortable with being who I am, the more she seems to suffocate me. Through the eight years that we have known each other, I have very much molded to who she is so that there wouldn't be any conflict. Now that I am becoming more outspoken about my views, being okay with being something different than her singular mindset, we butt heads a lot. It seems that our differences are pushing us apart because she cannot tolerate those who are different from her. I still love and appreciate her friendship, but it becomes more suffocating by the day. \n\nI don't know if you two live together or not, but the key could just be some time apart from each other so that you are able to disconnect, see each other differently, and then reconnect.

5	Clinical narcissist or ESTJ or something else?	My partner is exhausting - mentally and spiritually. He doesn't say I love you, he's critical, insulting and judgmental. He fights over food ('I bought that!') and he used my family history against me in an argument - so so hurtful. On the other side, he's highly intelligent, funny, a great cook and is very popular. He tested as ESTJ who are known to be rigid, but I'm tired of reading into MBTI to understand him. What am I living with exactly? A plain ESTJ or just an asshole? Any helpful thoughts welcome. 
8	As a critical, judgemental, and cold ESTJ, I say he is just an asshole.
7	"he's critical, insulting and judgmental. He fights over food ('I bought that!') and he used my family history against me in an argument - so so hurtful. " \n\nRed flags of someone who may have a borderline personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder.  I wouldn't jump to the conclusion just yet but I would watch myself before I got into too deep with this fellow.
5	Sounds like an unhealthy ESTJ.
3	My ESTJ doesn't say I love you either, but he'll say other affectionate stuff, and his love languages are primarily Acts of Service, Physical Touch, and Quality Time. He's not petty, critical or insulting or judgmental toward me, but he can be critical and judgmental toward people at his work, or other drivers during traffic. Mine is not very funny, and he's not cooked for me once yet in the year we've been dating. But he's fundamentally kind and patient with me. Is your partner aware how much he's hurting and exhausting you? Sounds like he needs you to explain how the things he says and does make you feel.
2	He sounds like he could be an unhealthy ESFJ, in my opinion. I don't think these issues stem from MBTI, though, unfortunately. 
2	Fellow ESTJs. Have any of you switched types in the past?	For instance a few years ago I was ESFJ but several things changed me into an ESTJ.
2	I tested as ISTJ when I was younger.
2	I switch between ENTJ and ESTJ. It is usually 60/40 in one direction or the other. 
1	Don't rely on the tests alone. They are somewhat inaccurate.
1	I would go ENTJ or ISTJ for a while.
4	Adult Male ESTJs. How do you deal with depression or disappointment?	My father is an ESTJ and he can be quite choleric. I'm assuming it's because life has been tough, he may even have mild depression (he doesn't care about his health at all). \n\nAt his worst I can best described him as a narcissistic parent. At his best he is the ultimate provider and hard worker who will lend a hand to anyone in need. \n\nNaturally as his adult child, and ENFP, I care about his health (both physically and mentally). But I doubt modern  (tell me your issues and feelings) psychology will do anything for him. For me it works wonders. My dad is an Alpha-Male who has to keep a tough exterior at all times (even though he's gooeyer than me deep down inside). He doesn't believe in therapists. He considers himself a REALIST, even though I see it as pessimistic. \n\n\nWhat are healthy ways to get my father to cope with his issues? Something that won't emasculate him (he's old school).
5	As an ESTJ and a mental health clinician, the thing that pulls me out of a slump the best is doing something that is physically challenging. Training on a punching bag after a challenging day at work does wonders for me.  I also love getting together with a small group of close friends so we can all talk and cut loose for a bit.  One one of my biggest challenges is that I take most things way too seriously and need to just have some fun once in a while.
2	I always try to do something to improve myself, or at least my image of myself. For instance I'll run, or work harder on the job, study or read, or plain just listen to a song that gets me pumped. It helps when an ESTJ feels useful. It's funny you're an ENFP because my father's an ENFP as well.
2	Agree with the physical challenges. Or just trying to be social with my close friends or family, though sometimes it's still not enough to pull me out of my own mind. But like mentioned, doing things to improve my work or further my goals or something... That does help. And music, definitely.
1	I deal with the depression by finding the root cause and figure out how to either:\nA) Eliminate it\nB) Avoid it\n\nBut this analysis and decision can take months/years. He isn't going to seek professional help because he has likely analyzed it himself and found the cause. He just doesn't know what to do about it.
9	Hey ESTJs! I have a short (1 minute) questionnaire on the correlation between personality and music preference and It'd help me a lot to get some more ESTJ responses! Thanks!	
2	Done. :)
2	Couldn't find three choices that I liked. No progressive, no classic rock, no alternative.

9	ESTJ's hardest type to deal with.	Hello fellow ESTJ's, I'd like to know your opinion on which is the hardest mbti type to deal with for us, either friendships or relationships,  based on your personal experience. Personally, it's INFJ.
8	For me (INTJ), it's you guys.
4	I don't know if you've checked out socionics before, but they say INFJ-ESTJ, INFP-ESTP pairings are ideal in terms of balance. In my personal experience, I had the best connection with my ESTJ ex-boyfriend, and I am an INFJ. \n\nBut i always come to the conclusion that while MBTI is great for seeing how we're wired in our heads, it doesn't take into consideration all the experiences/nurture portion of our personalities. I've also met ESTJ men that I didn't get along with. I think a big part of it is also how many Ns and Ss you grew up with in your family. 
5	[deleted]
2	I know an INFJ who has an ESTJ parent and they have a very difficult time dealing with each other/connecting with one another, so that's another point to validate your experience.\n\nI actually believe there is some sort of pattern where if someone is the opposite type of you with the exception of your judging/perception preference, it usually guarantees a lot of misunderstanding and difficulty to automatically get along. e.g. ISFP-ENTP, INFJ-ESTJ, ESFP-INTP, ENTJ-ISFJ.\n\nFor example, I'm an INFP and I have an extremely hard time connecting with ESTPs in general. (note that the first three letters are inverted but the P is the same). I also know of a couple that is an INTJ-ESFJ and they have had many misunderstandings with one another throughout the years. I know I only have three examples of this, but I'd be interested to see if this applies to other pairings with the same pattern.\n\nI don't ever believe it's impossible for two types to get along/for things to work out even if they're couples, but I think there are certain combinations where it requires a lot of conscious/deliberate effort to gel with one another. There are opposites that attract, and there are opposites that repel.
1	Are you guys sure it isn't entp, they are like a really loud opposite.
5	MBTI Types as Teachers PDF Statistics (ESTJs dominate) (also your subreddit is dead)	
1	Not a single INTP / 300?\n\n
4	Friendships with INFJ's	Hey guys! It's my first time on this subreddit. I'm an INFJ and I have an ESTJ friend. We get along very well. He's awesome, so I'm sure you guys are too! I'm curious to know how your interactions have been with INFJ's, how you perceive us, or any experiences you've had, whether positive or negative? Thanks in advance!
3	I love ESTJs. I think they get a bad reputation for being really blunt and all, but I like the straight forwardness and their sense of duty in all things they do. I am an INFJ.
2	I have a few friends that have either tested as INFJ or at least have the characteristics.  They're some of my best friends.  I'm borderline E/I.  I love talking with them because of how differently they prices information.  Most of my best friends are probably somewhere around that type (everyone drifts a little).  I would imagine they love hearing you talk.  Especially about things like how certain situations might make you uncomfortable and why.  Always interesting.  And it's definitely pleasurable to put that P into action and just confuse your J friends.
2	One thing that bothers me just a bit is that they can be a little stubborn and don't like being pointed out for small mistakes.
1	I had a really close friend who was an INFJ. He was really fun to talk to, and had a lot of very interesting viewpoints on things. However, his viewpoints on issues we both felt mattered, were drastically different, and being the strongly opinionated J's we are, we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of topics.\n\nA little self absorbed, but overall a great, empathetic friend.
5	Do you guys debate as a form of flirting?	So there's this ESTJ who I really like (I'm an ISFJ) and I noticed that he rather enjoys really arbitrary arguments about really silly things. So he and I have a lot of completely meaningless little theoretical debates/arguments about terminology or something completely pointless and I'm not sure if he likes to do this just to sharpen his brain or if he actually somewhat flirting? I ask this because oftentimes throughout the argument either he or I (or both) just sort of slowly start to smile as we realize the absurdity of the debate as it devolves into complete meaninglessness... so yeah, I was just curious. Thanks!
10	Maybe not as a form of flirting, but yes I will sometimes debate about things like the efficiency of pizza scissors vs. a regular pizza wheel cutter.\n\n*pizza wheel cutter master race*
6	Yeah maybe.  I've never really thought about that.  I could see that though, it's definitely engaging you so that very well could be.  I wouldn't do it with someone I didn't like, so at the very least the person likes you.
3	Confirmed ESTJ? ENTP's are called the debaters. We'd debate Hitler as an SJW if we were subjected to it. I will say though that I, as an ENTP, never debate as a form of flirting. We tend to take debates way too seriously and flirting (at least for me) I never take seriously. On top of all that, though, If you debate me and I don't completely obliterate your half (ie you proverbially "hold your own") I might catch feelings. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI know this sort of came off "look at me" - I didn't intend that but I hope it helps nonetheless.
2	[deleted]
2	I'm an ESTJ and yeah, I probably debate as a way to become closer to people. Not necessarily flirting...but he definitely enjoys your company.
1	My ESTJ sister challenges and competes against her crush in class.
1	I'm considering if he's actually an ESTJ. \n\nWhat do you mean by theoretical debates? 
3	A 10-minute personality questionnaire after which you may be invited to a scientific experiment!	
6	How would you describe your impression on others?	I'm an INFP and I'm pretty puzzled by you guys. Which might seem weird since we share all our functions. But when I try to look into how you guys work in terms of cognitive functions it's hard to imagine what you guys act like, if that makes sense at all.\n\nI have one acquaintance who's an ESTJ. I'd describe her as very independent (she seems to spend a lot of time to herself/with one other person, I totally thought she was an outgoing introvert before I introduced her to MBTI), witty, *quietly* charismatic, and confident. She's seen as very effortlessly cool and a bit of a hipster. People are very very *very* drawn to her, more so than anyone else I've met tbh. Her sense of humor is very understated, silly and weird/raunchy. I wouldn't have pegged her as an high Si user at all, tbh.\n\nTL;DR - what are some common traits and behaviors of ESTJs? How would you define yourself? What's your general impression on people? How would you recognize a fellow ESTJ? 
5	I always thought of myself as a introvert, but generally in a social setting with introverts I was more extroverted. People would be more drawn to me, I wouldnt necessarily want to talk to people all the time because it can get exhausting, but  I did find that I attracted people more in that sense. (That they wanted to talk to me and etc)\nVery independent is a great trait to describe myself, generally I'm always only with one of my best friends or close friends. Confidence ? Well I am but only when it comes to talking and my writing, generally I like to simplify whatever im saying to make it easier for everybody to understand where I'm getting at.\nSo being coherent is very important. \nMy humours more along the lines of being dry/sarcastic. \nI like people, but when someone goes out of their way to be blatantly ignorant or rude, I dont see the sense of hanging out with someone like that all the time.\nBut because I'm a eneagram 1 this could be the reason I'm more reserved quiet, then most Extroverts I don't know. So again this could differ between all ESTJs.
2	I don't know if it's just me, but *outgoing introvert* and witty is close enough to my reality as well! Maybe not drawing as many people, but confident.
1	my father is an estj, and i always thought of him as introverted. but i guess he's just more selective in who he hangs out with and his interests.  He actually enjoys being around a lot of people.  I'm unsure if to classify this as ambivert or what.
7	How do you adapt to change?	I absolutely admit that I'm terrible about adapting to any type of change--even good change or smaller scale change--and it's potentially my worst character flaw because it's the reason behind multiple maladaptive behavioral patterns. I'm resistant and it takes me forever to get with the changes. \n\n\nIf you also have this problem and have managed to negate it, what practical things do you suggest doing to speed up the process of accepting a change and moving onto more useful positive behaviors? 
6	random survey! need more responses especially Es and/or Js	
2	'twas fun
1	Done but you have several typos.
6	(ESTJ) Do you believe and act based on the belief of objective reality and morality?	
2	I'm split on objective reality, we can't really know, we might never know. I'll default to a belief that there is no objective reality until I find some rational for it to exist beyond subjective perception.\n\nMoral Objectivism I do not follow, but I think it has a certain allure.
2	Was going to pick a serious answer and then saw the last option.\n\nTIL I am a normal redditor.
2	Yes and yes. \n\nEven if reality was an illusion, it's still better to act as if it's a real and measurable thing.\n\nGiven the assumption of an objective reality an objective morality can be deduced from that.
4	ESTJs with crushes	ESTJs: comment how you flirt/how you act when you like someone
6	I'm an ENFP. \n\n1) Usually when ESTJs (and ENTJs) are into me, they try to hire me at their workplace so that they have an excuse to spend more time with me. \n\n2) Maybe it's because I've known a lot of ennea 3s, but they talk about achievements and current work stuff. That's their version of a come on. But, I am a 3. So it is definitely a "come hither" sign for me :D lol.\n\n3) The ESTJ I knew would spontaneously become goofy and joke a lot. Some of the jokes weren't necessarily funny, but I laughed anyway, because I thought it was cute. \n\n4) Try to talk to you a lot, compliment you or flirtatiously insult you.
3	I'm an ESTJ.\n\nI usually try to figure the person out as best as I can. I ask them a lot of personal questions and I'll ask them to hang out as frequently as possible. Eventually, I just tell them I like them. I'm not really one for playing games.
3	I'll normally compliment a girl I like on her hard work or the things she's done or made. I want her to know that those accomplishments are attractive and valuable to me.\n\nAlso I'll ask her a lot of questions about herself and give her more than the unusual attention during conversation
2	As direct as they can get. ESTJs just tell me they like me.
2	Unconventional Wisdom	My fellow ~NT~ friend and I are throwing around an idea for a podcast. People write in and we dispense rational, scientific based advice, divorced of feeling or sympathy, a la Data / Spock from Star Trek.\n\nIt would require research on our part for some questions. For example, if someone writes in about a contentious relationship, we'd have to look up the different styles of amygdala  hijack (fight or flight response to stress) and how to deescalate the situation. \n\nThere would be NO "tell the person how you feel" or "just be yourself" or "love yourself at your size", feeler advice. \n\nJust cold hard, science based, advice and an action plan attached to it.

5	MBTI podcast: Interview with an ESTJ woman that's a fitness celeb, feminist and college professor	Hello! My BFF and I cohost a podcast about Myers Briggs that we produce on our own in our house. I‚Äôm ENTP and she‚Äôs ESFP. Lately we‚Äôve been interviewing people as a way to catalog types so others can get to know and identify that type.\n\nIlyssa Russ, known online as @ohilyssa, is a popular fitness personality (shoutout to powerlifting and bodybuilding) as well as a college English professor who focuses on feminism, racism and classism, and - get this - she's a total ESTJ. ENTP Kaila and ESFP Meredith talk with Ilyssa about problematic issues in the fitness world, reconciling her strong sense of duty and tradition with her progressive worldview, and the dynamics with her ENFP boyfriend.\n\nThis specific episode: https://soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs/ohilyssa\n\n* [In general: Soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs](https://soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs)\n\n* [Facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs](https://www.facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs)\n\n* [Subscribe on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/when-myers-met-briggs/id1060274982)\n\n* [Twitter.com/WMMBpodcast](https://twitter.com/wmmbpodcast)\n\n* [Instagram.com/WMMBpodcast](https://www.instagram.com/wmmbpodcast/)\n\n**Let me know what you think!**\n(X-post r/MBTI: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4jy0xz/mbti_podcast_interview_with_an_estj_woman_thats_a/ and r/powerlifting https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/4jy2wl/podcast_interview_with_ilyssa_russ_ohilyssa_a/)\n
4	Herasy of the highest order. \n\nOne cannot be ESTJ and champion for the critical theory construct that is progressive identity politics, it's an oxymoron.\n\nUsurpers and degenerates are building a fifth column.
6	Post a picture of your Room/Work Desk	Let's see what you guys are working with!
7	Do you guys play any video games?	
5	I'm a huge gamer nerd, and especially fond of Nintendo. Favorites include the Legend of Zelda series, Metroid, Shadow of the Colossus, etc. Also love the multiplayer classics like Mario Kart and Smash. Recently obsessed with Splatoon.
3	Certainly do, played plenty of LoL, Dark Souls, Pokemon etc. I stopped playing them though about a year ago, but I still watch LoL tournaments. 
2	Just some Kinect games with my kids when it's too hot to take them outside.
1	I wish I was more into video games but it wasn't really a thing for me when I was a kid and I never got into it. Although, I do love card/board games . . . does that count? 
1	League of legends and Chivalry
3	Mbti chat on telegram	telegram is a free messenger app that‚Äôs available on mobile, in a browser, and as a desktop app. it‚Äôs way nicer than kik or skype chat or imessage\nwe‚Äôve got a very active and diverse chat on telegram for people who are into MBTI. we‚Äôd love some new members, so if you‚Äôre interested in joining, here‚Äôs a link to the chat. https://telegram.me/joinchat/CGj5kgcsTArYUlsh9IG59Q again, you can access it from any device if you have/make a telegram account. we look forward to meeting you!\n(i know telegram is a little scary because it asks for your phone number, but it doesn‚Äôt get shared with other users unless you choose to share it.)
6	Are you interested in space travel?	I have been reading little tidbits about what life would be like up on the ISS and the plans and struggles are in going to Mars. What are your thoughts on this? Is it worth it?\n\nJust seeing that we can put people in a livable environment nearly 500 kms above our heads amongst the dark vacuum of space is really insane. It will be very interesting to see how conquering the environment of mars will turn out.\n\nApparently there are many people who would opt into a one way trip to Mars if they could, but I wouldn't ever want to do that. I can only begin to imagine how much I would miss simply being able to freely go outside.
2	Once we get Warp Drive, Artificial Gravity, Holodecks, Replicators, and Transporters, sign me up!\n\nOtherwise no thank you. I'll leave it up to the adventurous people who don't mind living in perpetual discomfort and fearing for their lives all the time.
2	It's a glorious endeavour that taps into the human need for discovery and generates much needed hero's for Western civilisation. \n\nEver since the ease of travel and the discovery of all land masses over the world, society has become sedate, fulfilling the void left with degeneracy.
8	What are your plans for the summer?	Liven up the forum a bit. Te-Ne jazz hands. 
7	[deleted]
6	Well, hopefully I'll give my exams and all will go well and then I will probably work. Perhaps I'll find a few days to rest. 
3	I'm getting a Corgi puppy in June. And she shall be named Potato.
2	[deleted]
4	So who will the ESTJ's be voting for in this upcoming election?	
6	I hate everyone so far and I'm not sure who I will vote for. At this point it's choosing the least incompetent one. 
4	I would vote Trump (USA), UKIP (UK), Front National (France), AFD (Germany) or PVV (Netherlands). 
3	The Democrat nominee.
8	Australian here, but yeah. I would vote Bernie, he has the right ideas and he has been spot on about everything. He is the kind of person that you could trust in that position. Clinton>Trump though in terms of ideals, at least her policies are okay. I just abhor the way she tries to get votes, the female card she pulls out, the persuasive tricks, the questionable actions. \n\nTrump is just a fool; he rejects climate change, thinks that vaccines might cause autism, is 'pro-life' and his ideas about China are probably true, but the way he plans to go about changing things just foolish. I don't think many of his supporters know what they are voting for, they want to make America Great Again, but what would trump really do to make the country great? Bring manufacturing jobs to America, even though they probably wont compete with the global market? Sounds more like he will aim to cripple other countries like Donald Rumsfeld and the like did by spreading the Asian Contagion through the east so that they could sweep in and buy off Asian companies real cheap. Doesn't matter which of the two psychopaths get in anyway, Clinton will probably do the same thing.
7	Trump. I don't think personality type has much to do with it.
3	Trump, because he's a man, I don't need any other reason. #mancard 
1	trump coz swag :D
2	Bernie
1	Bernie if he magically wins the democratic nominee but I doubt it will happen with how everything has been going. So, Clinton most likely. Not Trump. Nope. 
1	What is your attitude towards religion?	Same question as asked towards r/ISTJ. The ISTJs seem to tend towards being agnostic, just wondering how ESTJs might see this.\n\nI am quite adamantly atheistic, I think it is far more likely that religion is an associated feeling or a state of mind, moreso than a reality. I think there is enough evidence against the existence of gods to dismiss it entirely. Asking people to have faith appears to me more like asking people to forget reason and rationality, it is crooked in my eyes.
6	I think that, true or not, the benefits of religion to humanity are greater than the drawbacks and it is worth keeping around. The objectionable parts are also worth reforming.\n\nEdit: Rereading the question, it seems you want to know our own practice, not just our opinions about religion in general. I believe in God and am a member of the LDS church.
5	Hate it, but I can respect peoples' right to believe what they want so long as that they respect my right to call them an idiot for it (I wouldn't, though.)
2	I'm agnostic
2	Catholic. What kind of person wants to just live with no after life? Costs me zero to believe and if it's true the pay off with be well worth.
2	ESTJ - LDS (Mormon)
1	Christian. For me it's important because it teaches people how to behave to grow spiritually and improve their lives, it also ties the community together and at the very least helps promote the family unit. If you want to look at it in a rational way, atheists and agnostics make the fewest kids in all groups, usually support state tyranny (lefties), offer no values to help the community or combat things like the "terrorists" and their "peaceful ideology".
5	Understanding early relationship with ESTJ	Dear ESTJ,\n\n[I made this post on /r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4fmnr4/understanding_early_relationship_with_estj/), Someone advised me to ask directly here, so here I am.\n\nThank you for your insight.
5	with ESTJs, what you see is usually what you get. I think she could've been cold because she was tired or deep in concerns (ESTJs worry a lot and therefore get a lot done to avoid having to worry again). As others advised, I think the best to approach an ESTJ is with direct questions without sounding like you're disrespecting them or accusing them of something. They're very honest!
3	I'm an ESTJ female, and from my personal experience I'd say her behavior sounds pretty normal. I enjoy being cuddly and demonstrative, but when I don't feel like it, it just shuts off. It doesn't mean anything is wrong.\n\nShe used the term "poker face" to describe the demonstrative "shutting off" but I think that's a little misleading: a poker face insinuates there's something hiding behind the expressionless exterior, but I doubt that's the case. She's probably just thinking about other stuff.\n\nThat's one nice thing about ESTJs, if they're upset with you or have a bone to pick they'll confront you with it. We're not into (or good at) mind-games and nuance. Unless she tells you otherwise, I think you can assume things are ok.
2	Probably a lot of other things on her mind, and you're over analyzing the situation.  She most likely doesn't realize what's going on in your head. 
5	estj vs infp	I have had a relationship with an ESTJ for 4 years now. we have very little trouble together. I was wondering if there are any others that have had this relationship work.\nWhen I look at it on paper it doesn't seem like it should.
3	 I remember reading somewhere that if the people involved have well developed personalities it doesn't really matter and they can get along. It might also be that both of you share the same values, but you express them differently, one using logic and the other using feelings. 
2	We are dual types, its generally favorable. A lot of the people I get along with best are Fi types, we usually have the same kind of values.
2	First of all, welcome to this subreddit and thanks for reaching out :) \n\nI can say from my personal experience that some of the people in my life that I cherish the most (romantically or otherwise) have been INFPs.  Granted, as with most relationships, there's a series of ups and downs associated with companionship.  I found that our strengths acted in a complementary manner.  Together we were able to have a more comprehensive view of the world and we picked up on things that the other was missing in their life.  It just seemed very easy for us to support one another and something that seemed so rudimentary to me was considered a herculean feat for the other (and vice versa of course).   \n\nAdditionally, you can find some additional information on the [oddly developed types site](http://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/ESTJ#Love) that references some studies that found ESTJs and INFPs had a tendency to end up in relationships in comparison to other types.  If you want to look into this with a larger sample size that's where I'd recommend starting.\n\nEdit: grammar 
2	Hi.  I know I'm late to the party.  I may be able to provide a little perspective.  I'm 39, I am INFP and I highly suspect my Dad is a ESTJ, though he refuses to take a trivial test.  I need to say I love my Dad to death, and there is a lot that I admire in him.  I cannot deny that I have his genes, just that my mother's genes are extraoridinarily more prominent in me.  I love his work ethic, his matter of fact point of view, and when we can break down the natural walls and really discuss something that fascinates us both, it can be an amazing conversation.  OK now for the warning flags, heh.  Basically my entire life he has let me know that I have a "blue personality".  He views this as a mental handicap, and he refuses, to this day, to accept that healthy human beings can think and feel like this.  In a episode a couple months ago, he shared with me about 5 mental illnesses that he self-diagnosed for me, and that he feels that without him guiding me, I'd be dead in 10 years.  He is very condescending and much of what he says to me I feel is gaslighting, because he assumes so much and presents it to me as absolute fact.  Also sometimes, he does gaslight me.  One example is we used to both have the same psychiatrist.  One day, out of the blue, he told me that she said she shouldn't have told him this, but he had asked her if I was scizophrenic.  (I take a anti-psychotic to dull my emotions, and slow down my brain.) He told me she said yes.  This really bothered me that she wouldn't have shared information like this with me, so after a couple months I straight asked her.  She denied every having spoken to my Dad, and assured me that I absolutely was not scizophrenic.  Which is absolutely clear anyways.  I guess my Dad has always found it strategic to make me doubt my view of reality and break my confidence.  When I was a teenager, I would say at least once or twice a week, he would...at any moment....snap into a mode of evil and abuse the hell out of me.  He would come in my room at 9:30 pm and for whatever slight he had that night, he would spend 2-3 hours screaming at me, cutting me down, bringing up all my past failures, telling me I had an ego 10 football fields long.  Looking back, I can honestly say that my father made me absolutely clinically insane.  Before I took the PSAT I kept hyping myself up all night long...no sleep.  I played Dragon Warrior 3 and Mega Man 3 on NES all night cause I love the music and I had those songs roaring through my head.  I took the PSAT, and it was the most fun I think I have ever had.  I finished early...I was in absolute command.  Of the results of that one test....I was labeled a National Merit Scholar and I had about 100 colleges in my state offer me a full ride.  Now keep in mind when I finally got freedom from my dad for the first time, the world literally blew my mind.  I was in no shape or fashion ever prepared for the real world, and while I grew a lot at this time...I did drop out of college almost immediately, and I can't say that was a success, but I'm pretty happy with me.  And my dad finally did find the right medication and the abuse stopped...until a couple months ago, and as he feels absolutely no remorse and in fact knows that I deserve it..I am having to distance myself from him again.  I know he won't be around forever and I will not hurt myself by cutting him out of my life.  Well that's probably a pretty twisted account of INFP vs ESTJ.  But I wish you absolute good luck, and thanks for asking.\nOh, one other thing.  He has always been absolutely no help and in fact insulting when I reached out for advice on women and stuff.  He basically always immediately cuts me down and lets me know that no woman would ever be interested in a twisted person such as myself, and looks for ways to let me know that it is inappropriate that I would ever have a interest in a woman.  That's one thing I really wish he could have helped me with, but honestly?  He probably doesn't know.  He doesn't have like any real friends other than my brother, who is very similar to him.  He married my mom soon out of high school and never has really had to deal with other people.  It is very insulting to me that he thinks my friends are horrible people and he goes out of his way to insult them, even when they are there.  That is one thing I can never accept, and I will never bring my friends to him to screen them.  He actually has asked me to do so.  He is a hard man to love...but you know a mbti description isn't everything about a person, and there is a lot of things to love about him.
1	I've never had a romantic relationship with an INFP, but some of my very best girlfriends in the whole wide world are INFPs! :)\n\nAs an aside, my husband is an ENFJ and supposedly we're completely incompatible. But if you and your partner are well-rounded people and willing to learn, having a partner that views the world in such a different light helps broaden your horizons and make you a more balanced person. :)
0	To change the face of human psychology completely‚Ä¶	\nPsychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority. Do the right thing.\n\n\nMARIAH CAREY "Emotions"\nYou've got me feeling emotions / \nDeeper than I've ever dreamed of / \nYou've got me feeling emotions / \nHigher than the heavens above / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJEFrth27Q\n\n\nTHE BEACH BOYS "Good Vibrations"\nI'm pickin' up good vibrations / \nShe's giving me excitations / \nGotta keep those lovin' good vibrations / \nA happenin' with her / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eab_beh07HU\n\n\nPEARL JAM "Even Flow"\nEven flow / \nThoughts arrive like butterflies / \nOh he don't know / \nSo he chases them away / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdIX36A8lMQ\n\n\n311 "Electricity"\nThe same force that flows through every circuit / \nThe juice that's spent everytime you work it / \nEvery life form is based on this simplicity / \nThe soul that you have is electricity / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1WyhqhGXHE\n\n\n311 "Large In The Margin"\nLarge in the margin / \nmy drama unfolds behind closed doors / \nTrying too hard to reach a higher plane / \nThere's no way to avoid listening / \nyou'll always end up listening / \nhere's hoping the voices aren't too unkind / \nhere's hoping the voices are benign / \nit's easier when you hear it / \nthere's no reason to fear it / \nit's you  / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VXQcVkvoe8\n\n\n311 "The Continuous Life"\nMy radio emits a signal form / \nA loud noise the kind of which I've never heard before / \nI scan the dial for more stations but all I get / \nIs an eerie feelin' I'm not dreaming' this is the real dealin / \nThere's nothin like this trance I'm caught in a daze / \n'cause I'm finally out of my body the blue lights are ablaze / \nYeah I'm really amazed and feelin' so light that's right / \nLift off and I'm into the sky / \nAs if a hologram were created to shift my consciousness / \nChanged again and I'm flung in the rift / \nI want to be free I want to do right / \nI move through the portal to be purified / \nIt's not ambiguous it be continuous / \nIt's all about us it's for real my man / \nThe continuous life there is no end / \nMovin' through life movin' through death / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irsNx9_rxbk\n\n\nTOOL "Schism"\nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away / \nDisintegrating as it goes testing our communication / \nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down / \nNo fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to / \nPoint the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over / \nTo bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication / \nI've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing  / \nDoomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication / \nI know the pieces fit / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhjG47gtMCo\n\n\nTOOL "Lateralus"\nOver thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind / \nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must / \nFeed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines / \nI'm reaching up and reaching out / \nI'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me / \nAnd following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been / \nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been / \nSpiral out, keep going... / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awYc9xvqnv0\n\n\nCROSSES (Chino Moreno from the Deftones) "Telepathy"\nBefore your entrance wave / \nBefore we play this game / \nI like to feel you break from inside / \nYou‚Äôre gold and pink inside / \nAnd it‚Äôs showing through your stare / \nIt‚Äôs frozen us in time from inside / \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQve6XA4zcI\n\n\nStanley Kubrick's THE SHINING\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZup24gsS8M\n\n\nSTAR WARS Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back - Luke talks to Obi-Wan\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsY71TFWSSs\n\n\nTHE ORB  "O.O.B.E."\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kY9NkGbBRs\n\n------------------------------\n\n‚ÄúChildhood's End‚Äù  Arthur C.

4	I skimmed this post and saw a 311 song, so I will be moving on now.
0	Nothing invites attacks from others like a good ole‚Äô post about telepathy or ESP‚Ä¶	\nMany of the responses that are received regarding the open discussion of telepathy are not about getting to the truth of what is real or not real regarding ESP, it‚Äôs about who the smartest individual is, and who can control how people think the most. The biggest egos that like CONTROL over others are usually the first to attack and discredit. This is true all across the board with other writers that also embrace psychic phenomena, not just with what I have written in the past. Many individuals that write about ESP and psychic functioning are immediately discredited and attacked by arrogant, closed minded, control freaks. They don‚Äôt like being figured out, they don‚Äôt like losing control, and they don‚Äôt like being seen for who they are deep down. Anyone with a negative attitude towards other human beings ‚Äì those that like authority and control over other people ‚Äì do not like it when highly aware individuals focus on the emotions that they put out to other people. The truth is this: all of us can sense positive-feeling vibrations, which are emotions and thoughts from other individuals, and all of us can sense bad-feeling vibrations. There is no denying this fact. This information exists everywhere in pop culture. It cannot be hidden and swept under a rug any longer.\n\n Big egos like authority and control, and they don‚Äôt much care for individuals that are pushing forward ESP and telepathy, even though it is the truth. We all observe it, and we all experience it. Awareness of ESP empowers the individual that embraces it, and disempowers individuals that seek authority and control over other human beings. Basically it‚Äôs like this: when someone starts talking openly about ESP and psychic awareness, big egos and control freaks get really pissed off. And this post will piss a lot of them off, but that‚Äôs OK ‚Äì they need to be more observant with their thoughts, lighten up a bit, and relinquish control over other human beings and how they think. \n\n‚ÄúPseudoscience‚Äù is a favorite word of the big ego. It‚Äôs a vague term that is used quite often to discredit the intelligence and intellect of those that want to study ESP openly. Remote viewing, which is psychic functioning based on telepathy and the ascertainment of data outside of the 5 senses, was developed with the scientific method and double-blind experiments. ‚ÄúRemote viewing‚Äù is a science based term that was developed from scientific experiments. This is a fact that cannot be denied. The federal government funded the development and use of remote viewing for intelligence operations, and I have no doubt that it is still being used today. Anyone familiar with quantum mechanics knows about the observer effect, wave/particle duality, and quantum entanglement. Our minds have a DIRECT IMPACT on that of which we observe, and removal of conscious observation of a target or object at a distance collapses the particle into the wave. Our minds perceive in a ‚Äúnon-localized‚Äù fashion, and this means that space/time becomes irrelevant when we focus our minds on an object. This is not ‚Äúpseudoscience‚Äù. These are scientific facts. \n\nI want to take this a step further and say that when other individuals think about us, all of us can sense this focus of thought. This is an observation of mine, but it has also been proven scientifically as well. Dr. Dean Radin has studied this phenomenon specifically in a scientific lab setting. It‚Äôs real. We don‚Äôt really need scientific studies to tell us this is so, however. We have emotional connectivity and personal observation, which lead us to direct experience ‚Äì something much more powerful. \n\nWhen I write these posts based on telepathy and ESP and post them online, I can immediately sense, via my feelings, when other individuals are reading them. I can FEEL the anger and arrogance and disagreement and the need to discredit what I am writing about. It‚Äôs all about control, and many individuals feel intellectually inferior to those that embrace ESP openly and without any doubt. And this is WHY these lower feeling thoughts/emotions are being expressed. Our feelings tell us what kinds of emotions are being directed towards us by other individuals, and because our emotions and thoughts are intrinsically linked, we can tell if other individuals are thinking either positively or negatively about us when they are thinking about us. None of us need the scientific method to know this. We all experience it. When another person is actively thinking about us, we become ‚Äúemotionally entangled‚Äù with that individual, and we can feel what the attitude this individual is expressing towards us. There is no denying this fact of reality. Individuals that are controlling and have poor (authoritative) attitudes towards other individuals do not like it when feelings and emotions are openly discussed. This means they are being figured out for who they are deep down and how they think. Most of the time, their thoughts are not very kind or humble. No one likes it when they are being exposed for who they are deep down, especially when they are mean-spirited, arrogant, and unrefined. All of us can sense good vibes and bad vibes ‚Äì and these are not just ‚Äúvibes‚Äù (an incredibly vague term used to discredit the perceptions of other individuals) ‚Äì they are thoughts. Our thoughts determine what kind of ‚Äúvibes‚Äù we are sending out to other people, do you not agree?\n\nAll of us, including myself, have big egos that need refinement in some way. This is humility. When we refuse to judge, and we see each other as growing individuals. I choose to refine my thoughts, and I spend a lot of my free time, asking for no compensation from other people, teaching what I know is true about reality. It takes a lot of time to write posts such as these. Most of the responses are harsh criticisms based out of ego, and not out of honesty and humility. These individuals feel threatened by what I am writing, and they should be if they are unkind and refuse to refine their own egos (the expression of truth and humility). A higher awareness of ESP and telepathy is incredibly threatening to the authoritative control freak that seeks power over other individuals. These behaviors and attitudes are rooted in low self-esteem (the need to be better than other individuals). Most of the responses are harsh criticisms, but I get the sense that there are many more that are thankful for what I am writing, because it puts them into a higher awareness immediately and empowers them. These writings are for those individuals that care about other people, are kind, and do not seek power, control and authority over others.\n\nI expect that, after I post this essay, many will begin to criticize it unfairly and be angry about it. They will most likely express that this post does not belong here, has no relation to MBTI, is off topic, is pseudoscience, has no intellectual bearing on reality itself, or any other putdowns or criticisms they can think of for the purposes of DISCREDITING what I have written. Many will attempt to use sarcasm as a hidden effort to discredit as well. Some individuals may even contact a moderator to block me from posting in the future, because they do not like what I am writing about. These are common reactions from individuals that want to control how other people think and what is being openly expressed. If there is one topic ‚Äì and one topic only ‚Äì that stirs the hornet nest the most, it is telepathy and ESP. This is because we are changing reality for what it is, and many individuals are just not ready to grow. They want to keep how they really think towards other people hidden, and remain controlling, judgmental Individuals that are bossy only care about power and authority, the do not care about refining the self. There is a direct correlation between higher intellectual functioning, and kindness, humility and honesty.\n\nI am not writing this to outsmart anyone, but to expose reality for what it is. If you don‚Äôt like this essay, NO HARD FEELINGS, OK?\n\nA few points I wanted to make:\n1.	The emotional states of individuals do not traverse space/time. Emotional synchronization between individuals (feelings) is non-localized in nature. All of us can feel love (high emotion thoughts ‚Äì kindness, honestly, humility), and all of us can feel hate (authority, fear, control, pessimism). We are emotionally connected, and it does not matter how far our bodies are separated. If another person has a negative attitude towards us and is holding us in their thoughts, or if that person is actively thinking about us to communicate, we can feel the direction of their thoughts. Our thoughts are either loving, kind and gentle, or they are not.\n2.	Skepticism regarding ESP does not mean to criticize unendedly. It means that we are also open to the possibility that it is real. If we constantly look for reasons that ESP is not real and put down people that are curious about it, this is not skepticism, this is control. Control can be in the form of derogatory comments, sarcasm, put downs, etc. Skepticism requires us to ask for CLARIFICATION, it does not mean that we detract over and over and over without any sort of objectivity.\n3.	We can sense not only direct thinking (telepathy), but also attitude (our vibe) of other individuals. Our attitude is determined by the habitual thoughts that we have about other people. If we habitually think unkind thoughts, have big egos, and look down on other people, we transmit a low vibe towards other people. We may not be actively thinking about another individual, but that individual will be able to pick up our attitude and current emotional state via feelings quite easily. \n4.	Telepathy is obvious when we stop actively thinking within and start watching the mind. When we stop actively thinking, we will see that the inner conversations and thoughts within our minds still continue. All of us hear these voices. There is no schizophrenia. There is only telepathy. We can all communicate with each other telepathically, and we can also communicate telepathically with the deceased. There is no death.\n\n\nhttps://justinmichaelmeredith.wordpress.com/\n
1	Hey OP, how do you think ESTJs specifically could be impacted by some of this?
1	condense ur writing im two paragraphs in and this nonesense info coulda been conveyed in one sentence. Those things ur calling "vibes", It's called empathy. You don't need to be a psychic to know people reading this thik you're a moron lmfao people with brains don't feel this because they know better than to spout such nonsense. What you basically just did here was the equivalent of a comedian knowing his jokes will make people laugh just in reverse. \n\nsincerely, confused intp.
5	What is your sex life like? What does it mean for you?	As a female INFJ, I'm wondering what your sex life is like. What does it mean for you ESTJ men? How is it different from having sex with someone you're in love with versus with someone you may not be in love with?\n
3	You're coming to the internet to ask ESTJs to talk about their feelings.  Best of luck with that. \n\nAnyway, I can try to take a crack at it.  Love, to me, means taking on all the other person's triumphs and failures as my own.  It's a transition from being an individual to a team.  Having sex with someone that you're not in love with is more so going through the motions so to speak and wouldn't have much of a long term impact.  The focus might be more selfish and about one's personal desires. If it's within the context of a caring relationship then there's a sense of connection, reciprocity, and tenderness that wouldn't necessarily be there otherwise.
1	oh boy, female infj with male estj?? that shit's more disastrous than a shipwreck. one is looking for a deep connection and love while the other uses the partner like a blowup doll/ tool to get off
4	How do I handle a bullying ESTJ in a position of authority?	I'm an ENTP/ENFP. I work as an engineer designing, building and commissioning systems for customers.\n\nAt the site of my biggest project, the foreman I have to work with is an ESTJ with an unhealthy bullying tendency, and he has identified me as the greatest threat to order and righteousness in his universe.\n\nThe problem is, he isnt wrong. He doesn't have much expertise in the fields I work in, and the stuff I work with is all very complicated. Everything I'm implementing in the field threatens his control over his sphere of influence.\n\nDuring the process, he has also given me bad information multiple times that has caused setbacks on the commissioning of the system. Each time, he has insisted that the problems are my fault, only to be proven wrong every time. \n\nWorst of all (and where I realize in hindsight that I screwed this up) I'm not the most developed EN-P myself. I get butt-hurt like and ENFP when I feel like I'm being bullied, and sarcastic like an ENTP when I'm right about something in an argument. I'm basically a firestorm of all the stuff you guys hate when I'm being bullied by someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. It's not just that we butt heads, it's that we bring out the absolute worst in one another because his bullying brings out my problems with being dominated, and my smart-ass arrogance brings out his righteous ass-kicking mode.\n\nIt's a shitty situation because I know that I want this system to work as much as he does. I just can't work with him trying to control everything without the necessary information, and I know he can't handle giving control of his realm to some smart-ass that's throwing a bunch of chaotic shit into his world that he doesn't have control over.\n\nWe are at the point now that our company is sending a technician to the field instead of me to gather the information, then I provide the fix and the tech implements it. It's a frustration for everyone involved.\n\nFirst answer I need, is there a fix for this situation? This guy is a really strongly judging ESTJ who takes pride in dominating and diminishing people he sees as beneath him. I'm pretty sure he has made up his mind about me, but I'd like any input on what it would take to change his mind if possible, because it would help a lot of people, including him and me.\n\nSecond, how do I adjust my mindset to handle any future customers (or anyone else I can't ignore, avoid or fight) with this personality type? What's the best way to show you guys that finding the answers is part of the process, and not a sign of incompetence? How can I give you the control you need in a situation where I'm the one with information and ability that's outside of your direct control? How can I show you that there's a method to my madness that is guided by the same values and principles that guide you? And how do I avoid becoming the target of bullying from an unhealthy ESTJ?\n\nBe brutal. I'm trying to approach this with the objectivity of my ENTP half, and my ENFP half needs to grow a pair, so don't worry about sparing my feelings (as if I have to ask LOL).
7	Well I'll take a whack at it! :)\n\nFirst of all, like you mentioned, if he's a bully then he's definitely an under-developed ESTJ, but here's some stuff that helps me out when dealing with people that I don't see eye to eye with.\n\nNumber one, and I mean NUMBER ONE, if he is a strong SJ like I am, we do NOT do well dealing with concepts/theory/abstract. I need solid, tested examples of why your suggestion will work. I want data, I want graphs, I want to be able to see proof in front of me that this is worth implementing and not "a bunch of empty philosophizing that doesn't accomplish anything" (that's what it'll sound like to us otherwise lol). Some people hear an idea and can automatically picture how it will all work in the big scheme of things. ESTJs are not those people (even just writing that sentence I feel like it's unclear and doesn't make sense because it's too conceptual lol).\n\nThere's a lot of things that your ESTJ bully could do on his end to make things better, but since we can't change him right now let's focus on what you can do.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me is that you said he "takes pride in dominating and diminishing people he sees as beneath him." I can understand why it feels that way, but maybe a better understanding of what *he* thinks he's doing will help: It actually isn't as much about power/control with ESTJs as people think. It's about helping keep the universe secure, efficient, and orderly (that reads, Peaceful, Happy, and Healthy to an ESTJ). When we see something that doesn't make sense to us and someone pushing it as a superior alternative, *until we can be convinced otherwise* with lots of data, concrete examples, and logical analysis, we see that someone an a threat to efficiency, and we are happy to squish them -- not because we think they're beneath us, but because we have successfully policed a situation that could disturb the security, harmony, and efficiency of our environment. Nothing makes us happier and more fulfilled than accomplishment, and something that we perceive as getting in the way of accomplishment is the bane of our existence.\n\nSo what YOU have to do is *convince this guy that your way is more efficient*. This won't be easy. ESTJs are notoriously stubborn. ESTJs don't mind conflict though -- it's a natural, objective process for us -- but the second you get emotionally involved in an argument ESTJs will shut down on you. You have to treat the conflict as a means to exchange data and information quickly, logically, and efficiently, and remember that anything concept/abstract will sound like white noise to an ESTJ, and any emotional input makes us uncomfortable, tired, and we mentally check out.\n\nPeople say ESTJs can't be convinced but that's not really true. We aren't EASILY convinced, but if you put the effort into presenting your data the way we understand it and leaving emotions out of it, it can be done! :) And I'm a girl, so I'm an emotional creature, so when I say leave the emotions out of it, that's saying something, right? :D\n\nAlso I thought you expressed yourself well when you said "How can I show you that there's a method to my madness that is guided by the same values and principles that guide you?" Have you thought of asking your problem ESTJ this exact question? That might give him pause and might give you answers. Never hurts to try.\n\nWell that was a big ramble but I really hope it helps you figure out something to make your life easier! Feel free to ask anything else.

1	Tell him he's doing a good job but it would be even better and efficient if he would listen to your proposal, and then you insert hard data and evidence for your claims and argument them in the most logical way possible. For example telling him your procedure gives more insight since it means more than just meets the eye (and you detail). Something along those lines. 
4	Seeking Advice on Reading my ESTJ Boss	Background information:\n\n--- I'm ISFP, single, and have been working with an ESTJ for a little over two months. \n\n--- when I initially transferred to this job I worked in a different department than he did. He seemed to immediately notice me and often approached me for conversation. \n\n--- He exhibits thoughtful gestures, both big and small. He also remembers subtle things I say in passing and asks me about my family. \n\n--- He immediately hired me to work under him when I confided to him that I was unhappy with the position I was currently in. This despite the fact there were at least three other people in my department, who had privately expressed to him their desire to be transferred, and they have been with the company longer than I have. \n\nBut he hired me instead. \n\n--- After he transferred me I was promoted and told there would be several opportunities available if I continued to prove myself. \n\n--- He continues to be supportive, helpful, and encouraging. He expresses concern when he thinks I'm struggling (both personally and professionally) and he seems interested in me as a person. Always laughs at my remarks, makes an effort to drop by and see me whenever he's there, gives me insight and advice. \n\n--- He is clearly charming and good with people in general. \n\n--- I do not think he is married and haven't heard about any girlfriend or significant other (not that I've asked. We have very strict anti-fraternization policies at work.)\n\n--- I recently noticed he was "friends" with my former boss and one of my co-workers  (who, like me, is also his subordinate) on Facebook. Since the ESTJ and I are forthcoming with each other about our personal lives anyway, I attempted to add him. He did not acknowledge it. This was late last night. This afternoon I cancelled the request, feeling somewhat snubbed. (I would not have taken it so personally had I not seen him on my coworker's "friends list".)\n\n--- Today he acted the same as always, charming and interested, and never said anything about the pending friend request. I didn't either, and was slightly more aloof and disinterested than usual. I do not think he noticed because the change in my mood was subtle and could easily have been attributed to stress at work. I came home and canceled the request.\n\n--- What's up with this guy? What are his intentions, if any? Should I just shut my mouth and stick to my work and be grateful for the opportunities he's given me? Or should I continue to be friendly with him (which is nearly impossible to do when I can't be honest and open and blunt...I'm Fi dominant) and let him decide the boundaries for this friendship?\n\n--- one more thing: he has never directly said or done anything that could be misconstrued as inappropriate. He is always professional and the only reason I've read so much into his behavior is because of (a) the kind gestures he's made toward me and (b) I'm interested in him. \n\nAnyway thanks for reading, if you still are. Any advice or interpretations would be appreciated :)
4	Am ESTJ female, might be able to offer you some insight. I think that he's cautious because he is also interested. He's not sure where to take this interaction, nor does he know the boundaries to set for this friendship. 
3	Just another thought: I'm an ESTJ and have a Facebook with lots of friends on my list but I don't check it daily at all. He might have just missed it. :)\n\nAlso, ESTJs don't play games. There's no underlying context you're supposed to be picking up on, so don't read into anything *too* much. If he's interested, he'll show you lots of personal attention and eventually ask you out if the workplace rules allow for it. If he's not interested, he'll just treat you the same as he does everyone else.

6	The Battle of El Alamein	
2	Seems like a war between an ESTP and ESTJ, really cool.
2	Montgomery had almost everything going for him, he had the terrain advantage, intelligence advantage, resources advantage, number advantage, and he had a chance to study Rommel's tactics before he took command. 
2	As an ISTJ just briefly visiting r/ESTJ - are posts like this regular out here, Big history/WWII buff and I'm interested but confused as to it's purpose on an MBTI page; Either way, Cool post dude
1	[ENTP] ESTJs, can you help me?	(Warning: A lot of this is meant to make fun of the situation, prepare yourself for the cringe! I actually do have a serious, legit problem, though, so it'd be quite nice if you could help with that, too...)\n\nI believe my relative is one of you. Blech, ew, this sounds way too formal already...\n\nANYWAYS, so my ESTJ relative...I love them to death, yeah? They can put up with me...most of the time. Hey, it's better than the average Joe on the street, I'll give you that!\n\nSo, anyways, I feel as though because we disagree on certain things, our relationship is trash. Not as in I-don't-like-this-relationship, it's as in this-relationship-goes-out-the-window-the-second-we-bring-up-a-touchy-subject kind of trash. \n\nSee, I think that because I don't think the same way as my ESTJ relative, I'm hurting them. \n\nThese are the two primary issues:\n\n1. Religion. I'm an agnostic, they're Christian. I tell them I don't want to go to Church or get confirmed. They make me do both anyways. AKA: That generic atheist/agnostic experience all atheists/agnostics get. \n2. The way I'm "experiencing the high school life." They want me to go to parties. I am okay with parties because super awesomely cool nerdfriends are there, but not necessarily ecstatic about it. I want to wear a suit to the party because suits are really, really, really cool and I think I'd look really badass wearing one. They don't want me to wear a suit, and refuse to argue with me on the matter. They instead force me to wear a dress. I hate dresses, on a badass scale of noodlearms to ninja grandmother they get a 'single-celled organism.'\n\nSo, how can I fix these situations? Do I have to bend my point of view to match theirs? If so, that's really gonna suck...ew...\n\nAnd does this sound ESTJ to you? My typing may have been off. 
2	Well I am as well an atheist and if I had family that wanted me to go to church and do what ever I would go asking as its not eating up your life. You don't have to believe what the preach but it will make them feel better if they think you will go to heaven. And for the dressing situation; I have a brother that has one of the worse fashion styles ever(not saying that you do) and her just wears shorts, doesn't do anything to his hair, basically doesn't care if anyone likes him. Even though I tell him what may look good on him he doesn't even want to try it, my recommendation for you is to wear what your cousins say looks nice maybe once out of every 5 times and just ask someone if they think you look good in it. If not try something else, don't worry it won't kill you.
1	First: Personally, as an ESTJ (and a Christian for that matter, lol, since it seems to be semi-relevant here), I don't think I'd "force" you to go to church. You mentioned confirmation so I'm assuming Catholicism, which I am not--but I've noticed that a lot of Catholics seem to "force" family members to go to church, so that may just be a combo of their personality and their denomination. \nSecond: I too used to hate dresses. However, I like them now, so I can't help you much on this one. Maybe compromise with a dress, a blazer/sport coat like jacket, and menswear inspired shoes? \nI'd recommend trying to find a compromise at least. \nAlso, how old are you, OP? You sound pretty young.\n
5	What does it mean when an ESTJ man is like this?	I went on a date with an ESTJ man, whom I liked after our first meeting. He seemed to like me, too, as we chatted often via text. \n\nThe thing is, he'a only asked me to hang out with him in presence of his friends, which I find really bothersome. I like to hang out one-on-one, at least in the beginning stage of getting to know someone. I do sense that he likes me, but I'm wondering if I'm just mistaken. \n\nAny thoughts, ESTJ men?
2	Have you suggested an one on one interaction? \n\nA ESTJ attracted to you wouldnt turn that down.
2	As a male ESTJ, I don't "get" hints whether they're subtle or otherwise. I need a neon sign that someone reads to me. Through a bullhorn.\n\nBut maybe that's just me.\n
2	He probably doesn't know you want to be alone. I know I would be eager to show my friends the girl I was dating. He's probably proud of you or wants you to see him in his element with his friends. Personally, one on one interactions make me nervous, and I am way more comfortable in group interaction. Maybe he's worried about how he'll come across one on one.
1	For best results, always be direct.  Men can't always read the signals at the best of times, so you can save yourself some grief and anxiety by getting to the point.
6	Functions	**Dominant Te (EXTJ)**: Here is the plan, and the steps needed to accomplish it. I can learn anything complicated. This is your responsibility, and I expect a status report. I measure success by objective means (best-seller lists, stock reports, etc). I have a second plan if the first one fails. Anything can be organized for greater results. This isn‚Äôt working right; let me fix it. Here is how you can accomplish your goals. Controlling one‚Äôs emotions is important. It takes an hour and ten minutes to get there, with 30 minutes allotment for a traffic jam. We can comfortably do this in two weeks, yes. These are the facts, and if something doesn‚Äôt measure the facts, I intend to challenge it.\n\n**Auxiliary Si (ESXJ)**: The last time I tackled this project, using this technique worked, so I feel confident in my ability to succeed using the same technique. This restaurant is laid out different than it was the last time I was here; those tables were on the patio, and they had red curtains, not green. I‚Äôm happy to provide you with the details of why I am making this decision. I recognize this street, so I know where to turn! This holiday is meaningful to me, because it allows me to connect to my family or my culture. I‚Äôm disappointed if we can‚Äôt celebrate it together every year. If we‚Äôre going to do this project, let‚Äôs do research to see how others have done it before we start. I like to reflect on my own past experiences when making decisions in the present, and believe I can learn from others‚Äô mistakes.\n\n**Tertiary Ne (ESXJ)**: Oh, that new idea is interesting! I‚Äôd like to talk about it with you! But I need to be somewhere in twenty minutes, so let‚Äôs keep it on track as much as we can. It feels like you are not tied to reality with this idea; can we pull it back to something tangible? I think I have several ideas as to what really happened back there. This discovery may help me discover my greater purpose in life. I suspected this was going to happen‚Ä¶\n\n**Inferior Fi (EXTJ)**: My beliefs are very strong, but I spend little time thinking about them. Many of them are tied to my feelings, and I‚Äôm not comfortable dwelling on my emotions. It‚Äôs easier to adopt a simple, straightforward moral code and stick to it without deviation. I don‚Äôt see the point in determining which causes are more important than others. I have a tendency to think that my values are right for others. I really want to do something greater than myself, and am fiercely loyal to what I believe in but I would rather donate time, energy, and money than emotional support. It‚Äôs hard for me to be loyal to people whose decisions I profoundly disagree with. I need to respect you before I can emotionally support you in those times. Slowly, I am learning to be more tolerant and not see the world as black and white.\n\nSource: http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/cognitivefunctions
3	[Master Personality Typology Survey] I'm conducting a survey to analyze correlations between popular personality typologies, and I need a lot more ESTJs in it!	
4	I am an INFP and my son is an ESTJ. Help!	To me, time is relative. To my son, time is respected. To me, decisions are based on being authentic and harmonious. To him, decisions are based on realities and gathered data. How do we get along? Any ESTJs with this frustrating parent/child experience? How did you find a balance, if any?
4	My mom is an ENFP and my dad is an INTP, and I'm their ESTJ daughter. Very strong emphasis on the J! :)\n\nThe advice I would give to an NFP parent of an STJ child is this: while lots of organization and structure may feel *restrictive* to you, organization and structure mean *security* to your child. ESTJs feel safer and happier when there is a hierarchy and predictability around them.\n\nI find that finding a "balance" with clashing personality preferences has more to do with understanding *why* another person has the preferences they do rather than how you're supposed to react. Structure and facts help ESTJs understand (and find our place in) the universe. Lack of organization and moral gray areas make us feel lost and frustrated. And when we feel that way, we don't want compassion, we want our structure and facts back lol!!! :)\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is, trying to get an ESTJ to see things in an NFP way is going to be frustrating for both of you (ESTJs may understand, intellectually, why you feel the way you do, but we'll never really get it and we'll NEVER think you're right lol). Instead, try to respect each other's needs, and provide, in some form, what the ESTJ needs to feel safe and fulfilled. And try to explain in a logical manner what you would like from your ESTJ son in return!
4	Are most ESTJs male?	I saw a statistic on a personality test website that ESTJ was the #1 most common personality type in men, but no source. For reference, I'm female. (Extra fun fact: my boyfriend is ISFJ, which is apparently, according to the same website, the most common in females).
3	I won't speak for everyone, but I'm a male. 
2	Fellow ESTJ female here, dating an xNFP male. Also curious about this stat!
2	I'm a male, have a feeling its probably male oriented but who knows!
2	Also fellow ESTJ female!
2	ESTJ male.\n\n\nI'm still special, ok? :p
2	I recently saw some video that 11% of men are ESTJ and 6% of women are, but I don't know if that's really true.\n\nAnyway, I'm an ESTJ female and one of my friends is too. Also, I married an ENFJ. Our marriage has definitely been a voyage of discovery! :D
1	I have always read the ESTJ was not that common. But yes, most are male. I am a female and have yet to meet another female ESTJ.
1	Where are all my ESTJ men at? I'm an INFJ and I love you guys. They say ESTJs are common and INFJs are rare, but in all seriousness I see way more INFJs than ESTJs.

1	My ENTJ/ESTJ partner has been having an existential crisis and I don't know what to do to help???	About 1-2 weeks ago, my boyfriend started having an existential crisis. It's been weeks and he still is really distressed from it, like especially at night while he's working/studying (related subjects) he'll start thinking about it. I (infj) try to approach the situation by asking him to describe what specifically he is thinking and what he's worried about. He's not very good at talking about his feeling so all I've managed to get out of him is "what happens when we die?" and "I'm so scared and confused about not existing". I used to feel like this when I was younger, and have now accepted death is inevitable and am comfortable with the idea of non-existence for myself. So I try to comfort him by telling him that he will find his own answers some day, telling him about my opinions on the matter, and how I got to where I am (on the matter). It doesn't seem to be working as what I'm doing seems to make him not want to tell me any more about it, other than when he's having the crisis. He's talking to other people about it, which is good, but I really want to help as well. I feel helpless but I really want to help him get through this together, but I'm not sure at all how to approach this situation!\nTl;dr, partner has been having existential crisis for weeks and what I'm trying to do has caused him to stop sharing with me. What do I do?
2	I can relate. I would try and discuss his plans for the future and get him back to thinking about the concrete world and what he would like to accomplish.

1	My ex-boyfriend, who was also an ESTJ (I'm an INFJ), would go into bouts of dark thoughts. It was scary because he was such a rock most of the other times.\n\nESTJs do worry a lot. But they're also problem solvers so their worries keep them working and solving problems until they are no longer problems. \n\nWith existential problems such as his, I think gently having him engage with more people and in the social life would be the best. They tend to recede into solitude when sad. That's actually not a good spot for them for an extended period of time.\n\nGive him some positive ego boosting support so he know you're on his side for everything. We INFJs are great at that! And if he's not comfortable, just let him solve his own thoughts. We don't have to be counsellors all the time. We can just be a cheerleader :)
2	Company assigning employees to teams based on their personality?	Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company \n\nAnyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. \n\n(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. \n\n(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. \n\n(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. \n\n(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
2	You're probably right.  Its not a common practice to segregate a company/floor to such an extent, but there are a lot of places that take your individual personality into account.  \n\nMy personal feelings though are to not divide up the floor like they did.  What they've done is created working groups whose members are too similar to each other.  You need the diversity and difference in personalities to really set up a great team.  Most places just make people aware of their personalities and their traits.
11	My ESTJ Roommate= A Blessing in Disguise	First off, you guys seem to get a lot of hate, and this is an appreciation post. To preface this, I'm an ENTP with a long history of terrible prioritizing, scheduling, and organizing skills. I came into this school year with no calendars, no schedule, no real motivation, no cares, or worries. After a semester with my ESTJ roommate I have learned a lot:\n\nWhen I first moved in I thought this would be like living with my mother round 2. She was high-strung, bossy, and bitchy. SHE CAN'T STOP CLEANING AND BITCHING ABOUT EVERYONE/EVERYTHING. The girl literally had no idea how to have fun. I honestly thought she and I would butt heads about anything and everything, but it turns out it was the best random roommate I could have asked for.\n\nThe girl taught me how to organize my life. \n\n 1. How to stop procrastinating by: "Do it right when you get it, make the deadline tomorrow."(I am now a month ahead of reading/hw/projects in my courses and I'm taking a full load). \n\n 2. How to clean up after myself consistently: Every (one day of the week) pretend friends are coming over that night-(even better, invite a few over that night). \n\n 3. How to make schedules/plan (I revamped it to fit my personality a little better). 3 attainable goals of the day, 2 reach goals, and 1 long term goal/progress on it (When you start with this method I recommend just lots of baby goals to cross off).\n\n 4. How to only keep/maintain healthy friendships-I deleted >50% of my contacts from my phone. I realized that a lot of these people don't want me to be the best I can be, and I really don't want people like that in my life anymore.\n\n 5. How to take an extra second to make better decisions.( Take a deep breath and look at the clock, list/say the worst things that can happen for the next minute). Really helped me stop going Ne crazy.\n\nBasically, she taught me how to "life" in just a semester without even knowing it or trying. So although our opinions and points of view on things don't always agree, She really is the yin to my yang.  While she does all this for me, I have shown her how to relax. How to start laughing about the little things in life. How to live life a little more on the edge. How to start thinking outside the box about how to solve some of her problems. Finally, I showed her that things are always black and white. There is a middle area and there are other perspectives and feelings we need to take into account before making broad statements.\n\nOverall, thank you ESTJ's for helping some of the lost find a path.\n\nIf you have any questions at all ask away! :)
2	Just curious, maybe you are ENFP? NFP + STJ is usually like a yin - yang relationship, they share the same beliefs and attitudes, enjoy similar activities etc. It would be interesting to find that ENTPs really like ESTJs too.
7	Hey guys, what does your handwriting look like?	"Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!" \n\nOn the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right? Anyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)

2	Book Suggestions for ESTJ and INFJ?	I'm bonding with an ESTJ. I asked if we could read a book together, and he said yes! He asked me to pick the book, and I asked if we could pick together instead. So, we are each suggesting two. Ideas?
3	Glass castle is really good
2	My husband and I just took the tests, and supposedly he is an ESTJ and I am an INFJ. We both really enjoyed Way of Kings from the Stormlight Archives, by Brandon Sanderson. I think that is the one we have both most liked. Its fantasy genre. First couple chapters are difficult because the world is very unique, but after you adjust it is *fantastic*.
2	If he are a non-fiction science kind of guy, highly recommend the Martian, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Science of Interstellar, The Sixth Extinction or Guns, Germs and Steel. \n\nPolitics/Law/Economics nerd? How about America's Constitition by Akhil Reed Amar? Or The Supreme Court by J. Rehnquist? Or if you have a whole year to spend- Thomas Piketty's Capital is incredible.\n\nGeneral well-being- Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.\n\n
1	As an INFJ, I'd prefer to read non-fiction. Do you have any common interests?
2	Any estj musicians?	Honestly looking for drummers guitarists bassists...and any correlations between personality type. 
1	I play a few instruments. What specifically are you trying to figure out?
1	[deleted]
1	Lead guitarist. And, to toot my own hornüìØ, I'm phenomenal. (Nah, I'm decent. But I've been playing for years in countless bands. It's my main hobby)
3	The best way to break up with an ESTJ?	I've tried to make it work. But I'm an ISFP and he gets so angry with me. Now I just want it to end peacefully and amicably. Any advice?
4	Rip the bandaid off quick, don't mince words, detail why it isn't working and why it can't be fixed. Just do it.\n\n\n\n<ShiaLeBouf.jpg>
3	"I'm breaking up with you because X" Done.
3	You have to be direct and affirmative, fully confident. If there is any weakness or second guessing, you likely won't be taken seriously.\n\n-ENTJ
3	IA with it being quick and to the point. You...might want to have a bulleted list of reasons why your PERSONALITIES are incompatible (because to an ESTJ, it can often feels like if someone "really" cared about something, they would do their best to bear the discomfort and change their actions for harmony). Explain that it's not fair to ask either of you to do things that make you unhappy, and that sometimes even when you care about each other, the dynamic can get so fraught with fundamental differences that it grows into plain resentment on both your parts. \n\nYou'll be okay, and you should feel no shame in wanting this for yourself. Even if he doesn't react the best, you are right to want something different. Trust me, he'll eventually realize the breakup makes sense, once the initial emotions patter out.
3	Being bullied by my ESTJ roommate. Want some advice	I have a roommate I believe is a(n EXTREMELY unhealthy) ESTJ.\n\nI'm an INFJ and preface this by saying I dated an ESTJ for 3 years. When we disagreed, we always just agreed to disagree, and it was never an issue. The coworker I also work most closely and best with is also an ESTJ. So my issue isn't with ESTJs, it's with a particularly unhealthy ESTJ (or simply just an unhealthy person).\n\nWith my roommate, she moved in and needs everything to be how she wants it to be at all times, and she has zeroed in on me to bully me. We're fundamentally different. It's more important to her that our house "look" like a nice happy place than actually being a nice happy place. For example, she put up Christmas decorations this weekend, but was angry and snapping at anyone who touched them. Her sisters kids came over to help. She yelled at them the entire time, but then made them pose nicely for a picture.\n\nA happy house to me is a place where everyone feels safe and comfortable, even if it's not that organized.\n\nSo, she's started narrowing in on me. For example, I put my broken down boxes near our recycling in the kitchen. She will somehow decide this is not okay, and start throwing them down the stairs to my bedroom door.\n\nI am the only one that drinks coffee in the house, and my coffee maker is on the counter plugged in. One day she decided this was not okay, and moved it to the cabinet. I keep putting it back, she keeps moving it.\n\nShe will do things like leave her things out where she knows that my cat will urinate on them (because I've explicitly told her, and because he's urinated on mine in the exact same spot) and then complain and demand monetary reimbursment. When I tell her I won't reimburse her because she had all this information beforehand, she flies off the rail and starts telling me she'll take me to small claims court.\n\nIn the past, I've complied with her newly enforced "rules", like our fridge used to just be where we put food. She organized it and wants everyone to have their own shelf. Okay, sure. I did that. But it's like the more I give in, the more she pushes. She knows no personal boundaries.\n\nIt's an excessive need to covertly control, and her lack of respect for other people's living habits in a house in which she is the newest member of. The ONLY thing I have seen her be semi-responsive to is our landlord, who she perceives to be an "authority figure".\n\nI realize that unhealthy is just unhealthy, but if anyone has any tips for how to deal with her best, I would love to hear it. So far I have tried to confront her directly, completely ignore her, return the passive aggression. All of these make her completely livid.
8	My old supervisor was an ESTJ. She publicly took her anger out on me in work after her train was delayed. I didn't respond to avoid giving her the reaction she wanted, then quietly typed an email threatening to report her for bullying. We didn't speak for months and she left. But she was still a complete bitch right up until I said goodbye to her. You can't win with ESTJs - they seek the quieter ones to bolster their egos and need for control. My boyfriend is an ESTJ and is making my life a misery, see my previous posts (I'm an ISFP) x
2	Finding a new roommate might be the best option?
2	ESTJ women are so different from ESTJ men... Sorry I don't have much to offer. I think with this much stress accumulated (and threats like you mention above), I would redirect my energy and focus on finding a new place. Good luck! 
1	A member of my family is an ESTJ and ALWAYS has to feel in control down to the most minute detail. As an INFP, we fall on the exact opposite end of the spectrum, so this behavior has always been incredibly foreign to me (and sometimes unbearably exhausting). I love her, but could never in a million years imagine living with her. \n\nJust find another roommate. Some people need other people to push down in order to feel like they're in control‚Äîdon't let that person be you! It's your life.
1	An introverts' perspective on Extroverts with a million friends!	
3	OP, not sure if you wrote that, but if you did, I recommend proof reading it. Secondly, not every extrovert is like this. We love to talk to people; we like making friends with people and it's fun for us. I get introverted people don't like to get to know everyone else as much and put themselves out there, but I really like having a lot of people I can call my friends. People that I knew who had 10+ friends, were very close to each other. More than anything, I see this as some introvert lashing out at extroverted people because they make friends easier. We still have close connections.
1	4-Type Chat Room Theory: Better chat rooms based on cognitive function theory. Try before you pass it by (explanation within)	
1	New subreddit for MBTI discussion. Who wants to join?	I have created a new subreddit to discuss MBTI and make new friends/meet new people.  If you are looking to chat with a certain type or just want to chat about anything and everything MBTI, this is the right place.  Anyone is welcome.
7	Just realized my boss is ESTJ. Any advice for helping her through emotional times?	Like the title says, my manager seems very strongly ESTJ. She is a good boss, but as an ESFP myself we are just very different. Accidentally finding her MTBI type makes me feel like I stumbled upon a manual for improving my work performance infinitely.\n\nShe is going through some very tough times emotionally, and I am beginning to think she is going to work with the persistence of a freight train regardless of what happens in her personal life. Any advice for how I can make this easier for her? 
5	nah, just leave her to do her thing. we don't really like to share personal stuff, it's just kinda not our thing.
7	Do Mature ESTJs have a dendency to act like NFs?	EDIT: before you get mad, I meant to type tendency, but it autocorrected to decency. Ok, resume.\n\nI'm INTJ, and my crush, 25 m, took the test recently for the first time and came out ESTJ. I could have sworn he's xNFx, so I thought maybe ENFJ? Idk, the more I read up on the two, the more I'm convinced he's ENFJ, but perhaps he has developed his Si and Ti.\n\nHe does act like an ESTJ in that he tends to judge people at work based on their compliance and respect for, schedules and procedures. He also talks about how he gets his work done asap, before his deadline, however any work that comes in when he's off the clock must be saved for the next work day. He's got a lot going on since he works full time, he tries to keep a really regular schedule of stuff he needs to do outside of work (laundry day, college classes, study time, and usually calling me at the end of the day and we talk for a couple hours). I have heard though that ESTJs are stereotyped as being "sticklers" and "hardnosed", but he's very laid back.\n\nHowever, when he's always very expressive (doesn't sound like an ESTJ trait), when he tells a story he usually explains everything surrounding/leading up to the story before he gets to the actual story, and he usually describes his overall impression and how he felt about what happened. He bought a book on watchmaking, and pretty much immediately started reading and applying what learned to watch repairs. He's really good with numbers and math, and is currently taking a class in differential equations (I'm not sure if that's uncharacteristic of ENFJs, but it seems like understanding systems like that is typically an N thing). He was taught how to cook from a young age, and the way he talks about it, he actually enjoys it. We've been friends for almost 2 years, but things have only started to progress in the pass couple months and now when I see him he is very into physical contact (e.g. hugging me, touching my arm, dancing with me pretty much all night). I was invited to a small gathering, and the hosts wanted to get everyone dancing, and he was the first to start the dancing. He fixed me some food, and I got food poisoning and he took care of me. Usually when there's a "milestone" in our relationship (like talking on the phone during the recent eclipse), he says, "Are we having a moment!? :D" Whenever I start to wonder if I should tell him something, he always encourages me to be open with him. In fact, when I asked what he wanted me to tell him, he specifically said, "Everything! I want to know everything you're thinking about!" He seems to really enjoy when I open up to him, especially when it's uncomfortable and vulnerable (which is scary for me, an INTJ). He said something about how it shows trust? He said he's typically really good at reading people, but these days he makes a conscious effort not do it anymore because he feels like he knows too much about the person and it can being upsetting sometimes. And the last reason I think he's ENFJ is he is a slut for the Confucius meme, lol.\n\nWhere the two personality types (ESTJ and ENFJ) overlap though is what trips me up. Both are goal oriented. Both care deeply about family and friends. Both tend to be good at leading people, I guess both in the office and with friends.\n\nSo does it sound like ESTJ behavior to you?\n\n**TL;DR** Does anyone else find that they tend to act like an ENxJ? How can I determine if he is ESTJ or ENFJ for sure? What do you feel like your biggest differences are with ENFJs? \n
4	My girlfriend is an ESTJ, and I'm an ENFP. I almost never see her sympathize or empathize with anyone, even those she cares about. However, she is very warm and affectionate to me (and also with animals). I get to see a side of her that really, no one else does. It makes me feel very special!
5	Older ESTJs seem like ENTJs to me, especially if they work in finance, business, etc., where meeting and venturing into new areas are a part of their job. Something about having to have many different views to be successful at their job gives them that N practice. Still pretty S in other areas of life. 
2	I don't think so. I'm an ESTJ and the only other type that I sometimes act like is ESTP. 
2	[deleted]
2	He must really like you!  The S types I know most definitely don't want to hear most of what I'm thinking (other than my ESTP SO).  Then again I'm an INFJ, and what I consider recreational speculation sounds like stoner wank to people who want to see concrete outcomes.\n\nI really try to stick to the facts when I talk to STJs.

7	Do ESTJs tend to get frustrated when people aren't punctual or is that all types?	I'm always extremely frustrated with people when we agree on a time to meet and then they show up 15mins-2 hours late. It really bothers me like nothing else. Is this everyone or a majority estjs? None of my friends or family seem to be phased by people being late, just me.
5	I hate late people. That's probably one of my biggest pet peeves. Being punctual is pretty much a point of pride for me. So I get you. Haha.\n\nEdit: But I'm also an ENTJ as well, lol.
3	INFP here. It really depends on the situation. If it's work related, or there are time constraints on the activity, it's  frustrating. However, on a social call, I give a lot more leeway. A friend was 30 mins late to meet me yesterday and I just took the time to listen to music and catch up on the news. NBD. Sometimes shit happens and I'd like to be extended the same flexibility if I was running late for whatever reason. 
3	I'm an INFJ and I definitely feel frustrated when people are late without letting me know in advance. It's more the breaking of etiquette than "my time is important" type of frustration, though. \n\nOne thing I've come to realize is that some people do not perceive time as fixed digits. For them, it's more fluid, and they underestimate the available time. It's like when I might underestimate the weather when there's a clear number for it (degrees). This perspective helps with the frustration!
2	I'm an ENTJ and I DEFINITELY get frustrated when people aren't punctual. I don't think that's a surprise coming from my type though. 
2	Is it an ESTJ thing? Not saying I'm not punctual or being punctual is bad but I was mildly surprised when I asked this girl out for a date the other day and she texted me exactly 2 minutes before the promised time asking, "I'm ready, where are you?" I thought it was just her (she also had something else to do later that day) but now that I'm seeing this post I'm thinking.. hmm...
2	Hey there ESTJ's I'm making a chat for the "Sentinels" type personalities (ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ and ESFJ) come join us	Hello ISTJs.\n\nI'm creating a Skype chat for people who fit into the role of the "Sentinels" which according the the [16-personalities website](http://www.16personalities.com/articles/our-theory) "Highly practical embracing and creating order and security and stability wherever they go." \n\nIn theory Sentinels tend to enjoy each others company and have common goals. So I thought I'd create a chat to see if this is true. So come join us.  \n\n\nHere is the Skype link to join the group: \nhttps://join.skype.com/vsBD6BebPjtH\n\nOr you can contact me directly if you have questions and i'll add you to it directly.\n\nMy Username: kaspeey\n
1	I might join later
4	How does a stepdad support his depressed 15 year old stepson? He's in a rut.	His dad and him don't talk because his dad is controlling and has some emotional issues.  He's done some things that I don't think you can take back.  Anyway, he's my stepson and he's in a rut.  He plays League Of Legends all day and has kind of stopped growing/taking care of himself for about 18 months now.  Him and I get along with respect however I haven't been able to retain a strong communication line with him as he's continued down this path.  I think that I can help him, so I would love some advice!
5	Is he an ESTJ, or are you? Anyway, it'll take time for him to grow socially. He may not want to, but try to get him to go on a quick hike on a trail somewhere, even overnight backpacking if possible. Spending time outdoors with someone trustworthy is one of the best treatments for depression, and the natural sunlight (especially blue light) will aid in serotonin buildup.
1	This is a weird idea maybe but I'd get him a dog...a cool dog...that he can hang out with...then I'd take walks with him and the dog.\n\nWalks are very underrated as mental healing tool--walking and talking is the best thing ever...\n\nSo happy you are thinking about him and want to help. Kudos to you!
3	ESTJs, what is the most common problem you face when dealing with ISTPs?	Try to be honest, or I might not understand what you have to say.
3	I don't have problems dealing with anyone usually, as long as they are respectful, honest and don't needlessly challenge me. Do you have a particular issue with them? Or someone of that type?
2	I've had a limited number of encounters, but the main problem I encountered was perceived lack of effort on their part.  I became easily frustrated when simple requests went unfulfilled.  Additionally, their ability to focus and stick out certain activities or projects irked me.  
1	 No idea, but from what I've heard other people dealing with them they're commies that fail to accept that just because they feel something doesn't make it factually correct and they shouldn't impose their views on others, or try to make them feel bad, just based on that. 
5	Any advice for an ENFP girl wanting to pursue an ESTJ guy?	I met this guy recently through some campus groups a few weeks ago and we seem to really hit it off. We talk about random things late at night on Facebook mostly and when we do see each other (busy schedules) we spent hours talking by ourselves or hanging in a group. He keeps inviting me to random things or to play badminton with him and his friends and its great. \n\nSo we ended up talking MBTI the other night. He has never heard of it before (he is from India and an electrical engineering major) and was really intrigued by it. The 16personalities.com test put him very solidly as an ES but completely middle for the last two. We both think ESTJ describes him most of the time. \n\nI really like him and of course I am doing the typical ENFP thing and second guessing and overanalyzing everything. I really like this guy and I want it to be more but I also don't want to lose a potentially good friend by misreading the situation. So my ESTJ comrades, what does it look like when you like someone? Any advice to be had?
4	[deleted]
3	ENFP guy here. My girlfriend of four years is ESTJ. We're decent at reading people, and reading her was like reading large block letters painted on the broad side of a barn. My running joke is that she is as subtle as a car accident. Before dating she was openly flirtatious and started doing things that were very clearly intended to get us either talking or doing something together. This is just a piece of anecdotal evidence and varies from person to person.\n\nMy advice is to you from the ENFP-perspective: go with your gut. Overanalysis wastes time and tricks us into inaction. We're great at communicating feelings, so go forth anD communicate your own!
2	ENFP guy here in the exact situation with an ENTJ girl. Please let me know if you've made any moves and how it's gone down. Let's support each other!
2	I dated an ESTJ. The best thing you do with them is speak straight-forwardedly but with sincerity.\n\nLike all TJ's, they love straight-up statements that are clear. Structured.\n\nLike all SJ's, they are tradition-minded; they have no time for insincerity or half-in-half-out.\n\nGood luck!!!!
2	ESTJs tend to me straight forward. Example: I won't help mud sharks. 
2	I know I'm a little late to the party here, but I'll speak as an ESTJ male.\n\nI am not subtle and I don't beat around the bush when I'm in "my mode" of normally doing things. If I like you I will probably tell you first. It is also my hope that I be complimented, flirted with and honestly communicated with. I appreciate directness in speech and actions and am do not have a high tolerance for hinting around. \n\nMy advice? If you like the guy, tell him verbally, clearly and honestly and at a minimum you'll get the same response back.
6	Are you all really sarcastic?	I think its a TJ trait but not really sure. I tend to be very sarcastic and if people aren't on board with me or are easily butt hurt it tends to make it very difficult to make friends. Anyone else?
8	[deleted]
5	[I'm the wife of this guy's account, but I'm an ISFJ. I use sarcasm much, but not in a harmful way. in in a non harmful way; that is a warm way. my girlfriend is an estj and she's pretty warm, even in sarcasm. She's not really into sarcasm that much though.]
5	Nope.
2	Incredibly and yes, it also affects my ability to make friends on a close level at least. Sarcasm is great for casual relationships but it's hard when people are trying to get close to you 
2	Yes... All my ESTJ friends crack sarcastic jokes from time to time... They're usually dry and to the point. Always some truth in them. I can laugh with them because I always agree, but I would cry if I were the one being joked about.
2	I am, but I lucked out, and people seem to 90% just think I'm hilarious, if you know me well enough though you can tell when I'm being an asshole.\n\n
1	TAGPROOOO BUDDY I RECOGNIZE YOU
6	What's your opinion of N-types? (ENFPs, INFPs, ENTPs, etc.)	And which is your favorite N type personality?\n
2	INTJ and ENFJ, but only as friends or family members, especially the latter since they tend to be very hurtful when they no longer have an interest in you by simply ignoring you without saying anything and actually thinking it's the kind thing to do. \n
3	My opinions on everyone are more or less unformed. I believe every type had good and bad. If I had to pick a type of N I particularly enjoy it would be INTP. I've worked with a few and they are Incredibly complimentary personalities.
6	I keep testing as ESTJ, but I feel more like ISTJ or even IIFJ at times, especially ISTJ.	Like I said in the title, I keep testing as ESTJ, but I feel more like ISTJ or even IIFJ. I read the descriptions, and they do seem to fit.\n\n>ESTJs are responsible, logical, norm-following hard workers. Their efforts are carried out in a practical, structured manner. ESTJs trust facts and experiences more than theories. They are decisive, loyal, tradition observing individuals. They enjoy being the person in charge and often make good supervisors.\n\nI fit that very well. I am listed as promotable very often in reviews at work even, and I feel I lead well. Still, I think I am more introverted. I was only 51% extroverted versus 49% introverted anyway. Outside of work, social events with a lot of talking put strain on me, but I don't like being the quiet one either. I feel awkward if I am the quiet one and find ways to make conversation even though I feel more comfortable being around someone I care about silently. I don't like being alone, but I enjoy silent time. I'd just walk or watch TV in silence with someone I care about or am close with; I don't mind listening, but I'd rather observe than speak.\n\nI like having friends even though all my close friends only talk to me online anymore. I moved away from most of them, and it has been hard for me to make lasting connections in my area. \n\nI am very intuitive, too. I figure things out on the fly, adapting quickly. Everyone comes to me for thinking outside of the box. I predict things so well that my fiancee likes to make fun of me calling me a psychic. I can tell her how people will act or even what will happen in a TV show. I enjoy watching a TV through to prove that I was right in my assumptions. My fiancee doesn't understand it. She asks me why I watch something if I know what is going to happen. I tell her I just like being right and laugh.\n\nI am very emotional too. I have trouble going to therapy, but I always want to talk about my feelings with someone I am close to until I feel like I have unloaded and can be comfortably silent again. I have a history of abuse from a female teenage babysitter, and I have had toxic relationships and been cheated on a bunch of times. I wonder if that has more to do with me feeling, but I can also be a bit of an emotional sponge. It seems like I can predict and feel what others are feeling at times. I have trouble watching very awkward scenes on TV because I can literally feel the awkwardness the character is going through as they go through it... same thing even in person if I see an awkward personal situation go down.\n\nAnyone else here get similar impressions of themselves?
1	I can't offer too much help here, other than telling you, I have an ESTJ uncle, and an ISTJ father, who are seriously living stereotypes of their MBTI type, and you don't sound like either of them.\n\nI'm guessing you aren't extraverted. I'm thinking probably ISTJ, but not entirely sure. You could by a shy-ish ESTJ, or either ESFJ/ISFJ. To really get at the core of what MBTI is, you should learn how each function presents itself. So, one by one, Google Se, Te, Ti, etc, and see how they match up with your experience. This is a great way of understanding yourself a little better. \n\nPersonality tests are extremely superficial. In my instance, I am an INFP, but I would be a fool to say there is not a logical answer to everything/most things. For a long time, I was thrown off by the questions themselves. \n\nGood luck, PM me or reply here if you need further help.
1	Have you heard of Ambiversion? It's a "type" between Extraversion and Introversion. You probably fit that description, I know I do. check out /r/ambivert Each of the 4 traits (e/i, s/n, f/t, p/j) is on a scale so it's important to recognize that also you might be VERY Extraverted, feeling and judging, your s/n letter might change based on the day of the week because you might fit both at different specific times! :)
6	Ivanka Trump, a good example of the ESTJ temperament	
1	Interviewer smirks too much. She must tickle "his fancy"
2	Mind helping me out?	Im an ENFJ who fell for a ESTJ last summer.  Didn't tell her how I felt cause I thought sharing my emotions would make her uncomfortable.  Also we would have had to do a long distance relationships because we were both going back to college.  \n\nMy friends always joke that I live the plot to Grease lolz  \n\nThe real question is, how do I express my emotions/interests without making her uncomfortable, etc.\n\nThis conversation is finally happening a year later, which is obviously not ideal but I was really worried that she would be put-off by me verbalizing what I felt.\n\nI thank you in advance for any input into how non-Fs deal with emotional discussions such as these!
1	I say just go for it.
1	I don't have the best perspective on this, since I am a man. But I can say as an ESTJ, I appreciate direct and to the point emotional conversations. Something simple but earnest and from the heart like: "hey X, I just want to say I really like you and feel like you're a great person. Would you like to go out sometime?" Obviously I don't know the entirety of your situation but if you speak open and honestly an ESTJ would likely appreciate the directness.
1	Talk about actions and desires more than feelings. Simple, but hope it helps.\n\nFor me, the impact of someone's emotions is more relevant than the emotions themselves. 
1	Both ENFJs and ESTJs I know like things straight-forward. ENFJs like things to be said a little softer; ESTJs like things to be said a little more sincerely.
6	How do you feel about INFJs?	Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a female INFJ and have been in a relationship with an ESTJ in the past. It was by far the best connection I've ever had, and I still miss him from time to time... If curious, I've written about my recent thoughts on my ESTJ ex in the INFJ subreddit.\n\nWhat are your impressions/thoughts on INFJ women in general?
4	I'd like to think that I have a high opinion of INFJs, considering I married one.  I think, generally, we compliment each other pretty well.  My extroverted side can exhaust her introverted side at times though.  I also feel my natural, knee jerk inclination to step in and "do" what needs to be done can be at odds with her more patient approach and desire to get things exactly right.  I tell people it's like what happens when the unstoppable force meets an immovable object. :p
2	They can make decisions for all the wrong reasons?\n\nJust kidding.  I married one and we balance each other out wonderfully. \n\nLots of judging happens, though. Stuff gets done. 
1	Im supposedly and INFJ female, and my husband is supposedly ESTJ. If I had to guess at what he thinks of me, an INFJ woman, based on what he's said:\n\nHe admires that I have me feelings and beliefs and stick to them. I always criticize myself for getting a philosophy degree, but he says its one of his favorite things about me - because I did what I loved, not what I should have done.\n\nHe always says he loves that I have a kind/good heart. I dont know where he gets this because I think Im awfully cynical, but thats a big one for him.\n\nHe is always telling me to be more decisive and assertive, and that I need to work on my confidence and ability to converse with people I dont know. And communicate in general.\n\nHe struggles with my inability to take criticism well, and that my emotions can be more powerful than my reason. Which I acknowledge.\n\nI dont know if this helps you, but this is my anecdotal answer! If we are typed right, this is what a particular M-ESTJ thinks of a particular F-INFJ.
-4	sorry to burst your bubble but if youre an INFJ with an ESTJ one of you is probably typed wrong :x considering the rarity of INFJ type it probably makes more sense youre an INFP. 
1	How strict are you (Te Dominants) with yourself when it comes to setting rules?	I'm wondering how true this feels to all of you? Would you provide some examples if so?\n\n> Much of the extraverted thinkers‚Äô effectiveness stems from their willingness to issue as strict orders to themselves as to anyone else. They stake out their objectives well in advance and put a lot of systematic effort into reaching them on schedule. At their best, they turn an unsparing eye upon their own conduct and revise whatever does not come up to standard.\n\n-- Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type (Chapter 9, paragraph 14)\n\n\nAlso posted to /r/entj - http://redd.it/3gmhdy
2	I take responsibilities so seriously that when outside influences change how I planned something might go I adjust quickly, inwardly beating myself up at the same time, but still.. I think constantly wanting to be liked and seen as competent makes for this rule following strength. I'm also able to prioritize really well. My boss seems to appreciate it. For example, an aspect of my job is driving people to a lot of different destinations on the fly. I get asked spontaneously to go to places I haven't been to in a few months. I'm super goal oriented so I like this. It makes me feel extremely good when I've accomplished what was asked of me in an ever changing job.
2	When someone breaks my time line I get pretty angry. Tardiness is something that just gets me and my friends are always tardy.
1	Goals are for losers; systems are for winners.\n\nhttp://blog.dilbert.com/post/102965026826/goals-are-for-losers-passion-is-bull\n\nIn some ways, this conflicts with the excerpt, but in some ways it matches. 
8	What's your favorite and least favorite function?	
6	Not a bit fan of the "1/x" function... There's not real practical use for it at all.
33	Bwahaha I am an invading INFP	Fear my wrath!!\n\nWe are opposites and therefore arch nemeses!!
10	... Actually ESTJs usually respect healthy INFPs quite a bit compared to other types. INFPs tend to wear a belt and stand up straight. :) 
8	I like INFP's....And ISFP....INTPs.... To be honest I think everyone is pretty worthwhile unless they're lazy fucks.
5	My boss is an ESTJ and we get along great. His Te motivates me to get things done, and um...I tell him how people feel. :D\nI think the key to a successful INFP/ESTJ relationship is respect. If both parties respect each other and give each other grace and space, then it works out. 
6	7 hours and no response.\n\nThey've clearly all preemptively surrendered. 
2	We band together as one! I am also here to invade!
1	I'm an invading ENTP mwahahaha
5	What are some differences between you guys and entp's?	So I'm an entp, and lately I've been trying to type my father,  but I can't tell if he's an entj or entj, what are some differences in how you guys act and how. An entj would act?
3	[deleted]
1	An ENTJ would be  commanditive. ENTJ is more like you have to do this and this and if you don't I won't be happy. Meanwhile an ENTP would cricize you 7 times as much , but would ultimately leave the decision to you. Even if you didn't do what he sees as correct he wouldn't rage on you, unless it was completely illogical.\n \nIs that simple enough for you to understand?
6	What's up ESTJ's i'm a ENTJ and curious about some of the differences between our neighboring types	sorry if this question has already been asked before i'm new to the mbti subreddits
3	[Here's a good summary](http://www.preludecharacteranalysis.com/types/entj/vs/estj)
1	that was perfect thank you jukeboxhero i really liked learning how compatible we are in general but especially in a work environment. thanks man.
0	Kik chat for ESTJs	sup :P\n\nwe made a kik chat at #estj if you guys want to chat sometimes. i'm an esfj and some of the rooms seem kinda scarce. i promised to advertise and i chat regularly in them 
7	Relationships with INFPs?	Have any of you been in romantic relationships with INFPs? We are duals and it doesn't seem like an uncommon match. What do you like about INFPs?
4	I am an INFP.\nGoing through some turmoil with the SO right about now. Can't see eye to eye. I want to talk about feelings, he wants to talk about the concrete facts and logistics of things. Looking for answers here too, haha.\nWe're going to have to compromise. Both feeling as if the other isn't hearing what the other is saying: feelings turned into misrepresented, cold logistics, and logical facts being  interpreted into biased feelings.\n\nIt sucks balls. It really sucks. I don't know, there's a silver lining. I feel that we're able to be better after overcoming this obstacle together-better people, better relationship, and have a stronger understanding with one another. I feel like we're halfway out of our current storm.\nWe'll see how it goes.\n\nUpdate:\nFor anyone who cares to know, we got over it.\n\nIn my case, I had to explain how I felt and what my true intentions were. I let my SO know what was going in my mind exactly without dusting off the grit of it and tried to calm my emotions, speaking calmly, whilst doing it (if not, you'll probably scare off the other person lol). Honestly, in this case you can't fight fire with fire. I guess what I learned through this is that you should always try to understand and hear out the true feelings of your SO and to present your feelings in a way they'd understand. Help them overcome this fear of showing an extravagant amount of emotions and try to get that break through heart to heart.
5	My current SO is INFP and it's definitely difficult at times but I'm extremely forthright so I usually just blatantly tell him what I need. He does not do this often enough but he's trying... so far I love his dreamer and spontaneous personality because I need more of that in my life!
4	I am a INFP, married to a ESTJ for ten years. Happily, I think :)
2	INFPs and ENFPs are generally very strong with empathy. They form strong emotional connections with a partner, and sex should be solid as long as the emotional component is strong.\n\nI recently ended a long-term relationship with an INFP, and it was tough not seeing eye to eye on some things. INFPs are known as dreamers, and sometimes they'll be lost in the clouds when you want to get things done/fix something concrete.\n\nThey've got some decent potential for spontaneity which is a good balance for strong Js.
6	ESTJs Needed: Personality and Sleep Patterns Survey	edit: I need ESTJs the most! Only 5 have taken the test (less than 1% of all participants), meaning that I need 25 more before before I can begin analyzing. Thanks guys!\n\nHello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!
2	ESTJ here. Just completed the survey. 
1	am I too late?
6	ESTJs, what are your favorite TV shows?	Feel free to explain why, or not, if that's not your thing.\n\nIf you don't like TV, what are your other favorite forms of entertainment?
6	Anything non-formulaic.  As soon as I see the pattern in the episodes I know I have 2-3 more episodes left before I get bored and completely drop it.
4	Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel, Pushing Daisies, 30 Rock, Portladia, Arrested Development, Gilmore Girls, etc. \n\nI typically like shows that are original, creative, and non-formulaic. 
3	Bones is top 1
3	My preference goes to comedy, and the more unexpected the better. I hate predictable stuff. \n\nMy fav shows are Xavier Renegade Angel, The Eric Andr√© Show, Louie, Regular Show, The Thick of It, My Name is Earl, The Mighty Boosh, Doctor Who, WLIIA, and The IT Crowd. 
2	The shows I currently enjoy watching are Bates Motel, Penny Dreadful, Once Upon a Time, Pretty Little Liars (though it can be infuriating), and Adventure Time.\n\nI don't think I can narrow down what my favorite movies would be. I don't normally like romantic comedies, some stupid comedies, and really, any movie that was poorly made (due to the writing, the directing, etc. whatever the reason may be.)\n\nMy favorite authors are Stephen King and V.C. Andrews. I like reading thriller and suspenseful novels, and novels that are really dark and twisted/fucked up.
2	I love tv. My faves are the Mindy project, Portlandia, Louie, orphan black, flight of the Concords (miss this one), dr who, impractical jokers, always sunny in Philadelphia. 
2	Comedy, I love Modern Family, The Office, Community, Arrested Development etc
2	Not a big fan of TV anymore. I used to enjoy shows like Friends and Seinfeld. Before I cut the chord, the only show I would watch with some regularity was the Daily Show. I find myself more interested in science minded documentaries these days. And popcorn action flicks, cant forget about those. Explosions are always cool.
2	Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Captain Picard is a xSTJ, right?  Love it.\n\nThe show puts on a front of being N and P, but in the end it is S and J for sure.
2	Walking dead, The Office, Modern Family. Mostly comedy, but some drama if its not over the top.\n
2	[deleted]
1	Entourage, ray Donovan, weeds, game of thrones, silicon valley, sons of anarchy, breaking bad

6	I feel like I am striving to be somebody I am not	Is it normal for an ESTJ to dislike their own type? I mean I really dislike the idea of being an ESTJ (I just hate the idea of it), however there is no doubt that I am one. One thing I love, however, is that we pair with INFJ's and that makes me really happy. Can anybody else relate?\n\nI just hate the rigidness, the organisation, the lack of versatility that comes with ESTJ. I strive to be imaginative, abstract, creative, intuitive. But now that I have learned about MBTI I feel like that the things I am trying to make myself are all just a lie and I am only fooling myself by pursuing them.\n\nI also think that I should not let MBTI dictate what I do in my life, but I really strive for perfection and do not want to be working in the wrong direction. I suppose I should just continue as if I was unaware that I am an ESTJ and trust that life will naturally pull me towards my correct path?
6	Continue on not caring or putting any weight into your MTBI results.\n\nSeriously.\n\nThe test measured what you were on a particular day at a particular time.  I switch between ENTJ/ESTJ/ISTJ depending on the day.  \n\nYou do you, don't let four letters define you.
1	I feel the same way, especially with the negative view of ESTJS on reddit.. I am an ESTJ and sometimes wish to be otherwise.\n\nCan't believe u said ESTJS and INFJ pair well! I agree, my girlfriend is INFJ and we are great, despite all the negative research that claims we are the worst fit possible. Agree with all u wrote
0	Who did you marry?	I met an ESTJ a month or so go and as an ISTJ she was just very hard to deal with. I enjoyed talking to her but she was very stubborn and down right rude and disrespectful. Granted she was much wiser than me in alot of things and in areas she wasnt she just played it off as if it didnt matter (ugh!).\nLol anyway my question to you is who the heck would marry one of u and actually be happy?
8	Most of my LTR have been INFP. And you're a very rude and condescending person, apparently - maybe that's the problem. 
6	I'm engaged to an INTJ. We fight semi-often, but we quickly get over it and we love each other to death. 
3	You guys share the same functions, you're pretty much mirror images of each other. Sounds like a personal problem.
2	This is hilarious coming from an ISTJ. Dude, looking at us is like looking at yourself if you were an extrovert. 
3	I have been married to an ISTP for 13 years. We love each other deeply. We compliment each other in the best ways. I don't even know what to say, it's just perfect.
1	I'll add that I'm being serious as I am curious to know who would match well.
1	I married an ISFP
10	ESTJ's, why such a quiet sub?	I've been following this group for a while now, and it's incredibly quiet here.\nWhy do you think that is?  Is this a quirk of the ESTJ type that realizes that online interaction isn't all that great, or is there something else?\n\n
13	Im infj. My dad is estj. I don't know about other estjs but my dad would think its a waste of time to analyse himself and talk about his personality. In his opinion, he is what he is. Done. When he goes online, its to read interesting articles that he can talk about to his multitude of friends and sound knowledgable, or to look at cars/boats/bikes, or to watch funny videos and laugh obnoxiously loud. He is very interesting to analyse for me, though, and i love him. 
4	I am an ESTJ and am very interested in this stuff. Ive taken the test 4 times over 7 or 8 years and am always ESTJ, I answer honestly, and agree with about 80 percent of the analysis... my question is why does EVERYONE on the relationship page despise ESTJ...? Ive been fortunate with dating, and tend to gravitate towards NFs. my current and last girlfriends were and are INFJ and ENFP.. curious as to why this is
4	Personal experience, ESTJs usually hate this stuff. They don't want somebody telling them what they think they already know. Obviously not all of them, but generally speaking. Te/Si makes for a pretty stubborn person.
3	Get back to work.
3	I need more ESTJ for my next Watson analysis.	I'm in the process of developing a more advanced analysis than [the one I provided](http://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2r2uix/an_analysis_of_the_myersbrigg_subreddit_comments/). It will be based on people global reddit activity and take into account their type. \n\nIf you posted in /r/MBTI and your flair is set, I already got you in my database. Otherwise, please set your flair and post here. My script will find you that way. As a bonus, I will provide everyone that made it into my database their own graph comparing them to other redditors of their type.

3	Retired ESTJs	Hello ESTJs nice to meet you all! I have a step-father and suspect he may be an ESTJ. He's well into his retirement and I wondered if any of you on here were retired or might be able to comment on your experiences with other retired ESTJs.\n\nThe reason for asking is that primarily he's lazy and I thought ESTJs weren't lazy! I wondered if it was just down to age though. He does contribute and stick his nose into what others are doing almost in the supervisory sense (as I would expect) but generally just sits about and falls asleep in his chair! :P\n\nIn addition to this, while I can 'get along' with him, this can apparently only be accomplished by direct effort on my part. He is unable to see the world from my point of view and is very set in his ways. \n\nHe also doesn't ever play the feeling card; is this typical even of an older ESTJ? Does Fi not develop and manifest later in life to the point where  he might be able to reflect sympathetically on a person or situation? Is it just him?
4	ENTP dating ESTJ	To be quite honest, I've looked around the internet and haven't seen much talk about this pairing. Can anyone shed some light on this dynamic, and maybe share personal experiences?
7	I am with an ESTJ. We drive each other crazy. And often not in a good way. Of course, we've been together over a decade, so that says something too.\n\nI find he keeps me grounded, and makes me step back and rethink some of my crazy ideas - if he can tolerate listening to them. Sometimes he shuts me down too fast. The idea of changing something makes him stressed, even when nothing has changed yet. \n\nWe discovered it was best to clearly communicate when I was just "thinking" and when I was actually wanting to implement something. Also, we had to learn to communicate clearly when either of us had committed to something. Sometimes, he would think we'd made a plan, and I thought we were just brainstorming. ;)\n\nAll in all, it has been both a good and bad pairing. I sometimes wish I had someone who was more willing to be flexible and dive deep into interesting subjects with me - but I have friendships that help me to accomplish that. He is solid. Like, totally dependable. He is my rock, and I have learned to appreciate the benefits of discipline and stability (even when they are *thrust* upon me). He has learned to lighten up, and I have helped soften his rough edges - especially with relationships with other people.\n\nThat's just a smidgen of insight, but we are evidence the pairing can work. Many people have admired our relationship, as there has been a lot (LOT) of give and take, but it's more iron sharpening iron. You just have to be willing to accept and appreciate the differences, because if you wanted to, you could focus on the negatives and get in a mire pretty quickly.\n\nSide note: Unfortunately, NT and NFs tend to dominate the internet forums related to Myers Briggs. (I think the SPs are out actually living life, and the SJs are out making sure they're doing it correctly without killing themselves...) Because of that, you'll find quite a bit of 'S' bashing - and especially SJ since they are practically the exact opposite of NTs in many ways. This is unfortunate, since SJs are the ones that have the patience and discipline to follow through with the day to day realities of life and help keep and restore order when our crazy ideas don't quite materialize in the way we anticipated. ;)\n
5	I've got an ESTJ friend. He's pretty much a big swingin' penis all the time but he's also willing to take criticism which is always a good thing. It seems the best way we get along is through building off of the others views on people/society.\n\nThen again, we're two straight guys so I don't know how much my input applies. I THINK we're straight anyway. I tend to attract either gender and if he really wanted to, I guess I'd poke his hackeysack. 
2	I'm super late to the party, but hey.\n\nMy ENTP boyfriend is the most unexpected, wonderful thing honestly. We balance each other very well. Then again, I have this weird subconscious thing for ENTP's. My best friend, ex boyfriend, and current boyfriend are ENTP's, and my ex girlfriend is an ENTJ. I like sniff them out or something lol.\n\nAnyways, as far as good things go:\n\nENTP's get really deeply excited about things, which is good, because ESTJ's often feel silly expressing that sort of thing so it gives us permission to let loose.\n\nENTP's are very creative, and ESTJ's can thrive off of this by putting their ideas into actions and helping to trim and shape them.\n\nENTP's are never boring to be around, and are generally down for socializing, although they need more introvert time than we do.\n\nESTJ's are ENTP rocks. Treat one well, care for them, help them plan, and the ENTP will always do right by you. ESTJ's are extremely reliable, which is great, because ENTP's tend to be less stable.\n\nPotential problems:\n\nENTP's /do not/ plan. Like, hardly ever. This can be stressful.\n\nENTP's and ESTJ's can both be bery awkward in outward expressions of emotion until that barrier is broken, although I think ENTP's less so.\n\nIt can be difficult for the ESTJ to understand the ENTP sometimes, because they're off in weird intuitive land and we're trying to keep up. They also have a terrible habit of half smirking 24/7 which is hard to interpret until you've been with them long enough.\n\nENTP's might find a more strict ESTJ a buzzkill, so that relationship won't go anywhere.\n\nMany ESTJ's have a huge pet peeve for people not putting in their share of the work. ENTP's have a nasty habit of procrastinating and just plain shirking their work, and this may drive an ESTJ up the wall.\n\nOverall, I love my partner, I wouldn't want anyone else, but tbh I'm not sure this pairing is for everyone. Treasure your ENTP's though, guys.
1	To fellow ENTPs who are already finding friction with ESTJs, wondering what's going on: Turn back now.
1	ENTP married to an ESTJ (with ENTJ tendencies) here. We argue a lot. Most of the time it isn't even because we're angry with each other; we just have very strong differing opinions and have to intellectually duke it out until one of us admits the other is right. Don't be afraid of the arguments as long as they are respectful and yielding productive results.\n\nWhich is one great thing about an ESTJ--they have the stamina to argue the point and the graciousness and logic to concede when incorrect (I try to do the same).\n\nSomething that pisses me off is--as another redditor pointed out--even the suggestion of change to their plans is enough to get them all bent out of shape. LAME!\n\nBut another great thing is their ability to take care of day-to-day details. I am notoriously terrible at stupid things like getting paperwork turned in on time, taking out trash, etc. My ESTJ spouse keeps my life running! We often joke that I'd be living under a bridge somewhere if I weren't married to him.\n\nWe've finally reached a point where we're learning to meet each other in the middle for many things, but it wasn't always that way. We broke up several times before we decided to nut up about our differences and take the plunge. 
4	INFP seeking ESTJs to answer research questionnaire on personality trait clusters & correlations!	Like taking personality tests? I need research participants to take a bunch of them and answer a long questionnaire! I‚Äôm posting to this subreddit specifically because I need more ESTJs to take the survey, since last I checked only one or two ESTJs had taken it.\n\n**[Questionnaire link](http://research.rujic.net/index.php/survey/index?sid=91844&lang=en)**  \n*The whole thing could take several hours to complete. Please register for a user account so your responses will be backed up in case you accidentally lose them or can‚Äôt finish in one sitting. "Resume Later" button is at bottom of first page. (NOTE: Users have reported a bug on the last page; please scroll all the way to the right to submit your results.)*\n\n**Research context:** I'm writing a book about personality, pathology, states and spectrums of consciousness, the art+autism connection, comics, and [a bunch of other stuff](http://dondepresso.rujic.net). The book, [Don Depresso, Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS)](http://dondepresso.rujic.net/post/88499134800/comic-books-and-personality-research#.VEWdaEHSkaU), will include analysis and discussion of the data I collect from this questionnaire.\n\n**Research goals:** I want to connect various, disparate personality frameworks that already exist as well as add my own scales to measure traits that don't appear on any well-known personality tests to date. I'm especially interested in identifying patterns of human behavior and frequently clustered traits using a descriptive approach that remains independent of cultural constructs of pathology‚Äîso I'll be looking at characteristics associated with mental disorders as well as those considered "normal" variations.\n\nFor more info and to stay updated, join the [3D Spectral Cluster(fuck) Personality Theory Research Pool](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3dspectralcluster/) group on Facebook.\n\nThanks for your time (and data)!\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is not a formal, peer-reviewed study. I named it "3D Spectral Cluster(fuck) Personality Theory‚Äù for a reason. I‚Äôm a comic artist who‚Äôs obsessed with psychology, not a professional psychologist.
2	If you posted this to /r/mbti, then I'm not surprised you didn't get many of us. Unfortunately, we are the minority over there :/. I promise I will start on this tomorrow (I'm working all day today).
1	Would it be cool if I get around to it hopefully in a few days? 
1	is this still a thing? i can't open the link anymore :(
4	ENTJ here. What have been your experiences with ENTJs?	Just curious. I'm learning more about MBTI, and am curious how Extraverted Thinking manifests itself in ENTJ-ESTJ interactions. I want to understand the Te and realized I don't have any ESTJ friends. Who can share some experiences with me? \n\nThank you!
3	what would you like to know? :P unfortunately i might not be the best for you because i am a strong ETJ but waffle between N and S. in general i can tell i'm interacting with one vs. the other based on how frustrated i become with what they talk about. if i'm talking to an N, i can tell i'm very S when they start talking about these glorious ideas and i just am like whoa honey, lets come back down to earth and deal with what's happening now. and then if i'm talking to an S, i become very N when they are obsessing over even the slightest imperfections of something.\n\noverall, i love being an extraverted thinker though! WE'RE THE BEST ;D
1	[deleted]
7	What do you think of INFPs?	So I'm an INFP. If you hang out in any infp group, there's destined, nay, fated to be some ESTJ bashing from time to time. We call you anything from robots to ants to unfeeling Jerks who take pleasure in kicking puppies. Seriously, we can be a spiteful bunch! \n\nAnyways, I've got to wonder what you estjs think about us. Are we special little snowflakes? Are we crybabies? Are we just plain ungrounded in reality? Well... I guess we are all three actually. \n\nSo.... Be  brutal. And  note that while I tease, when I've actually known an ESTJ, they've actually been cool people. 
4	Not an ESTJ, but I had the fun of observing the ESTJ/INFP dynamic between my dad and one of my best friends.\n\nMy dad (the ESTJ; ESTJs are like the perfect Dad stereotype) distrusted the INFP as a matter of principle, because the INFP was trying to date his daughter (my sister.) However, after the ESTJ had known the INFP for a while, he began to see him as a good guy. They didn't have a whole lot in common, but they liked and respected each other. I think a huge factor in this was that my dad is the only S in a family of Ns, and married to a really strong I. This gave him an ability to appreciate the INFP where other ESTJs might have blown the INFP off as unfocused, undisciplined, or otherwise worthless.\n\nMy INFP friend's relationship with my sister ended, but whenever we talk and reminisce about my family, he tells me, "I miss talking to your dad the most. I never knew what he was thinking."
6	Popping in to say that I'm an INFP (happily, most of the time) married to an ESTJ. We kind of balance each other out? But annoy one another probably a lot of the time :D 
1	Pussies
2	My relationship with other types	
5	As an ENFJ, I am ambivalent about the description. The first part is right, we are hard workers, don't tolerate bullshit and are fast paced. In a "get things done" perspective, I enjoy working with ESTJs. You will keep on your commitments, and will work hard towards what needs to be done. There is some room for humour as well, which is nice.\n\nHowever, I have yet to meet an excellent ESTJ boss. At worse, ESTJs are micromangers, and at best, they are managers. While very good at creating a "game plan" (that must be derived from a very concrete framework), all ESTJs I know are poor at inspiring leadership and have very little vision. Also very likely to kill innovation from workers because they hate "insubordination", "it isn't the way things should be done" or because they don't want to appear incompetent. 
2	Given it's one person's perspective, this isn't actually that bad. Although, as an INTP, I want to claim that we solved the bottom-of-the-food-chain problem by getting out of the food chain. Most of the MBTI humour stuff *does* have us as goalpost-movers.
1	This made me laugh because basically he says ESTJs can't get along with anyone for any length of time. Some he dismisses right out of the gate, others he states can handle for a brief time (maybe), and yet others he starts out liking but basically says the relationship is doomed. Is this typical of most ESTJs???
4	ENFJ girl here, dating an ESTJ. I need someone to clue me in on the way you guys think...	As said, I'm an ENFJ and I'm a highly emotional/feeling type of person. I've been dating someone (for 6 months) who is similar to me in so many ways, EXCEPT for the fact that he's a thinker. \n\nSometimes he doesn't appear to have much empathy, but I understand that's just how he is. However, what I find difficult is knowing what he's thinking, because it's most likely the polar opposite to what I think/feel. And I wonder, do ESTJ's actually feel much? (Legit stupid question...sorry) or is it all logic and reason? When I ask him he tells me he thinks with logic and reason...but I literally just don't understand that! So I thought maybe someone here could explain it better, because I'm really curious to get a better idea of how you guys 'think' and how you experience feelings!\n\nThanks :)
3	agreeing with all of the above. i'm a STRONG T so i've even met other T's who are too "f" for me. i am constantly told that i can be intimidating or cold. i can see why, but i don't think that that's the case. i also dont think that we "don't feel anything" because i actually tend to feel perhaps overwhelming feelings sometimes. the difference is that the way we process the world, think, make decisions, is we do it based on rational things alone (not feelings). for example, approaching a court case or something. for all the world, i might feel bad for the victim in the situation. however, if i think they honestly broke the law, then i'm going to convict them regardless of how bad i feel about the guy. that's just how i roll. (and you know how us ESTJs love the law... haha)\n\nanyway, my best advice for you when reaching out and communicating with your guy is to just remember that we DO have feelings, we just prefer not to use them as a way to make choices/decide things. i feel frustrated when people always tell me i'm heartless because it's not the case at all, and i just wish more "F types" could understand that. Also, if you ever want your guy to do things or to see things your way in an argument, it's almost useless to try to reach out and appeal to their feeling side. its always better to give a good, well-formulated argument with thought-out reasons. :) i hate being "wrong" but if you can give me good, real, rational reasons for your way of thinking, i respect that enough that i will switch sides.
2	I'd like to help you, but I have absolutely no idea what you didn't understand, so I don't know what I have to explain. Care to develop? 
1	I'm an ESTJ and sometimes it can look like i'm a bit cold and uncaring but often that isn't the case at all it just means that you take feelings out of the equation and look and things rationally.
-1	ESTJ's don't think they are just Lil sheep who follow the system. They are also the most common type so their hardly special.

3	Thanks for this
3	I'm an ESTJ with not many friends. Is that normal?	Actually the only friend I talk to on a regular (hell even a monthly) basis is my boyfriend (he's an ISTJ, so we fight a lot). Is this typical? I though that ESTJs have a lot of friends.
6	Some people think ESTJ's sound like assholes and are insensitive. Watch what you say even if it sounds good in your head.
4	I don't have many friends. Many of my peers are not on the same line as me. I value education, or any opportunities that will better me. They wanna talk about drinking, fucking or just boring shit. 
1	Why do you think ISTJ and ESTJ would fight a lot?  You should both value logical conversation that is largely grounded in past practice.  Perhaps that has just become *your* pattern that you need to break out of.  \n\nI would expect an ESTJ to have a few really strong friends and probably comfortable going to bars and concerts and meeting people.  
1	I don't have loads of friends, I more have a few close friends I keep in touch with. Not so into having loads of superficial friends.
5	For those of you with INFPs in your life: How do ESTJs interact with them? How can they ease relations with you and vice-versa?	I'm an INFP, and my dad is an ESTJ. So, really, we're polar opposites. I live with him, and this provides a lot of friction. You guys know your type best, so how can I improve relations with my dad?\n\nNote: I'm not looking for specific advice, like a therapist or family counselor could provide. Just... general stuff to get along better with your type. Thank you so much!
9	Whoa. I am an INFP and I literally just (like an hour ago) forced my dad to take the test and he got ESTJ. And then I came here to figure out why I don't get along with him. ARE YOU ME?
4	I am an INFP and my twin brother is an ESTJ. We get along great because he's a great support system to have. He's always been the type to help me out (financially) and just goof around with. We clash on our beliefs all the time though, just yesterday we had a huge argument about whether or not graffiti was art (totally is). When we have heart-to-heart conversations, I usually can always tell what he's feeling/trying to tell me. Our difference in personalities works for us. I'm grateful for him and I'm sure he appreciates me as well. 
2	Hmm, my ex-best friend is an ESTJ. I learned from our failed friendship that neither of us were wrong, but that we really do care about COMPLETELY different things.\n\nESTJs value efficiency and regulation. In my experience, they're good at the social aspect of life if they choose to be because people are attracted to them due to their confidence and blunt honesty. Others hang onto them like a big tree trunk if we all lived in a metaphorical flood and wanted to stay socially afloat (sorry, INFP metaphors... >.>)\n\nShe's always the one nagging people to do chores at home (I live with her and several other friends) and she's always the first one to deliver a negative judgment about someone. She delivers both of these things in a very critical tone, but it blew my mind that she's really not trying to hurt people when she does these things. She is just really focused on categorizing things, being successful in life, creating the "best" situation possible, etc. She's the moderator of the household, telling us when we err at chores or violate a social norm - if noone did that, the sink would be full of dishes for weeks at a time. They are masters of keeping order and pushing for improvement in a practical manner.\n\nThat said, they're not really thinking a whole lot about valuing people's self-realization and personal growth and feelings and whatnot. I guess that's what we're for... hooray INFPs. =p
3	Thought you may enjoy, over at /r/INTP there is a post about compatability between INTP and ENTJ and ESTJ personalities - tag your type and join in! (x-post)	http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1p4yjb/apparently_entjs_and_estjs_are_the_best_matches/
3	ENFP Relationship	Ayo!  Male ENFP here.  I recently just got into a relationship with an ESTJ and I realized that she is exactly the opposite of me.  It's painfully obvious in our conversations yet somehow, I enjoy it so much.  I literally have her figured out to the point of all I have to do is think the opposite of what I'd normally say/do and bam!  that's what she's thinking/doing.  Obviously this is not to say that you are a simple bunch ;)\nBut my real question is have any of you ever been in a relationship with an ENFP and if so, what would you say are some tips to make it work?  
5	My mom is an ESTJ and my dad was ENFP.  Also, 4 of my best friends over the course of my life have been male ENFP's.  I'm an ISTP, and we have an excellent cognitive relationship.\n\nThe same is true with you and an ESTJ.  You guys are activity partners in socionics terms, meaning that your top two functions are her bottom two and vice versa.  So inasmuch as you guys are very different, you can communicate quite effortlessly, and literally complete each other, cognitively.\n\nThe key would be to allow yourselves and each other to be who you are and  benefit each other.  She'll provide structure and data and logic that you have a harder time seeing, and you'll show her possibilities, help her get in touch with her values, and help her go with the flow a bit more.  \n 
5	Things ESTJs say	Saw this in r/ENTP thread and thought it might get some interesting responses here. What are some unique things you think ESTJs say/think?
5	"Where is the manager?"\n\n"Why isn't this more organized?"\n\n"What's the plan of action?"
6	"It's just common sense."\n\n"Be smarter than what you're working with."

1	As the website is hosted on Google Apps, it might go temporarily unavailable every 24 hours (approx) for some time after their serving quota is met. It is rehosted everyday at 12:00 PM (IST) or 22:30 PM (PST) or 01:30 AM (EST) or 06:30 AM (GMT). Google will provide a message if that happens, but do come later to enter the data. \n\nThanks!
3	MBTI - as an ESTJ how do you use MBTI to enrich your life?	
2	Myers Briggs and Enneagram Correlation ‚Äì Why can MBTI types be multiple Enneagram types. The ESTJ (Part 1 of 16)	
1	Do any of you ESTJ's have strong academic interests?	I'm referring to fields like cognitive psycology or medicine or philosophy. I want to know if any of those fields interest you so much so that you labor to become somewhat of an authority in your peer group or beyond within your topic of interest.\n\nWhy am I interested? My father is ESTJ and he seems to not really care to learn about anything academic besides history. His only reading consists of war/mystery/crime fiction. 
2	I'm in Massage therapy, and while it's not exactly 'medicinal', it is very strong in pathology of diseases and interactions between massage and drugs in the body as well as Anatomy/Kinesthetics.
2	Have you always been ESTJ?	I took the test numerous times in high school and college and was always ISTJ, though barely an introvert as I got older (closer to E each time). When I took the test a few years ago, I came up as an ESTJ. Curious to know if anyone else here has shifted.
2	I was ENFP >> ESTP >> ESTJ
2	I went INTJ -> ENTJ -> ESTJ.\n\nI've been an N for so long; this S is weird! Welcome!~
1	ENTJ>ESTJ
1	First test (I can remember) came up with ESTJ, with S over N by about 1%. Since then, I have become more S (38%)

7	I am an INFP dating an ESTJ and I am wondering what some of you look for in a partner.	We have been together for 7 months and I want to continue to make this work.  I sometimes feel like I am not able to be myself, and at times I submit to her ESTJness and supress the real me.  She does love me very dearly and I really appreciate that. I find her extremely interesting because she is pretty much my opposite.  I am messy and spontaneous, she is organized to a T and very scheduled.  I am abstract and philosphical and she is very realistic and concrete. One of my biggest problems in the relationship is that I love to talk existential and she does not.  However, all of these citations of disagreement are merely from my perspective.  We have not discussed our differences.  I am under the impression that she "fakes" and pretends to be interested in my "lost and space" antics, however, I think she really trully does not understand.  I am afraid that the only reason we are together is that we are both very smart and investigative and we find one another to be extremely interesting.\n\nTLDR\n\nINFP male dating an ESTJ female. I feel like she doesnt really get me.  I want to make it work. Please help! Thanks 
3	All I can say is let her wear the pants in the relationship. I doubt you have a very assertive personality, but I would think that she does. If you're not alright with her dominance, you will need a way to assert your wants/needs where she takes them into consideration. If that doesn't happen, you'll have a rough time. 
5	I am a (very) ESTJ-oriented male and my girlfriend is a very introverted and reserved, quiet-type (I'll have her do the Jung test the /r/mbti sub recommends and edit later this evening; edit: ISFP). She is constantly challenging me in the creative ways to help me see when what I mistake for my own assertiveness could be gravitating towards being controlling. She balances with me well with her intelligent and empathetic, purposeful passive-agressiveness; often letting me figure out what it is I am doing that I would judge another person for. \n\nNote: I'm not a raging asshole or anything and I sorta just summed this all up in terms of the aggressive nature of many ESTJ's. Also, I just learned about all of this MBTI stuff from the /r/bestof thread on the front page. \n\nNote2: I am aware of the inaccuracy of internet tests. 
4	As a fellow INFP, unless you really really really love this girl run. We idealize relationships and I can guarantee you have attributed more attributes to her than she really has (goes for any relationship). To put it bluntly, can you picture yourself spending the rest of your life with someone who does not really attach importance to emotions like you do? In my experience the most important thing to an INFP is being understood and I hold the belief that XSTJ types are not able to fully understand us.\n\nI'd like to add that this doesn't mean I hate XSTJ types. I admire the sense of duty fulfillment XSTJs have. You can always depend on an XSTJ to come through. I just can't fathom the XSTJ mindset and I think it goes both ways.
2	What are fun things that ESTJs should do/would enjoy?	I just found out that I was 'ESTJ' from a test in school.... what are some fun things that I should do/try that "we" enjoy? Thanks!
3	As an estj I enjoy surrounding myself with individuals that are skilled in various fields with the aim of directing this talent to one coherent project. 
2	Sheep herding.
2	I also have a sweet tooth. I love activities that involve fitness. Anything from bike riding to wall climbing. I really like conversing on controversial topics over a glass of wine. 
2	What is your profession and how do you fit into the ESTJ type?	I'm a conservative Marine..who is sometimes seen as an asshole, but I just like doing things right.\n\nHow about you?
2	I am a healthcare fraud & abuse detection data analyst. I absolutely LOVE my job. It allows me to focus on finding people breaking the rules (which oddly satisfies me), sift through mountains of data to find patterns of fraud/abuse, and also present my findings in both written and verbal form. My job lets my brain do what it is intended to do, which is very satisfying. It does bring out my more introverted side (I'm only just slightly more extroverted than introverted), since I can get sucked into my work and not come up for air for a while, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
1	I'm a sales and service coordinator. Don't ask me what it means, I do just about every job in the office, including service, office management, shipping manager, sales, trade shows, customer service, vendor and distributor relations. 
2	Famous ESTJs	
3	Not to many of us fit the ESTJ model XD	Almost makes me want to retake the test again just to be sure I answered the questions correctly.\nI went here, http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp - Anyone got a better test?
2	I retook the test, there is no mistaking it, I am ESTJ >.>\n\nI was kinda hoping there would be some articles here which would help me change things, like in other subreddits.
1	A lot of ESTJs don't fit the ESTJ model because they are raised by liberals, N's or a combination of both.  ESTJs are famous for being ball busting conservatives. But if an ESTJ is raised in a Liberal household, they will be a product of that environment.  I am an ESTJ girl.  This is also hard to find research on as the type is dominated by men.  I hope this helps other confused ESTJs. Don't let stereotypes give us a bad rap!
