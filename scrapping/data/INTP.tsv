259	PSA: You are all moderators.	To start off, I *do* think link flair is a good idea and makes it easy to quickly identify the type of discussions you want to read.  This is something that I will work on this week.  \n\nEvery once in a while there's a flare up of people asking for hands on moderation.\n\nI've said this from the very start when I was brought on as a moderator to do garbage duty with the spam queue and to add to the sidebar:\n\nI really don't care to police content, nor do I think omfgninja does.  There is no reason to on reddit; that's literally the whole point of the site and the reason user voting is such a popular format for content/discussion on the internet for the past few years.  It allows everyone to feel a degree of control and relevance regardless of whether they participate or contribute directly.  Invariably the content which is most popular with the largest amount of people will be the most successful. \n\nIf it really bothers you that someone is shitposting, or saying something that really rambles your jambourines, all it takes is 5 of you to downvote it and then no one else will have to see those hurtful words on their computer monitors.\n\nIf there is obvious spam, report it and I will 9/10 times see it within a day.  That's the most control I would ever see necessary for a select few people to have over the content on a broad discussion subreddit like this.  Who am I or anyone else to decide what the thousands of active members like to see?  \n\nFor the record, I hate circlejerky PersonalityCafe-esque shitposts such as:\n\n* DAE THIS AN INTP THING?\n* DO ANY OTHER INTPS HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME BEING VERY SMART AND INTERACTING WITH OTHER HUMANS WHO ARE LESS SMART? \n* MAN I HATE HOW SMART AND LAZY I AM.  WHY AM I NOT MAKING $150k A YEAR YET?\n* WHAT IS OBJECTIVELY THE BEST CAREER FOR INTPS (ESPECIALLY ONES WHO ARE REALLY SMART BUT HATE DETAILS AND DISLIKE SOCIAL INTERACTION BUT LIKE LOGIC AND RATIONALITY)?\n\nThis type of shit is the worst on /r/INTJ.  It's not as bad here but it happens.  I still don't see any reason to remove it because if more people disliked it than it wouldn't have a positive score.  It really doesn't bother me to downvote something stupid and stop caring about it 10 seconds later.\n\ntl;dr: the moderation team here is literally fucking useless and don't even read the subreddit and just dont want to do any work.  i don't even think they have internet access.  honestly i hope they kill themselves IRL.  also, why am I not a moderator yet?  I read this subreddit LITERALLY more than anyone else, and one downvote isn't enough for me.  also, i called jungle in lobby and this guy instalocked without even saying anything WTF please all 9 report after game im way too sick of dealing with trolls in this game dude.  my teams always throw and i'd be like 5k mmr in dota, this game just has too many feeders.  i can't believe i'm being forced to play this stupid game.  i wish the guy with the gun here would just fucking leave.
145	> the moderation team here is literally fucking useless and don't even read the subreddit and just dont want to do any work.\n\nSo, INTP's?
59	That tl;dr though. 
46	All hail our absentee gods. Those are the best kind.
21	Yeah, c'mon. This place isn't even at 20k subscribers yet. The real problems don't even begin until you hit 50k and start getting linked in askreddit comments on a weekly basis.
20	If given the mod permissions, I could throw down some Naut and make [this popular post](http://imgur.com/wG1NCkX) the header image. I don't know much about CSS, but it's something.
12	I wish my subreddit was reasonable enough for this kind of talking to.
11	I think the voting mechanism is ineffective as a quality filter in large subreddits, but this one is small enough so that the current regime is sufficient.
12	> I was brought on as a moderator to do garbage duty\n\nthus is the heavy burden of the mod
29	I immediately like you after reading this
29	[deleted]
8	I honestly think most of the people here who want to be mods just want to see what it's like to have an extra button or two and a green name.\n\nDAE want to be mod?\n\nDAE mods r gey?\n\nDAE INTP?\n\nFor the record, your style of moderating seems fine.
19	I want to be a mod :( \n\nBut only to jazz up the CSS this shit is boring as fuck, can we get some /r/naut up in this bitch? 
4	The circlejerky posts you list are the rite of passage of any new intp to the sub, the most important questions on his mind on which he would like opinions of others like him. Heck, even more older (irl or in this sub) intps might like any new insights with regards to normal human functions (smalltalk, name-remembering, career and relationships) as this can be a life long struggle.
9	This is honestly the best mod policy. \n\nToo many mods in other subreddits get on fucking teenage power trips and start to police content for no reason other than stroke their own egos. Thanks for being chill, /r/intp mods 
4	Weow
4	Will the real slim shady please stand up?
6	Yeah, I hate the guy with the gun too ^^^^hoho ^^^^haha

3	Is this a reaction to my iron hold over r/ENTJ?
3	Hahaha!!! Upvoted for the "shitpost" examples.
3	All hail the mostly uncaring Gods!\n\nSeriously though I think the mods do fine.  I don't see any obvious spam.  I think the DAE and OMG IM SMART posts just means some of the posters are 14.  That's fine.  Let people circle jerk a bit.  I can just skip over the thread.\n\nI do find career discussions personally interesting, but I've never really found good answers in them.
3	LoL>DotA
3	10/10. This was hilarious.
3	This is how a community of INTP's should be anyways. Fuck the hierarchical bullshit.
2	.
2	Seriously though, decency regarding posting and commenting is one thing, but the ability to spruce up the subreddit requires legitimate, official mod powers. Naut, the space banner, we can vote on the colors. I have the minimal knowledge to make this sort of a thing happen. We need a mod to actually do it, and if no-one else will, I volunteer as tribute.
2	> also, i called jungle in lobby\n\nthis was when I was having doubts if I was in the INTP subreddit or /r/dota2\n\n> 9 report after game im way too sick of dealing with trolls in this game dude. my teams always throw and i'd be like 5k mmr in dota\n\nthis was when I started to wonder if I was drunk or high or just too sleepy\n\nedit: formatting errors

2	Neat.    \n    \nALL HAIL LORD ME    \n    \n    \n    \n....and everyone else    \n    \nLet my proclamation be heard across the lands "Fuck you!"
2	"Invariably the content which is most popular with the largest amount of people will be the most successful."\n\nI feel really bad for you guys if your mods truly believe this.
3	I'll happily be a moderator, I'm constantly checking for bullshit posts, spam & the like. However, I think you need a giant hug. 
2	[deleted]
2	I hereby challenge you to a duel, whereby I shall remove your head and claim your powers as an absentee mod. *En garde*. There can be only one.
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/bestof] [Moderator makes some excellent points explaining why he thinks moderators should police content less](https://np.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3mzu75/moderator_makes_some_excellent_points_explaining/)\n\n[](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*\n\n[](#bot)

1	"For the record, I hate circlejerky PersonalityCafe-esque shitposts such as:"\n\nBut this is /r/intp in a nutshell...
1	Make me mod, I've clean up the trash.
1	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tNqqTYi3i8Q/maxresdefault.jpg
1	How about that steam name doe? Get some dota going on.  
1	Just because you personally hate something doesn't mean it should be removed from a board, is my stance.
1	Report jg toxic gg
1	I Like you because swearing.
1	My name isn't green, though. 
1	I don't know why you even bothered to pay attention to it frankly. This is such a common bitch out.
1	Is there some metric for knowing how much someone "reads" a sub? I am guessing you are being sarcastic in saying \n\n>I read this subreddit LITERALLY more than anyone else\n\nBut if it were possible to know I would be interested. I am here all day every day. I just usually ignore most of the drivel these kids regurgitate. 
1	What an enticing read, good stuff, man. (No sarcasm)
0	You need to chill.
0	bro you are not even accounting for for self centered the people here are they do not give a fuck no one is the moderator 
-1	hello bullshit patrol extrovert claims to lurk on internet more than introverts ..not impossible but seems questionable  \nplease moderate.
141	INTP subreddit chat	It exists now.
151	Giving INTPs a chat room is like giving a blind man reading glasses
93	Cool. I wonder if anyone will use it
35	I am an INTP (duh) that is bored out of his mind by this sub, I was hoping for either some intelectual conversation, or at least to get my dick virtually sucked by some other INTPs when they tell me how smart and superior INTPs are as a type, but no. \n
36	The mods have spoken
20	Wow you sound like an ENTP who's bored out of his mind by this sub. How did you get that way?
18	Is it accessible on mobile?
12	[deleted]
8	Where is this chat?, how I find it?
8	I made a similarly informative and simple post about its existence a month ago and no one up voted it. 
6	I was looking for it yesterday.
5	What's the spoiler
3	Just idles in loading mode on mobile.
3	Unless we discuss somethings with philosophical repercusions 
3	Alright, something philosophical. If everyone else said that a blue chair was red, and one person said it would be blue, who would be right?
2	Got banned from it lol
2	Why we should wanna a chat?
2	how the fuck am i going to keep mrhaircut on discord now?
1	Waste of time. To clarify, the chat room is going say fast that you don't have time to process. And if you happen to find a meaningful thought or question by the time you get a chance to reply there will have been ten posts about penises and vaginas.
1	Idk man.
1	Is this the chat?
1	I knew, but thanks anyway, it is invaded by others types, I prefer chat in the INFP
1	how to use it?
1	Discord?
1	G
1	How do you enter this chatroom?
1	LMAO. Your username cracks me up ! 
1	Does it even work?
1	intp's try way to hard here. can we just chill, please. 
1	What happened to the chat?
256	Somehing so simple, yet so difficult.....	
14	Where’s the yellow button?
11	Wouldn't green solve red?
3	Greeeeen! Bam! 
4	i dont actually understand the definition of small talk tbh. i ask people how their day went and i can proceed to have a full blown discussion with them in minutes. 
2	I’ve gotten good at it with practice. Though my inferior FE gets in the way with interpreting emotion, I can hold a conversation without coming off as awkward as I used to
2	Very easy. Smash All.
3	So you'd rather humanity suffer because you're a dumbass that can't handle small talk? Where is the button to end your life? That is the option you should choose. 
2	>small talk\n\nYou mean those null bumps reactionary twits do? Is it profane echo location, virtue signaling, or stuck in recitation loop? If it starts paradoxing try to BSOD. I will have your dialogue back up and running in no time. Remember when dealing with an NPC, beatings are always the solution!
1	Infj - yes pls
1	if everything was perfect life would have no meaning, but small talk is just annoying and uncomfortable 
1	That's a gentle way to say end the human race.
1	WTF, Welcome To Finland.\n\nWe don't know how to do small talk.
12	A portrait of an INTP	
2	Ohh, I love that! Simple, funny and true. :)
2	That's it? You want to make a physical depiction of an abstract concept and all you can do is scribble a few inches to illustrate a mind? Garbage tier art. 1/10
1	Needs more colour. Your portrait is too 1 dimensional. 5/10 good effort.
92	Thought this shirt fit the sub pretty well	
30	expressing your insecurities through pseudo intellectualism again I see
4	Hold on I'm requisitioning these for the IT team 
1	This is how I feel about how we live in a society.
1	That shirt tells "I am narrow-minded and cynical because of my insecurities". I am not that type of person, so:\n\nhttps://i-h2.pinimg.com/564x/62/54/62/6254622b581e846a058c64ccf5aacd87.jpg
0	Ha! Basically described every worker to a manager.
0	[Here you go](http://2.redbubblehomeone.xyz)
0	This sub needs a reform. It’s just been plagued by insecure pseudo intellectuals lately. 
-1	This should be considered acceptable business wear. 
20	oh no	
2	Quality, did you do this in paint?
1	Weird, I remember seeing this here before. I would like to say that this is a repost.
894	you guys need to chill out sometimes	
161	Intp's, the perfect combination of a genius complex and cripplingly low self-esteem
113	Fuck corporate.
89	You know, this kind of Truly High quality meme makes me want to call you an idiot, which in turn would qualify me for r/iamverysmart more than anything else on this sub.\n\nThis is basically bait. 
24	I feel personally attacked.
8	I mean...the critique often stands, but have y'all seen /r/intj/ ?\n\nThe subset of posters who are in high school and haven't yet reached key milestones in self-awareness can be insufferable. . .at the same time, their sub is overall more interesting than ours. . .
15	If they were the same, we wouldn't need two subreddits
16	They don‘t want to sound #verysmart, but if someone tries to express their thoughts on sth with accuracy it can quickly be seen as such. But there‘s no reason to assume they‘re not already chill about it.
3	lol
3	I don't visit this sub too often but considering what I have seen on it recently, you are 100% correct.
27	So hold the fuck on a second here buddy boy.\n\nAre we self-defeating, hopeless, whiny, neurotic losers destined for failure?\n\nOr are we arrogant, self-righteous, pretentious, machiavellian elitists?\n\nBecause I see at least one post a day BITCHING that this ENTIRE SUB is one or the other.\n\nHere's a theory. This sub is full of people, who lie somewhere in-between the two extremes. Most of us share a common sense of humor and experience, which is why we cluster here.\n\nSensationalist, self-depricating, and absurdist humor is our forte. If you take everything everyone says here seriously, and apply it to the group as a whole, **you're a fucking moron.**\n\nShut up.
6	wht do i have a feeling that most r/iamverysmart candidates are ISTJ? But intoverted only because nobody likes them
2	If it makes you feel better, I don't think I contributed much to r/iamverysmart materials. I mainly talk about my insecurity and vulnerability here; if that makes me sound smart, so be it. 
2	BRB, must post some pseudo-intellectual commentary so that I can screenshot it, post it on r/iamverysmart and reap that sweet sweet karma!
2	except that i don't cringe as much in r/intp than i would in r/iamverysmart.
2	How else are we supposed to sate our feelings of awkward superiority, if not by communing with a herd of other cats?
2	I appreciate this post xD
2	Seriously though. I’ve seen this sub the past few weeks and been thinking the same thing 
3	How come the same women is presenting the problem and answering the question? Clones that dress similar?
4	No how about you chill out. As a male intp I don't even think like that much less say I'm very smart in a condecending tone. Unlike you I understand that we are ALL intelligent in our own way. We are ALL smart. I understand INTP people can be unintentionally condecending smart asses when we converse with people who don't understand our messy chaotic thinking process. but Jesus twiddily fking Christ!!! we just want to be left alone to learn, explore and discover knowledge and truth with what ever we are fascinated with. I didn't realise our unintentional high and mighty inner bitch made people this concerned. Now it seems I really do need to chill now. Thanks a lot.\n\n\nThis here people is a prime example of an angry INTP who was personally attacked by a harmless meme. You can also tell that I am a Leo due to how offended I got at this quite frankly mediocre meme.  And how much I wrote. You are very welcome and I apologise for being a nuisance. Have a good day. Or not. Because I am not your father. I don't tell you what to do.
2	Nice bait xd
2	Why say lot word when dank meme do trick?
1	Hahaha I’ve had that sub reddit thrown in my face once on a comment I made....
1	Am I missing something? How are INTPs iamverysmart material? Shouldn't an iamverysmart person essentially be an E for starters?
1	That means we're very smart without trying to be.. Right?
1	r/entp and r/intp would be better i think :D
1	i feel attacked
1	that's a level of joke way over my head.
1	It's the same with the INTJ sub
1	Yeah, there’s a lot of content building up an intellect so towering no extrovert plebe can understand... but guess what, really the OP probably sucked at explaining it because they’re so far up their own pseudo-intellectual ass, and the extrovert could’ve explained it better then stolen their friends.\n\nI get called out a lot at work and home for having skipped too many steps ahead in an explanation. Other personality types getting me to rewind and explain properly fosters a lot better discussion and brainstorming. We need to work *with* others rather than using their confusion as some sort of twisted confirmation that our genius will never be understood.
0	As an INTP, I feel insulted. Very insulted. Typical human emotional response is insult back.\n\nOP, you're a cunt.\n\nActually, I believe you're a great human who just made something they thought was funny, but is actually hurtful.  \n\nI have lost count of how many times I did similar.  \n\nAlso , why cunt sack
-1	Some people are very smart and when you acknowledge that you are in fact very smart, that upsets people who aren't, especially when their fully aware that they aren't as smart as you . r/iamverysmart is a place for them to vent. Everyone needs a place to vent their frustrations.
-2	So now we have to deal with a bunch of anti-INTP shit on our subreddit? We need to cut the idiots off from posting here. It’s not our fault we are smarter.
-1	Ah, the glory of popularity. The more popular this sub gets, the more this is going to become 90% of the posts, thus completely turning any discussion toward meaningless meta-retardedness.
22	How do you deal with all your internal chaotic energy?	Context: I feel like I constantly have very convoluted thoughts that make sense if I piece them together well but more often than not my anxiety causes me to be basically incomprehensible when communicating my ideas. I was explaining to my class this plan to solve systematic inequality in education systems and I was explaining using this graph that ended up looking like a straight up piece of abstract art at the end. My feedback was,” Amidst that chaos, I see some salient points.” However, no one else understood what I was talking about and I felt like such an idiot after. I can’t seem to hold back my blunt opinons or extreme ideas for some reason too. It’s so frustrating when you have so much to say but no one can understand you or see eye to eye with you.
15	Writing, drugs
12	Music, exercise, and friends that actually a like me. 
7	Meditation,  lots of exercise,  psychedelics. 
3	Drugs, meditation, reading, cycling
3	Writing and drugs
3	Drugs, lots of drugs. i prefer the downies cuz the. I can relax.
5	Elon Musk once said that his mind is a "never ending explosion." I thought that an apt description.\n\nFor most of my life, I thought that I was my mind, and I just followed along wherever it chose to go. Through mindfulness, I learned that I am not my mind.  My thoughts are not me, they are just thoughts. Thoughts are things that I do. And I can choose what to think about. I can even choose what to think, unlike emotions, which just happen to me. \n\nOnce I realized that, I no longer felt compelled to chase after every thought I had. A lot of the time, I just observe that I am thinking about something and let the thought pass. As much as I can, I gently redirect my thinking to the present moment. Changed my life.
1	Embrace it?
1	We can be friends; I’ll understand you. -INFP 😀
1	Honestly, I have found chronic undersleeping helpful in keeping me ground down enough so that I’m not all over the place but can plod through a task as befits a work day (though there are still going to be like 5 programs and 10 browser tabs open minimum). I’m a night owl who possibly has that delayed sleep shift where it’s hard to go bed until 2, so it hasn’t been that hard. The sweet spot is 5-6 hours/night. I did a questionnaire or two and am pretty sure I don’t have ADHD, though I realize this could seem like a warning sign for that.\n\nNow that I have a baby, there’s not even enough sleep for that...\n\nWriting stuff out, where I can get numbered steps or bullet points going, maybe some links besides, also helps tremendously.
17	INTP and INTP Relationship	I'm currently in a relationship with with another INTP (as an INTP) and everything is going pretty well. I thought it was pretty funny when I learned that my partner is INTP, and I was curious if anyone else has been in a relationship with another INTP. If so, how did your relationship work out? Any interesting stories?\n\n(Yes I know, this isn't going to define my relationship, I'm just curious as to how others with two INTPs played out)
28	One thing is certain: This will be an under decorated home or apartment
9	so you're telling me you got into a relationship *without* knowing their type first?! \n\n*how dare you*
5	Usually it goes to shit. You better hope that one of you isn't actually an INTP.
6	Both of my parents are INTPs actually, and they are still in a healthy relationship. 
9	I had another INTP confess to me a few years ago in front of a few other people. I instinctively said 'No' and my facial features didn't budge one bit. I still feel kinda bad about it aha.
4	Not a good pair, IMO. Being in a relationship with an INTP is almost like being alone but worse. I’m the kind who wants to go out sometimes and do fun stuff, but I only have enough energy and social reach to seek out a few of those events, and I’d expect my partner to contribute something like that too, but with INTPs it’s always like I have to drag them around because they’d just sit at home. I do like to sit at home, but prefer doing that alone and not 100% of time. I think an INTP needs someone more active. Then again, my anecdotal experience doesn’t mean every INTP couple is the same, just that I happened to find the most passive and introverted ones.
8	Currently in one. I'm out on bond for two felonies and she has serious issues with depressed, anxiety and anger, though none has been directed at me. We haven't seen eachother for over a week because I've been busy getting high and arrested and she's been busy with emotional volatility and anxiety. We have plans for Friday. She generally keeps to plans.
3	I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost a year and it’s been going great. 
3	I need a feeler can't relate 
3	Commit to booking a regular cleaner....!
2	I have an inkling that my first bf was also an INTP. We had a great summer together. When the summer was coming to an end and I was headed to college and he was still in high school we kinda decided to end things. We went from daily contact to nothing at all in a day and never talked again. 
2	My husband and I have been together almost 12 years and both tested this way, so obviously I think it can work well. We have really productive fights because we insist on finding some sort of solution before we resolve it. If the other brings up a logical point, we will concede to it without any fuss, and we will also admit if we were wrong about a topic as experience proved us otherwise; gotta stick to the truth!\n\nWe both like learning about different topics, him via video and me via the written word (helpful to have different sources!), so we will share with each other, often getting into deep debates, and never run out of things to talk about. Since socializing can be tiring for us both, we provide each other advance notice on any such events and space them out. We often just go out without the other and (except for any lessening or childcare) are pretty content to socialize or pursue hobbies separately.\n\nAll this has been incredible helpful in working together for parenting, too. We are so upfront in sharing our needs that it can be difficult for me to read in some forums how stressed some parents can get without help from their partners!\n\nOne recent example of us thinking similarly is he shared with me a logic puzzle in which a genie offers Box A ($100) and Box B (50/50 $0 or $1m). You can either pick just one box or both, but the genie warns that he doesn’t like greedy people. I picked both because the box is already set, at least I get something. and WTF do I care what the genie thinks of me - but apparently the logical answer is just Box B? Though his friends had different answers, my husband had 100% come to the same conclusion as me.
4	Stages of INTP	1.Doing nothing acctualy\n\n2.Doing nothing acctualy and expecting something to happen\n\nJust my thoughs about myself can somone correlate with this dumbness?
4	There could be a correlation between your dumbness and inability to spell.\n\nI'm either INTP or ISTP but either way - the only time I do nothing is when I'm emotionally exhausted, otherwise I always have a project on the go.
1	Just because you work with your brain doesn't mean you're not working.
1	You REEK of weakness
4	Happened with anyone else in school?	
2	Not because I had a bad teacher, just because I suck at math
2	School is the real test. The sheeple become meat for thr grinder while those that are capable escape and rise to the top or play the system.
1	All you have realized that the education system is failing its students in a sense that it's being dumbed down on purpose to dumb down our population. 
1	Happened few times, but mostly when I start teaching myself the new thing I get bored and start doing something else. This is why I and possibly other INTPs need good teachers that keep us interested.
1	When you teach yourself the subject because you have immense struggles to listen and focus and actually attend classes... I wonder whether all my life I‘ve ever learned any subject at all from my teachers
1	Wrong. If I was a dog that was walking myself I wouldn't be around any fucking roads. I'd be straight into the forest to hunt rabbits and roll in deer shit. 
4	Is seeing your personality characterized so well more comforting or more dehumanizing?	
1	That's an interesting question, thanks!\n\nAt first bliss I would say it's more comforting - and at second too. We are social animals, evolved from herd animals, so we could think it's just because we love to belong, but I don't think that's all this is about.\n\nWe (as the human species) have mental illnesses, self-destructing thoughts and tendencies, and the younger generations need to face so much stimuli and have so much fake role models with perfect personality and outlook, that finding a characterisation what tells you "Hey, you are not abnormal! You are just like that bunch of people out there. There are other people with as fucked up thoughts as yours!" is really comforting.\n\nFor me, it is. :)
3	Feeling unlovable and unwanted as a child	I often felt this way when I was young. I wondered if my parents and the rest of the world would be better of without me. I guess I wasn't able to figure out how my existence contributed in a potive way.\n\nI was considered smart and lacy, and I had a tendency of hurting people feelings, which made me hate myself. Especially because I couldn't see, what I did wrong.\n\nAs an adult, it's much better. But I still sometimes get caught in the same thought pattern. When I really care a lot about a person, I get scared that they will decide, that I'm not lovable. Sometimes this makes me distance myself from them. I tell myself, that they are better of without me, but in reality, I think I fear that they will see through me, and decide I'm not worth their time.\n\nDoes anyone identify? 
9	intps and riddles	One of the best stereotypes for INTPs is that they are amazing problem solvers.  \n\n\nLike most INTPs, I am quite decent at things like chess, strategy games, sudoku, iq tests, finding patterns, crossword, mobile puzzle games, and other stuff.  \n\n\nHowever, what I noticed about riddles, it's either I get the answer extremely quickly or don't bother thinking it through. There are also times when I think TOO outside the box, making my answer technically wrong (but in a way, right because the answer is consistent with the question, it's just not what the riddle was looking for). Does anyone else have any experience with this, or at least any other experiences to share with riddles? Because I swear to God, some riddles make me wanna kms on how ridiculously simple or stupid they are, it physically hurts when I didn't think it through enough.  \n\n\nAlso, as an extra measure, how do you get better at riddles? Not think too deep? Think more superficial? My pride is a bit triggered on how average I am at these things and I sorta find myself wanting to improve.
6	Head on over to /r/intj they are better at this kinda stuff than us.
4	I'm horrible at riddles as well. I just don't get them but I never cared enough to try to get better. If you do find a way please do tell
2	When is a door not a door?

2	I am also very bad at riddles, especially if it's said to me instead of me reading it.
1	I’ve only played it once but I was really super good at the Mafia/Werewolf party game. 
1	When I play video games, I just want to keep progressing through the story and have my character get more powerful. I’ll spend very little time on a riddle before just looking it up. I play on easy mode anyway.
1	Who cares? Riddles are fucking stupid anyway. There are hundreds of possible answers and normally NONE of them are exactly correct. 
4	Is Patrick Star a dumb INTP?	
6	SpongeBob lore (if such a concept can actually exist) indicates that Patrick is actually a genius with severe brain damage. So maybe.

2	Bilingual INTPs wanted	How have you guys best learned your second language?  Do you dissect it and break it down, analyzing sentence structure and conjugated verbs OR have you acquired it more organically?  Any advice appreciated.
3	I speak five languages (French, English, Spanish, German, Mandarin), though not quite at the level I would like. Apart from English, which I started learning in third grade, the other three I started learning in the second half of my undergrad degree. I mention this because it annoys me to no end when people say they're too old to learn languages. \n\nAnyway, to answer your question, my process is dissecting the *logic* behind the structure of the language and spotting patterns between these logics so that they eventually congregate into greater mutually interacting logical frameworks. \n\nI'm not sure I'm expressing this clearly, but I essentially spot patterns, find a reason why they make sense and just refer to these reasons to build my own understanding of how the language works. This is more or less how I learn everything, actually. Taking classes until an intermediate level is what works best for me because I'm too lazy to force myself to study the grammar independently. Thereafter you have a good enough base to fly on your own (organically, as you would say), which is a lot more fun than more classes where people move too slowly and where more grammar is not beneficial. \n\nI'm sorry I'm really terrible at explaining it. I hope you manage to gleam something helpful within my attempted explanation anyway?
2	My mother tongue is French, I learned English the same way I learned French: by mere exposure — letting my brain connect the dots afterwards.\n\nOf course I had obligatory English courses at school but in my humble opinion most of them were pointless; for instance, you don't become fluent in English by rote-learning irregular verbs, as those things can wait and if you ever say “I catched a ball” at first, no biggie, people will understand.\n\n
1	Xi Jinping shi welda de lingxiu!
1	I learned conjugation rules first. Grammar and structure, then  words fell into place as I learned new vocab.
1	Well I started to study English when I was a tiny little 5 year old, so no, I haven't been analyzing it much. I took up French in 7th grade, but given that I am a lazy piece of garbage I didn't put enough energy to study it well, therefore my knowledge is close to zero, so I'm probably not the best person to ask.
1	I attempted to learn Japanese logically, but the complexity and rule exceptions drove me mad. I ended up making the most progress through matching intonation and learning the most common sentence structure and expressions. The purpose is to communicate people oft forget.
1	I speak English and Spanish equally fluent but I’m working on French and German simultaneously. The best way to learn a language is exactly how you would, break it down and reassemble it. Break down the logical structures and find the patterns (gender, noun cases, conjugation, etc) and emplore them to help you learn. It’s always great to have a language learning app like Duolingo but it can only do so much. When starting with a language, let’s use Turkish for example, you want to start off by simply listening Turkish audio with Turkish subtitles. Then, with the use of forums and native speakers, learn the sentence structure, then grammar. The best place to start with grammar is sentence order and noun cases. Noun cases (if the language has them) can seriously help you even if your sentence order is messed up. Happy language learning
2	What's your Hogwarts House?	I'm a Hufflepuff, and I was thinking that's probably pretty unusual for an INTP. Are a lot of INTPs Ravenclaw or...? Do you think Ravenclaw fits INTP the best, or might another house make more sense? 
1	I’m a hufflepuff too! 
1	SlytherClaw.
1	Ravenclaw 
1	All of them.
1	Ravenclaw
1	Slytherin. I'm a product of my environment though. 
1	Ravenclaw.
1	I would imagine that any rational (NT) would be a good candidate for Ravenclaw. I'm a Ravenclaw, myself. 
1	Aren’t intps supposed to hate children because they’re so happy?
2	I love making random eye contact with strangers	I don't know why, but it charges me up. Every time I walk past a person when I try to do try contact and they accept my invitation for about 2-3 seconds, I feel great (not sure what to do when it's longer than that), but a lot of people don't or if they do, they break it 0.5s. later. Anyone else loves staring at strangers eyes for no reason at all?
4	I do it, and the outcome varies depending on the locale.  I think it's a subconscious way to gauge the general mood of a place and the intentions of fellow enthusiasts.  Concerts and sporting events (whether participating or spectating) yield untrustworthy results, but hobby stores (bookstores, antique shops, e.g) usually reveal a similar mindset.  Maybe it's because you're not beholden to any sort of further communication in a setting where you're in constant motion or the experience is similar, but not shared.  There is aggression and competitiveness at sporting events and dubious personal intent at concerts, plus the awkwardness of potentially being seated close together and feeling some need to further engage, so in those instances, it's best to keep entirely to myself.
3	I would do this if I wouldn't smile for no reason.

3	Yup and I think I should stop that
1	I do this too for some reason. Sometimes it feels like you connect on a deep level.

1	wrong sub?
2	My Big Picture	Personally, learning that I am INTP was a great jumping off point. Through the course of hanging in this sub, I've learned about [wings](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test), and [colors](https://my-personality-test.com/true-colours), and now today [temperaments](http://www.godtype.com/godtype-personality-test/). I'm not here to argue the scientific validity of any of these tests. I'm more interested in the how they can be used as a lens to focus on certain aspects of myself that may be hidden on a regular basis.\n\n[Enneagram Types - 5w4 Explained (with Instinctual variant)](https://personalityjunkie.com/02/enneagram-type-5-5w4-5w6-intp-intj-infj-infp/)\n> The 5w4 is the more subjective Five subtype. Like the Enneagram type 4, 5w4s are driven to understand their own personality, routinely exploring their identity and life’s purpose. They are also more idiosyncratic and individualistic in their investigative methods, in many ways operating more like artists than scientists. Their explorations are informed, and to some extent driven, by their need for personal meaning and authenticity. \n\n> *Sexual variant*:\nPeople of the sexual variant are very much interested in one to one contacts. They are looking for intimacy and this may show in sexuality, though not necessarily. Being in a relationship is very important to them. They are the most passionate of the subtypes, being temperamental and having more energy. They have less of a problem with getting into a fight and care less about rules and responsibility.\n\n[Color of Personalities from Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/real_colors_personality_temperament_tool_part_3_green)\n> Those with Green color personality strengths tend to be perfectionistic, analytical, conceptual, cool, calm, inventive and logical. They seek knowledge and understanding as well as always looking for explanations and answers.\n\n> Greens can be good researchers – looking for facts and asking lots of questions. Greens have a large vocabulary and can argue both sides of an issue. Often, Greens take the time to concentrate and give correct answers. Greens like Mind Games that challenge their thinking.\n\n[Temperaments](http://www.4temperaments.com/).\n> Improviser: Want the freedom to choose the next act. Seek to have impact, to get results. Want to be graceful, bold, and impressive. Generally are excited and optimistic. Are absorbed in the action of the moment. Are oriented toward the present. Seek adventure and stimulation. Hunger for spontaneity. Trust impulses, luck, and their ability to solve any problem they run into. Think in terms of variation. Have a talent for noticing and describing rich detail, constantly seeking relevant information. Like freedom to move, festivities, and games. Tend to be natural negotiators. Seize opportunities. Usually are gifted tacticians, deciding the best move to make in the moment, the expedient action to take. Are frequently drawn to all kinds of work that requires variation on a theme.\n\nThis post has no real purpose other than to say thank you to those that offered guidance to all that asked. Learning more about myself has helped immensely in not only my personal relationships, but also with how I act at work and with coworkers.\n\n
1	Ive never heard of temperment or colours before I must know more. Could you link me source material? Pretty please. Many thanks and updoots around on me.

1	Is it just me or does INTP function stack not make much sense	A lot of the MBTI sites show similarities between dominant function types. Not just in Ti=Ti, but also Fi=Ti. Like ESTP and ENTP seem pretty similar.\n\nTi dominants are troubleshooters if we pay attention to ISTP descriptions. But their Se-Ni gives them confidence just like for ESTP. They can only see one vision of the future for Ni and it's weak so their Se just charges in. Meanwhile ENTP because of Ne thinks of everything that could possibly go wrong.\n\nTroubleshooting is being in a crisis, so precisely when you would need confidence in your action. Having Ne seems like it'd make you unconfident, so Ne users wouldn't be as good in a crisis and would need time to develope their thought.\n\nBut at the same time, INTP descriptions talk about philosophy. Wouldn't ENTP higher Ne make more awareness of possibilities? So if they committed to figuring something out they would be better at finding a philosophy truth?\n\nThat'd leave INTP as a relatively unconfident fearful troubleshooters, and a relatively unimaginative philosopher.
1	Wierd dream	Dreamt about Dr. House (from House M. D.)  burying Cuddy in the ground and then giving me and a group of other people some sort of magic popcorn that would make us invincible and really fast. Had to collect as many green glowing stones as possible, but as soon as the spirit in the Egyptian? cave detected me I would be dead. Apparently this assignment was for my math degree? Was willing to take some medication to induce seizures to make myself faster (makes no sense but yea) , really scary. My mom telepathically told me that she really hoped I would get the degree, but was OK if I didn't too. I really wished I was Cuddy, she was a lot safer in the ground. \nIm not even studying in university, why would I have such a dream?

1	fuck
1	*Emotional intelligence* is a whole wad of bullshit propagated mostly by people in the management and entrepreneurial field who have a track record of being extremely unscientific in their approach. Don't fall for it!\n\nDo you know what one of the main proponents of EI said when an academic study came out that there was no significant effect of EI on actual performance metrics?\n\n> Academia plays by a different set of rules of proof than do folks in the business world: what gets published in peer-reviewed journals, versus what actually works.\n\n> And therein lies the significant difference in these contrasting views of emotional intelligence. Academics are fastidious about their research methods, and analyze their data to see, for example, which variables correlate at what strength.\n\nHe f#$%ing blamed the study for being too concerned about what the variables and their measurement and their accuracy than having *his* gut feeling about what works in business.\n\nTheir whole field itself is so pretentious and circlejerky. I hate it. How can INTPs even adopt their terms? I feel filthy just reading their [Wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence#Ability_model) I've got to go take a bath now!\n\nSome, heck I'll give it to you, *most* INTPs do get into trouble in dealing with the emotional stuff some time in their lives, be it their own or that of the others. That is mostly because they tend to give it almost no significance in making logical decisions, which other don't. Other people being not so logical, or making decisions emotionally causes friction between them and INTPs. INTPs are also vary of people who deal with emotions a lot as they feel it is misleading people, which is why I am so angry about this now. Having said that, INTPs can feel a lot of emotions themselves, maybe not at the same time and same occasions as others. INTPs even are quite perceptive of other's emotions, and can also handle emotions well if they are logical about it. But that's it. Don't ever muddle this with the cesspool of *emotional intelligence* again.
1	Isnt it the other way around? People with low emotional intelligence are super emotional, sensitive, and cant understand or handle emotions. Like emotionally instable people. INTPs are emotionally stable people. We just dont care for emotions. They mean little to us.
0	EQ is a fake metric made up to make women and low iq people feel better for being manipulative.  
0	Emotional intelligence? Really?
0	INTPs do not lack emotional intelligence. We just did not learn emotional regulation skills because we were so caught up in our thinking. No harm there. We can pick up emotional regulation skills any time.\n\nIt requires a degree of mindfulness, the more the better. There are many places and ways to learn mindfulness. It all will sound hokey to an INTP at first, but give it a try. \n\nContrary to popular INTP belief, we are not our minds. Our thoughts and emotions are not who we are. They are just things that we are doing it that are happening to us. We do not have to follow our thoughts wherever they want to go, and we can choose how we react to emotions.
0	Is there a thread for INFP?
5	How loyal are you INTPs?	Would you be intimate with multiple people without telling them if you were to make sure they could never know about it?
36	We can't even get ourselves to be intimate with one person most of the times, we are *that* loyal. 
24	I dont give a shit about most people. Once i care about you i am the most frigging loyal a person can be, usually without expecting the same from you. So yea, intp can be pretty damn loyal
13	If I said I would, I will, if I didn't, or it's an *implied promise* or whatever other BS, nope. 
8	Making sure they would never know would be so, so much not worth the work.
7	I, do this. I like to keep my close friends separate from each other so I can be with each one individually.
14	I'm loyal if you're loyal.
5	That's a tall glass of nope. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you find someone who you connect with and who gets you, why screw that up? If she's willing to put up with me all the time (and that't not always easy to do), she deserves my loyalty. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis goes beyond romantic relationships too. If someone proves to be a loyal friend, I will stick with them through just about anything. 
5	Perfectly loyal.  No exceptions. \n\nHowever, once the other is disloyal, the relationship is effectively finished.  And I no longer care what that person does. 
4	No, I never cheat. NEVER. I hate lying and although I don't think monogamy is the best relationship type, I can't imagine myself be in any other type. Monogamy means for both party to be exclusive and I would never cross the line, because I would hate myself afterwards (lot more than on a usual weekday). I don't have too much principles, but that is one of them.
6	Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious loyal. Unless someone f's me over, then out of anger, I might do something really stupid. Like date their best friend.
3	Being anything but loyal just seems like a lot of work and drama. I like to think I'm pretty loyal. :P
3	No, I won’t. I don’t see the point of having multiple partners. 
3	I'd say I'm very loyal. Could never bare the guilt of something like an affair. Been married 12 years this May.
2	Hella loyalty if you've demonstrated loyalty. If disloyalty has been demonstrated it takes a lot to bring it back but it's not impossible. If neither has been demonstrated other factors determine it.
2	Why though? it makes no sense as having multiple just drives all of them away eventually.
2	Depends on what boundaries are set. If exclusivity isn’t set, I’ve entertained the idea but I wouldn’t go behind someone’s back and do it. I would be forward with them. 
2	If I don't care about the people involved. Sure.\n\nIf I do care about them. Never. When I'm in a relationship I feel super guilty for just having a dream about another person. I will always be loyal and honest towards the people that matters to me. 
1	I'm not subservient to the feelings of loyalty for another person like these guys are. But I have sound principle, so I won't snitch easy. I'll recognize and return honest favors. \n\n&#x200B;
1	If it is in relationships then n/a
1	No. For me, that would be contrary to being intimate in the first place. 
1	No, I like going to bed knowing that I have nothing to hide.
1	The most loyal. 
1	Not worth the effort. keeping track of convos, spending effort and money. Potential STDs and not focusing on important stuff... Idek how people do it
3	Feeler Meltdown (rant)	I've witnessed some chaos this weekend. \n\nStarted out great, go out for a nice meal to celebrate a birthday and a new job. Well, the little sister hijacks the meal with theatrics. Cried twice during the mealtime (ugh) but then over the top happy 5 mins later. Couldn't even go to any of the restaurants birthday person wanted because little sister is picky.\n\n Birthday person gets upset because im the only one who seems to want to interact with her, everyone else is laser focused on keeping little sister happy.\n\nThen when we get home everyone is pissed off with birthday person for being ungrateful and not having a good time. She tries to explain why she didn't have a good time - nope not a good enough reason to feel that way.\n\n How the fuck can people function like this? Its so fragile. A teenage drama queen acts up and starts a chain reaction of madness. No one is capable of understanding anyone elses viewpoint, and instead of validating each other's feelings they just hate each other for not feeling the right feelings.\n\nCue screaming and passive aggressive behaviour for the whole weekend.\n\nAnd of course no one will extend the olive branch and start the discussion to sort it out because everyone is too stubborn and hateful. \n\nFamily dynamics can be insane, especially when you have a black sheep + golden child. \n\nIm absolutely burnt out from being caught in the middle of this. I'll be spending a while alone now. \n\n No point to this post other than to remove this shit from my mind so I can concentrate on work. 
3	:( I'm sorry you had to deal with this. If that means something, it will be better when you move out (if you already did, well... that sucks). My family is dysfunctional either, so I feel you. *pat pat*

12	This happens to me in a really short timeline. Like an hour or so after trying to do something 😂
8	Not really.  Perfectionism is a problem of mine, but I'm not really that motivated to burn out.  I just get partway through, can see the solutions to the problems generated to that point, know how much work will be required and get distracted by something else.
3	Not exactly like that.\n\n- Try again/try something different/move on to another team or job.\n- Depression, more like disappointment. I do my best, if others do not, it's their decision. I am happy with myself, even on a failed project, when I am positive that I did my very best. If the project still fails, I wash my hands. We live and die by our choices.\n

6	Need some help understanding cognitive functions	I just did a cognitive function test and this is my result. Am i a healthy INTP and what do I need to develop? Also, why is my Fi and Se kind of high? I am new to this, so I can use some help. Thanks!\n\n[result](https://i.redd.it/uph8wm1hc1k21.jpg)
3	Where did you do the test?
3	Hmm, that's interesting. :) Especially you are so young. I'm almost ten years older than you, but my Se and Fi are only average. Probably you are just a "not that typical" INTP. Anyway, good for you! Well-developed tertiary and inferior functions just make your life easier. :)
2	Huh interesting, your test results are all over the place. Have you done this test before? Are you younger or older? As of now I can’t say anything for certain as I don’t know you but I can definitively say you are not INTP based on these results alone. Reasoning is that your scores are well balanced and there’s no evidence of which is your primary from your shadow function stack. This leads me to believe you are either very young or very old. An INTP would score terribly in both Se and Fi. Your Ti Ne Ni Te scores would most likely be much higher and Fe could remain as is. \n\nEdit: was thinkin of a diff test but ill post in a sec my results which is interesting cuz i scored high fi on this test huhh....
2	Here ya go, here is my results https://imgur.com/a/R2pxcOX
2	Happy cake day!:D
2	Weird, considering Fi would be your LEAST used function. If Fe is your 4th function as an INTP then that makes Fi your 8th. Thr order of functions used for INTP:\n\nTi Ne Si Fe - a healthy/developed INTP uses all 4 problem solving/decision making/info processing  mechanisms\n\nAnd then....\n\nTe Ni Se Fi - these are shadow functions that generally stress INTPs out \n\nFi is the final/last function used to make a decision. 
32	Do ya'll ever have a daydream where someone doesn't understand a basic concept or doesn't know what a word means and you deliver a beautifully concise explanation that clarifies everything instantly?	Its weird because this actually happens in real life sometimes but I still think about it.
16	I explain stuff to fictional people in my head all the time.\n\nSometimes I'll spend like an hour or two just pretending I have some dude from 300 years ago riding around inside my head and I explain all the advances in technology around me and give a brief history lesson. \n\nSometimes it's a former version of myself and I go over all the things that were going to happen to me and how life turned out differently than expected.
9	Yup. And then when I say it in person. None of the words come out correctly
3	That's kind of how I studied in college. If I could talk about it in my head, I knew I was in a good place. 
2	Yes\nSometimes days, weeks or even months later
2	Guilty as charged, I can't think of an actual example but knowing me I've certainly done this.
2	Naw man, I'm done being the hero. People can fail. It's ok. They learn from it. I help when asked. 
2	Nah what’s the point, you could spend that time on something infinitely more useful, making soundproof definitions of various words

2	I do this with all my obsessions. Fell in love with that book? Fine, I will tell fictional people about it. Motivations of the characters, twists in the plot, etc. Built a theory about some scientific stuff? I tell the fictional people about that. Sometimes I just talk to them about Rohan (yeah, I'm a big fan). And yes, sometimes I even have that dude from the past.\n\nYayyyy, I'm not retarded (that much)! It's a relief knowing that other people do this too.
1	Yup! It used to be to my hypothetical future child (even before conception), though now that they’re here, I’m too tired to do this lately...
79	"Can I help you, sir?" "No, I'm just looking around."	
6	I mean if i know the exact thing i want down to the model, i would ask the staff
5	Maybe its some kind of "ego problem" in INTPs we dislike asking help...\nI don't ask for help I kind of solve any problem wicky wacky...
4	I got over this by realizing I looked like an idiot walking down the same isle over and over while refusing help. I got myself to be so self conscious about it, that it overrid my fear of approaching an employee. Improvise, adapt, overcome or something like that.
3	Wear headphones while you shop and nobody will bother you
2	I get self-conscious when I'm doing my browsing and hope people don't find my overanalyzing to be weird. I start reading labels down to the very last detail and comparing 15 different products for, like, toothbrushes. And then I've got this scatterbrained system where I go all over the store in an inefficient web instead of planning out my journey ahead of time.
2	What the fuck is with these low energy posts? Is this the new meme or did i became old overnight?
1	Nah I always ask for help because I want to get back home as soon as possible
1	The fuck? Ask the question asap so you can get the fuck outta there and go home.
-1	this post reeks of white privilege to assume the staff ain't hoverin' two feet behind a brotha every step of the way
8	Do you feel any sort of loyalty to others of your own personality type?	Maybe not loyalty, but affinity to others who share your same personality type? Like "We (*insert personality type here*) gotta stick together!"
19	I do, it's not loyalty tho, it's a feeling of closeness and mutual understanding. \n\nLoyalty is a dark trait. \n\n
3	No; I hate 90% of you. I crawl on over the INTJ sub and attempt to get their affection.
2	In a way.  Empathy I guess.  Even an intp can muster some
2	Depends on the individual. Some INTPs are nice, some make me want to stab someone. 
2	Yes. I have a friend who is a fellow INTP and I always feel inclined to defend him when others accuse him of being emotionless because I’ve worked on those weaknesses and changed, but I know he’s still trying to figure out certain things. 
2	I don't think I've even met one in real life but I've gotten into a little habit of looking up the types of characters. Bernard Black from Black Books is INTP and I find him hilarious and relatable. 
1	No, I don’t 
1	Sort of, I never met anyone who identified as an INTP (all the INTPs I know took the test after I told them to)
1	yess!
1	I would love to know more about people’s types IRL because I think then I could be like, “That person, they get me. We should chat more.” I know my husband is also this type, at least (he gets me and we do chat, so there you go).

1	I haven't seen this kermit meme before.
2	We INTPs tend to obsess rather than fall in love. In your opinion what are the characteristics you find in the opposite genders that makes you obsess about them?	I find my self attracted to intellectuals. Who are self Absorbed ignorant to my emotions and serving a greater purpose. What about you, fellow intps?
10	I don't think that INTPs obsess rather than fall in love. INTPs do not always deal with love in the most effective way, but the love we feel is genuine and authentic.
9	Depends on what I'm personally missing at the time. My first crush was an extrovert who is well liked by many and is extremely socially skilled; back then those were the traits I valued the most. My second crush was someone who shares my culture heritage, and a person who made me feel connected to my ethic root. The third crush I had was someone who is independent and hardworking. My first crush made me want to be more social; my second crush made me want to feel closer to my ancestral culture; my third crush made me want to be more independent and hardworking. To me my crushes have always been about me trying to gain insights for self improvements; I can't really wrap my head around it, but it seems to me I subconsciously find "role models" through my crushes to develope myself. 
6	Prove your statement first. 
4	I don't obsess but I like smart bois who are also good bois. This doesn't happen often though. 
5	Haha, I too have a tendency for obsession. But on the other hand, this obsession gives me a lot of energy to be really productive, get stuff done, and do some self-improvement in the process. It probably sounds weird, and it feels even weirder. I have a hate-love relationship to these obsessions of mine. However, objects of obsession may vary too much to be summarized into one type. 
3	If they have the same artistic and musical taste, also if they have the same humour as me. I like women that don’t care about other women and have their own unique identity when expressing themselves. If a girl has those characteristics coupled with being goodlooking, I can’t resist. 
3	When she stimulates my brain baby. But also if she keeps good company. I appreciate someone who values me enough to make time in their day for me and appreciates me for who I am. The real me of course.
3	curiosity, determination and willingness to change
3	I will get obsessive unless I have other people and hobbies to keep me occupied.  I'm careful not to let it get that way these days due to past mistakes. 
5	Sympathy/Consoling Others.	For those considered good/passable at offering condolences or sympathy, what are your basic positive thoughts/ideas on improving?\n\nOver the past few months I've had an aunt and uncle pass. This past week, two long-time, major-feeler friends lost someone or got dumped. I've improved at keeping in contact with people, but I cringe painfully when I want to give a good message or comfort someone in that manner. I know the right words/actions for only like four people.
5	INTPs are the friends that state harsh realities. We may not know how to console and comfort people, but we can state the truth and lay out possibilities for a brighter future. We help them see brighter paths from this point in time - I think that’s what we offer and what they need, even though they may not be ready to hear it
2	I have never cried when an old person died because I realized when I was very young we will all die.  Same with pets.  I prepare for it a little bit every day\n\nI look like a psychopath at funerals for my grandparents because I’m happy for the life they lived and happy to see my family.  The women are all crying but I’m like come on guys he was 90 we knew this was coming.\n\nYou can’t transfer pain so don’t act like you can.  Just be their friend and they’ll get it through their system.
1	Just watch shows or movies and copy the froofie bullshit they say. That's what I do
5	Something Something r/iamverysmart	Stop piling onto these posts already. We all know this is just bait because frankly it’s hilarious how some of the sub will continuously fall for it and make a fool of themselves in front of everyone else. This isn’t the point of the subreddit.
6	Yeah Im getting really tired of the iamverysmart trolling.  Some paranoid hysteric posted several days ago about an oncoming wave of trolls.  I think he might have been right.\n\nProbably another part of the INTJ master plan.
2	Ya I saw that meme and came on here to see what's happening and all these memes are garbage. They've always been pretty bad, but it's like someone flipped a switch recently. I much prefer the text discussion prompts over this low-effort, self-deprecating, generalized bullshit.

1	My general answer to that is well I do and i’ll Make sure that it doesn’t change for a while 
3	Connecting with My Parents	Since I could remember, I never really felt close to my parents. I also remember how caring and responsible they are. They are ready to encourage my hobbies and support me. Yet, when they get sick, I solemnly feel concerned for them. There were few instances where I did feel concern, but it was when there was a fight, so I was worried about the status quo and the future (the what if). (Hell, I sometimes find their fights amusing or annoying.) on family vacations, the time I mostly enjoy is with myself.\n\nRecently, I started to close off of them, and with mbti, I explicitly realized the why's. My mom always tries to start small talk and is generally imposing and controlling. She is super conscious about appearances and blesses my uncaring ears with these values. My father rigidly holds traditional values and upholds rules. He sometimes looks down on my opinions and mannerisms. He forces me to do stuff just for the sake of learning and the greater good. I often don't talk to him because I have nothing to talk about. My mom is more emotionally intelligent than anything else. My father doesn't understand me well because of him being born in another country, 50+ years ago.\n\nHow do I connect with them and improve our relationship? I actually attend counseling (courtesy of my father) even though I have never been suicidally depressed and don't have ADHD. The thing is that it never helped much. One of the psychiatrists thought I was fine. My father changed the psychiatrist after that.
1	I relate to this on so many levels, I mean the situation your feelings and everything are exactly how I feel about my parents and my entire family in general. The way that I’ve been dealing with it is just by understanding that I’m incompatible with them, but still trying to figure out what they might be thinking or feeling in those annoying circumstances. \n\nSo really even though I may not necessarily actually feel much of a connection with my family I sometimes just pretend there is just to be a good person and by doing that sometimes I even begin to feel  like I am connected until there’s another absurd moment or misunderstanding.  It’s also funny cause your F 4w5 as well I wonder if that has anything to do with it?
1	Meditation and YOU!	How has meditation helped you in your life? Cognition functions, creativity, introspection, social dynamics, etc.
2	I have been meditating on and off for years. The effects are paradoxically both subtle and remarkable. Meditating doesn't change your life, but it does change the grip you have on it. Suddenly you have more agency over yourself. You are in tune what your body tells to you, and you find it easier to classify thoughts and sensations and recognize where they come from. You are more aware of each day, you are more present similar to how you would be if you were doing something new and exciting. Life feels more fluid and vibrant. The effects of meditation are hard to quantify, since both the daily meditating and never meditating state of minds feel like home, but there is definitely a difference between when I do it for even 5 minutes a day vs not at all.
1	I've been doing it since the beginning of the year, and it has helped me focus when ive wanted to, and further ignore the (non-existent) emotions that I don't have
1	I am more into mindfulness, but as a practical matter it is essentially Zen meditation. It has radically altered my sense of self and my connection to reality. It started with the very difficult realization that I have a mind, but am not my mind. I argued with my Yogi about that for years. I thought that I was my mind and that my thoughts were a pure expression of who I was. I thought that my emotions were me too, but I rejected them as illogical.\n\nOnce I realized my thoughts are just things that my brain does, I realized that I could control my thoughts. I could choose what to think about and even what to think. I realized the emotions are things that happen to me, and that I cannot control them. However, I can control how I react to them. Unless, that is, if I start thinking about what caused them. That just throws gasoline on the fire. \n\nI guess one difference is that meditation is usually thought of as time specifically devoted to practice. I find that I am mindful more and more of the time, to the extent that it is becoming my normal state. I believe that is the goal of Zen meditation, but I never approached it that way when I practiced Zen.

4	I really like him, his arguments are valid and he’s a generally funny guy.
4	Insightful thinker and funny as fuck. Wish he were still around too.
4	He was around when I grew up. He was a bit of a guilty pleasure back then. A lot of parents protected their kids from exposure to him. I always enjoyed his take on things. His joke about the taxi driver and red lights still makes me laugh.
3	I grew up watching comics like this and he had a strong influence on my life, I was sad when I heard he had died.  Bill Hicks is another good one, he died way too young.
3	If you like Carlin check out Bill Hicks
3	I mean he's a comedian, and a good one at that
3	He was a really good comedian, but just like Bill Hicks, a bit of a conspiracy theorist, which sucks.

6	Use of Habitify to automate boring everyday tasks and improve time management	I have the worst time management. I usually get up an hour and a half before work and then spend the next 70 minutes wandering around daydreaming and spending the last 20 trying to fit everything in. Usually I then forget things (mostly my lunch 😞). My wife says I need to be more organised but I hate the idea of having to concentrate on what I have to do next and by what time. \nBut last night as a lay sweating in this Aussie heat I realised, it’s not so much the dull boring routine that I need to create, but a way to layout the routine so that I can view it as automation. So I can still wander around doing thinking about whatever I like and an app on my phone can do all the “focussing”. So a reminder comes up at a certain time with a task I need to complete and my mind is relatively free from distraction to think what it wants AND I’m being “productive”. \nWhat are your thoughts and what systems do you use or have used?
4	I use the alarm feature on my phone heavily. \n\nI gave up trying to accomplish anything in the morning besides getting ready for work. I would get distracted and then be late. \n\nI get up a half hour before I need to leave. Feed cats n dogs, Toilet, put contacts in my eyes, shower, brush teeth, get dressed, grab my breakfast/lunch, take out trash if it's trash day, get in the car and go. \n\nIf I do anything else, I get distracted and I'm late. I focus on the same exact routine everyday. No deviations except on trash days.

4	Train Crash of an Essay	 \n\n“To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens” – Adolf Hitler.\n\nAs Americans, we all share the freedoms afforded to us by the Second Amendment. Recently there has been an increased emphasis on gun violence in the media, and debates about the Second Amendment are at an all time high. Now, many citizens and lawmakers are starting to believe that the Second Amendment is outdated and in need of major reform. I have spent a great deal of time studying the Second Amendment and it has been an interest of mine for years. I am very concerned with this willingness to give up our individual rights to protect ourselves. Politicians are continually trying to reduce the power of the Second Amendment, and if they get their way, the Second Amendment will continue to slowly disappear until it is no more. \n\nWe must protect the Second Amendment from overreaching gun control laws, but we can’t do that if we don’t understand what the Second Amendment is and why it was written, so let’s go over that. The Second Amendment was primarily created by the founding fathers to give the people the right and the ability to overthrow a tyrannical government. The Second Amendment reads: “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed”. \n\nNow, some people interpret “well regulated” as meaning “strictly under the rule of law” or “under the control of a superior authority”. That is today’s accepted meaning of that phrase, but we need to go by what the words meant when they were written. It has been determined through examination of other documents at the time, that “well regulated” was used to mean “in proper working order”. In the case of a militia this means well trained, well disciplined, well organized, and well equipped. This makes sense, since the effectiveness of a militia is determined by how well trained it is, and not by the rules imposed upon it. \n\nSo to ensure the security of a free state, the militia must be well trained and disciplined, but what is the militia? The nation’s military is not the militia.  The militia is every free and able bodied citizen, and is not under the control of the federal government. Another term that is sometimes, but less often, misunderstood is the term “arms”. The term arms does not mean muskets. “Arms” means, and has always meant “weapons”. So now that the terms have been cleared up, we know that in modern language, the Second Amendment means this: “A well trained and equipped body of citizens is necessary to the security of a free country, therefore, it is the right of the citizens to privately own and use weapons, that shall not be infringed”. \n\nNow on to gun control. I personally am in complete support of “common sense gun control”… but I am also strongly against “common sense gun control”. That might not seem possible, but it is, and there lies the problem. “Common sense gun control” means whatever you want it to mean. Politicians who use this term are being very insincere. It creates a lot of confusion, and leads people to support gun control laws without understanding what they are actually doing. We really need to focus on the content of new gun legislation and not the name of it. \n\nWhen we do look at the content, we see that these “common sense” ideas are uncommon and nonsensical. A popular “common sense” belief is that we must ban these things called “assault weapons”, because they are so exceedingly dangerous and designed to murder people. Surely something like that shouldn’t be in the hands of regular people! Well, just like “common sense gun control”, the term “assault weapon” doesn’t really mean anything. It is used by leftist politicians to describe weapons that look scary. It is not to be confused with “assault rifle”, which is a rifle that is capable of select fire. Those have been banned since 1935. \n\nAlthough definitions vary greatly among different jurisdictions, commonly “assault weapon” refers to a semi automatic firearm capable of accepting a detachable magazine, with a folding or telescoping stock, pistol grip, forward grip, bayonet mount, threaded barrel, flash suppressor, suppressor, muzzle brake, grenade launcher, or barrel shroud. I bet a lot of you don’t know what any of that means, so I show you with an illustration. \n\nAs you can see, absolutely none of those characteristics affect the power of the weapon or what the weapon fires. Banning those things just makes guns less safe to handle, less accurate, and harder to control. I don’t see how that’s supposed to save lives. Other more effective sounding gun control proposals are raised age requirements, taxes on ammunition, gun registration databases, and magazine capacity limits. \n\nAge requirements past adulthood for a natural right are unconstitutional. Taxes would limit the ability of gun owners to practice and this would make self defense shootings less safe. Also, a tax on a natural right is simply unconstitutional. A gun registration database works against the intentions of the Second Amendment, because letting the government know who owns firearms would give it a great advantage should it become tyrannical. \n\nPeople say that if limiting the number of rounds you can can carry saves just one life, then it is worth it. Now first, it would be impossible to measure this. And second, if smaller magazines mean less deaths, then why don’t we just get rid of the magazine? This is just a slippery slope that ends with getting rid of guns. All of these proposed gun laws would violate the Second Amendment. \n\nFortunately, as adults of a free country there are several steps we take to prevent the corrosion of the Second Amendment. Firstly we can strive to better understand the issue by figuring out what the facts are, and whether or not they are relevant. Putting our opinions aside and just searching for the truth will allow us to develop a more accurate perception of what is going on. Knowledge is power. If we know the truth we cannot be deceived into voting away our rights. \n\nSecondly, we can better understand guns by using them. Having personal experience with buying, owning, and using a firearm will clear up any false beliefs that you have about them. \n\nThirdly, we can inform others. Many people have strong opinions on the Second Amendment and gun control but are very uninformed on those topics. With so much misinformation in the media, this is understandable, but not excusable.\n\nwe must understand the “common sense gun control” that we need to resist… but there’s a problem with that. We can’t – and that is because “common sense gun control” doesn’t mean anything. It means whatever you want it to mean. 
3	I like it, I like it.  Can be polished up real nice.  Very good points.  Well thought out.  Great job!\n\n\-Me, a gun owning Libertarian who is greatly biased in judgment because of that. ;)
2	I would agree with you on a lot of points, guns do need to be regulated a bit better (as in more efficiently rather than strictly)
1	Decent Essay, but wrong subreddit to post this on if you want the world to change unless you're just looking for critique and discussion.\n\n>commonly “assault weapon” refers to a semi automatic firearm capable of  accepting a detachable magazine, with a folding or telescoping stock,  pistol grip, forward grip, bayonet mount, threaded barrel, flash  suppressor, suppressor, muzzle brake, grenade launcher, or barrel  shroud.

Banning those things just makes guns less safe to handle, less accurate, and harder to control. \n\nI don't know... I think attaching a bayonet mount and grenade launcher on your "assault weapon" would definitely increase potential danger.\n\n>Thirdly, we can inform others. \n\nAssuming they want to listen and understand. A very common problem for INTPs is trying to reason with ignorant people. It's very difficult to reason someone out of something that they didn't reason themselves into.
1	As an attorney who has litigated Second Amendment issues, I have a very different understanding.  \n\nGiven that the Second Amendment was adopted two years after the Constitution itself, it seems unlikely that our brand new government was ensuring that the people could revolt against it. To my understanding, the Bill of Rights was largely intended to extend certain rights to the people against state and federal government and to preserve the rights of states as autonomous governments. \n\nYou state that the "militia" is  militia is every free and able bodied citizen, but I do not believe that it has ever had that meaning. I agree that a militia is not the federal military. But nor is it individuals acting alone and for their own interests. A militia by definition is an organized group of people who combine for a perceived common good. When the Constitution was enacted, every state had a militia as did many cities. \n\nAccepting your position that "well regulated" means  “in proper working order,” the point remains that the Second Amendment exists to preserve militias. Nothing in the historical record suggests that the Second Amendment was intended to preserve a personal right to possess a dangerous weapon. In fact, the society at the time proscribed many restrictions on personal behavior that was deemed unacceptable. A person who walked the streets of Philadelphia brandishing a gun probably would have been thrown in the stocks. \n\nIn any event, a well regulated militia necessarily has order and rules. It has every right to decide which members may or may not possess arms. After the Constitution was enacted, the primary perceived purpose of militias was to protect states or cities from attack by the federal government or other groups. To the extent that the right could be called personal, it exists only in that context. A person carrying a weapon for his or her own purposes cannot be said to be part of a militia.\n\nYou also need to bear in mind that our founding fathers were eminently practical people. The idea that they would countenance a right for individuals to possess the means to commit mass murder or mayhem is an insult to who they really were. \n\nI also believe that your understanding of "natural rights" is inaccurate. The most fundamental right is probably the right to free speech. However, as Justice Holmes said, "falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic" is not a right. All rights, even "natural" rights, have their limits. \n\nYou make a number of statements as facts that seem to be beliefs.  For example, " Banning those things just makes guns less safe to handle, less accurate, and harder to control." It is hard to see how banning certain kinds of guns would make other kinds less safe, less accurate or harder to control. However, if one starts this conversation accepting those statements as fact, then it would be easy to reach the conclusions that you did.\n\nI agree that we should "strive to better understand the issue by figuring out what the facts are, and whether or not they are relevant." As I see it, that process necessarily starts with setting aside the understanding and beliefs that we bring to the table and attempting to be as objective as possible. That is difficult for all of us. One method is to genuinely advocate against what you believe. \n\nI do not think that I need to use guns to understand them any more than I need to use nuclear weapons. I believe that most people have a general idea of what guns and what guns do. More importantly, we know how lives are affected by them. In 2011,  67,321 persons were victims of a crime committed with a firearm in the United States. Gun violence has increased over the last 3 years. In 2018,  11,984 deaths resulted from gun violence. That works out to 33 people per day. Those deaths included  548 children and 2,321 teenagers. \n\nThe Constitution does not require us to tolerate and endure this violence. Moreover, even assuming that the federal government became tyrannical, guns would be useless in opposition. The military has weapons that render personal firearms irrelevant. In any event, that fight is far more likely to be waged over the internet that on a battlefield. \n\nYou have transformed guns from objects into some kind of talisman. Guns are just things. If you want to join a well regulated militia, have at it. But claiming a right to own a gun for your own personal use under the Second Amendment is not a serious or considered position.
17	Theory: INTPs are acctualy much more sensitive then other people, and they supress emotions because they don't know what to do with them. Write about your opinion about this	
12	Yeah, I can see it. I'm sure socionics probably has some weird high level take on this but yea. For me, I've learned all my life to close myself off to not get hurt and now I'm just starting to undo all that damage I did to myself. Perhaps you are correct that we deep down are sensitive because we are ultimately aware of what goes on through our higher thought process. Maybe we do this to ourselves to put us in a kind of fantasy where we can be happy instead of dealing with the real world issues which often hurt us. I dunno; just speaking off the top of my head if anyone else wants to chime in.
11	I just think its rude to dump emotons on people like toxic sludge.  
5	Before I learned about personality types and the fact that I’m an INTP I always felt like an odd ball that was an asshole and maybe even crazy for not being able to understand others emotions and frequently repressing my own. I just feel uncomfortable with emotions and would actively avoid anything sad (ex: songs, moves, events)  because I don’t like to have that emotion so I just ignore/ avoid it. Now that i now I’m an INTP i have begun to take baby step to develop that function. 
11	Yes. I feel like we value emotion to a much higher extent than the others which is why we use it so scarcely 
6	I am an Intp. I dont know if I am mistyped or not, but I am someone who is fond of romance movies. And what I like most about it is to imagine myself to be in romance. You can see how lonely I am :’).  Sad movies makes me cry easily, but if is not sincere, I will hate it. I can give EASILY of my tears while watching sad movies.\n\nFor the movie example, in my opinion, when I see a logical sad movies, it makes me cry easily. While a sad movies with some fantasies, cannot relate at all (e.g Kimi no Na Wa). I couldn’t comprehend how people said that this is a very good movie, while me trying to let my tears out but its just too hard lol.\n\nIn real life, I wouldn’t really think of anything sad or not. I will organise people in difficulties in their place. For example, beggar should work instead of asking for money etc. But that is me if I look at the person on the surface. If I gained more infomation about the beggar (how his daily life his, his starving family etc), the logical reasoning of what makes the person a beggar makes me feel sad for the person and that reason might makes me to want to help him. My way of trying to understand the beggar is by thinking of being the beggar himself.\n\nI think a healthy intp is actually more sensitive, and it a impossible for them to be a robot. But when we’re in our thinking mode or try to logically think for a moment, that’s the only time we’re being insensitive. \n\n\n\n
7	I'm not sure about the more sensative part.  More sensative than some types sure, but I think introverted types are all pretty sensative. \n\nWell, sure we supress emotion. It's at the end of our stack, so once we get emotional there is nothing left in our deck to help us with it. There is no next step. No extra card to pull out. Nothing to do but shove it down or explode.\n\nThe answer is to have someone close to you who can handle emotion well and understands that you dont to help you through it. You use their stack kinda like a booster pack. I recently just experienced this, and it's amazing. Highly recommend.\n\nIt's like we are a superhero who gets handed a bomb that's about to explode. We either wrap ourselves around it or try to fly it into space. \n\nEnter another superhero or maybe just someone and they take a look, ask a few good questions and push the off button. Bomb does not explode. Everyone is much happier.
3	"INTPs" to me seem very emotionally intense and it's almost a stereotype to say that we feel very deeply, the thing is that we don't show it, we basically show the opposite.
3	I wouldn't say more sensitive than other people, but more sensitive than others might think we are.\n\nThe rest I agree with.
2	I've always felt this way (at least of myself). I think it is true because I actually have a more intimate understanding of my own feelings instead of allowing my emotions to lead me around by the nose. I can't stand it when I read some MB article that calls INTPs unemotional or when someone I know accuses me of being the same. Although I disagree about suppressing my emotions and not knowing what to do with them.\n\nFor me - I only suppress the impulses that my emotions elicit inside of me - but I allow the emotions themselves to ride. My logical process is to factor in the emotional aspects (both the expected emotions of others as well as my own) of a situation/topic into the equation of my understanding and to express those emotions if needed with deliberate care.
2	What do normal people do when they get this sad? -Elliot Alderson (INTP)
2	You are correct.  
2	If we showed our true emotion, the depth that we feel, the intensity that we feel it, we wouldn't be able to function in society. Some people can. It doesn't come rushing out like a busted dam. But we gotta keep that shit contained. There's just too much damage otherwise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuppressing it is the only way we can get through it. Shoving it down and burying it. \n\nLogic is the sole vehicle that we rely on to navigate in this world without the dual companion of emotionality that many are able to embrace and utilize.
1	thats not how emotions work.  \nthe emotional value system will provide a motivation > projection . the rational system will offer another. everyone has internal conflicts. INTPS have a strong rational system that will most likely win. the better the analysis the smoother the win.  
1	Yes and so do intjs
1	I disagree totally. This is pure subjectivity, do you even know how sensitive other types are ? How can you say we are more sensitive ?\n\nThe other day, a girl told me she cried, and it's surprised me, because I (almost literally) couldn't understand why. 
1	It's because of bad Fe and shadow Fi. We have deep emotions but we don't know what to do with them for fucks sake, we just like to sad music and try to chill. My experience anyway,though I'm not sure if I'm INFP or INTP. 
0	I don't think they suppress emotions because they don't know how to deal with them, all we tend to do is analyze them and make plans "ow I am experiencing emotional pain, what course of action can I take to not do that".  \n\n\nEmotional pain is an evolutionary adaptation to make us stay together because that is all survival meant back then (Kurzgesagt, [Lonieless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA&t=634s)). So for us emotional dipshits we may be more receptive to emotions in this way than what is normal for others because of this reason.
0	Gay INTP/INFJ golden pairing/friendship? (INFJ)	I've come across several ideas online saying they have high compatibility, do any gay INTPs have this experience and would you care to share them? and if not, would anyone like to try it for scientific/learning purposes? nothing serious or anything, just along the lines of me being curious since I have an ENTP and INTj as good friends. \[INFJ 25y/o\]\n\nI don't really relate to any of the LGBTQ+ community as much as I want to, I feel like an outsider albeit it might just be from my limited experiences with it, I've read that most gay INTPs kinda feel the same way too on previous threads I've found in Google search results \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINB4: My Reddit history might be embarrassing, I don't usually log in for months and unless I have to
2	Your first mistake was assuming we’d lurk your history but were lazy af to even do that. Second, you’ve now forced me to because you drew attention to it so I wanna know your dirty little secrets. \n\nI can atest to the golden pairing as I have an INFJ friend irl (non romantic) that I love just talking to and hanging out with.

Are you naturally nice, or will it have to be an act? It don't matter. Play this role if you need to until he finds out truth and is too attached to run.\n\nTalk to man. Ask for help! Man wants to help woman, he is investing in you by helping you. Play damsel in distress role (but don't go overboard, yo!).\n\n&#x200B;
3	I (21M) wanna fall in love :(	I've been really lonely over the past 2 years. I can't seem to fall in love long term. I feel like something is broken inside of me. It's like I meet girls, I like them, but I lose interest quickly.\n\nI need help.

Then you will become someone they can proudly appreciate.\n\nThe ones who are best with women are those who can live without them.
2	another person is not going to make your life feel full. You gotta be a fan of yourself, then someone will become a fan too. From there, you decide. 
3	Have you tried chocolate?
2	Nothing wrong with being picky. You have no control over 'fateful meetings', all you can do is focus on how you handle yourself, what you want out of life, and what you need to be a mature, responsible person who brings a few good qualities to the table.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't force good meetings, you can only fuck'em up if you let yourself be bitter and negative and unable to stand on your own two feet. Whoever you might meet in the future's also looking for someone who brings them joy and security and love, not a project they need to love-nurse to stability first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo your own thing, grow into the kind of overall-pretty-awesome person you can be. Someone doing their own thing with a bit of pep and self-respect is attractive all by itself.
1	Loving somone and having crush on somone is huge difference, when you have crush on somone you idealize that person, but when you love somone you know that person with both good and bad sides,and love that person as it is. It's better to alone then with bad person.

1	Don't look for it. Your idea of love might not actually be what 'love' is. You potentially run the risk of meeting someone and ultimately disregard them because of your expectations of what love is.  \n\n\nPersonally I feel like you need relationships, both good and bad , to help build a frame work of knowing you've found the right person. My friend always said 'relationships are like ice cream, you need to try all the flavours before you settle down on a favourite", something along those lines anyway.  \n\n\nThe main thing is to be happy with yourself, no-one else can do that for you  \n\n\n&#x200B;

6	What was the first thing you became obsessed with?	For me it was this high-powered rifle my father kept somewhere in the house, I just couldn't stop thinking about it\n\nBear in mind, I am not from the U.S or anywhere it is remotely normal or expected to just have a fucking gun in the house. My father was not a hunter or a marksman and no one would ever tell me why he had it.\n\nThis thing tho - even apart from the true source of the fascination which was obviously power over life and death, this was just a beautiful object with a smooth and shiny wooden finish, big motherfucking *scope* affixed to the top for seeing distant thing clearly to target them for destruction, neat little box of ammunition next to it in the case.\n\nNow I definitely *had* a comprehensive list of people who needed to be you know, handled, which I regularly maintained and updated. Just the usual, teachers, bullies, and the like. Whether I *consciously* connected this to the gun, not sure, must have on some level. \n\nSince I know what it looked like, naturally I *did* finally get my hands on it one fine day. It was in this utility room that my father kept locked at all fucking times (and I probably thought this was normal too). The PC was in there and I was only granted entry upon request (passwords he had included 'cybershock' and 'kompressor' lmao)\n\nAnyway, I had the gun just laid out on my bed with its case open and my mom caught me and flipped out at *me* which is a bit fucking rich tbh. My grandma used the 'boys will be boys line' which is apt here if it ever was, so I appreciated her having my back. My childhood was an extraordinary education in hypocrisy\n\n\n\nThink they got rid of it after that, not sure. How I learned the thing existed in the first place I can't remember. Must have overheard my mom mention it as she spat venom at my dad one day and just been like, holy shit a motherfucking gun really, awesome\n\nAnd for any uninspired wannabe freudian cuck reading this, YES I glimpsed my dad's dick at a urinal walking into a public bathroom when I was like 3 and wondered why mine wasn't so big (yet) so don't even go there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
3	After breaking some objects when I thought they weren't supposed to break (like most toddlers do), I became obsessed with testing object's resistance. I would force all my stuffed animals, try to go near breaking point (but ensuring not to pass it) with electronics, etc. It was so my family wouldn't yell at me anymore for breaking stuff without me meaning to. That's the earliest obsession I remember.\n\nI still do something similar to this day, but I take note on textures instead.

1	my grandad brought me a BBC documentary one, i loved it. So he brought a dvd (or occasionally an entire set) on his way home every day. It got to the point where we filled an entire cupboard with BBC nature and astronomy documentries.

1	I’ve loved pro wrestling for over half my life, when I first discovered it I wanted to learn everything I could about it. This was during my tween years and I sponged up any bit of information I could find mostly online. It felt like there were parts of my brain that were becoming activated that I didn’t even know existed before. I’m still like this to this day, if you name pretty much any famous pro wrestler I could tell you what show or promotion they work for, whether or not they’re still working, if they’re not when they had their last match, etc. Parents, parents of friends, adults in general were always amazed at how much I was able to learn, especially because I didn’t retain much info in school and my grades weren’t great!
1	Zodiac, all the charts and planets. I used to really believe it. My mars is gemini (mars controls energy I think).

I almost believe it but I think it lacks something, and that is for someone who is obsessed with MBTI to research for.

2	Hey how many of you also suffer from depersonalization and/or OCD?	
2	Yes and yes
2	Both, though I never saw them as connected. If anything, when I was depersonalised was when I felt the least OCD - if reality itself was seen as unreal, the magical realist fantasy bullshit my hellbrain concocted must have been like unreality squared. Fuck, at least you'd *think* that's how it'd work. Man, everyone should lose touch with reality at least once in a while. Shit's too heavy, detox a little. For the sake of your sanity.\n
1	i have depersonalization. it varies in intensity based on circumstsnces but its always lingering. sucks tryna connect with people when you look at them and they aint human anymore \n\ni also suspect i may have pure O OCD, i have no diagnosis, but it seems spot on sometimes
1	Yeah to me it’s not that they’re aliens to me, but that I could be viewing them as such and they’d look the same
1	I have both! Interesting combination, but my DPDR is more “derealization”, and is triggered mainly by overstimulating sensory environments. Add to that the fact that I have Crohn’s-induced Anemia, and the dizziness renders me incapable of driving or often leaving my house.
1	Depersonalization, yes all the time almost all day.\n\nI actually suffer from OCD as well. I saw a therapist about it briefly , found myself avoiding anything that caused me discomfort (could actually help me), and I now  work everyday on letting go of obsessive thoughts inside of my own head.\n\nLife is great :)

2	Didn't know there was a term for it, but moral relativism is why I used to struggle with morals. How could some societies be perfectly fine with slavery, how could the Aztecs (a highly developed society for their time) be perfectly fine with human sacrifice, but the culture I grew up in view those things as unspeakable evils. What makes any of those views more right then the others
1	RemindMe! 7 days ""
1	Considering morals arise from the emotions/psychology/subjective experiences and judgements of humans and there exist no morals in the universe if you take humanity out of the equation, the idea of moral absolutism makes me fucking lmao. Like, really, there is no fucking conceivable way I can think of other than 'well uh, fucking magic I guess' or 'I want things to be this way because complexity makes me cry inside' to support the actual notion of black and white morals existing somewhere in the universe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI certainly have a moral system for myself, as being also a part of this species, with some ethical rules I cannot fucking compromise on.  If your moral rule of 'don't hurt people' is constantly being challenged by 'do what the boss says and if the boss says to hurt people it's okay', your 'don't hurt people' rule was never a rule at all and you cannot fucking claim to actually believe in this tenet (as one example of why I think it's fucking disgusting that conservatives that act like this still have the fucking gall to call themselves 'good people' that care about the health and happiness of others. If an authority is sufficient to make you act like a selfish violent fuckhead, you are not a fucking good person).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, humans are diverse, moral priorities and instinctive feelings are diverse, and context is actually a thing. Reality is stupidly complex and for any clear-cut situation, it's not that hard to come up with a dozen situations where several moral stances are in direct competition with each other. The fact that this can happen means you'd be forced to give differential weight to each moral prerogative in these complex situations, meaning you'd have to start coming up with some kind of hierarchy, priority list, modulations, combinations, anything to help you sort out which moral rule or ruleset will be the one to provide a simple 'this person's action was all bad or all good' answer... i.e. you would no longer be dealing with a simple yes/no circuit at all, since to reach a final result you'd either need to start messing with the purity of your moral rules, or you'd need to compromise and ignore all but the one 'main' rule that you decided on, or you'd need to acknowledge that the result of all of these moral rules given the context now results in a realistically 'mixed' final judgement of 'some of this was good and some of this was bad'.
1	Being Christian, I am an Absolutist.  Though there is a slight amount of relativism in Christianity.  Mainly, sinning against your own conscience.\n\nDrinking alcohol is not a sin.  Alcoholism is, but in moderation it isnt.  But someone could have a conscience that feels that it is sin.  In that case, it is sin for that person to drink alcohol, because it goes against his conscience.  But he can't force his conscience on everyone else, and others shouldnt do the same to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you know the "Are you hiding Jews?" moral dilemma?  Well the answer there is that it is *not* wrong to lie to save innocent life.  So there's a little flexibility there.

1	INTP Tattoos?	If you have tattoos, would love to see what you have.\n\nIf not, what's your thought process behind not wanting one?
5	I have enough qualities that make interacting with normal people difficult, I didn't want to possibly cause career problems or other issues by having people judge me due to tattoos.  There are a lot of people that view them negatively, if you want to get some you need to accept that fact.\n\nAs a life long cannabis user, I also thought it might make interactions with police more difficult.  I have had run ins with police that I truly believe would have ended with me getting arrested had I not looked more professional.\n\nIn my youth I also thought that I may not like the same things later in life, now that I am older, I would be ok with almost anything I would have liked as younger me, but it was a worry nonetheless.
4	I have thought about it, but the idea was never compelling enough to do. The thought of something that would be permanent made me think I had to come up with the perfect tattoo, and I never could.
3	None. Can't fully decide on body part, design, artist and where lol.. Thinking for 10 years now 😳\n\n*Thennn,* I worry about how identifiable tattoos can be lol
3	I would share mine but I don’t know how. I’m working on my half sleeve now and I’m super into tattoos but I’m very specific about what I want
3	I don't decorate my home or my meatsuit.
2	I only have one and I got it about a year ago. I wanted one for years, but could never decide what it would be.\n\nThis is it: https://imgur.com/a/X32nVL5\n\nThe pic was taken right after the tattooist finished working. In English it says "samsara" (it's a Buddhist thing). I really like it.\n\nFor me, tattoos fall in the "less is more" category, so I won't be getting any others.
2	I have a mom heart tattoo on my leg. People can only see it when I’ve got gym shorts on. So even if I’m wearing normal shorts I can still cover it up. Also, it’s a super cliche tattoo so my insecurities were not an issue when deciding whether or not people would make fun of it. Mom hearts are tried and true and it’s sad that I can’t just be confident enough to get whatever tattoo I like, I’m glad I was able to reconcile my confidence with my desire for a lil ink.
1	Did this last summer, my first tattoo. https://imgur.com/a/cCvBEju\n\nDesigned it myself in photoshop and asked a tattoo artist to "print it" on my leg. \n\nEDIT: For many years I didn't like the idea of tattoos at all, by I went through a phase were I no longer care what others might think and that decision marked that phase. Find strength from the past, see today and aim for the future is one of my first interpretation of my tattoo symbolism.

3	Ne-Si thinking chain/stack	Not sure I am an INTP, but I have this thing where I start thinking about something without realizing it and then suddenly stop and ask myself, "Why am I thinking this?” And then I start popping the thinking stack where I can see the relations between thoughts until I find the originating one.\n\nI think this is Ne-Si in action, though I've asked my mom who is likely an INFP and she doesn't relate to this. What about you guys?\n
3	Over thinking about thinking. How INTP of you. 
5	Happens all the time. Use to worry me to. But now I kinda enjoy looking back at the chain of thought
3	I do this a lot, actually
3	Ive started doing that a lot, and it's a very powerful tool.  Particularly when it comes to the ol' feels.\n\nIf Im bummed out, I ask myself "why do I feel this way?", and introspect and break it down until I know why.  Then I can more easily attempt to use my *Ti* to fix it.\n\nOr if angry, I do this: "What do I want? What am I wanting that was denied to me?  Am I owed the thing I want?"  Anger almost always comes from wanting something.  Getting to work on time, someone to treat you respectfully, etc.  
2	Be aware of what you're manifesting	
1	Your manifestation powers are real. Recently, after months of torturing myself and yearning, i manifested the woman i love. To my knowledge she lived in New York but i saw her very randomly at the mall....the vibes were way off. I wanted so badly for this meeting to happen but when it did, I felt the spiritual attacks. She came off very much like she has hatred toward me and her anxious energy made me anxious and sad. Had I been aware instead of being blinded by memories of what we were, I would've known the way she felt about me and not put all of that energy into the universe. Chances are our meeting never would have happened. You must always be fully aware of what you're manifesting. Namaste. \n

2	Translation: "please please follow me but I know you're not going to if I ask you to, so I just tell you not to so you'll want to follow for the trolls."
1	I did not even know that you could follow people here. They really need a manual, a printed one. On paper.
48	Anyone having a problem with falling in love/ getting crushes too easily?	I fucking hate this part of myself and my mind cannot make up its mind
16	Definitely me, sometimes I stay in love for quite a long time too, even if the feelings aren't mutual.
9	I try.  But, i realize i am desperate. I'm 32 and still have not kissed a girl, let alone had sex. So i fall in love or am infatuated with many women.  
10	Yeah, and I do everything I can to be awkward and weird, in order to ruin every opportunity I could have with that person :D
16	As soon as it happens I try to tune it out
8	Even with our logic and reasoning as INTP, falling in love takes no efforts. But I also think we recover easily than most people.
6	I haven't fallen for someone in probably 6 years   The last relationship I had changed me. 
7	I dont fall easily. But once I do, it's *hard* to get out. Time is ephemeral and my love spans years. Currently trying to move on lol.\n\nCrushes are cute though.
7	I used to a lot, but not anymore. I have no idea why, but I haven't had this happen in years now. 
5	I did when I was a free bird. Kinda looked at anyone as potential boyfriend material. Every now and then it still happens when I see someone attractive, but I quickly remember that I'm in a happy relationship with someone who is smart and level-headed. They're only fleeting thoughts for me.
3	yes, but i procrastinate it away.
2	I did in the past, and it painted a huge target on my back for people who wanted to prey on my willingness to do anything for them. I’ve since learned my lesson (in the hardest possible way). I’m not closed off to love whatsoever, in fact I still crave it on some level and know at some point I’ll be comfortable opening up again. I just am also okay knowing that probably won’t be for a while, and that when it does happen, I need to actually be selective and not ignore red flags. It’s kind of a self-esteem thing, I guess? I’m used to instinctively feeling like nobody is ever gonna love me so if someone shows any interest and I maybe feel like reciprocating then I have to reciprocate 200%. And that’s not fair to me, so I stopped. 
2	I realize there are so many unique wonderful people and I don't mind falling in love and expressing it even if it's not reciprocated.\nLove is a wonderful thing.\nI don't see why it's a problem to. Knowing you can let go and find someone else later on. 
2	Opposite. I've never fallen in love, and I don't think I really want to. Having a casual partner (sexual or nonsexual) wouldn't be horrible, but I don't think I could stomach all the lovey-dovey/romancey things. 
2	I have a very avoidant personality but at the same time I crave romantic intimacy the most out of anything in this world.\n\nIt's killing me. 
1	Genuinly curious, why do you INTPs not want to fall in love/limerence/infatuation? \n\nIs it fear, anxiety, or overwhelm or emotions? Or do you truly not want love? 
1	If you mean trynna bone everything that smiles at me then no, no problem at all. Just getting to old. 
1	Quite the opposite
1	I used to have crushes all the time when I was younger. They were agonising because they were always with inappropriate people. Anyway, about a year ago, I recognised I was about to have one with another inappropriate person - - after years of not having a crush - - but I stomped on it by avoiding any interaction with that person. Thankfully it went away before it could take root. It would have been not only awkward but also posed a danger of me betraying my personal bias in a professional setting. Not that I would ever be less than objective at my job. It's the reason why I had to act quickly and box off the attraction. 
1	I don't think it's an intp thing because I'm quite the opposite. I'm actually demiromantic so I don't ever get crushes. I have to be really really emotionally involved with someone to fall in love. 
1	Gah, you guys, I feel so sad reading all this. Also I feel exposed. Currently trying love with a remarkable ISFJ. \n\nPast failures were awful and v hard on me.\n\nYes, I sometimes get crushes. Not a lot. They linger. I don't think would get them if I was in a solid loving marriage. Which I'm hoping to obtain someday with my ISFJ tho the marriage is optional. Too many bad experiences so giving it plenty of time.
1	Sometimes I feel like I'm in love with five different people at the same time because I feel intensely about each one all at the same time because I just have that much emotional intensity. I wouldn't do polyamory though and it's not necessarily sexual.\n\nAlso people think if you really care about someone it must be a sex thing, it's as if, "No maybe I just really want this person to be OK and they are in trouble so I'm very intensely there with them because they need that."
1	Reading this stuff fills me with anxiety.  I already dont like my chances of ever even being in a relationship, but seeing so many others in the same boat is terrifying.  \n\nIve had a girl take a liking to me before.  But I put an end to that, being that she was batshit crazy.  Which probably explains why she did like me.  LOL
1	I personally love pepe easily, but find it very difficult to fall in love. Dated my gf for a full year before I actually knew I loved her. Took me a long time to feel sure she was right for me. If you fall into this boat, just get out there and date lots of people, and give them a chance beyond your initial judgements.
1	doesnt everyone? its not only intp
1	I feel the same way! Many of my friends and just people I've talked to in general say that they think crushing on people is fun, but for me that's just not the case. I get super infatuated super fast, and with seemingly the most random guys. Having crushes is always painful/exciting for me because of how quickly I get emotionally invested. I just can't really be nonchalant about it.
1	Yesssssssssssss
64	A note to myself- an INTP.	I'm almost 30 and still have yet to fully understand what it is that I want to do in life. I have so many interests and my mind just loves hopping from one thing to the next.\n\nPsychology, philosophy, physics, mathematics, music production, industrial design, business, micro/macro econ, data analytics, app development, machine learning.. !! And the list goes on of all the subjects I've dabbled in. I need an intervention!\n\nAny INTP's have the same problem of figuring out what it is you want to do with your life? Do you have it figured out? \nOlder INTP's, what knowledge can you bestow upon younger generations that will make us better off?\n\nSelf discovery, knowledge, and purpose have been my priority, but I also care deeply about the environment and have very strong empathy for animals and people whom are under oppression. I love helping and teaching, but also learning and understanding. \n\nI can't contain myself from detesting popular culture; superficial actions aggrivate me, which pushes me further apart from community and society. I hate texting and small talk, the basis for modern day communication. I've always been an outsider of my own accord and consequence.\n\nI feel as if I have a greater purpose I need to fill, but am severely critical of myself. Holding myself to an unattainably high degree on which I expect everyone else would, but they don't, and I become depressed. The structures I have built in my head over years of countless observations, topples in seconds whenever reality(human emotions) contradicts the patterns of my logic, and I feel lost again. \n\nI, unbeknownst to those around me, reside in the realm of self-doubt, skepticism, and pessimism, despite my outward impression of confidence in my logic. \n\nI can't help but see conceptual webs of interactions; structures that diverge and converge making reality predictable by the patterns of stochastic decisions. \n\nI'm a walking contradiction; I think objectively but reflect subjectively. I'm quiet and reserved but my mind is loud and intrusive; dozens of thoughts, imagery, and ideas every minute of every day, yet they call me lazy, but they have no idea how much work it is, to think, and to think deeply. Someone has to do it. But it takes time, time of which we have so little of in this day and age. No one has time for an explanation. So I sacrifice my thoughtfulness for results, and the results are bad. And now I am useless to my community. \n\nThe ephemeral thoughts that pop in and out of existence faster than I can speak; just so I can feel and sound like an idiot whom has no rhythm of thought. Yet, still able to debate against the articulate extrovert, and crush them. \n\nI know I'm intelligent..  But on a deeper level than I can confide with the world. Maybe our type of mind isn't ripe yet for this modernity. \n\n\n\n\n \n
23	I'm in my 30s and the best way I think I can help is probably not going to sound helpful because it's so simple. Our type tends to overlook the simple though so here goes.\n\nPick something and go for it. If it doesn't work out and you're satisfied that you gave it your best attempt then you have a whole backlog of other things you can try. \n\nSo for now the purpose is to try stuff you think you might like that will also sustain your future. Don't decide what you like before hand and only move forward with the perfect plan. Make moves and make mistakes and always remember, the master has failed more times than the novice has even tried.
7	I'm 35, have a job I hate, but no real idea of what I want to do. Ideally I'd like to help people, but without having to interact with them in person too much. That's why I went into healthcare (I work behind the scenes at a healthcare company). Last year I foolishly decided I could help our department run better if I took a supervisory position, but it's been a disaster for all involved. Right now it just pays the bills while I research other options.\n\n\n\n
8	If you can't find a job that lets you use your intuition, you should find a repetetive job you can do while being able to think freely.\n\nIf your job requires all of your attention and focus, you won't be able to progress through your own train of thoughts, and they are important because without significant interruptions you will eventually find conclusions to them.\n\nEinstein had to make his coworker and friend work his hours at the patent office in order for Einstein to finish his work on relativity. Not because the math was taking too long, but because the work environment required too much of his attention to find conclusions to his intuitive thoughts, which would then lead to his equations, which led to his success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPay attention during training and of course work to be a contributing and competent employee. But once all that becomes automatic, you will be able to think. That doesn't sound like a great way to live, but being able to translate your intuitive thoughts into words and concepts other people can understand will bring you towards that one thing that only you can do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I work I take a piece of paper and scribble the thoughts and images in my mind, and the actual job has become a subconscious exercise at this point. My intuitive focus remains intact most of the time unless I'm targeted by the boss for failing to achieve good enough results or when I'm engaging with other people or colleagues, but that's a part of the job. They're paying you to work for them, and talking with your colleagues will keep you sane and people around you won't be afraid of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut don't tell them that's the reason you work there. Because they will interpret it as you purposely slacking off on the job. If someone wants to know what you're writing or drawing just say it's just a scribble, or something else other than what you're actually thinking about. You can even be creative and hide the idea in symbols only you understand.\n\nYou can't trust anyone with your inner thoughts. Not only will people try to sabotage your work, or convince you that you're wasting your time, they will literally steal your ideas. I swear to god.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it is crucial that you take notes or scribble down images from your mind in some way or another because they will help you pick up on those ideas and continue to iterate them when you get back home. I know, gaming, tv shows, responsibilities. You can probably cut down on one of those and allocate time for your intuition to materialize in art, in writing, in building something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I'm telling you, one day you'll bring home one of those pieces of paper, with something original that you've never heard of, never seen before anywhere, and google won't even produce any results for it. You will have created your own lottery ticket.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut don't wait too long taking advantage of it, because we intuitives have a reoccurring problem which is someone else somewhere who turns out to have been working on the same idea, and beating us to the punch. Often they completely ruin its potential. Just look at the massive projects for movies Stanley Kubrick canceled because someone barely touched on the same subject he was working on in film before he could finish his work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know some of this sounds borderline insane and counter-productive to our lives, and it is, but we perceive time differently because of our intuition which produces thoughts and images that take time to process. Our trains of thought are very long trains with many cars attached to them. We need to keep them on track until those trains reaches their destinations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't have to tell you what happens if you choose to ignore your intuition. You can feel it. It feels like dying slowly. Like giving in. Even if you're "better off" by everyone elses standards, you will always be pretending to be something you're not, while yearning to come back to it again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what I recently did which helped controlling my intuition:\n\nChoose a single subject and try to prioritize your intuition to it. Stay on that one subject as long as you find it possible every day. Write down ideas and even the weak sensations of something nearly becoming and idea, and iterate them. \n\nOnce you have a physical stack of ideas, which now represent a range of your intuitive thoughts, go through them one by one and put them into categories: useful or not, important or not, speculation or fact, subjective or objective, good art, crappy art .etc.\n\nAnd one of those stacks is clearly your favorite one. And if you need to think about something else from a different stack, you'll know where to look. (Get some folders)\n\nIn this way you will have cleaned up some of the mess in your mind. It won't be seen as easily as an incoherent mess anymore.\n\nI was met with a sensation of incredible relief after doing this just once last month.
5	Is there something wrong with wanting to know it all and do it all? I feel like you are comparing yourself to some ideal that fits some people. I think you stated very clearly what it is you want to do. You are already doing it. Don't let life beat you into a mold. \n\nLike how the educational system is a one size fits all system, but we all know it doesn't work optimally for everyone.  It's the same with adult hood. \n\nThere are not many INTPs  thus the world is not set up for us. I read that ISFJ folks dominate as far as numbers go, and they have no trouble settling on something to do. Mainly they become teachers or nurses.\n\nNow I get focusing on something for work to have a career and build a skill set. I have.  The sky is the limit outside of work. Be the INTP you were meant to be and learn about it all. Become a walking encyclopedia. \n\nOr not yanno, it's your life and your time to spend as you like. :)\n\nAt age 50, I am working hard on climbing out of the mold I've been beaten into.
5	I'm just 18 and I have doubts on everything. As you, I like practically all subjects, especially physics and psychology, but I don't know if is it worth to work for this world, for these people, for human race. I don't know if I can believe in something again. It's not about things or animais, it's about all of we. Is it worth to live for this?
7	What a dense and thoughtful post. I am 54 and see some of my former selves in you, but not sure what age.\n\nWhen I was in college, I must have gone through 12 majors. Every new subject was so interesting, and then at the 600 level, it was a lot about nothing. I bailed on Astronomy when the next class was Space Plasma Physics. My mind just did not want to learn any one thing in great depth. I wanted to learn enough about everything to see all the connections. Everyone kept telling me that the world is specializing, that I need to pick one thing and stick with it.\n\nI finally wandered into law school, and it was so wonderful. As a law student, you pretty much take a survey of the law, and all of the parts are interrelated. The law has no "right" answers, and it never even asks the same question twice. When I graduated, I was offered positions in bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions, and tax law. But that was just more specialization, and I said no. My practice literally consists of anything that interests me for people I will feel good about representing.\n\nI am not saying to go to law school. You could if it is a fit, but my point is that some people are not meant to become specialists. If everyone were a specialist, then no one would see the big picture or the connections between things. This world does have a place for such people. And these days, people who choose to define their position can get away with it. So you might want to look for positions that match your interests and abilities, or make one up if you have to.\n\nI also would comment that you seem to be harshly judgmental about yourself. You say that you have empathy for animals and the oppressed, but you seem to have no time for community and society, meaning other people. I was that way for so long (less empathy for animals maybe). For me, finding peace and meaning required that I stop judging myself, and that required me to stop judging others. Through a deliberate mindfulness practice, I came to understand that I am not my mind, and that thoughts and emotions are things, not me. Zen meditation is similar. \n\nYou seem to think that something is wrong with you, but it does not look that way to me. You need to live your life and become the person you want to, not let others tell you how to live. You know your abilities.  Trust them.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Maybe you should focus a little more on self-discovery and humility for the time being.
2	It's funny how intps have the same interests almost to a T. My list looks almost exactly like yours and I struggle with inaction as well- but I'm working on it. \n\nMake lists on paper with all your interests. \n\nRank them in different categories based on usefulness/necessities... I know that isn't clear but once you start it kind of makes sense.\n\nSplit it all up into long/medium/short term goals.\n\nBuild your day to day routine around things that require daily attention- like practicing guitar, work/school, diet, cooking, exercising.... All the little stuff. Make meal plans, exercise logs, AND PLAN YOUR MONTH OUT WITH DAILY SCHEDULES. Go get Excel templates. \n\nMake a schedule and work on building routine .\n\nPut steps into place to obtain your medium goals, like if you want to go back to school start that.\n\nBuy a few books on philosphy. Stoicism, Machiavelli, learning-I just read "art of learning" and am working on "unlimited memory" ... Learning is the building block for everything. \n\nTurn your environment to work for you. Remove distractions. Get the lighting right. Etc etc. \n\nTake your long term goals and see how you want to live down the road. Who do you want to be? \n\nPersonally I am bartender and that does a great job of being flexible and providing a comfortable living. I go to community college (I already have my bachelor's) to get associates degrees in a few subjects like business, web dev, and linguistics. I want to be able to learn both spoken and computer languages with ease, as those two things are going to be INSANELY important/already are. I try to learn instruments (taking a guitar class) and python programming (joined club) in my free time. I also signed up for some classes at the rec center to learn simple things like sewing. My goal is to pay my bills through different gig type jobs or repairing and selling different things. But bartending really does take care of me perfectly. \n\nKeep journals and write yourself reminders/motivation.\n\nRead. Meditate. \n\nRemember that the smallest steps have the biggest impact, as long as you keep walking.
2	Wow. I felt this 
2	I'm 21, and for me knowing it all (or some of it) is the way to satisfaction. Sometimes I have this itch for some subject and I NEED to learn it. But I feel proud of what I know and I know some of everything...\n\nI am currently in a masters course, pursuing bioinformatics (due to the INTPness) and I have been learning guitar, drawing, physics, chemistry, mathematics and history SIMULTANEOUSLY!!\n\nSo yeah, there is no problem in trying to learn everything...\n\nPs. I know I'm younger than you guys but I had realised the INTP in me while I was 16 or 17 so I had a lot of time to ponder about it :)
2	>I have so many interests and my mind just loves hopping from one thing to the next.\n\nhaha.... I have so few interests in life I can't even find a hobby let alone something I want to do for a career. \n\nDAE depression? 
2	This sounds exactly like me.  To the letter, and I mean literally.  I am almost 30 as well, same passions, same dilemma.
2	Become a system admin / architect. ;)
2	you are searching for permanence in an ephemeral world, and take issue that time only really flows in a single, relentless, direction.\n\n\nlearn to find beauty in impermanence, or you *will* go nuts. \n\n\n[whatever you want to do, do it, and do lots of it.](https://excellentjourney.net/2015/03/04/art-fear-the-ceramics-class-and-quantity-before-quality/) if you don't like the results, do something else.
2	I am like that too. Just find a secure income for your basic needs or find a partner with a constant job. Then just live your life hopping from one thing to other.  Explore the world and your interests. Find ways to use your diverse knowledge.  Keep in mind, whatever you are, hard work is what that will take you there. 
2	Can relate to a lot of what you are writing. If I would recommend one thing it would be to try something not related to knowledge as a hobby. For instance I sing. At home. It is a nice way to connect with them pesky feelings :) I guess playing an instrument or dancing or maybe improv theather could work to. Just a suggestion. 
2	Passion is important to start something. But it's not sustainable in the long run. You will need discipline if you want to keep focus on 1 field and reach mastery level in it.\nThis is what lack from INTP, because our brain easy to recognize pattern and put even fague interconnecting lines between things. \nThe best way is try to discipline yourself. When you were young, it is easy as you have your parents around. But if you're an adult, it won't be easy, but it doesn't mean it's impossible.
2	Don't worry, having a range of interests will actually work in your favour, due to the world transitioning into the gig economy (like having many short term jobs etc.)  Do what you love, and don't feel the need to take up a mundane job just to pay the bills. (you can do this through other means, like tutoring people in subjects you like) As an INTJ with many close friends expressing your dilemma, all I have to say is, when there is a will, there is a way. All the best! :)
2	I have to preface that I consider myself very lucky.  Despite my life being full of struggle, sorrow, traumas, I am grateful I managed to persist and find and stay true to myself in spite, and exactly because of the whole shitstorm that life can sometimes turn into. \n\n\nBottom line: We live here and now. Find ways to bring good to the society. Be useful. Act, move! Pace and speed are irrelevant, as long as you're applied.\n\n\nI managed to tap deep into the love that I have for humanity, and am working to bring it about every day. Educating self, others, keeping chaos at bay, being good and productive proffessional that adheres to my own standards, caring about people who will consume my work - are just some of the goals I strive to achieve. \n\nI'm not interested in the degree of success, so to speak. I don't want fame or attention. Most of days I arguably fail in many ways than one, but that is irrelevant - I go at it the next minute, hour, day. In spite of everything. And because I can.\n\n\nShameless plug for Stoicism. Read upon it, hone your values, bring them about in the world. \n
2	Everything you said is... Well... Me, and I've come to think that I think I'm trying to find the cohesion point of all my interests. That point where the chaos of the system is also a part of the order of it and I'm able to live in there just experiencing everything from both sides with only the slightest margin for bad shit happening, both introverted thinking and extroverted intuition in equatable measure. Honestly, I'm just hoping that in that once in that place the amount of time I spend outside my comfort zone, doing all those things that I'd rather leave to others to do while I disconnect from the world and collect my data is justifi(-ed/-able)\n\nI'm 28
2	Live an unexpected life.\n\nOnce I started embracing this, I became more content with the randomness and tendency to move from one interest to the next. I recognize what I’m doing right now might be very different than what I’m doing in 5 years and I’m finally ok with that. So basically I stopped doing mental loops with wtf am I doing with my life. Because I realized I have no idea and prob never will. But this has made my life random as hell, which I realized is kind of cool. I went from being an investment banker and now work in west Africa in development field. 
2	Man, I really relate to this. I hope I won't still feel this way in 4 years time.
1	The answer is simple. You want to amass knowledge with your life
1	I'm 19 and haven't evem started college for I'm confused about what i really want, everything seems fascinating 
1	I like a lot of the arguments you propose. You have some really valid points that tie the he fundamental laws of physics, including thermodynamics and entropy. Buuut alas, not even theoretical physicists of our time are certain about the uncertainty.\nI really doubt we have, at this point in time, the necessary tools to fully comprehend the dynamics of the universe. When we do, however, I believe it will be with new physics, and new mathematics, and it will completely upend our current comprehension of reality. So I'll keep my mind open for the time being, we could and most likely are both wrong lol.\nOn a side note, I spent a lot of time thinking and asking myself questions about the nature of things, like you I find all of it fascinating, better than fiction.\nI wonder if you've come across this thought before, but nothing in the universe is absolutely immobile. And so if all that exists is motion, it may very well be that we are made up of just quantum reverberations.\nI like where the mind can explore, limitless. Places the body cannot. This is a fun little discussion on the quandries of our universe. 
1	I am 17 and exactly like this. I have no idea what to do with my life, but i always thought i would figure it out someday. But now, seeing that you are 30 and still confused, depresses me.
1	Choose something that combines all of those topics, like architecture. It's what I do and I love it.
1	> Any INTP's have the same problem of figuring out what it is you want to do with your life? Do you have it figured out?\n\nAsk yourself the opposite, what is it that you don't want, and why ? Once you have a list, you can start orienting yourself\n\nMine, is that I don't want to be shackled to anything, and not to something too annoying/tiring. I want freedom/autonomy. Then, the question is on the nature of said freedom/how I define it, and how to obtain it ?\n\n> I also care deeply about the environment and have very strong empathy for animals and people whom are under oppression.\n\nFunny how you put the animals before people. Very INTP of you (stereotypically)\n\n> I feel as if I have a greater purpose I need to fill\n\nYeah, you don't. Fate doesn't exist, and your feeling can't say whatever the fuck they want, it won't change that\n\n> I, unbeknownst to those around me, reside in the realm of self-doubt, skepticism, and pessimism, despite my outward impression of confidence in my logic.\n\nCould be more visible than you think, but again, I'm called arrogant quite often, so if you're like me, maybe not\n\n> 
0	r/iamverysmart
0	Are we introverted or have we all come to realize how useless normal social interaction is? If everyone was an intp would we be entps?	Just curious. 
5	It's anything but useless.
2	I think that a lot of INTPs go through a time when they tell themselves that social interaction is useless. But for the vast majority of us, it is a temporary thing. 
3	What makes us suck in relationships?	Does anyone else always strive to better their partners?\n\nI used to. I'd always do my best to gently point out irrational / self destructive behaviour and help to correct it. It was an act of love for me, and I was aware that it might come off condescending, so I did my best to be gentle with my phrasing and to always explain why I was even trying to help. \n\nHowever, I've come to believe that helping out like that will come off as condescending no matter what you do and will slowly breed resentment. I think sometimes it's better to keep our observations to ourselves because emotional people never seem to take kindly to well meaning criticism no matter how you phrase it. It just comes off as an attack on them.\nDoes my conclusion make sense and has anyone else had experience with something similar?\n\nWhat other "flaws" do we have in common as INTP's that we might overlook when it comes to relationships? 
5	Generally people rather want to hear comfortable lie, then uncomfortable (rational) truth, and yeah this shouldn't stop you to say something that is logical. Of course if you see that person is angry, wait until there is right moment or something like that. And yeah If you tried something multiple times and there is no result you should give up (but not easily). And some persons just do whanever they want until they seek consequnces, and some don't stop even when there are very bad consequences. So always do best you can. And of course don't critise people in life threathing situations for you and if you see that there is no any effect.
3	NTs in general have the problem of overlooking emotions in favour of logic. While your partner will probably acknowledge that that's just how you work and will make changes for you, in no way should you say "my job is done here". If you have feeler partner please don't throw "Hey maybe you can do this" only, but add some "Hey i love how you do that/when you do that" too. Relationships are for mutual growth, and if your partner feels that it's only them who give and not recieve, talking things out is the best.\n\nI know you guys usually run from emotions. Trust me Fi isn't very good at sharing and talking about more complex feelings either. But if you ignore your partner's way of thinking in favour of yours, it's not gonna be a healthy relationship in the long run.
3	My version of help doesn't seem to be the help they want.\nSolving problems is apparently less useful then telling someone "it's ok" 
4	The flaw here is not them, its you. Sometimes being a partner means you have to overlook someone's flaws. Sometimes people are not looking for you to correct them or save them or show them the better path out. They are looking to you for support because they find comfort in you. By trying to "fix" them, you are telling them they are broken. Your intentions may be to help them and it's because you care but to them, they do not see your intention; they only see the result of it. The reason we suck or rather you in this case at relationships is because you lack that discretion in when is it right to correct someone and when is it right to leave them alone and be ignorant about something. You can communicate intention too and explain to them but sometimes that's not what someone wants to hear. Sometimes they just want to get a hug or have you say "that really sucks im sorry". You need to open up your emotional quotient; that's what makes us suck at relationships the most.
5	Think about it for a second.  How would you react if people in a relationship tried to "better" or "fix" you? Not very well, I imagine. Everyone has a narrative in their head telling them that they are just fine, thank you.\n\nPeople do not have relationships to be improved by others. Human relationships are inherently based in accepting each other for who and what we are. The good news is that means others accepting us as we are.\n\nWe INTPs also like to say that we have objective observations, but in truth, we are making judgments. And judgments are always subjective. We tend to judge ourselves most harshly, which is root cause of a lot of our angst.\n\nFor me, mindfulness was what changed things. I came across it at age 45 and wish that I had discovered it earlier.
2	I get it, it feels like we aren't being genuine if we hold back the truth so as to not hurt their feelings.\n\nThere are "tougher" partners out there who can take stuff like this from you, and maybe benefit from it.
2	Think of it like color blindness - sometimes others just can't see it and they never will. But you must always realize that the same is true of yourself.
2	For me it's trying too hard to be like the other person and being too afraid to truly be myself. I'm very conflict-averse and afraid of humiliation.
2	Answer to the tittle + your question at the end : Not much "presence", and not much emotion.\n\n* Se deals with all the sensory thing happening in the outside world, and it's our PolR. We not only don't value it, it's as weak as our Fe (further amplified by our avoidance of it). One important thing here (amog others) is bodylanguage. You know, that thing that is said to account for 70% of communication ? We are blissfully unaware of it. Bodylanguage includes touching people, your positioning & how you occupy space, how you move (rythm and all), your posture, and of course, facial expression. Even when talking verbally, your timbre, tone, pitch and volume are more important than what's being said... Ever had someone tell you to stop being angry at them, while you weren't really angry ? Bodylanguage. I'm not going too deep into this, and it's not like understanding of bodylanguage is that widespread, but at least, other people are paying attention to it somewhat, us, not so much. I think we basically are deadfish/poker face all day, rather elusive, or too communicative if we are invested in the topic (Say, someone said something stupid or an argument) **Anyway, we ignore all thoses things in the Se domain, sometime, we're so much in our heads/absent, that we literally aren't "here"... Ever tried to see how much time you spent in your room or whatever ? It's a big chunk, probably, especially compared to others. When they say 80% of success is showing up, they mean it**\n* Fi deals with all emotions, etc, and while we're not emotionless robot, or totally ignorant of what we like or dislike, Fi is not something we value, at bets, it's something we work a bit on to navigate the world better, thus, it's claled the "Role function" in socionics, because it's a role you play, like a mask. We simply don't have much drive here, so, all thoses "I love you", or whatever ? We don't say them, and we don't actually understand why they are even wnated, much less "*necessary*" for others. \n\nGood news is, as your Super Ego block, you can consciously work at thoses two functions. Try to pay attention/spend time with people. \n\n***\n> I used to. I'd always do my best to gently point out irrational / self destructive behaviour and help to correct it. It was an act of love for me, and I was aware that it might come off condescending, so I did my best to be gentle with my phrasing and to always explain why I was even trying to help.\n\n> I think sometimes it's better to keep our observations to ourselves because emotional people never seem to take kindly to well meaning criticism no matter how you phrase it. It just comes off as an attack on them. \n\nYeah, not everyone values criticism. When I give critics on art or writing, if it's not explicitely asked for, I will prefaces it with "If you want some constructive criticism" or whatever to ste people in that "mood", otherwise, they often take it as insults/personally.\n\nTypology wise, I would say some type are more sensible than others : \n\n* Ni dom. They have high Ni, low Se. Meaning they abstract a lot, have an idea/clear vision in their head, but they don't really look at the Se reality (much like we dsuck at Fe). To be honest, **they have an certain idea of themselves**, like a mini movie that over between reality and fiction, between wishful thinking and facts. If you present evidence/do something that's contrary to **that vision/image of themselves, it can be a very big blow to their ego**. If you say something bad  about INFJs socially on their subs or r/mbti, you can be sure there's going to be a few offended ones trying to correct you, blame it on something else, or say "Not all infjs". (E.v.e.r.y fucking t.i.m.e). Their Fe is their pride, but Ni amplify it. For INTJs, prove them wrong Te wise, and see their pride/ego crumbling. It's crazy. They thrive on being knowledgeable/right.  (Btw, we share that high ni, low se weakness, with the Te option too. But unlike INTJs, it's in our shadow/unvalued functions, so it's not as bad as that's not something we value. Say, we can be very fine with our own incompetence, with our TiNe, however, not so much. Anyway, that negative Ni self-image destruction can pop up sometimes and bite you in the ass, be wary)\n* F types : They don't operate like we do on a true/untrue, logical/unlogical basis. But a like/dislike, valued/unvalued basis. So, when criticized, Feelers feel devalued and disliked, they don't care about what you say. It's actually that simple. There's variations, of course, with the interplay with other functions, or Fi vs Fe : Criticize an FI user could be the equivalent of saying "I don't like you", criticize an Fe user can be like saying "You're unvaluable to/unwanted by the group". I dunno how they perceiveit actually, but I guess it's quite harsh for them.\nDo note, though, the opposite is also (obviously) true, compliments means you value/like them, and you're propping their ego up. So if a feeler has a "bad day" (whatever that means, dunno if you guys experience thoses, but I don't unless something absolutely awful happens to me), you can consider that they feel disvalued/disliked, and thus "need" compliment to remplenish their reserves. \n\nOf course, all of this matters even more if they like you/value your opinion... Seems silly, but it seems it's how other types work. \n\nBest way to be listened is probably to not be too critical. Especially of types with low Ti, say, ESFPs/ENFPs. Maybe throw a compliments or two before the criticism, or give some afterward ? Or say "You're great, but here's how to be even greater" ? Dunno exactly, I'm theorizing here.\n\n***\n> However, I've come to believe that helping out like that will come off as condescending no matter what you do and will slowly breed resentment.\n\nDepends on which function is targeted : \n\n* First and Second won't accept help since you pride yourself in them. So, don't...\n* Fifth and Sixth will be perceived as annoyance, especially since you're rather competent here. Pride also applies here. \n* The third accepts to be helped in little doses, but not too much. Say, parents telling you "clean your room" Si ? Annoying if repeated to often, wasn't it ?\n* The 4th appreciates help/explanation most of the time. Say, someone explaning how others felt at a moment Fe wise ? It's good. \n* As for your 7th and 8th function, it's disliked, but you also feel "powerless" For example, for us, the unfamous "You should smile more" ? That's FiSe self expression. (They are right, tho, you should work on that FiSe...)\n\n\nSo yeah, resentment for all the shadow is pretty plausible. Eitheir pride speaking, or insecurity for the 7th and 8th (if you're not recognized as a competent authority or whatever on the subject). 1st and 2nd will be prideful too, but they may rebuke you gently here with a smirk, and threads lightly on the third.\n\nOnly the 4th function really like helps.\n
1	I'm gonna turn 49 this year. I have no answers. No matter now hard I try, and I try hard, it never works for me. \n\nI know I'm the problem. I fall for these people. Then it turns to shit when they show what shitty people they are.  \n\nI think I have a good thing with my ISFJ gf except it's long distance, though we visit every month or two. Her idea of enough communication is a phone call every 3 days or so. My idea of enough conversation is exchanging texts a few times a day, and maybe a phone call. I expect this to be what finally ends it. I hate it because she is awesome, but I need more frequent contact. I am working so hard to communicate my needs.\n\nI can't win. I can't stop trying. My life is hell. LOL\n\n
1	Yea don’t offer this type of “help” unless its specifically asked for
1	It sounds like you were just a lot smarter than those partners.  You need a partner as smart as you or life will be hell
1	trying to figure out whats wrong with me constantly.... or maybe its just being an INTP?	i’m pretty scatterbrained and i usually need a lot of caffeine + an adderall or something to say what i actually have to say so i might trail off or say some shit that makes no sense but whatever. for as long as i can remember my internal monologue has been me hectically trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me - even in the middle of conversations, going to school, its just a paranoid daze. i compare myself and my mannerisms to other people, some of whom i barely even know in my head constantly, obsess over my identity and freak the fuck out whenever i grow out of whatever phase id been going through. i desperately try to express all the interests i have through fashion, collages, or whatever medium i can find, probably out of desperation to express something about myself thats there besides a monotonous, moody, awkward, teenage boy. im constantly dissociated from all of my surroundings and analyzing every situation im in vigorously to the point where i cant even enjoy it. i dont remember the last time ive felt present in my entire life and ive ruined many close relationships including my girlfriend of 2 years due to my excessive fantasizing about being somewhere better, with someone better, and recreating myself. i cant hold a conversation for the death of me and wish i could just be brutally honest all the time. i never know what i want and end up leading people on, making unnecessary changes, and just fucking people over in general because of it. im at the point not even sure whether anything im typing is true or if im just desperately trying to explain why i am the way i am. sometimes i idolize people i dont even know and start dressing like them and comparing myself to them as a way of somehow finding my identity. my motor skills are shit and i absolutely cannot get any work done at all, clean, or make art, even though i say art is my passion, although i dont even know if i actually like it. im in my extra year of high school and all of my friends are hectically applying to universities and building their portfolios while im just fixating on bizarre fucking internal psychological shit and diagnosing myself with disorders in my head, sometimes i feel like its all i talk about and it pisses my close friends off and im worried theyre gonna get sick of me and that im not truly liked by anyone. ive convinced myself that i have aspergers, maybe narcissistic personality disorder and even possibly borderline but none of it really makes sense at all. therapy doesnt help because i dont feel present enough to listen to any of the shit theyre saying. i find myself using stimulants to cope with my thinking process and figure shit even though it usually just makes it worse and makes my fixations even more intense. i know that wasnt linear or easy to understand at all but please let me know if anyone relates to any of this bc i think im insane.\n\n\n
2	Some part I can highly relate. I thought it was not an intp thing but here you showed me, and I am the similar to you! For the part about how you try to follow what others are doing/trying to be them is what I can relate. For mine, this is going to be a bit strange. I don’t know if I am gay or not, but it is obvious that I love a man’s body, while quite disgusted to women’s. But to have sex with a man? No, it is disgusting to me. Women? Yes and plus I’ve been longing for a partner for so long, but still dont have one. So from this information I just realized that I am idolizing something that I dont have, which is a perfect male’s body, and that is to hide my insecurities that I dont have that body.\n\nAdditionally, I tried to mimic others, how others are socialising. I think this is due to me lacking the skills (inferior Fe). I actually am now mimicking how my enfj friend becoming interested in a conversation, mimicking to say no and some hand gestures from an istp etc. \n\nI also have stimulants to counter all these, which is by fapping (/masturbation). I was doing that everyday, and that of course made me more depressed. I also listened to depressing songs and just cry. I think of unreasonable thing of why people doesn’t want to interact with me and so on.\n\nI think you should stop the similar routines like I did above. Try to talk more, with inferior Fe you can do this, although only on the surface. But as you keep making friends, you will find friend that would loves your around (for me it’s an ESFP). Dont try to really think of how intp is actually a robot, no emotion etc. I do have emotions and can cry easily, but the only time Im being insensitive is when im in my thinking mode.\n\nI’ve said that I’ve been longing for a partner right? That is how I imagine myself to be in better condition / basically me being insecure. I love watching romance because it usually ends up with a good ending (and I imagine myself to be the male character). But reality is not like that. So stop thinking about that, STOP TRYING TO ENTER THAT TYPE OF THINKING. I know how comfortable and pleasureable it is to think about all that. I’ve been there and I know a fellow intp can control themselves from going into that realm.\n\n\nJust remember, I used to be like you but now I am much better. You can change, just like me an intp. Sorry for my bad english, and please take care of yourself. Just ask me if you have more questions\n\nEdit:\nI forgot one thing. I always hate myself for not having topics to talk about with my friends. My only conversation was to talk about subjects we took at schools. And that’s all. I actually think about how I want to be the top at my school so that I would be famous and people would be more willing to talk to me, and therefore have more friends (one of my ideal and unrealistic imagination, just like yours)\n\nTo counter these, I try to find out what people are interested in. For me I choose anime and a game that is currently famous (e.g maybe something like Apex Legends?). This is a way for you to survive so that you can have something to talk to with people, and as for me, they come naturally to me just to talk about the game we played together (which is our common interest). 
1	I feel the same way. I don’t what to tell you. Life is confusing, relationships are hard, having responsibilities is hard. I don’t know if I’m either too nice or not nice enough. I over think things too much. I need more money but I already feel burnt out. I feel like you either have to be an asshole and get into business or you have a passion that you get underpaid for. I need a plan but I can barely focus on what I need to be doing right now. I’m in my 30s btw. At least now I feel like my system and life hasn’t really been neither less or more effective than that of my peers. So theres that.
1	First, you sound perfectly fine. Every INTP I have known struggled in high school. There is nothing wrong with you.\n\nHowever, you are doing a bang up job of creating the illusion of problems. I think I lost count at 50 finding the judgments in your post. It is funny that we INTPs are so prone to judge ourselves. \n\nI believe that INTPs tend to miss out on early emotional regulation because our thinking develops so quickly. As a result, we sometimes try to deal with emotions by thinking about them. We need to know what caused them, so we replay the events over and over again in our heads, which just reignites the emotions.\n\nI realized this later in life than I would care admit, but 45 would not be far off. The thing that helped me most was dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which is loosely related to cognitive behavioral therapy. DBT is based in mindfulness, while CBT is more cognitive. CBT most made my problems worse. If DBT is available to you, then you might want to give it a try. Although it is relatively new, it has been more validated in studies than any other modality of therapy.\n\nA lot of the benefit of DBT is accessible with mindfulness alone. Mindfulness means fully present and aware in the present moment. When I started, I realized that none of my mind was in the present moment. Half was rethinking the past, and the other half was worrying about the future. \n\nMy life changed when I realized that I am not my mind, not my thoughts, and not my emotions. I was always certain that I was my mind, and that my thoughts were pure expressions of who I was. Thoughts are just things that my brain does. They are events, and they have no truth. Although I let my mind go where it wanted for so long, I can decide what to think about and even what to think. Emotions are things that happen to me. I cannot control my emotions, such as deciding not to be angry or sad.  However, I am in complete control of how I react to them. Like thoughts, emotions are just things. I need to recognize them in me and identify them. But I do not have to let their impulses become my actions. \n\nIf you look into mindfulness, your first reaction probably will be to reject it as rubbish. Fight that temptation and suspend disbelief. Better yet, take half an hour right now and listen to the meditations at [https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/programs/mbsr/Documents/MP3/15\_Min\_Lovingkindness.mp3](https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/programs/mbsr/Documents/MP3/15_Min_Lovingkindness.mp3) and [https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/programs/mbsr/Documents/MP3/10\_Min\_Wisdom\_Meditation.mp3](https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/programs/mbsr/Documents/MP3/10_Min_Wisdom_Meditation.mp3)\n\nThey are offered by the Mindfulness Center at the University of California Dan Diego. Its website is [https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/pages/default.aspx](https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/pages/default.aspx) and it has many audio files at [https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/programs/mbsr/pages/audio.aspx](https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/programs/mbsr/pages/audio.aspx)\n\nLastly, I caution you against putting a name on your state or letting anyone else do it. The mental health profession loves to put labels on people and say what is wrong with them. You are experiencing the same things that countless other INTPs before you have. Nothing is wrong with you. Your life might be better if you learned a few skills and practiced mindfulness, but you are not broken. 
3	INTPS and (quitting) adderall/similar drugs?	Hi everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I've been prescribed adderall about 2 and 1/2 years now, and I've developed a real love-hate relationship with this drug. I started on it halfway through college to treat ADD (although I'm not convinced I actually have ADD), as I was starting to seriously slip in school and my doctor said it would help me focus, and it most certainly did help in that regard. The first year or so it felt as though I'd found the answer to all of my problems: I exercised more, socialized more, studied more, and overall just seemed to be living better. I would even say it helped me grow as a person because it made me open up to people in ways I never had before as it gave me a tendency to say whatever I was thinking/feeling (this has produced both very good and very bad outcomes for my personal life, but for the first couple years I felt as though it was better than my prior norm of inaction).\n\nBut over the last 6-8 months I've began to feel more and more just the negative effects of this drug, and I've been experimenting with not taking it for a few days at a time to see how it affects my personality and the way I think. I graduated in December, so I recently took my longest break from it (about three weeks off from Jan 15th-Feb 7th) since I didn't necessarily have to depend on it to do well in school, and in the latter part of that break I felt like I was becoming myself again once my body began to readjust. I felt like I regained my abstract thinking ability, dry humor, and curiosity, but didn't return to my old ways of inaction and social ineptitude.\n\nAt this point my cons list for adderall goes something like this: I've become more and more dependent and expect I'll have to keep raising my dosage if I stay on it, my once-newfound openness has just become oversharing, I get fixated on little things way too often (very often my anxiety) and thus am not as creative of a thinker despite my raised productivity, it makes me more reactionary/quick to respond without thinking things through (a few people, including a girl that I'm crazy about, have told me in the last few months that I seem easily offended these days and less able to take a joke, which is a trait I hate to see in myself), and it just has numerous negative effects on your overall health that I fear letting continue through adulthood.\n\nAnd my list of reasons to stay on it is basically just because getting off of it will be difficult and will likely prolong my current job hunt. Not sure if it's better for me to wait until I get settled into a job before getting off of it or if this is the ideal time to do it since I don't have any immediate responsibilities (I can afford to wait 2-3 months before getting a job at the moment).\n\nSo yeah, that's a brief summary of my experiences with adderall and my rationale for quitting. I'm going to visit my doctor later this week and ask what she recommends in this situation. What are you guys' experiences with these kinds of drugs? Any tips for quitting and readjusting?\n\nedit: dammit didn't mean to capitalize the S in INTPs in the title

2	I've been on Vyvanse for almost 9 years. Vyvanse is similar to Adderall with the main difference being that it lasts for about 12 hours instead of 4. I take it every day rather than "when I need it" like a lot of Adderall users do.\n\nWhen I first started ate age 17 I was suffering from depression in addition to ADHD and this was basically a miracle drug that felt like it fixed everything from the very first moment it kicked in. I didn't just care about school (a life first) I kicked ASS at school, and I suddenly felt the urge to share myself and be involved in the world around me instead of harboring contempt for all the normal and capable people out there. Also made me significantly better at video games and I got back to a normal weight. I was always the chubby kid who LOATHED gym and it turned me into a top-tier runner (amphetamine is a PED after all -- I never competed in anything just FYI).\n\nFast forward to today and it's a significantly different picture. All the little peripheral benefits are still there, but it has turned me into a complete robot. I've lost my creativity, I have next to no spontaneity and I'm prone to getting stuck in a rut with everything. I live my life in a shell doing the same things for weeks at a time. Breaking the routine is particularly uncomfortable and an emotionally "invasive" experience. I used to be interested in a much wider variety of things but now all I do is play the same single video game for months and months at a time and it feels "wrong" to try a new game if I'm not "done" with it yet. I wasted 3 years of my life at a low paying part time job while living with my parents because it was a stable routine, and although I've finally moved on into a middle class career field I'm still procrastinating on significant life steps like moving out and buying this new vehicle I already have my sights set on. All for no reason other than it's outside of my scope of routine and normalcy. I'm also more reclusive and socially anxious than I've ever been. At my last job I LITERALLY didn't talk to anybody for the whole 3 years unless it was purely business, and at this job my complete inability to speak to people for help has made my acclimation an excruciatingly slow process. I didn't try to fraternize with a single soul until about 8 months in when a coworker basically said fuck it and forced me to be social with him and his group (complex situation, hard to summarize accurately, but essentially I would not have been social at all if not for this extremely blunt outside intervention). On top of all this, I've lost a significant portion of my ability to feel accomplishment or ambition in the first place. \n\nI'm also long since dependent now. Skipping even a single day gives strong flu/hangover type symptoms that essentially ruin the entire day. Can't do anything, work nor play. I haven't seen what my "natural self" was like in nearly 9 years, or actually it's even more because I was suffering from severe depression for 3 years prior. Basically I have never been my baseline adult self and have nothing to go by. Taking a break from the medication is going to take a months-long weening process so I've been reluctant to try that just as an experiment.\n\nI'm also suspicious that I'm still depressed underneath all this and that the Vyvanse is giving a false appearance. It feels like I'm "depressed but physically incapable of sadness", in the same way that the drug makes it physically impossible to sleep while active.
2	Just stop altogether if you can. Unless you’re writing super long essays or something for school you ABSOLUTELY must get done. It turns people into weirdos. Me included. Can’t wait to stop. 
2	Thanks for sharing.I find it so interesting. I tried to get prescribed because I tried my friends while drinking and it was so much fun! The ladies were far more interested in me than usual that night (hm?)\n\n\nTurns out my doc was skeptical. Sounds like the substance has diminishing returns and personally I wouldn't want to be robotic. Currently I just have an abilify prescription and I find the differences so minor that I suspect I could easilty quit.\n\n
2	Similar experiences on Modafinil (prescribed). I'm in my fifth year of using it now. Some people, typically new users, laud it as some kind of wonder-drug, but it really isn't. \n\n**Pros:**\n\n - Things are lighter and nicer when I take it. \n\n - I have much more energy and a greater capacity to focus. \n\n - Mentally, I just feel faster.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n - The height of its effects only last a few hours and the late-afternoon crash is awful. I'm a zombie after 3pm.\n\n - I have more focus, but less control over where it goes. I get stuck doing things that are sorta good (like documentation and administration bullshit), but really not the important thing I need to be doing right that minute. \n\n - I've started structuring my life around it, from the times I schedule work/meetings to the times I actually take the drug. I want the energy from it *now*, but if I take it before I leave home then I feel like I'll be "wasting" some of it on my commute. It feels like I'm being controlled by it. \n\n - Loads of attention and energy, but it's given to me over such a short time that I can't actually use it all effectively. I feel like half of the day's potential is burned away in jitters and over-stimulation. 
1	Your dose was too high
1	Prolonged use is probably not the answer. It sounds like it's preventing you from questioning. IMO adderall should be thought of as in the same category as alcohol, weed, cocaine. It's a drug, that can be used for stuff. If that's what you feel like you need in life, then go nuts. 
1	How’s your sleep and physical health in general?
621	I feel personally attacked...	
27	To me that's the truth. I've learned to google the number and then forget about it, rather than getting stressed about answering or not while the phone's vibrating.\n\n&#x200B;
62	I didn't realise other people did this! Haha
15	Can you blame us, though? Picking up the wrong call only ensures that you're gonna get a thousand more robocalls just like it. Who needs that?
10	Yep.   If I know them, I'll recognize the number.  If it's important, they'll leave a message.
15	in a world of instant communication, i choose to be instantly available only to people i enjoy the company of, and only when i want to be available.\n\n\ni've an asterisk pbx set up on a voip number that screens calls and will follow my devices if someone has the emergency extension or is calling from a number on the safe list. otherwise, they can text me, or email me.\n\n\njust because it's in vogue to be attached to the world's every whim doesn't mean *i* have to participate.\n\n\nthe best thing about a cellphone is 911 and other emergency contacts^(*). the second best thing is not having to answer it.\n\n\n^\* i'm from *the time before.* i didn't get a cellphone until i was in my mid 20's. prior to that, i used to hike and camp quite a bit, as well as taking a dozen or so roundtrip cross country car adventures. i had a small mirror for flashing things, a compass, a flashlight^†, small white and red towels, a copy of the hitchhikers guide to the  galaxy, a copy of the fellowship of the ring, and a handheld cb radio. there were a couple of incidents, but nothing more severe than three hours of trying to get my vehicle unstuck at 2am a hundred miles outside of gothenburg nebraska. luckily!\n\n\nlooking back, those times were a bit barbaric, kind of prehistoric, even. if something went wrong, you waited with a white flag hanging out of your window if you needed help. or a red flag if you needed medical help, not that the color made anyone show up quicker. if you were lucky, you could find someone on the cb and maybe get help faster... but mainly, you waited... that's what the books were for.\n\n\non the plus side, even in the middle of absolutely nowhere, people were much more likely to stop and check on you. driving from ithaca ny to tucson az, a college buddy with me taking turns at the wheel. we were somewhere in the middle of texas, past the part that smelled of cow farts, and it was 3am or so. pitch black, flat, nothing on the horizon in any direction, nobody on the road. so we pulled over to the side, and matt and i took a long look at one of the most amazing night skys i have ever seen. almost felt like i was going to fall off the earth, it was so big. i could see *everything* in all directions!\n\n\nkicking it there for a smoke, about 15 minutes later we see a vehicle in the distance. it took about ten minutes to get to where we were. *it slowed down, then pulled over, and stopped*. the guy in the pickup *stopped* just to check if we were ok. so we told him we were from ny and were enjoying the night sky. well, the guy was pretty cool, and on his way back from camping, we got to talking, and before you know it, he had a small grill set up and was cooking up some hotdogs and coffee. so we ate it, enjoyed the sky a bit more, then we all left.\n\n\nthere's no chance in heaven or hell below that i'll ever run across the old guy again, but i still think about that night sky here and there. on the off chance that you stopped for a couple of hippies skygazing in the middle of texas late one night in '95, thanks for the hotdogs, coffee, and company! i was surprised that anyone would check on a stopped car on an empty road. it's nice knowing that there's people who do that :) \n\n\n^† flashlights back then mostly sucked (save maglites), as well as the batteries. if the bulb still worked, you went through those c or d cells pretty quickly... a handful of hours at best, and the batteries didn't have much of a shelf life, either, so this was a maintenance item: check bulb, check spare bulb, and replace both sets of batteries every 3 months. when you need a flashlight, you need it to *work*
4	I especially hate the number spoofing where they look like they are calling from a local number. Good thing I never changed my cell number when I moved across the country. No one calls me from there, so I always know its spoofed.
5	This sub is so ridiculous sometimes. This isn't an INTP thing... Everyone does this
2	Use a Facebook search not a Google one 
2	I literally did this yesterday :0\n\nFigured if it was important they would leave a voicemail for me to call back or something. 
2	This way I find out, if those are scammers. 
2	Well yes! Because if someone called me and didn't leave a message, it's **always** a scammer, or a robo scammer or a cold call charity. \n\nAnyone I know uses facebook messenger or WhatsApp.
2	I have a Google pixel, and its screens my calls. I love it so much.
2	There are too many scams out there, and some of them have only required the person to say innocuous words like "yes". So I never answer unknown numbers.
3	you know you made it to 2019 when you read that someone felt "personally attacked" by the words someone else has said to someone else
1	Don’t even do, that. I answer a phone call from a number I 90% know is fake, I don’t say anything, (if they are a real person they will say something) after 4sec of silence,  it hangs up then I immediately start the block caller sequence of button presses. 
1	This is me. Also God bless the screen call feature on Android.
1	i always did that with unknown numbers, because i used to receive a lot of telemarketing phonecalls.\n\nnow we have GDPR, and those scumbags know better.
1	Google's call screen feature is the best thing ever.\n\nBTW, I wonder why there's not a good phone number lookup database? Those lookup sites suck, and there's rarely a hit, or it's behind a paywall. This is something that should be built into phone software by now.
1	I pick up my phone if it's family or a close friend, otherwise it goes to voicemail and I might remember to check it that day sometime lol.
1	Whitepages reverse phone lookup is one of my most visited sites lol
1	Wow. \n\n\nThe skilled among us can Google the number and see if it's spam or important *before* it goes to voicemail. 
1	post removed for bad title? wtf gay mods
1	my favorite website for this is [https://inteltechniques.com/menu.html](https://inteltechniques.com/menu.html) . It searches multiple search engines for the telephone number at once.  or just google "osint tools".
1	My phone does that by itself... can't remember if I use an app for that or if it's default. Galaxy S7
1	I literally did this today, is it really an INTP thing? I feel like anybody who is Introverted would do this, not exclusively INTPs
1	*blush*
-2	This is kinda weird, just pick up the phone
9	INTP Virtual Meetup	What if we all got into a discord server and just shot the shit? I really miss talking to guys who have interesting stuff to bring to the table. Would anyone be down to do it if I set it up?
8	Bold of you to assume that this hasn't been done.
3	Well most of the "INTP" discord servers are full of miss-types anyways. Do any of you have the balls to actually prune away those people? The reason I'm not in INTP discords to begin with is because they are a fucking mess. Hope that sheds some light on what you want versus the reality.
2	There is an INTP reddit chat, but a discord would be cool too. 
2	Just guys?
1	There has been invites to discord servers from time to time. But yeah cant have enough discord servers\n\n&#x200B;
1	Keep posting about this to update us
1	I know there's a Discord thing already but if there's a demand then go for it. I'm in.
1	May be interesting
1	But we have a reddit INTP chatroom? Also I have discord but naw not interested in talking on it.
1	doubt thisll be any different than its predecessors but keep me posted
1	we need to make a discord server for something specific that a high concentration of INTPs will go to, because none of us would go to an INTP discord server
0	Start it I’m down
6	Anybody else can't keep a secret to save their life?	How are you INTPs with keeping secrets? I'm an open book. I mean of course I won't if someone says don't tell anyone ____ but honestly unless someone straight up says DON'T TELL ANYONE or I forget that they said that then I will tell anyone who asks.\n\nI also have trouble distinguishing between stuff that people want kept secret and don't.\n\nAlso how are you at keeping your life private from your friends? Like honestly I just tell them everything if they ask.
10	I am an open book about my own life but I don’t tell other people’s secrets. I just don’t give a shit if other people think I’m weird for something I tell them about myself, don’t like that XYZ? Okay we don’t have to be friends. 
2	I'm good at it, not because I care about keeping secrets. It's more like I forget them seconds after they are told. 
2	I'm useless at knowing what is meant to be a secret and what ain't, unless I'm explicitly told. But that's irrelevent to my being a good 'secret keeper'...\n\nI'm paraphrasing here, but there's a scene in the movie, Warrior, in which a gym owner knocks on a door and tells the guy who answers: *I'm looking for Tommy*. The man, who is Tommy's father, asks: *What business do you have with Tommy?* The gym owner says he manages fighters and wants to 'know a little more about the guy'. The father tells him: *Anything you wanna' know about Tommy, you got to ask him yourself.* The gym owner responds: *look, I'm just asking for some general information here.* The father tells him, again: *Like I just said, anything you want to know about Tommy you got to ask him yourself.* then shuts the door.\n\nIt seems such a trivial, insignificant scene, but it's one of the most pivotal, despite being one of the least dramatic.  This becomes apparent when, a few scenes later in the movie, Tommy meets with his father and says: *I know \[that gym owner\] came to see you.* The father responds: *I didn't tell him anything.* And, Tommy, who has been estranged from his father for years, replies: *I wouldn't be here now if you had.*\n\nPoint being, ain't my or anyone's business to tell other people's.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Nah, never tell them to anyone. 
1	I'm excellent at keeping secrets. Part of that is because I don't talk to people 😅
1	Are you on the autistic spectrum or do you have some form of learning difficulty?
3	Why does everyone see INTPs as social freaks?	I invite you to debate, my friends. :)\n\nFor a long period of time, I thought I was an ENTP. After reading Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type I realized I am an INTP. \n\nAll over the internet and even in this sub there’s a load of posts about how extremely introverted INTPs are. If you go to Pinterest, 80 % of the INTP pictures are about introversion. I don't think extreme introversion is a key trait in INTP type, and I think that misconception is the cause for many INTPs being mistyped as ENTPs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTP is an introverted type because his dominant function is introverted. Period. Our dominant and auxiliary functions are thinking and intuition, so we aren't extremely good with people, I admit it. But come on, I just can't believe that every INTP spend their weekends catalogizing their books and writing essays about philosophical thoughts. \n\nYes, I live in my mind. Yes, I always have theories I think about. No, I don't share these with anyone (my journal is my best friend). But I am witty, I have a dark sense of humor, I can be really fun and easy-going. I have friends whom I party with sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have the feeling that a lot of people are mistyped as INTPs, just because they are intelligent and introverted. What do you think about that?\n\nSorry for mistakes, that's not my native language. I'm better at understanding than using it. :)
7	In socionics, there's a concept called dimensionality of function, that has 4 levels, or dimensions\n\n1 D is **"Experience"** (Trial and error), 2D is **"norms"** (Your exp + that of others), 3D is **"Situation"** (going beyond the norms by improvising to the specific situation) and 4D is **"Time/Globality"** (Where you go beyond improvising, you formalize it in principles, etc, and can make predictions in that function's domain)\n\nOur Ti is 4D, so not many people get our ideas (I recommand to reference more common thinking, like sayings or quote, ie, Ti at the norm "level" to communicate, and maybe go to 3D"situation" if you want to show you get more. Straight 4D just looks weird to most people.), while our Fe is 1D, so we don't even get what everyone else seems to understand, ie, the norms/rules. That's the real answer, we break rules without knowing it, and since people don't say what you did wrong outright, you sometime don't even notice it. 
1	INTP's and ENTP's are very similarily related in their cognitive functions, it's just in the order or priority of those functions that distinguishes the two types. You can be outgoing as an INTP, there is no doubt about it. BUT the real question you have to ask yourself is if you are truly introverted. A lot of ENTP's and INTP's think they are each other's types maybe because an ENTP is depressed or going through a phase; An intp could be hitting their flow and seem a lot more outgoing they usually are. Thing is at the end of the day; extraverted types at their core draw energy from being outgoing, socializing, being outside. Introverted types, get drained doing the same thing. Where one type gets recharged on a rainy day in the house the other gets drained with nothing to do. Whether you identify as INTP or ENTP, does it really matter? You are still you after all. 
1	I agree entirely
25	My INTP BF just lost his job. How do I support him? Emotional support vs practical support vs the pep talk.	
30	He might already be in his head stressing, I’m sure he’s thinking something up for his next job. I wouldn’t even bring it up unless he does.... Throw some neck tonight, Kick back, and don’t force a pep talk on him. I would hate that! (Intp) 
18	I was in his position a year ago. It was harsh. Be supportive but not sympathetic. It's already hard to understand INTP's as is, if his ego is damaged, it will be even harder. Just listen if he wants to open up, try not to suggest anything. He most likely is already doing research on how to handle it emotionally, and what the next step is. We are emotionally independent so don't worry about his feelings, he will resolve any angst with pure logic and reasoning.\nAlso if he is unemployed for a posiibly lengthy period(job market is rough) try to get him out of the house, even if he refuses. It's imparative lol! The sunshine and fresh air is essential for the recovery. He needs to learn that the earth keeps spinning. 
8	Just be there.  Don't talk unless he wants to talk.
6	Just make sure he doesn't sit around all day (day after day) doing nothing. 
5	Dont suggest any thing, a soothing sexual session sounds like a good idea. INTP
6	Let him process everything for a week. After the week is over, start laying down the law and help him look for jobs. STAY ON TOP OF HIM AND ASK FOR SPECIFICS.\n\nHe's gonna get lazy. You have got to be on his ass 24/7 after the week of grieving is over. 
4	Sex him up
3	I'd probably appreciate all three to be honest >:O
2	I feel like INTPs are the type least attached to their work, in the form of a job; it’s likely he had projects he wants involve himself in to some capacity, may be just ask and encourage him to do so 
1	It could take a mix of both emotional and practical support.   \nDoing well = Him: "Ok, the problem isn't resolved, but at least I feel better right now."   \nKillin it = Him: "Ok, the problem isn't resolved, but my perspective has changed and I now see this as an opportunity"\n\nKillin it is tough and you gotta be sharp, too. I suppose this falls under "pep talk". Either way, any support would be welcomed whether he expresses it or not. Regardless, it's very nice that you care enough to make an entire post to try and understand how to help.\n\nI hope this is useful in some way.
1	Eh, we don't really need "Emotional support"... As for practical advice/support, I dunno what there is ? What do you know that he doesn't ? And pep talks are annoying\n\nJust say "Well, it's you, you should be able to do it", and it will be fine. 
1	Ask him what job he wants to do next. If he had think about it already, he would tell you. If he is angry instead, he is thinking of something else at the moment. 
1	what job?
1	Get a new boyfriend
0	Whatever you do, don't give him blowjob. 
1	[Discussion] Social Creatures	I've often heard the phrase of humans as "social creatures" and given the tendency of people, say with INTP personalities or similar, to want to isolate themselves, I would just like to give way for discussion for anyone who may be for/against this phrase and maybe link relevant info to your argument. \n\nI'll give an opinion on this subject in that, in my personal experience, I tend to enjoy my time alone and away from other people. However I can see how given too much time away from everyone can produce unforeseen consequences with feelings of social anxiety, depression, etc. In some instances, I feel that I have to force myself out and perhaps find some way interact with others or in other cases, I feel the need to retreat as quickly as possible (especially after long periods of interaction with family, friends, etc.) Any thoughts? 
4	Humans are described as 'social creatures' because, as a species, they naturally form social networks in order to survive. Unlike, for example, frogs which, as a species, only interact with each other or even try to in order to mate and spend the rest of their time living solitary lives.\n\nEthologists, sociologists etc, when observing the behaviour of a species do not makes statements like 'humans are social creatures' based on the specific habits of individuals, rather, they make statements based on a species as a whole.\n\nThere's 7.7 billion people estimated to be alive right now and over 108 billion estimated to have ever been alive and the vast majority are / were part of some form of social network. Hence, Dave over there who doesn't 'do' house parties or Brenda the lonely lighthouse attendant or Sally the INTP or Trevor the happy Hermit individually and even collectively do nothing to challenge the argument that humans are social creatures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Our biggest introverts are still social creatures compared to non-social species unless you try to kill people on contact.
20	Something something personally attacked	
13	I feel empty inside
2	Don’t we all u/DeadManIV... don’t we all...
2	Are you attacking me?
1	Okay now I'm #triggered
1	I feel the INTJs are behind these attacks.  They dont like any resistance to their evil plots.  We cannot let the J's overcome our P's!  Liberty or death!
13	I feel like I have to have my opinion heard.	After 30+ years in religion I couldn't take it anymore. I was born and raised in a very loving Christian home. My parents were devoted Christians but there wasn't any crazy charismatic stuff. I always had questions but feared hell if I questioned God. My parents never could settle on one church or one particular denomination so I was exposed to a good portion of them giving me first hand experience of what these denominations believed. \n\nI started reading and researching the Bible more than I ever had before to try and strengthen my faith. The more I read the less sense it made and I finally told both sides of my family that I was struggling with my faith and they all threw cliche verses, books, and advice at me. Even though they had the best intentions it just pissed me off more. \n\nNow several years after deconverting both sides of my family still try to bring me back into the fold. I recently told them all out needs to stop and so far they have respected that but everything in me wants to tell them point by point why what they believe is beyond ridiculous. If I keep my mouth shut I will keep peace in my family and will probably have to deal with them trying to bring me back into the fold. The more I continue to read and research the more I get pissed off. \n\nI should mention too that my brother used to be my best friend until he got psycho religious a few years ago. His wife is a manipulative bitch who uses her religion to guilt and shame her family and those around her into doing what she wants. Their whole family moved without telling anyone to another state where they got jobs as pastors and my brother is the VP of some bullshit leadership institute. They believe in prophecies, speaking in tongues, gold dust falling from the ceiling, they literally believe they are training as special forces spiritual warfare warriors. The list goes on and on. This REALLY drives me nuts the amount of insane magic they believe in. \n\nAnybody else have trouble letting go of letting people know your opinion on a matter? \n\n
8	Dude, I feel your pain. I was raised in a religious family. My mom was Lutheran and my Dad had been raised in a fundamentalist uhhhh I would call it a cult. My parents decided to be very "non-denominational" with our religious education but still put a lot of importance on God and the Bible. My family never took me to church but I'd go with neighbors, friends, and other family members.\n\nAfter my parents split up my dad married a woman from his old church. We started going and following all the laws etc. Grandma always praised the heck out of me for being so pious. \n\nThere was a kind of split in my family. At some point the cult had split into several new groups and some went this way and some the other. I started to see people disagreeing on all these "important" points. I didn't understand how they could all be right.\n\nIn high school I started going to a DIFFERENT, more main stream church with some friends. Started going to youth group, bible studies. I was so into it. I even got baptized at 16.\n\nIt wasn't part of the church most my family was in, but everyone was still so proud.\n\nI had always had some issues with common beliefs and practices. I didn't understand why so many Christians shunned science, particularly evolution. I didn't understand why they seemed to think the existence of evolution would eliminate the possibility of a god. There were other things too...\n\nAs an adult, I moved to a big city for a couple years before having to move back home by my family. I met lots of different people of different religions and denominations. They all seemed pretty damn sure they were right. They described the same feelings I had experienced and were used by others I knew while growing up to validate their faith in some kind of holy spirit. It did not make sense to me that they should all be right, because if they were, and if everyone was really trying to worship God however they were taught to, why were they all fighting? Why did everyone insist everyone else was damned to hell? And why wouldn't god come sort all this out for them?\n\nI struggled with it for years. It's hard to let such deeply held beliefs go, especially when everyone around you insists you are being corrupted by Satan if you don't agree with them on everything.\n\nI have never told my family that I don't believe this stuff anymore. I kinda tried to assert myself a little bit years ago and simply disagreed with them on a few points and they went ballistic. Really really psycho. Everyone blowing up my phone to yell at me, coming to my workplace to call me a whore, pulling over their vehicles to try to "reach out" when they saw me walking down the street, only to turn hostile when the conversation didn't go their way.\n\nAnd I hadn't even told them I was pretty much an atheist. I just said some things about how I was worried about my dad listening to the Christian radio all of a sudden. I was afraid it was brainwashing him. That's what started it all.\n\nNow I am a single mom with a little girl. No one I know IRL knows how I feel about any of this. My family knows everyone in town and I'd face harassment by these crazies everywhere, and I just want some semblance of normalcy for my daughter.\n\nBUT. I know I am going to have to do something. She's three now. Everyone wants me to take her to church. They're trying to indoctrinate her. My family is pushing for me to find "a nice Christian man" to marry and take care of me. I can't even try to have a normal dating experience because they would go ape shit.\n\nMy conclusion: I need to move the fuck out of this town. I need to go just far enough away so they wouldn't bother driving there to harass me. And then I need to assert myself. Be myself. Raise my daughter right. And hopefully meet other adults who think like I do. \n\nBut yeah. And the anger thing, it's really painful to realize how deceived you've been. And to see everyone around you completely shutting out all reason because of fear and a longing to feel superior to everyone else? You love these people. You worry about them. You just want everyone to be reasonable adults and respect each other.\n\nIt also seems like this stuff is stunting my family members' personal growth. They don't always seem too self-aware, and they blame everything that happens, good or bad, on God. So when my uncle's business is doing very badly, it's got something to do with god maybe punishing him or someone else who works there. No, it couldn't POSSIBLY be because my uncle went on a manic spending spree and stretched the company's budget and production schedule too thin for the FIFTY MILLIONTH TIME. SMH\n\nIf you don't have to worry about them directly harassing you or trying to sabatoge your life, I'd say just be straight up with them on a case by case basis. If they are talking about something and ask your opinion, give it. It will be better for your mental health to be yourself. \n\nAt the same time, I hope you can find a way to address your own anger. That's inside YOU. Gotta control what you can. Let go of the anger. \n\nAh I could go on and on about my thoughts on this matter, but typing it all out is a pain and probably no one would read it anyway. \n\nGood luck to you.\n\nAgain, I feel your pain.
2	I don't really have trouble letting go of making my opinions known, though sometimes my opinions just burst out when I'm impatient or someone is asking stupid questions or trampling over what I believe (usually by misrepresenting it, for example).\n\nI don't think making your opinions known in this situation is a bad thing. I'll put it this way: there's a sweet spot. If you keep your mouth shut and your family has no idea what you believe and probably assume you believe the same with them, that's bad because your relationship isn't genuine. If you argue non-stop and being right or having shared beliefs is more important than getting along with your family, then that's also bad for your relationship. One potential sweet spot, depending on the situation, is to make it clear that your beliefs differ but for that not to get in the way of being there for each other.\n\nI haven't really found a mature solution in my own situation but I pretty much low key spread the seed of doubt among my parents and jokingly disagree with them about everything. They don't know what I believe and they don't care to ask, but all that matters to me is that they don't assume they know what I believe.

4	An Insincerity Dilemma	Have any of you guys/girls ever been in a scenario where you've had to have a conversation about a 'serious' or 'sensitive' topic, but you're not really good at displaying emotion when talking, but you don't want it to seem as though you aren't aware/experiencing/understanding the emotional weight of the situation, so you try and make yourself seem like you're more emotional than you actually are? However, then you start thinking that you're being insincere and that that insincerity is showing and you don't know whether to continue feigning the outward emotion of go back to a more natural state of expression.
2	Me ^
1	No, because I can get really emotional about things I say that I mean even if I don't intentionally show it. It doesn't have to be dramatic, but people who are good at reading body language can tell. That said, most people don't seem to interact with me any differently when I'm really angry or sad. Either because they can't tell or they don't care.
1	Lol same!! Im only sincere at being angry. My happiness before was exaggerated, but now I can control it, although still insincere (inferior Fe). While talking about something sad immediately makes me aware of myself and lose focus on what Im trying to say. \n\nWhen I feel sadness or happiness, I only try to repeat that Im sad or happy, and the repetition means the levels of depth of my emotion, e.g the more I said that I am happy means that I am really happy, more repetitions means really really happy. but from that still couldn’t show how deep my hapiness is. 
13	Any one heard of CS Joseph? What do you think of his analysis?	
14	He knows his shit. Can't attest to how deep his knowledge really goes, because mine isn't too deep myself, but I binged a bunch of his vids a while back and it really gave me more of a complete picture of the function stack. Focusing on just the 4 most conscious subfunctions is an oversimplification.
3	Love the dude
3	It's really entertaining. The analysis covers generally everything about the INTP and some helpful tips.
2	Practical. I found many vids and the typing grid helpful.\n\nifyouknowwhatimean
2	You should look up the vids where he gets triggered by SJ's.
2	There's also a youtube channel called Eric the intp which I like better
2	He was basically my introduction to MBTI.  Crazy smart.\n\nHe meanders a lot, so he probably drives Sensors crazy.  I keep up and love the detail he puts into it.\n\nAnd one thing I really like is his directness and bluntness.  I love it when he goes on rants about INTPs.  His criticisms are blunt, but constructive.  No sugarcoating, just building.  I appreciate that greatly.
1	Can't comment on depth but I'm really enjoying this - makes me realise I need to do some serious reading. 
1	I thought his assessment of intps was decent, but I went to one of his livestreams and it turns out he is a really devoted Christian, and an antibiotic vaxxer. That led me to immediately unsubscribe
1	It's not very good, he's far too confident in his ideas too. There are far better sources out here if you look for them\n\n

3	I think that phrasing it as "be yourself" causes people to misinterpret what the advice is intending. A better way to say it is "strive to be the best version of yourself".\n\nToo many people interpret "Be yourself" as "I have flaws, and that's who I am, and if anyone wants to be with me, they need to deal with them or they can get the fuck out." If you strive to be the best version of yourself, you say "I have flaws, and because I recognize these aspects of myself as flaws, I have to do the work to make myself better. No one can do that work for me." Everyone has flaws, but it is not attractive to embrace your flaws. If you acknowledge you are flawed and make good faith efforts to improve yourself, that is what people find attractive.
1	This has not been my experience so far... lol
0	It's too bad that who I am sucks and anyone who could ever see me act like myself would decide that I'm a terrible person, up to and including my family members. 
1	is being a fast learner an intp thing, if so, how?	title says it all chief 
3	Well If you are interested into topic and have willingness to learn you will learn faster(curiosity which is probably most associeted with INTPs). But if you don't found topic interesting you'll procastinate, so depends.
1	I have no idea how but it me. In high school I used to get so frustrated when we had to practice new concepts so much like ya got it lets move on with our lives. Now I'm in college and need them to slow the fuck down though... lol. Maybe this goes back to INTPs being good at recognising patterns? Also we actually want to understand things and the logic of them and get frustrated when things just "are."
1	If I'm curious or motivated by something else, like a competition that I actually want to win or money that I actually need for something, I'll learn ridiculously fast. Doesn't matter whether I'm learning by myself or with classmates, I can't seem to be able to turn my mind off. All I need to get it going is sufficient motivation.
1	I think so. We can discern patterns and also apply past experiences to present moments. Combine these together, and you get someone who could spot their mistakes and remember them and then use this knowledge to avoid future mistakes. This allows INTPs "learn faster" through trial and error.
1	I've never been a "fast" learner. I'm actually a particularly slow learner if anything. It takes a few times before it really sticks.\n\nBut when I'm interested in a subject, I will learn every single detail possible.\n\nSo I'd say I'm gifted in the quality of my learning, not speed.
1	Anecdotally I have been described as a very fast learner, INTPs tend to be intelligent (or at least book smart ) so generally it would follow that they tend to learn faster on average. There are undoubtedly exceptions though. 
1	So people do you have a lot of removed reddit accounts(and other accounts),and why did you removed them? And do you plan te remove reddit account that you're currently using?	
2	Only ever had this one... but I just joined in November, so there's still time.
2	i have free time. make a lot of accounts. delete a lot of accounts. i dont plan on doing it.
1	I've deleted tons of accounts. Usually because I cross the line. I've stopped giving a shit though. 
1	More often than not, people have been able to discover who I am IRL based on my posts, so I usually delete accounts and start new so that I can freely express my ideas and thoughts while remaining anon.
1	Yeah I've deleted several accounts.  I've deleted them once they had a certain amount of karma.\n\nThis account is about 20k short of having excessive karma -- but when it makes it to that point, yes.  It too shall pass.
3	Does anyone else want to be an INTJ?	I think that if I had more INTJ qualities I'd be able to achieve almost everything I set out to do.\n\nDoes anyone else think this way?
5	I've wished I was another type (except INFP), I've wished I was smarter, I've wished I had better instincts / Ni. INTJs are the smarter and more efficient type. So it used to be tempting but now I say fuck no, I'd rather spend a lifetime dealing with my shit than be an INTJ.
3	I am INxJ and I like it. Very efficient, much strategic. Such manipulative, though. \n\nI am here because my husband is INTP, btw. I have learned that our humor is very different, it has been helpful. INxJ humor is sometimes quite nonexistent. 
2	Not at all, and neitheir do you...\n\nBeing an INTP is a matter of preferences, and the definition of INTP is that you prefer **Ti over Te, Ne over Ni, Si over Se and Fe over Fi**... Being an INTP means you actively reject the INTJ type.\n\nBeing an INTJ means going with your own idea/PoV (Ni) instead of checking multiples one (Ne), and refering to other wya of thinking (Te) rather than thinking for yourself (Ti). We actually use Ni and Te rather often, as they are our shadow functions, and I'm pretty sur enone of us actually like it (I sure don't)\n\n\n
2	Definitely no.\n\nINTJs are awkwardly unaware and embody too many toxic nerd stereotypes for me to harbor any kind of idealization toward them.\n\nThe types I've idolized most are ENTP and ISFP.
2	i suggest ENTP , ENTJ as a step forward.  \nif you cannot do that, going INTJ will get you stuck not progress, as INTPs are much better at modeling themselves and balancing resources / emotional values
1	I'm quite interested in the scenario of becoming an ENTJ. I sometimes imagine myself as one because I really respect thier strength, efficiency, and overall competence. I have so many different thoughts and ideas, and I never put in the effort to turn them into reality. However, in the end of the day, they do say grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. I'm sure ENTJs have their fair share of struggles too. 
1	No way. I love my open mindedness. I believe that no other type is as free minded as INTP. We have the capability of having the biggest imagination, and that's neat. 
1	I wanna be an entp and do absolutely everything 
0	The Most Important Habit For Living a Successful Life (A simple, short video)	
2	alright, masculine man.
1	Yo, this fucked me up! My name is Tom and in December I decided I was going to make 2019 the year I get fit. The plan I came up with was to work out once a week for 2 months, then twice a week for two months...until I ended the year working out 6 times a week. So I guess what I’m wondering is, who the fuck are you and why are you watching me?
3	The game the r/ISFJ is playing	So I popped into the ISFJ subreddit, and they are playing a game called fuck, marry, kill. \n\nSo far not too many have played, but INTP came up on one as Marry. Also the players seem to view ESFJ and INFJ folks negatively. Which makes sense because our stack is the same but reversed kinda.\n\n\nSo here is my take on it:\n\nFuck: Ya, I just can't. Not so far anyway.\n\nMarry: ISFJ  Never lack for love and practical support.\n\nKill: INFJ  I can't trust them\n\nAnyone else care to play?
3	That's a misuse of typology, and absolutely shouldn't be done under any circumstances !!! How dare you ?!\n\n...\n\nFuck : xNFP, I guess ?  \nMarry : No idea.  \nKill : ESTP, thoses damn walking reminders of how much I suck at Se. \n\n***\nBtw, checked that [threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/aws03j/weekend_discussion_thread_fuck_marry_and_kill/) out, and the "marry" person is an INFJ...\n\nFunnily though, of the "hot" threads of their sub, there's like 4 from or about us. 
0	Why you can't trust INFJs? Litteraly most trustworthy type
0	Fuck: only whoever I marry\n\nMarry:  I have no clue.  ENFJs are a kind of opposite to INTPs, so we balance each other out.  Their empathy is mesmerizing.  But someone I know who I wouldnt mind marrying is an ISFP, hehe.  But I'd rather not any INTXs.  Too similar.  They're a lot like another me, *and im not too fond of myself in the first place!*\n\nKill:  you daggum INTJs why you have to constantly try to control us and tell us what to do please stop also you take the credit for the stuff we intps do and have all of the memes centered around you dangit i thought you didnt like being in the spotlight but guess what you are and not only that youre only supposed to be about 2% of the population but the internet is covered in you people what the heck obviosly its all skewed data it's all clear to me now you have been controlling eveything from behind the scenes you run the deepstate youre trying to take over the world you **FREAKIN DEEPSTATE GLOBALIST INTJS!**\n\n(Edit: yeah in case it wasnt extremely obvious to you people, the last part is a joke.  I actually cannot believe Im having to make this edit.  Chill with your fucking downvotes.)
3	What are your thoughts on adult responsibilities	What do you think about adult responsibilities, such as: laundry, dishes, cooking, filing taxes, earning money, getting smog checks, maintaining your car, cleaning ur PC, cleaning the house, mowing the lawn, taking out the trash, paying bills, and so on?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
10	You do them all or you will eventually not be able to do what you want. You gotta work hard to earn your time off. 
5	A necessity to not live in squaller, under a bridge, or at my parents house. Most people I think of any personality type would prefer to have robots do the task or just have them magically completed. Sometimes I find some joy / pride in organizing my items or having my spaces look really nice. \n\nIf I didn’t have to do any of them or sleep I would much rather live that way. But that sort of deal sounds like something that would require selling your mortal soul.  
3	Does anyone really care about them? They’re just things that need to get done, it’s hardly the highlight of anyone’s day. 
2	I just kind of zone out when I do tasks like those. Most of the time they don't really require my full brain's attention so. I will wash the same dish or vacuum the same spot like 3 times though cuz I forget. But overall I'm just like eh. Had to be done. Time could be spent doing something I find more productive but unfortunately the world disagrees.
2	I have no doubt you would be bored senseless by therapy. The same way i’m bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is: it's not an adventure. There’s no way to do it so wrong you might die. It’s just work. And the bottom line is: some people are okay going to work and some people... well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."\n\n\-Dr. Wong﻿
1	I do them. 
1	I'm horrible at remembering to do them.  No matter how organized I try to be about those things I just can't remember what day trash day is! I have to set alarms on my phone for things and when it goes off I immediately do it otherwise I'll forget again. Thankfully there is auto pay for bills and I have a gardener. I used to have a housekeeper as well which I may go back to. As far as the things I see such as dishes, laundry and such I hate doing them but I like to keep my place and myself very clean so it has to be done. In college I did use a ton of disposable dishes and silverware though. So much easier. 
1	I do like doing some of these activities actually, I am particularly found of cleaning and listening to audiobooks.\n\nHowever the big problem I have with them is the time it takes. I have a full time job and then there is all this stuff to take care off, then where it’s the time for the projects that are exciting to me for my personal interest and growth and then the down time needed to relax.\n\nThere just is not enough time in the day, so then you have to become more efficient but trying to be efficient in everything is rough, it’s draining and makes everything seem like something you have to do and in a certain way, which just reduces your life to a mundane set of tasks. \n\nSo something has to slide, you can’t have everything. There really just is not enough time. I’m wrestling with this at the moment and trying to find the right balance plus figure out what is worth my time and what is not because there are clearly some things I should do and some things that I like doing that there is just not enough time for, there has to be choices. \n\nIn my new schedule, I’m trying out making Sunday, my sort it out day, where I do as much of these things as possible in one day, food shopping, meal prep, cleaning, laundry, all those little tasks and then spend time creating some space to indulge my INTP brain and think about life, my goals, what intreasts and excites me, what I can improve etc and then set out my focus for the week ahead.  Mainly because after work, time and energy is limited, so I want to try and clear away as much of that stuff as possible so i can focus on bigger projects and things that matter to me as well as trying to find some down time too.
1	My thought is that responsibility is basically necessary for freedom. Basically, the difference between a child (that we don't consider free) and an adult (that we consider free) is taking responsibility for your own actions. A child is irresponsible, for example, toward the Law... To say, "I did that" when you did, and thus your *choice* in making that decision is basically freedom. Reallu just that, your decision... \n\nThey aren't things "forced" on you :\n\n* Laundry, dishes, cleaning your PC/House. Your choice\n* Taxes : The states, an authority figure, so not really "responsibility", if you don't consider it as "I contribute" thing\n* Earning money and paying : Your choice too, ie, not being a child depending on others or a thief...\n* Mowing the lawn is pretty stupid. How many hours are you going to waste killing grass ? Well, your choice too...
1	#anti
1	utter waste of time and energy, wasting your life on them implies you are not using your time for doing what is actaully important. mind and body degenerate over time along with will to live and ability to cope. no car, small house/apartment, no lawn, raw food, no showering, satisfaction only of relevant, not perceived neccessities.
3	INxP/INTP and Helping Behaviour	SO, long story short, I (f) started dating male (entj)...who I love... and we're not in a committed relationship yet (it's been 7 months!). A year and a half ago he was engaged. His ex broke up with him because of devastating family issues (dad has dementia) and is moving back to her home country soon. He's still friends with her and relies on her for support and is absolutely not over her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few years ago, I dated an INTP who was trying to help me get over a breakup. He saw all these problems with me that he wanted to fix, but it ended up bordering on abusive and he was extremely critical of me (even if he was right). He had concerns about my own mental health which later proved to be true. Also, he was a genius and knew a lot about psychology and the brain, so he was basing his judgments on real info and he was right but I didn't realize it until much later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm in the opposite position of my ex. I want to help this guy I'm seeing (entj) get over his ex. I have a whole list of recommendations for him that is research based and I know would help his mental health. There are real issues that I see, and I want to help him get better. He could get better in a few months if he followed my suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this crazy of me? I just want him to get better. And I do my research and base everything on evidence. It's a great plan that will help him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this a common thing with INTP's? I mean... wanting to help people like this. Taking on pet projects, I guess? I'm INxP actually if it matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	If you want to "save" him then I guess that's entirely up to you. However, I think that's a bad mentality to begin with anyways. He's still into her and seems to have a load of baggage. The focus should be on you and what he brings to the table as your partner. Not his baggage. You sound like a sloppy rebound if anything and if I were you I would of dipped the minute I learned about this as he's clearly not over her. It sounds like he went back into the dating pool too fast and really should of worked on himself first.
1	INTPs or just me	This is from a tumblr post :\n\nMBTI and why they lie:\nTo troll people: ENTP, ESTP, ENTJ, INTP\n\nHello fellow INTPs I too am INTP or that's what MBTI type me as. I am not still sure myself.\n\nJust wanted to know am I the only one who likes to be brutally honest all the time as I love truth and it pisses people off.\n\nI like to lie too, to troll people as this too pisses them.

2	Woah woah woah. Hold on there armchair psychiatrists; first of all OP, have you talked to your GP about this and maybe you should be looking to get an appointment with a psychologist or therapy to help you address your issues better. 
1	Definitely abnormal but most intp’s aren’t really in touch with their feelings, so I can see why you would have that mindset.. You live in a society where you would spend the rest of your life in prison, around a bunch of unlogical people. (Idk if you’re straight, but theirs allot of gay shit in jail) For me, I’d rather be the one getting shot! Lol 
1	Not normal. 
1	Not normal.\n\nIf you have no emotional drive to refrain from murder, I don’t think this is normal at all. Even most strong thinkers feel *some* emotions, and I think that a distaste for murder is something that most people are biologically programmed to have, even those who are generally unemotional. \n\nIf what you mean is just that you don’t think there’s any real *reason* that murder is not okay, I think this is definitely not normal for people overall, but it might be somewhat normal for INTPs. In either case, I disagree with this mindset. I think that we can rationality determine morality and discover what’s okay, but even if that isn’t true, we at least have reason to treat murder as if it isn’t okay. Imagine a society in which everyone treats murder as fine. At the very least it seems reasonable to enter a social contract with others in which we act as if murder isn’t okay, because if murder is treated as okay we’d live under constant danger. 
1	My personal moral code is simple, harming another living organism without a reason is immoral, harming another sentient being without a reason is even more immoral
2	Thought Diary	Anyone out there who records their everyday random thoughts? \n\nI always think that they are super interesting and the world would want to know them.

4	Contrast ISTP problem solving vs INTP problem solving?	Title
4	ISTPs avoid problems that they can't solve, and fix and troubleshoot problems that they can inherently understand to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of whatever event they're tackling to make the most out of a long-term goal they can reap the most benefit from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTPs want to tackle unfamiliar, often multifacited problems so they can understand it at a conceptual level and eliminate the event's or concept's vagueness and abstractness, and develop a more comprehensive framework so they can understand similar situations later on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited: Think of an ISTP who's starting a small business. He realizes he understands whatever the business sells to its customers and tries to hone in on and develop that business. Or at a simpler level, maybe an ISTP carpenter who wants to fix people's homes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVersus an INTP researcher who's goal is to understand some certain issue the company is having so they can help the company innovate or avoid wide-ranging problems down the road. Or more simply, an INTP who wants to learn German because they find it interesting and maybe they'll be in germany some day or help them understand english better. 
3	I can't pick a college major, send help!	I'm 18 and am in my second semester of college. I'm an electrical engineering major but am only like 65.83-ish % sure if thats really what I want to major in. How do/did you know if your major is right for you? I know everyone has this problem but maybe people who understand my personality a bit can help. I do that thing where I get interested in something but can never really focus on that one thing. Thats' why I think I'll be better in EE than say CoE.\n\nI think I want to stick with it and then specialize in telecommunications but I'm running out of time if I want to switch to computer engineering. People keep saying to not focus too much on what you want to do because life can change quick and you'll end up doing something completely different - but people keep asking!
3	Pick something that looks good on the resume which is most engineering degrees. Doesn't matter if you don't particularly like that field THAT much because engineering degrees can get you into a lot of different career paths. That's just my opinion
2	I am having almost this same exact problem right now, except I am thinking about either aerospace or mechanical engineering. I am planning on talking to my school's career help office to see about getting some job shadows for over the summer to try to help figure it out.
2	Definitely nursing. The patients could benefit greatly from an INTP's warm and welcoming personality
1	I'm a about a decade older. I recommend philosophy. It can be very logical with critical thinking and gives us (INTPS) a chance to explore the logical side of emotions. It sounds like you're quite career oriented though, so my advice is probably not for you. \n\nCould go bio and then medical school? 
2	Overthinking social life	I'm so confused by people. I'm annoyed because I'll go out with friends n the 2 I hangout with alot are complaining about how fake the other ones are. When crap goes down I'll talk them through it bc I'm able to spit logical thoughts to stabalize and ground others. But then the very next day they will go out with the people they talked crap on the night before and I wont get an invite.\n\nTbh, it's because I'm broke n live like 20 minutes away.\n\nBut like how are you gonna always talk about how I'm one of your few not fake friends then not invite me out when going out with the fake friends. I dont have problems with the "fake" friends. I've seen no sign of any negativity to me. That's why I hang out with them. That's what makes me think. This makes them all fake. Bc they talk crap on each other then hangout together. \n\nBut from what I seen this is normal. So now, I feel like I'm being a real friend to everyone when these people are showing me that they talk crap on their friends. Makes me uncomfortable and start looking around.\n\nBut this all dont matter bc I didnt want to go out tonight anyway, I don't mind only goin out once in a while. Fake people make me feel extra welcome, even if I know it might be fake. And I really dont feel like making new friends. I'll just stay in the middle listening to the crap talk commence. Every conversation that I barely talked in other than saying "idk man, that's crazy." Will end with "dont tell anyone I said this"\n\nYup, life is good. 
1	Yea I think people just want company, they don't really care who. Making new friends is tough and a process so. As long as you guys like doing the same things its someone to do those things with. And I guess theres always going to be something wrong with everyone, nobodys perfect. I too hate the shit talking though. Like if you're going to keep hanging out with "fake friends" at least don't complain about it.

1	well because we have opposite values/ethics and similar thought processes
5	Thoughts on this (rather silly) theory?	Something I've been thinking about for the last few weeks- human behaviour being somewhat analogous to the behaviour of molecules. Considering I really don't know that much about chemistry or thermodynamics, so here's a modicum of crackpottery!\n\nStarting off:\n\nLove, being governed by chemical affinities. "L1" will denote "lover 1" and "L2" will denote "lover 2" (horrible notation I know):\n\nL1+L2 --> L1L2\n\nsimilar to how:\n\nA+B --> AB\n\nLikewise, this can also be used to explain someone's change in feelings:\n\nL1L2+L3 --> L1L3+L2\n\nThis would denote lover 1 being dissatisfied with lover 2, and thus desiring lover 3 instead. \n\nThis is based off an analogy my chemistry teacher used a little over a year ago, as well as being essentially the idea in Goethe's main idea in *Elective Affinities*. I'd say that learning about the latter (I haven't had the pleasure of reading it yet unfortunately) probably had more influence than the former.\n\nNow, in regards to societies:\n\nExtending this "theory", societies would essentially be an aggregate of humans-analogous-to-molecules. My assumption would be that said societies would have the property of entropy (*S*), as would countries, cities and empires. It's also possible that humans, if societies are a mixture, would have the property of fugacity- this would explain why people go on vacations.\n\nI think this could also be used to explain history:\n\nAs a preface, in ~1940 a rather strange fellow named William Sidis wrote a theory of history (only fragments of it found) that can be read as such:\n\nhttps://www.sidis.net/SocialContinuity.htm\n\nOne specific element in the theory however is relevant to my silly idea:\n\n>Would this be the case if a place remained uninhabited for a long time? It is hard to tell; there are such cases, but nothing in such cases to indicate the exact social institutions of the former inhabitants. It is possible that, if the new colonists of such places as Easter Island or Pitcairn Island had, when they got there, known much of the social institutions of former inhabitants, they might have made considerable use of them in building up their own society. An extreme, if fictional, case of local continuity of this sort, appears in the case of a book called "After Worlds Collide," wherein the earth is pictured as being destroyed by a collision, while a few refugees from the earth succeed in getting away to another planet just arrived from outer space, and whose original inhabitants became extinct in its millions of years of travel through space; here the institutions of the former inhabitants are pictured as having an influence on the new inhabitants to a remarkable extent. \n\nWhat I think is that said "continuities" and locality based tendencies are based of the temperatures of the areas in which the inhabitants exist; certain tendencies could be associated with how hot or cold an area is, as well as how much the temperature fluctuates. Thus, even if areas weren't inhabited for a very long time continuities would persist. If this could be figured out, we would be able to establish possibilities as to what the future would be like geopolitically; predicting history, essentially. Kinda like Asimov/Seldon's "psychohistory".\n\nNow, I know this sounds very crackpotty but I'm curious as to what you people think of this idea (not really that serious). If you want to post this on /r/badscience feel free to, if that happens I'll be flattered by the amount of attention I'll get.\n\n
3	Ok i‘m sorry to be that guy, but technically L1 + L2 = L1 + L2 while L1 * L2 = L1L2, which means if there is L1+L2, and L1 finds someone new to love L3, then it would make (L1+L3)+L2 which then again is the same as L1 + L2 + L3, so someone is a third wheel and it is not clearly visible which one likes L3. So I would say L1 * L2, so L1L2 where L1 liking new L3, would be (L1L3)L2, which then again means both Lovers cannot exist without L2, making it contradictory to logic. So I think the maths don‘t quite apply, \n\nBUT, all in all your theory is extremely interesting. Especially the last part makes totally sense and would theoretically be possible, I don‘t know how probable that is though. I think once we know the degree of influence of geography to human tendencies, we‘d know the degree of probability to be able to assess future history with such a tool.
2	Chemical substitution reactions (L1L2 + L3 = L1L3 + L2) largely occur due to a stronger electrochemical bond replacing a weaker one. Electrophilicity and nucleophilicity are objective and absolute, unlike human attraction, which is subjective and relative. \n\nThis molecular model would imply all humans leave their partners without hesitation, including a marrital spouse, for a sexier new mate (by a nonexistent objective measure). \n\nFurthermore, the second law of thermodynamics only postulates entropy inevitably increasing within an *isolated* system. Human society interacts far too much with external influences, such as the state of the planet and its natural resources, for it to exhibit any such trend that is analogous to the second law. \n\nWho knows though, I’m just a dum bizness guy. 
3	What have you been taken and where can I get some
1	>Extending this "theory", societies would essentially be an aggregate of humans-analogous-to-molecules. My assumption would be that said societies would have the property of entropy (S), as would countries, cities and empires. It's also possible that humans, if societies are a mixture, would have the property of fugacity- this would explain why people go on vacations.\n\nAll that exists is based on a few base principles. The same patterns emerge on all scales of reference. No state of being exist forever. Everything is in fluctuation, except the abstract totality of all that fluctuates. Nothing new under the sun, as above so below etc.\n\n>What I think is that said "continuities" and locality based tendencies are based of the temperatures of the areas in which the inhabitants exist; certain tendencies could be associated with how hot or cold an area is, as well as how much the temperature fluctuates.\n\nThis is commonly known as evolution.\n

2	Just sheer curiosity	What was you first thoughts on programming language? Did you understand it the first time? When I was in my high school, they taught us c++ first year it was ....meh but most of my friends found it was easy, second year tho I found it quite interesting and I learned enough to get good marks (my parents had expectations). Now I am quite better than my friends, on the top of that I learned html, css, php, JavaScript and python on my own. But I know it just for the SAKE OF KNOWING I don't have any idea(clue, motivation or I am stupid, etc.) where I am really gonna use them. (It's been an hour now!!) let me make it clear again how was your exprience? 
1	I never had any exposure to programming until I graduated with my bachelors in business admin, got my first corp job and got bored. I taught myself trying to fuck with code I found in the dev console to bypass poor UI design. It kind of escalated from there. I'm now learning about neural networks and love programming for fun. It comes almost naturally. It's probably bad code from an academic perspective but it always accomplishes what I need it to. It's extremely rewarding to write something that does exactly what you wanted it to. Addicting even.
1	Pessimistic about socializing with others	The only reason why I feel uncomfortable talking to others is because it will always end badly for me. No matter how much I try and be polite or any other standard that person has, it just results in that person leaving me out or them disliking me. \n\nI am just a someone who lives alone and rarely talks to anyone in my lifetime because that's how I was raised to be, maybe that's the reason. If I get too comfortable talking to that person, I get provocative which will result in that person instantly disliking me. When a person say something, I usually don't know what else to say so I will just stay quiet. I never initiate a conversation because I am afraid that person will not take a liking and just leave me.\n\n I am only trying my best to socialize with others because I hate being myself. I always wait for something wrong to go happen while talking to others because it always happens to me, it's what's on my mind the entire time. Maybe there are just some people who aren't meant to get along with everyone, or just inept in social skills forever. My mom always tell me I need to get out more and talk to others, what's the point in that? \n\nI never understood why some people hate everyone, but now I know why. If humans are suppose to be social creatures, then why does this always happen? I have some dude who I had a convo with over this problem and surprisingly he sent me a request telling me to talk to him if I need anything, but I won't do that. Because it will just have that typical ending of him disliking me or ignoring me. People fucking suck. \n\nWhen you are a nice person who is willing to treat people with care, they will take that as an advantage and destroy you. The fucking hateful people always get far in life and experience better things because that's how society works. If it's actually true then you might as well be one since you will live a fortunate life.\n\nAgain though, people suck. I don't care what anyone else say or do, my point still stands. I give up on humanity.
1	There are so many places and possibilities in the world. You'll need to look harder to find your niche than the average person. Seek challenges and struggle. You haven't figured everything out about the world and its people yet, I promise.
7	How to stop being tired when I have/must to do things(learning) that I don't found interesting.	So if I'm interesting into doing something I can do this things for hours and I don't even realize that time exists, I do something when I'm litteraly not able to keep may eyes open, almost fell asleep on desk sometimes. But when I need to do something that I must do I have a deadline (but I don't love learning this thing) I get immediatly tired. So I guess that I need to be somehow disciplined or got motivation any advice is welcome.
12	Rail fucking fat lines of crank
5	Just the usual advice: aim to do it for 5 minutes. Once you've started you might have gotten over the initial discomfort associated with procrastination and it's almost easier to keep doing it rather than quit.
2	Please I need this information too lol. I'm in college and my professor turned the technological research paper I wanted to write into an opinionated piece of garbage about how people will feel about those technological changes. I dont like humanities.
2	Start working on it, and once you get into the "rhythm" of it, you can continue with your own pace. From my personal experience, I can usually trick myself out of procrastination by working in chunks; for example, if it is a 10 page paper that has to be due in two weeks, I start on the day it is assigned just by writing down the intro paragraph just to be make some progress without the deadline looming over me. To me, tasks are less daunting once you start, and they become even less so when you think you are making progress ahead of the deadline. 
3	Girl doesn't like me and I think I'm a deeply flawed person	So one of my romantic endeavors went sour and I am really sad and frustrated.\n\nThis is the second time that something like this has happened to me. When thinking about why this happened, as well as a couple of other similar failures that didn't end quite as poorly, there is a combination of factors that I think lead me down this path. The first of which is my tendency to obsess over women. I don't think I've gone a single night sine probably kindergarten without playing out romantic visions. I then think about it when I wake up and throughout the day while I daydream. So when something falls through, it's pretty catastrophic for me because it's related to a huge chunk of my life. This would probably be fine and dandy if I could actually get a girlfriend and be disillusioned of my overly rosy view of romance but that hasn't happened yet. I was really obnoxious and immature until about a year and a half ago so it's really only been that long that girls have even been somewhat receptive to my pursuits. \n\nSo the next reason is the girls I choose. Up until this very recent girl, they have all been nightmares. All of them were extremely immature and most of them were really dumb too. This last girl was pretty amazing but also had a couple of issues and I think I may just see her that way because of how shitty the previous girls were. Anyway, the point is, pretty much all of these girls are untenable and I'm just chasing dragons because I don't feel they are capable of having a relationship. Dating in middle school would be easier than dating most of the girls I liked.\n\nCoupled with this for the ultimate combination for ruin is my own incapability. With pretty much all of the girls, I was able to enter some sort of romantic environment but they all led to a state of limbo. I think they know I'm interested, I think they're probably  somewhat interested, but I am terrified of actually acting in accordance with this and I end up acting in a very benign manner and this has led me to waste months while achieving nothing trying to date some stupid and childish girl. This pretty much always culminates in some final interaction that goes poorly, leading me to cut myself off entirely and being sad for a while.\n\nThis last girl was really lit though I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I just fucked up by not doing anything. I also might not have had a chance all along but I'm pretty sure I just fucked up.\n\nAnyway, prompted I think by my despair and frustration, I had a revelation last night. I realized my relationship with romance and girls is not something a mature, capable adult should have. I have been rebellious toward the idea that I ought to make an effort to improve my social image. I disregard things like trying to act more likable and socially fluid as well as working on my appearance as pandering to the sheepish, vacuous majority. I crafted this persona as an edgy nonchalant kid and it is ruining me. The number of people I interact with is very low and that is probably why I'm unable to find people who I actually respect and want to date and talk with. When I look at celebrities and CEOs I realize that the most capable people are also very socially adept and often well put together. Will these people ever want to talk to some arrogant kid who simultaneously is inconsiderate has no confidence? I'm not meeting people, and even if I did I'm not the kinda guy people wanna fuck with. \n\nI have no idea what to do. My college, UCSD, just feels so isolated as well. I feel like it's an especially harsh environment for someone with my problem. I have no one. Nobody wants to date me and I can't find any friends that I am crazy about either. Will any effort to improve my circumstances actually work or do I just have to wait and grow up and to learn to be mature confident? Am I fucked forever?

Really? Are you going to let a meaningless desire guide your life like that? Anyway, since I doubt a reddit comment from a stranger is going to affect your life long obsession:\n\nDecide what kind of women you're looking for, discover what they want, decide if you fit. If you don't, decide what matters most, remaining the way you are or becoming this other self. If you decide on the latter, then fine. I already warn you the first couple girls you'll try something with are most likely going to be disasters. \n\nIf you choose to remain being yourself... then what the hell do you want in life? \n\nEdit: Oh yeah, what I came here to say. Yes you are flawed as fuck. Waiting for shit to get better gets you nowhere. When you say -> "Nobody wants to date me and I can't find any friends that I am crazy about either" <- that's you saying that you can't find people who find any desirable traits in you. Fucking guess what that means and how that can be solved.
1	I hate to be that person but this is so me. Especially the part about the romantic visions and then being deeply disappointed when it goes wrong (usually because of my lack of communication). I feel like I keep putting off serious romantic endeavors because I'm in college and feel like I just won't date seriously until I get a job. And because of that, I rarely go out or put myself out there. I also go back and forth on whether to just buck down and start dating, or to just wait and build that "mature confidence". And sometimes when I'm depressed I just comfort myself by saying I'll be satisfied with my daydreaming instead of pursuing an actual life.\n\nSo yeah, I have no answers for you, just wanted to let you know you're not alone on this.
1	> Will these people ever want to talk to some arrogant kid who  simultaneously is inconsiderate has no confidence? I'm not meeting  people, and even if I did I'm not the kinda guy people wanna fuck with.\n\nI can't speak for such people, but it's very possible learn to show more consideration to others and increase your self-confidence. There's no necessary need to "meet" people unless you want friends or a relationship.\n\n>Will  any effort to improve my circumstances actually work or do I just have  to wait and grow up and to learn to be mature confident? Am I fucked  forever? \n\nYes. Most people aren't robotic in nature like an INTP so showing even a little bit if interest can go a long way. Everyone is different so there's always a chance that someone out there will be a good suitable friend or lover. Making mistakes in life and learning from them along with having regret is what makes you more mature while simply waiting to become a better person does nothing. Start small and set attainable goals to increase your self-confidence. Push yourself to try to have some sort of conversation with people that you interact wherever you go and maybe try complimenting a few to see their response.
1	> All of them were extremely immature and most of them were really dumb too. \n\nI'm curious, were you aware of this before proceeding or did you realize after the fact?
1	>So one of my romantic endeavors went sour and I am really sad and frustrated.\n>\n>This is the second time that something like this has happened to me.

This would probably be fine and dandy if I could actually get a girlfriend and be disillusioned of my overly rosy view of romance but that hasn't happened yet. \n\nI think that is the root of your problem; you are stuck in your own head with your idealized version of romance, which prevents you from forming actual relationships with real people. Things are better when they are imagined, but no one can perfectly fit your idealized version of a romantic interest, nor could anyone give you the exact same type of relationship you imagine because reality isn't going to be as ideal. I think you already know all of this, so I guess the most you could do about it right now is to actually consider what you truly want out of a relationship. From there you can ground yourself to a more practical view of romance. Are there certain traits you desire from a woman? Do you want her to be intelligent, empathic, independent etc. Is there any passion or interests you would want to share with anyone. By asking these questions, you can pin point what you actually want to pursue instead of chasing after a phantom. \n\n>I was really obnoxious and immature until about a year and a half ago so it's really only been that long that girls have even been somewhat receptive to my pursuits. \n\nSelf improvement is always good. And I can see you are making progress. \n\n>So the next reason is the girls I choose. Up until this very recent girl, they have all been nightmares. All of them were extremely immature and most of them were really dumb too.

Anyway, the point is, pretty much all of these girls are untenable and I'm just chasing dragons because I don't feel they are capable of having a relationship. Dating in middle school would be easier than dating most of the girls I liked.\n\nMay I ask why you think they are immature, dumb, nightmare etc? Are there any traits that they share that make you feel repulsed by them? If you can pin point what parts of their personality you do not like, you can atleast figure out what you don't want in a person, so you can prevent further disappointments. From reading your post, I assume you tend to idealize the women you are interested in before actually getting to know them, so perhaps you are disillusioned and off set by the fact that they don't meet your "expectations". I think you can try to drop all your expectations while interacting with your crushes, and judge them for who they are, not for what you think they should be. \n\n>Coupled with this for the ultimate combination for ruin is my own incapability. With pretty much all of the girls, I was able to enter some sort of romantic environment but they all led to a state of limbo. I think they know I'm interested, I think they're probably  somewhat interested, but I am terrified of actually acting in accordance with this and I end up acting in a very benign manner and this has led me to waste months while achieving nothing trying to date some stupid and childish girl. This pretty much always culminates in some final interaction that goes poorly, leading me to cut myself off entirely and being sad for a while.\n>\n\nIf you feel like there is any chance, just go pursue whomever you are interested in; I might be making a baseless assumption here, but they way you constantly refer your crushes as "stupid and childish" does sound like a defensive mechanism to hide your own insecurity about yourself. To me you are trying to rationalize your failures in dating by assuring yourself that your interests were not worth it. Of course there is a high chance that I am wrong on this, and if I am, I do sincerely apologize. However, I do want to know *why* you think of them that way, are there any traits that you particularly do not like? \n\n>This last girl was really lit though I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I just fucked up by not doing anything. I also might not have had a chance all along but I'm pretty sure I just fucked up.\n\nWhy is the last girl different? Did you get to know her more or less than the "dumb and childish" ones? If you got to know her more, probably you could try to connect with more people to build that type of understanding; if you know her less, perhaps you are still indulged in your idealized version of her. Are there any  traits she exhibits that you find attractive? You didn't provide any contexts, so I'm sorry if I can only speculate and ask you more questions. \n\n>Anyway, prompted I think by my despair and frustration, I had a revelation last night. I realized my relationship with romance and girls is not something a mature, capable adult should have.\n\nWanting a relationship is what most adults would want, but I agree your obsession with it is becoming problematic. I not saying that because I'm judgemental toward you; I'm saying that because you made it clear that it is bothering you. \n\n>I have been rebellious toward the idea that I ought to make an effort to improve my social image. I disregard things like trying to act more likable and socially fluid as well as working on my appearance as pandering to the sheepish, vacuous majority.

Will these people ever want to talk to some arrogant kid who simultaneously is inconsiderate has no confidence? I'm not meeting people, and even if I did I'm not the kinda guy people wanna fuck with.\n\nIf you are aware of all this, what are your going to do about it? Have you tried to act more humble, talk to more people and shifting your mindset and persona of which you personally think is problematic? You can't force people to want to talk to you; you have to adapt and change your behaviors if you want to seek actual changes in your life. \n>\n\n>I have no idea what to do. My college, UCSD, just feels so isolated as well. I feel like it's an especially harsh environment for someone with my problem. I have no one.

Will any effort to improve my circumstances actually work or do I just have to wait and grow up and to learn to be mature confident? Am I fucked forever?\n\nGrowing up is an active effort, the fact that you are introspecting and reflecting means you are getting there. You cannot grow more mature or confident by doing nothing. You have to put in actual efforts to change. \n
6	I feel personally attacked	
2	Why the fuck do I keep seeing this.
4	One's life following patterns	Has anyone noticed patterns in someone's life? Yours, others...\n\nWhat have you done about them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I've noticed my life follows extremes. I deal with things a certain way, then do its opposite, then actually decide on a best way to handle it. Aside from that, that one graph describing the relation between how much someone thinks they know vs how much they really know describes me well. I tried to 'break' out of some of my patterns, only to notice this behavior itself was part of it.
4	You see the patterns you look for. So it's important which patterns you look for.
2	I cycle addictions, constantly feeling like I'm finally about to be free from everything. But no, then I rekindle another addiction I quit two months ago.

1	I have noticed one pattern in the universe — and that is that many things are exactly the opposite of what you‘d expect them to be. That‘s why I always check both ends of a topic at hand, so I‘m sure I don‘t miss out on its real nature. Which usually seems equally plausible, which then again makes me believe the philosophical belief that „two opposites are the same“ is actually true.\n\nBesides that, in my life one pattern I‘ve noticed is that I used to think I‘ve gotten insight about sth, which then got disproved again after a while. Everytime sth gets disproven and I know better, I assume that it is final, which then again gets disproven and I get to know better again etc. which makes me wonder is there even an end to the constant learning and experiences?\n\nAnother pattern in my life is that, if I really want sth, I first get disappointed and have already given up on a thing, only then I actually get what I wanted from the beginning with. And also that everything that happens to me are extremes, I either have extremely bad or extremely good luck. Things where people would say „How in the world could that ever happen? The odds are so small?“ and that somehow every person I get close with turns toxic, making me wonder whether I‘m the problem and create monsters.
1	Ray dalio talks a lot about this. Definitely someone to Check out in if your into being better 
7	I used to think I was INTP due to social anxiety, but really I was an ENTP.	If you cba reading this, skip to the last paragraph. It may  help you find your true self.\n\nI used to always think I was introverted. However I have recently learnt that I was socially anxious whilst been extraverted and this caused me to become depressed. How? \n\nWell I always used to think I sucked in social situations. So I would be really quiet, constantly in my head, analysing the whole situation. I would stay in my flat whilst my friends and other people were out having fun. I would always be eager to get out, to have friends and to socialise, but due to my social anxiety, I would choose, against my natural instinct and desire, to stay in. I was getting pretty depressed as I wanted to socialise but I never could because of social anxiety.\n\nI have recently gotten over my social anxiety, since starting university. I am now happier than ever because of socialising alone. I learned that not been social was actually causing my social anxiety. When I feel sad now, I'll go into my flat kitchen and have a conversation and it'll cheer me up.\n\nIf there are any people in this sub who have an urge to socialise, you should go do it. You probably aren't introverted, but socially anxious. There is nothing worse than thinking you're introverted, whilst you're actually extraverted.\n
5	> There is nothing worse than thinking you're introverted, whilst you're actually extraverted. \n\nFamine, AIDS and getting shot are just some things I can imagine being worse.   \n\n\nSeriously though. It's great that you got that anxiety under control and I think the real message here is that extroverted individuals are not immune to social anxiety or fears. As an INTP I tend to believe that extroverts have some social superpower and everything is easy for them. I think a lot of INTPs and other introverted types think the same way. \n\n&#x200B;

2	Fear is the mind-killer. And a common problem for me. \n\nWho would you be if you removed fear from the equation? Not caution, but fear.\n\nFear of being judged. Fear of getting it wrong. Fear of getting hurt. \n\nFear of failing, so you never try. Fear of trying, so you never learn. Fear of dying, so you never live.\n\nOnce you fear to fail, you have already failed.
1	cba is a term that has been used a lot recently. 
1	I take an MBTI test every few months and I've observed that I constantly switch between being an ENTP and being an INTP. \n\nIf I'm dealing with something that depresses me, or if I'm working on making myself better, I take a step back from the extraverted life because I need some time off from people. When I'm like that, dealing with people frustrates me because I feel like they're intruding on what to me is extremely valuable self reflection time. It begins to feel like I can't function without some alone time. \n\nWhen I feel like I'm free of whatever is bothering me, and I just want to live a little, the ENTP comes back out to play. \n\nI believe we're all ambiverts. Who we are today doesn't have to be who we are tomorrow. Don't box yourself into being an extrovert forever. You never know when you'll need some alone time to recharge. Be whoever you feel the need to be at the moment.
1	Holy shit, this is kinda a revelation for me. I have ADHD as well as Asperger's, and I've always been INTP despite loving conversations. Even if I'm bad at talking to people and relating with them, I still get very sad when I'm lonely for extended periods. Sometimes I don't even open my mouth when I want to talk to someone because I'm too afraid. \n\nI definitely gotta look into this.  
1	Yeh it’s weird as my social anxiety went away and I became more comfortable around others, I started to test for ENTP. It’s 70/30 rn for INTP n ENTP

1	Direct quotation from Patrick Star, from "Patrick Smartpants", Season 4 Episode 11.
1	Apparently Patrick Star is a dumb INTP, but I'm not to sure. Pretty hard to actually type cartoon characters. 
5	I don't know if I'm an INTP or an ENTP	I've been described as someone who's very funny. I was pretty much a class clown in high school. I'm not really scared of talking to people at all. I can do small talk, but I don't really prefer it. The only time I'm socially awkward is when I'm talking to someone I like. Like a crush. I have conversations and arguments inside of my head a lot (yeah it's weird) and I love to think. I DO enjoy staying at home and playing video games and watching things like conspiracy theories and documentaries, but I don't really mind going out with friends and doing things outside. I'm kind of a quiet person (depending on the situation) but I'm definitely not afraid to talk. Dumb ass rules and laws that don't make any sense also tend to piss me off. \n\n\n\nI've taken the mbti test several times and I've gotten gotten INTP the most and ENTP occasionally. I honestly feel like both, but apparently you can't be both. So I'm a little bit conflicted. \n\nCan an INTP have ENTP traits and vice versa?\n\n
9	I swear you just described me perfectly. I'm pretty sure INTP's can adapt to the world around them fairly easily, that's why (for me at least) i started out pretty shy and socially awkward but as I observed the people around me, I found it a lot easier to be "social". I still have my awkward moments though. I met an ENTP once and they were completely different than me (hyper beyond belief)

1	INTP it sounds like. INTPs can behave very chaotically and come off as ENTPs in the right situation and context. I’m an INTP and I had the same delimmea as you. What it all really boils down to is if you feel recharged or drained hanging out with people. That’s the best way to know. For me, i can’t hang out any longer than 4 hours or I’ll go insane
1	You are definitely an INTP, and a lucky one because your friends appreciate intelligent humor! Meanwhile, *my* friends called it lame so I’ve learnt to stop cracking jokes and keep them to myself (often causing me to randomly half-smile like a creep).
1	Welcome to the "I'm an INTP but this sub thinks I'm too outgoing to be an INTP but I really do not relate to ENTP problems club"
-1	There's this in between, called an ambivert. It doesn't fit in the MBTI scheme
6	Do other INTP's find it tiresome to be friends with very emotional friends?	Before I say anything else, I'm certain that this will sound almost like a rant, but what better place to get something of your mind.\nI'm in my last year of school, studying in a specialised school (art) meaning almost 90 % of all students are emotional people. Now enters friend. At first, I didn't really want to associate with her as she really gave me the 'I'm a special snowflake' vibes, which I'm not a fan of. But she also lived in our dormitory and subsequently became my roommate. For the first two years I was polite, yet cold (according to her). At first she seemed kind of likeable, although people naturally like to flock around her. People liked that she was so opinionated and impulsive at times, after all that's how most artists are perceived to be. \nAfter being friends for over 4 years she started acting... differently. She started pointing out how I was weird to not cry about emotional things , I wasn't passionate enough about my specialty (which I am, but I might not voice it) and that I 'looked smart' yet got average grades, she even started to make fun of my wish to get more friends and just get along with people. \nAll of that would be fine, if I didn't have to spend around 15+ hours a day with her for years. I tried to change roommates, but my request was denied. She would suddenly tell me that she hated some of my character traits. \nEvery time she asks me to say something I dislike about her, she suddenly starts crying and telling me I'm a bitch for being so cold and apathic, told her me that I could never understand her since she has depression.\nTo get to the point, lately I've been feeling not like myself. I feel irritated often, I have to go on walks every day to clear my head. I even started considering if maybe I am a toxic person. However much I want to separate from her, I don't really have much of a choice, since her mother asked me to look after her, and we're going to go to the same university.\nI know that the question was different, but I was hoping maybe someone could give me some advice how to deal with this?

2	I don't think that you're wrong for feeling the way you feel about her. I don't think that you're toxic either. I think you're being forced to carry someone else's burdens and you shouldn't have to.\n\nInstead of viewing her as the nuisance she obviously is, and wallowing in the negative vibes she puts off, you could choose to continue being objective about the whole situation you're stuck in. Don't let her negative emotions and words create more of the same in you otherwise even when you finally stop being roommates, you'll still carry some of those burdens she's placing on everywhere you go. \n\n>She started pointing out how I was weird to not cry about emotional things , I wasn't passionate enough about my specialty (which I am, but I might not voice it) and that I 'looked smart' yet got average grades, she even started to make fun of my wish to get more friends and just get along with people.\n\n>I even started considering if maybe I am a toxic person\n\nShe's obviously the more toxic of the two of you because she seems to be reaching out of her comfort zone to disrupt you in yours in a way that seems to hurt more than help. She's sown the seeds of self doubt in you. I'm not implying that you're flawless, but I think that what she points out as flaws are really just parts of what make you, you. They don't actually harm anyone and they don't make you less than anyone. Someone else might find the same things beautiful. Accept yourself, and don't allow her to get under your skin anymore.\n\nThat said, emotional people don't take well to harsh truths about themselves, so perhaps be a bit more gentle with her when you're pointing out her flaws, but don't lie about them, just soften the blows where you can.\n\nAsking you to be nice to her is probably asking a lot because you really don't owe her anything if that's how she treats you, but you could choose to be the better person instead of reflecting her bitterness back at her.\n\nGood luck.
1	x\n2nd. emotionality = sign of incompetence   > 3  \n3rd incompetence doesnt deserve much intimacy and the interaction tends to be draining  \n4th theres serious value system incompatibility (intimacy vs conceptual truth)   \n5th rhetoric differences making it a pain to understand one another  \nimagine the compounded effect of all these   \n\nps. only read title - learn to be concise
1	This sounds exhausting. It's absolutely NOT your job to take care of her. I would say to distance yourself as much as you can even though you have to see her regularly. People like this will drain you. I don't know the rules of dorm life but can you say it's an unhealthy living arrangement for you mentally? Or get your parents/guardians involved? Something to get them to move you asap.
447	“that means it’s working”	
27	(INFP) INTPs post the best comics and memes. 
0	isn’t this subreddit supposed to be about higher discussion and thinking? yet here we are with some stupid comic whose formula is just to take ordinary things and describe them in a reductionist manner. \n\neverytime i see something related to daily life posted it makes me incredibly depressed. this is just about a cat and your experiences with it. it makes me think of everyday life which is empty of meaningfulness.\n\nfuck that, i want to maximize meaning in my life. i’ll start by extracting the meaning from this comic by pointing out that it’s the opposite of meaning: it’s meaningless simplistic entertainment focused on relatability in daily life. it’s a fine example of something devoid of meaningfulness.\n\nmeaningfulness would be something HIGHER which elevates away from everyday life! it’s that which fills your soul. i need to figure out what things are like that, in order to start making more of it happen 
-8	I noticed something about cats and dogs cohabitating. Cats are afraid and get all weird and hide when there's a dog in the house. I've noticed a few cases of this. For the good of cats pick one animal.
1	I shaved my head	I shaved my head yesterday. I'm not really sure why but I've been blasted from my comfort zone, so far I can't even see it anymore... I'm not unhappy though, I've been really anxious lately and I've always tried to hide from people rather than talk to them. Now I've leapt free of the social and personal ambiguity that protected and shrouded me. \n\nJust wanted to share
2	Excellent! I am 54 and did that 6 months ago. My wife was not pleased, and the boys just laughed. I was pleased to learn that I actually have a good head shape to be bald. It was amusing to see how differently people reacted to me.\n\nI ended up letting it grow back in because it was too much hassle. I thought bald was easy, but for me it was not. I wanted a smooth, shiny bald head, not stubble. I shaved my head in the morning and then had to shave again around 5. \n\nBy the way, I went through a bunch of shavers. Most of them did not give the smooth shiny look. There are some that are made for bald heads, but they were no better.  In the end, I found that the  Panasonic ES-LA93-K did what I wanted.  There are some similar Braun shavers too. Only a foil shaver gave me the closeness I wanted.\n\nAmazing how quickly I got cold outside. Hats are good.  \n\nEnjoy it. Maybe for you, it should be permanent.
2	I shaved off all my hair to win a game at a school camp. It worked. I won the title of ‘coolest kiddo 2018’. It probably helped that I am a woman.
3	So how does pulling a Britney feel and did it do what you hoped it would?
1	Be me:\n\n8 years old and Dad’s longing to use the “trimmer” from older brothers past hence forth, the summer heat drives us to crazy ideas.\n\nI reluctantly succeeded to the whim of fatherly trimming using a #2 guard, leaving me with a chill running up my neck as the sight of my malformed noggin finally revealed in the mirror of my childhood bathroom.\n\n“Oh shit”, school is in two weeks, the timing of parental decision impaled me to the thought of all the social aspects I would infer.\n\n“I know!” I instantly came up with a game plan to save the day.\n\nMy 8 or 9 year old brain decided it would “ease” the fact I was a fuzz-head to my peeps by surprise, an antic of horror-film status-quo.., I would hide in the bushes in our main hallway of our school and jump out and shout “Ahhhhh” really loud at people. They would be scared at first, then see my hideous head and be too distracted to oblige a judgement of my appearance, rendering them in a state of awe. \n\nThis was my plan, but I don’t think my assimilation back to society once I shaved my head went over as an eight year-old would hope for.\n\nGood luck.
1	I did that. It felt nice but I looked so ugly. so instead of making me feel more confident I just got more depressed. if I could pull it off I would totally do it again though
11	Any INTPs here ever been to Jail?	I currently have 5 or 6 misdemeanors on my record but I was booked on two felonies and spent 36hrs in jail. I likely won't be convicted of felonies because I can plead out and because even though I'm an addict and mentally ill I work 40+hrs a week. The vast majority of my hours are at a store but I'm officially a published newsman for a news site (even though I'm technically an intern and get paid for it). I'm also probably going to grad school for media studies. These are mitigating factors that show I have legit income, I won't become a habitual offender chasing money the easy way. I've been booked on a felony before but I was arrested with my boys and while 17 is technically an adult for criminal charges, they didn't wanna send us up to the county.\n\nBut the other day was booked on a felony and at first I didn't know I would be. I was brought in for questioning and then they filed the charges at the precinct and bc they were felonies I had to go to county alone. Legit scary shit. Apparently I was under investigation for a while. A smart thing that I did was be at my mom's apartment when they brought six cops in. They did this because I have a record of punching out cops but was never charged for it because I was brought in on a psych hold that time and I was blacked out on booze and benzos (Schizoaffective-bipolar disorder). \n\nThis time I was super calm. I've been in cuffs more than a dozen times (arrests and psych holds combined, plus my juvenile offenses, now expunged).\n\nThe reason it was smart to get cuffed and taken away in front of my mom was because she would know I would be getting sent up and start the process of bail. She was the one who warned me about the investigation too.\n\nIf it were a misdemeanor I could've started the bail process earlier AND I wouldn't have to go to the county. They told me I was gonna be in there a week at least but my mom kept bugging them (shout out to mom and dad too. He drove to my state and secured lawyer--Dad had more money than mom. Having a good lawyer is important). The second my lawyer got in contact with the DA and made sure no further charges got filed he started working on my bail. All the other inmates were thinking it was a pipe dream to think I'd be out in less than a week with two felonies on my head. \n\nAnyway. People in my major in college, profs and students alike, and the whole government admit how broken the system is, but unless you see it first hand you don't know the extent. I spent an hour at the precinct before my charges were filed. Then spent 10-12hrs chained to a bench with ten other cats. While nobody was getting booked into the jail. In dealing with a truly traumatic experience there we got along with each other well enough. Laughing and joking about an old man who could've been dying on the bench because he was slumped over passed out. Another guy who was transported from my precinct couldn't speak coherently because the cops had beaten the shit out of him, possibly with just cause if he was fighting them. But what isn't okay at all is how he was not on drugs yet was passed out. Make no bones about it. It's uncomfortable as hell on that bench being cuffed and if you can be unconscious you need medical attention. No joke. There is no real database open to the public about how many people die in custody. Upon bail my mom was told to watch me for 24hrs (which she didn't do). This is for two reasons: suicide watch and injury. In 36hrs I only saw one case of a fight between inmates but I saw a half dozen cases of aggression by COs on the inmates. Reason 2 is if you're injured behind bars. In all likelihood this will happen when COs attack inmates and not when two inmates get into it. I'm sure state prison is quite different with more violence amongst inmates. The reason this doesn't happen in the ~24hrs I was in the county (plus all the hours in the precinct and booking 12-14hrs) is because it's a transitional phase. The people getting ready to serve REAL TIME are getting ready and people who will be out in a week or less (like me and maybe half the other inmates) are focused on the first thing they'll do when out. For me it was smoke a cig. Take a shit and pop a klonopin. I couldn't shit in the cell with ten dudes watching and no TP. I'm a benzo addict. I was able to have a nurse give me 10mg of diazepam, not so I wouldn't go into withdrawals but so the withdrawals wouldn't kill me. My dissociation, eyes of a maniac, and so forth were why I wasn't messed with. Even though I would normally be a target because I'm white and out of 70-80 males on the cell block there was one other white guy. People who are habitual offenders bring in contraband. I smoked part of a rolled cig which people were inhaling like weed to get the nicotine in their system. Some in the cell were smoking weed. This was done during the cig so that it wouldn't reek of bud. Honestly the cells smell so bad already that nobody could notice. The same dude bragged about coming to the same county jail for 25yrs Smuggled tobacco, weed, a lighter and heroin. He was ready for a long stay. I love opiates. Hell I'm on a legal opiate RC right now and was probably in withdrawal from the RC on top of the benzos. I've never done heroin but was super tempted. I wasn't by the weed because paranoia. The only reason I didn't do the heroin was because I didn't wanna be incapacitated then raped. This same guy said he'd put money on my books if I watched him jerk off in the corner. I said "fuck no" and he didn't even jack it. He was just testing me. My psychotic behavior kept me safe. Before all these dudes entered the cell I had been asleep because of the diazepam and because they threw me in a cell alone because I wandered to near the "female only" by mistake twice. Then I wandered near the exit and a tasing order was given but I backed off. In the cell alone I got a small amount of sleep. All the other dudes were put in my cell because of the fight I mentioned (so I didn't technically witness it but knew it happened). Gang affiliation and race seemed not to matter at this stage either. Rival gang members were downright friendly with a GD and 4CH giving daps to eachother. On the other hand members of the same gang were shaking up constantly to show they had strength in numbers. The only Hispanic dude in my cell seemed to have the same racial reaction as me "as the only one" and seemed scared despite how on the outside he would scare me as a crack and heroin dealer. He seemed like a kissass to the dude with all the contraband we called "OG" because he knew the system. They snorted H together. The Hispanic dude seemed to not use it much because he fell asleep right after while OG seemed barely affected yet in a very good mood. I was having asthma attacks and constantly needed water, but to get it I had to beat the shit outta the door. Then a CO would come with a can of mace, holding it menacingly as I drank the nasty lead filled water. The straight lead water actually tasted better than the kool aid made with lead water I took my diazepam with. Words cannot describe what I felt when I was released. But right on the other side seeing my mom didn't calm me. I was in full blown psychosis and I had picked up the criminal slang like full immersion into a second language.\n\nI had PTSD going in. Dunno if this will cause more but everything smelled like the county for a day and I took a shower when I got home that felt like the ones that rape victims take in the movies. Though I wasn't raped. I heard enough gnarly criminal bragging etc. Also the COs were right to protect the women. Apparently when I was away from the door someone saw a guy jump a girl with unknown intentions but I don't give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nGot home. Took a bunch of kpin, Clonazolam and Tianeptine to get my mind right. They're downers so I took a nap. Woke up to my dad trying to rid my apartment of anything incriminating. Mostly pill bottles but he also did a legit clean in case this was cause for eviction. My parents respect my choices enough to let me keep the c-lam and tianeptine.\n\nI went to see my lawyer with both parents (who hate each other but hate the law and police more, especially when I get treated this way). Both were aware of why I could get in trouble. I disclosed it to both of them. They are sympathetic. Especially because in recent months I got a job, an internship in my dream field, and a gf healthier than me. I was arrested with no drugs on me, but I had a large amount of cash. I'll either get a check for it or it will be kept as evidence.\n\nI met with my lawyer and was reassured I probably won't get to felony convictions or the 3-5yrs in prison like the DA wanted.\n\nI spent the past two days numbing myself with sex and drugs. I've been seeing my girl almost two months but haven't fucked her that much so I think the night after I got out I fucked her more than the whole relationship combined. I wanted to fuck her like a thug straight outta jail. Rough and to be aggressive but she was down. I wanted to fuck her to forget what I went through. Then I kinda kicked her out. I postponed the pillow talk to a phone call yesterday morning. We've had some bonding experiences. I can see this going places. I haven't had a serious relationship since 2015. That girl left me for meth. I spent the rest of Friday continuing to numb with drugs. Stims this time. Gotta be at work in a couple hours.\n
5	Your life makes me feel bad for wasting my days sitting on the couch.
3	No man, never been to jail. 
2	Were stopped regularly, when I was younger, because I was 'associated' with guys who did interest the cops.\n\nHad they wanted to slap me with a criminal record, they'd have had an easy job; I was a criminal.\n\nFrom being thirteen, they'd stop me on the street, day and night. I had no school by then, no one at 'home' waiting on me and plenty of 'others' relying on me; hence, I was on the street day and night, but I never got charged. They knew I were a criminal by proxy, not by intent.\n\nThe cops hadn't the time, funds, resources or inclination to charge the likes of my sorry arse; one cop once told me I was born too smart and raised too 'street' to go to jail and not leave as either a sociopath or criminal mastermind, and they'd enough sociopaths and criminal masterminds to deal with already.\n\nKind thing to say and even kinder way to treat a kid who felt they had no one and nothing.\n\nSo, I got dealt a bad hand; shit happens. I focussed on the few kindnesses I were shown. Despite my kidhood, consequent decade shooting heroin to deal with or, more accurately, avoid dealing with my kidhood, and being INTP; **there are reasons, but there are no excuses**. Point being, I did what I needed to do to survive. But and when I learned better, **I did better, and I got better**.\n\n&#x200B;

4	What defines an INTP?	Hey r/intp. I’ve recently looked into the mbti and I got INTP as my results. However, I’m still skeptical as to whether it’s believable. So, what traits define an INTP? (P.S. I did two different mbti tests and somehow got the same thing)
11	Introvert: recharges when alone, extended social interaction is emotionally draining.\n\nIntuition: Big picture more important than tiny details. Tends to absorb all information, draw a meaningful conclusion, and then delete details from brain.\n\nThinking: Logic over Emotion\n\nPerceiving: Minimal planning, prefers freedom over a strict schedule. Dislikes obligations and authoritarians.
3	> However, I’m still skeptical as to whether it’s believable.\n\nIt is. However :\n\n* Remember it's a man made categorization. \n* How you are determines your type, not the other way around. \n* It's also about your preferences, not your competence\n* It's about the way you process information, not behaviors. \n* Introverted vs Extraverted isn't about shy vs social, nor is it about how you "recharge your batteries". You've got extraverted and introverted tendencies, and everyone does. The question is more "About what are you introverted or Extraverted ?"\n\n> So, what traits define an INTP?\n\nWell, ideally, you would to research the 8 cognitive function ASAP. I recommand cognitiveprocesses.com\n\nINTP is TiNeSiFe. With :\n\n* **Ti : Introverted Thinking.** It's thinking, but introverted, so tailored to you, the subject (as opposed to the "extraverted" outside world). It's about what you think, what you understand, what you find logical... \n\nTi being our first function means we are very skeptical/critical, not in a bad sense of the term (even though we get perceived as such), it's just the standard we hold ourselves to. I can't actually state how much we care about this, but let's just say it's the most important thing for us ? Like, an INTP won't do something that doesn't "make sense" to him or her. "That's the way it always been" or "I'm more knowledgeable so do as I say " and similar ideas won't work at all. \n\n* **Ne : Extraverted Intuition.** It's not about "intuition" in the classic meaning, here, intuition means the world of the abstract and ideas. Sinc eit's extraverted, it operates in the outside world. Translating it, Ne looks for more and more ideas to feed on. When confronted with something new, an Ne user will look for multiple ways of looking at this before settling on one. Think of it as being confronted to a cube, and turning around to see if it's really a cube, asking yourself, "what if it's a box from the other side ?" \n\nNe in INTP makes us prettty able to discuss things from multiple point of views, multiples philoophical lenses, with even different starting facts/assumptions\n\n* **Si : Introverted Sensing** Sensing refers to the senses, and since it's about you as an introverted function, it's more about the other senses beside the 5 ons. For example, feeling mentally tired, feeling physically exhausted, pain, hunger,feeling cold, feeling hot, etc. It also includes some of the 5 sense, but the key thing is that it's about you. Perception of your own body, etc. \n\nIn INTP, Si, as a the third function, is weak. So, we tend to not take care of ourselves too much, or forgetting to eat. Another thing that may be tell tale is the cold ? I always get comments when I get out with a long sleeved t shirt when it's "cold" (say 12-15°C) even if it's more comfortable with the sun and all. Anyway, we're rather bad at taking care of ourselves and whatever.\n\n* **Fe : Extraverted Feeling** Feeling refers to values, like and dislike, and preferences. Being etxraverted, it operate in the outside world, and tries to find "what's objectively valuable ?" "What's objectively likable ?" As such, Fe is kinda looking to please, find the common ground with peoples, and develop "harmony"... Well, actually, Fe can also be used to sow the total opposite, discord, envy, etc, it's really about the group's common value. High Fe users find that stuff like saying Hello, how are you, and other niceties is pretty important. \n\nFe is 4th in INTPs, and let's just say we're pretty bad at it, very oblivious to all that stuff that we tend to ignore in favor of our Ti. We don't really "get it" socially, what people wants, what they expect of us, what opinions are socially acceptable, that "there's a time and a place" idea, etc, etc. \n\n***\n**Combine that, you get a somewhat intelligent guy/gal, who's apt in the abstract, yet don't get what's happening in front of him/her, and looks like a mess sometimes.**\n\nThat's it for now, I really invite you to dig it more, I can't really explain all of it on top of my head. 
2	Introvert: focused on what objects of conception "are", rather than objects themselves.\n\nIntuitive: focus on abstractness rather than information from the senses or relating to perception of the universe through the senses. not as interested in the experience as what is timeless.\n\nThinking: values facts and logic over emotions and desires or distastes, relatively speaking.\n\nPerceiver: When interacting with the outer world, rather than the inner nature, INTPs focus on "what is", rather than what it means to you or implies.\n\nWhen you put all of this together using Jungian psychology, it often means that the personality manifests as someone who focuses primarily on the logic inherent between objects of conception, with a secondary focus on approaching objects of conception in an abstract way. They wish to systematize things which can be systematized, in order to have some sense of understanding, but when they are exploring, they can be quite unrestricted and go from thing to thing.\n\nIntroversion does not necessarily mean "you become drained in social situations", although it often results in such behavior. An introvert will not primarily be focused on "people" themselves, but rather what those people represent or "mean", so interacting with them directly is not as natural. More than the average person, INTPS are focused on their inner world, thinking about themselves and thinking about the essence of things, rather than simply viewing themselves in a detached sort of way or making strong judgements of others.
2	You don't  handle emotions well and when trapped and pushed hard enough will expode, melt down, very messy, very frightening to others. At least thats what I do.
1	I won't repeat what other have said here but it you want some additional resources to learn about the cognitive functions to be able to type yourself, look at this: https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com\nThey mostly type fictional characters but they have a lot of information on MBTI if you look through the sections at the top. It's also explained pretty straightforward, so you should be able to understand it without much prior knowledge.\n\nIf you've looked at that and want something more in-depth, check this out: https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com\nIt's way more dense to read but is so much more precise and deep. Definitely don't recommend it until you've looked at the first one though.
1	I don’t think about the types as the 4 letters in INTP and what they stand for. I look at the 4 most preferred functions in order as u can find on type in mind. For ex. - we have \n1. Ti\n2. Ne\n3. Si\n4. Fe \nin that order.... Entp has the same exact 4 but in a different order. To really learn each type, it’s better to figure out their 4 function stack and how they feed into eachother.
1	Mbti is interesting, but take it with a grain of salt because it is kinda bullshit

0	I feel personalgy attacked..

1	 **I feel feel feel personally attacked** 
1	Intps who are into fashion, give me one good reason to be into it.	
8	I'm not into fashion either, but what I do believe unfortunately is that people assume who you are by the way you present yourself. It's moreso for others rather than yourself. If you ever want to be treated professionally, you'll have to dress the part.
4	To visibly feel like you're better than everyone else
4	Wearing clothes that suit you and fit well make other people like you better.\n\nShallow, but worth taking advantage of. 
3	That’s not how it works. You’re into it or you aren’t 
2	If you are not into something, you are not into it. If you want to be more fashionable in the eyes of other people, you don't have to be into it. Just google the latest trend for your age group, gender, area etc and adapt to whatever styles that are generally popular. If you have your own sense of fashion that is not shared by many, just go ahead and embrace it. 
1	The only good reason I have is if you enjoy it then learn about it. Could ask the same question for any kind of "art".
1	To represent values in a temporary fashion, it’s a frill to an already solid unit of expression. 
1	I wouldn't say I'm into fashion, per se, but I know how to dress myself.  What it accomplishes, idk, but it's superficially satisfying to curate your own inimitable style.\n\nThere is no good,objective reason if you don't have a curiosity.
1	I dress smartly because I want to make my outer shell and inner shell in balance. \n\nYou cannot deny it that our culture is one that looks at appearance a.k.a first impression. Not everyone knows "do not judge the book by its cover". \n\nThe benefit of dressing up is worth it, I think. In my experience, although I work as IT, but often I will need to attend meeting with users/customers. It will make my job easier if I dress up smartly so they will listen to my opinion. 
1	I enjoy looking nice. I like being able to look in the mirror and see that I look good in whatever I’m wearing. So if you already think you look nice without picking a particular outfit OR if you genuinely just don’t care, don’t bother trying to get into it. Some people like wearing sneakers and sweats all the time. That’s not for me, but it makes them happy. 
1	I think it's interesting, reading people's logical takes on this.  Looking how I choose to look has been important to me for as long as I can remember.  I think it might be a sensory response to how completely misunderstood I felt.  I wasn't allowed to express myself verbally or mentally in the ways I wanted to, so I went a different route, one of which my parents were fairly tolerant and accommodating.  \n\nAt work, I've had to concede a few things of course, but my employer is fairly accommodating; as long as I wear pretty, conservative, well fitting clothes, they don't seem to mind my occasional black, green, or blue lipsticks.  It's all about balance.
1	You can express exactly how you feel without using a single word. It allows people to know exactly when to talk to you or when to give you space. It (can) filter out who attempts to talk to you in order to provide significantly higher quality conversations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt (can) give you things to talk about during "parties." 
1	1. You can express yourself much easier, even to people you don't talk to\n2. Aesthetic value\n3. As a way of signaling the type of person you are and which interests you have. If you dress sporty then another sporty person will be more likely to interact with you\n4. Its boring to see the same face and body in the mirror for 365*85 days straight. It's much more fun and interesting to see a different looking person every day\n5. You can influence people's conscious and subconscious impressions of you
0	It's a tool you can use to your advantage.\n\nAlso, wearing things that are displeasing to the eye is bad manners if you're going to be around people. The more people that see you, the greater the responsibility.\n\nA little effort goes a long way. To start off with, try wearing clothes that fit well. Find colors that go well together with your skin and hair. You should be able to represent yourself well to other people. You can apply artistic talents to your appearance in a tasteful manner.\n\nThis is just another skill to master. INTPs can be excellent at aesthetics if they make an attempt.

6	Couldn't give a shit.
3	why the fuck should I care about these 2 people acting like idiots
1	people are really really really stupid. This just makes me not want to go outside even more.
1	Can you not post shit like this? Thanks
4	So couple of questions:1.Do you males hate makeup? 2. Do you female INTPs use makeup? 3. And what is fellining to be female INTP?	
5	What is” fellining “?
5	(Female)\n\nI believe that a person's actions are foremost to his/her appearance. That's probably why I barely invest into my appearance. No makeup. Just casual clothes and running shoes. Sometimes, it looks I am wearing the same thing every day because of how similar everything is. I barely feel self-conscious of my appearance. In fact, I am mostly comfortable with it. However, I still understand the importance of appearances, so I usually put on lotion and comb my hair.
5	(Male) I dislike the concept of makeup and want to find a girl that's naturally beautiful without it.\n\nI'm not contouring my biceps, chest, and making myself appear way better than I actually am. What a person sees is what they get. \n\nNow I do think hygiene and physical fitness are very important. I'd rather be with a girl that's a 6, but fit and clean..vs a girl that's like an 8 but smells, is chunky, with lots of makeup 
2	I use makeup but not often, only when I’m expecting to see people that I want to like me. And never a full face, I can’t get over how uncomfortable it is to have a layer of goop all over your skin. I really like nice eyebrows and panda eyes though. And some sort of mildly tinted lip balm, maybe.
2	1 yes   \n2 only if they havent thought about the implications fully. - most intp girls i talk to stop using makeup or didnt use it to start with (cant remember one who still does .. i think one with severe skin condition)
2	OOooowww living the cliche!, "Intps women don't wear make-up" lol.
2	Girls/guys, wear make up if you like wearing make up. Let's not create another dumb stigma, ok?
2	I don’t see the point of females wearing makeup.
1	INTP female speaking.\n1. Not a guy but I both hate and like makeup. I like well done eyeliner, pretty lipsticks,and elegant but fun eyeshadow. Much more than that and I hate how fake the face looks. Makeup is an accessory, so you should use only as much as you need and that you feel adds to your look. Any more and it's like putting on 5 necklaces. They might match, but it's gonna look clunky.\n(Exceptions are made for very over the top makeup used for certain events or circumstances, like drag queens. They're pretty cool)\n\n2. I do not, but I've often considered using it in a similar way I described above. I mostly don't because I don't want to spend the money on it, it would take a long time to get good at it, and I don't want to risk clogging pores or anything like that.\n\n3. Not entirely sure what you mean by that question but in essence, it feels frustrating. Mostly because other women are... Different. Most of them don't like the things I do, like things I don't, or don't even seem passionate about what they're doing. I currently have an associates in piano performance and am about to start on my bachelors in composition (music, not english), and only a small fraction of the music women I've met actually give a damn about understanding and just loving what they're doing. They just run around like blind bats doing what they "love" while never even talking about it. There's more to life than just floating around until you have a baby.
1	F INTP also Lesbian on the soft butch side.\n\n1) Hell no, I don't use make up.  \n\nI have been known to wear a small unnoticeable  amount to job interviews to help me look better. I have not had job interview since 2012.\n\n2) Feel great to be INTP. Feels bad to be INTP. Feels worse to be 9w1 sx while being an INTP.\n\nI did start out my young life with bad advice from the adults around me, so once I shook off the toxic people in my life (about age 30) My life, though challeging, has gotten better and better. \n\nWhile I would not trade being INTP for anything, I also would not give up being gay. It's the best. Women are so amazing. I love them so much. \n\n
1	INTP Female\n\n1. Not a male but probably indifferent? INTPs i feel like dont really care.\n\n2. Nope. At prom just wore lip gloss and mascara but I think thats pretty much it. I dont wear it daily, for going out or for interviews.\n\n3. Feels pretty lonely. I find women to be on the emotional side so I almost always end up screwing up my relationships with them. Also its hard to make male friends I think.\n\nI go to a tech school, and I feel like being a woman just makes you stand out. I'm an engineering major and have a (1) female friend who I think is an INTP too so we can have logical discussions and its a nice feeling. I also have my roommates but they're more extraverted and my roommate is more of a feeling type so she expects me to be in control of things that may piss her off but I'm just like no I'm not here to cater to your feelings so we clash a bit. I want to be friends with the guys in my major but I'm shy 😬. I just kind of say hi as I walk past. Also embarrassing when you can't remember their names.
1	Female INTP\n\n1. Not Applicable\n\n2. I do use makeup. Not too often though because I prioritize other things over my appearance (I usually wear makeup for job interviews or social events that I'm dragged into)\n\n3. I think the general implication here is that women are supposed to act and think a certain way, and that my INTP brain makes me different from the others. I've been told that I look like a girl and have the brain of a boy (if someone could explain that to me, that would be much appreciated). Additionally, I find myself getting extremely obsessed over a single topic and drowning myself in a rabbit hole. This is opposed to my colleagues, who strive to get a superficial understanding of several topics, rather than a deep understanding of one or two topics.\n
1	I don't hate makeup, in fact I like it a bit. If you NEED makeup when you go out I consider that unhealthy.
1	My feeling is that make-up is like false advertising. Enhancement is ok - but obfuscation is not...
1	Female intp here.\n\nI do use makeup, but mostly just enough to look presentable. I don't wear it everyday, but if I feel like it and have an extra 10 minutes in the morning I'll do some minor stuff. I do alwayd wear it to job interviews or other events where appearance matters a lot, I also wear it if I know there's going to be a lot of pictures taken, because it makes me hate taking them a little less.\n\nI used to hate make up with a passion. I didn't like that I was pressured to wear it and I didn't want to put in the effort to learn it/put it on everyday. But it's actually not that hard to do a low effort every day look\n\nI do know another intp/entp who loves makeup but she enjoys it because it's art. I've lived with her and I've known her to put on fancy makeup just to walk around the house.
1	1. I don't think they do, why would they?\n2. I don't, I like it on other people, I think it looks great when it's well done. I've worn it before and have watched some tutorials because I want the advantages that come with it but I guess I don't want them enough to actually invest the time lol\n3. Idk, I feel that if I were a male I'd be very similar. Maybe I would put on a different 'social mask' but not extremely so. Overall, it's disappointing, I have mostly male dominated interests and it's a lie that people treat you better for being a girl, it usually comes with a lack of respect instead. The ones that do usually turn out to be overdramatic or creeps, sadly, some are alright though (this is mostly over the internet, irl people are nice to each other but I don't think you get to know their bad sides). I don't have many female friends either, I'd say just one, and we rarely see each other, we have known each other for so long but I don't think there's a deep connection, I like her though, she's really nice, even if we barely text. Overall I think male INTPs find more acceptance even if we're both quite androgynous, regardless of sex, it's kinda sad, I'm in Academia and I play videogames and I used to identify with people in those circles (from afar), but when you're in it you find hostility instead because a lot of people can't see anything but your gender. Irl most people are nice enough, but you definitely can tell how they treat you differently (I ain't blind!). I wouldn't change my MBTI type even if it comes with these struggles though, I eventually found a small group of people I enjoy, but sometimes I see hints of what I've described above with them and I feel a bit of disillusionment. Overall I consider my sex a disadvantage, I used to want to like 'prove them wrong' and shit but it's not worth it, but I guess this is what I'm stuck with so whatever
1	On a daily basis I use eyebrow pencil and lipstick thats all, I'm not a makeup enthusiast but I don't mind people who enjoy makeup, it could be a creative form of art.
1	Butch lesbian here. I don’t wear makeup, never have, never will. And in my experience, I dunno if it’s so much about my myers-briggs or what, but I feel very alienated from other women almost 100% of the time. I don’t share many of the experiences a lot of women consider a staple of womanhood, and additionally, even though i do have emotions (a LOT of them, at that), I don’t express them in the same way. A lot of my relationships, both romantic and platonic, have suffered greatly due to the other party being very much a heart thinker and not a head thinker, and me not knowing how to deal with that. I’m blunt. I try to be nice and in my head it sounds like I’m doing a decent job of it, but there’s always at least one person who takes it in the worst way possible and that lands me in the dog house.
1	Female intp. \n\nI wear full makeup one day per week at work, then the bare minimum at uni on weekdays.  
22	This may just be me not an INTP thing	You ever be thinking but your mind is still empty
6	Yes, I rather enjoy the Zen like state. 
5	Yes and it's the reason my life is going to shit. "Thinking" is completely fucking useless masturbation because you're too afraid to face the present.
3	I'm finally able to shut off the chatter completely after a month straight of meditation.  I do around 10-15 minutes per morning and it feels like freedom and control.  
2	No
1	It's called frontal lobe brain damage. Don't worry friend. It's the reason you have a limitless memory about an extremely wide range of subjects. 
1	breh, It's awful. It used to not happen when I was younger. but now its like, all the time.
1	I don't think anymore \n\nI've transcended past the limits of thought
44	Who else buy more books that you can read?	And I getting lazy and I can't even finish the book I started like 3 months ago (it's 1500 pag novel with multiple characters and gives me anxiety), buuuuuuut I just get the Lord Of The Rings and I have like 50 books that I have not read yet, lots of them with 500+ pag. \n\n\n\n\nWTF IS WRONG WITH ME
8	Really, the internet is killing my ability to read books.   I’m half way thru “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t keep quiet”, and my copy of “Compilers” (Dragon book) just came in.   And I’m barely thru the first couple chapter of the Shanara Trilogy.\n\nOh, and I’ve read LOTR multiple times now.  Have all the movies, multiple costumes, and a few of the weapons.   My wife’s laundry room is Lothlaundrian.  It has LOTR posters, the Argonath, and other items.
4	I have the same problem, just digital.
5	LOTR is the best.  I've read it three times and, despite the stack of unread books on my nightstand that I really am interested in, I find myself ready for round four.  I'm practicing discipline and reading The Silmarillion instead.
4	Everyone who likes books does this I think 
3	That is normal.\n\nJust imagine...you will die tomorrow.
3	It’s tsundoku:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku?wprov=sfti1
2	My local library has paperbacks for 50¢ and a lot of them are classics. I buy them to read, and right now I have about 20-25 classic paperbacks unread by my bed. It's becoming a problem. 
2	Lord of the Rings is just terrific and magical, good decision picking it up!  And I've got more books than I have time to read in a lifetime lol
2	Lately, I’ve added newspapers. I struggle to get theough the New York Times and then “why not just get digital subs to the WSJ and the LA Times”
2	I buy more games that I can play, does that count? 
2	I've been forcing myself to finish reading books although I'm switching between about three. I literally write it down on a to do list and try to block out a time for reading if possible because I've lost control of my life and can only handle things on lists with any success.
2	I've switched to audio books now due to this very problem.  My kindle is full of zombied books.  Audio books seem to work so far but I have only listened to non fiction at this point.  Long drives and my running routine help me get through them.
1	I fucked up. I got my library card revoked and turned over to collections. I'll have to buy these 4 books. I bought one book last week. I'm only a few chapters in but only the first one was something I haven't read. Chapters 2-4 have been published in lit mags.
1	Yes. I have 5 books to read and I don't read.
1	Me! Oh, I'll get to them. Someday. Probably. 
1	how in the hell does a book give someone anxiety?
1	I honestly don’t even really like reading that much, this is how it usually turns out with me and books, I get a random urge to read a book and gain whatever I can from it, I start to read it, lose interesting in reading and go back on my phone to read more o guess you could say “real world” things 
1	The tweet culture has destroyed my ability to finish books
1	I just can't help myself.... I wish the books could just download into my brain when I buy one 
1	I read a lot of books (on average: approx. 700 pages per week), but for the last two years, I've been buying even more (average rate: 900 pages per week). \n   \nNot only is it expensive, the unread books have started to accumulate as my to-read list grows ever longer. On the bright side, I have more and more options to choose from depending on my mood. For example, I just finished The Rememberance of Earth's Past Trilogy and now get to choose whether I want to read Ninefox Gambit (to stick with sci-fi), The Grace of Kings (to stick with Ken Liu), or The Selfish Gene (to stick with the evolution theme). \n   \nUnfortunately I don't live near any English language libraries. Back in the States, library due dates could always motivate me to suck it up and finish something.
1	yep,\n\n&#x200B;\n\ncurrently reading\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlife 3.0\n\nautobiography of a yogi\n\nmastering the core teachings of the buddha\n\nmere christianity\n\nreaper's gale\n\n&#x200B;\n\n simultaneously lmao
1	I have every Dungeons and Dragons 5e book that's been released and I haven't even read most of the supplement material. And let's not even talk about all the campaigns I have...
1	It's better to have many plans than to have none.\n\nFirst i was under the impression that i don't like reading, i also tend to struggle a bit to stay focused, and while i certainly prefer well put together videos, i did very much enjoy reading some books. \n\nThe more books i read, the more critical i become of their mistakes, especially when it comes to non fiction. \n\nIf you liked that book you wouldn't have to whip yourself to read it.\n\n
1	I can read these books just fine.  Im not going to but I can.
1	Because how easily verbal information can be accessed nowadays with the internet and smartphones, I don't often find the need to buy books. I have a very bad attention span and can't hold on to anything too long, so I doubt I can actually finish a book unless it is something that is absolutely required of me. I guess I'm simply too lazy to read a book, because I can easily fuel my need of imagination and curiosity with videos. However, I am trying to get into reading ,because there is more to be digested from a book than a ten minutes video on YouTube if Im actually interested to learn about a topic. 
1	Raises hand.

1	intp subreddit	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z-pVZiRjac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z-pVZiRjac)
18	Were you once very extroverted but suddenly become very introverted?	Also, do you find it 1000x easier to talk to adults even though you’re not incredibly mature? Partially due to finding most people your own age annoying and cringy? (This would only apply if you’re not already an adult)
8	Yeah when I was like 11 hehe.\n\nedit: In the "social" sense. I was always introverted in the more general Jungian sense of not being focused on objects but rather on their essence. Around 11 I became more aware of how others behaved and it made me a bit more shy, because I didn't grasp the actions of others as easily as the average extravert. When I started to realize that extraverts and I didn't have as similar interests as we used to, that's when I started being more "traditionally" introverted.
7	Idk about extroverted, but I was a condescending annoying fuck in high school. Thought I knew all the answers. Like I had lots of acquaintances in different "cliques" but I still judged tf out of them. I cringe about that immaturity now. I find it much easier to talk to adults/elders now (as an adult ofc) than I did in high school. Probably because back then, I found there to be a very clear line between kid/teens and adults where adults should always be in a place of authority. But now, I don't really care about treating those older than me with a greater amount of respect so I come off as more casual or friendly with other adults older than me. 
6	Yeah I used to be very extroverted. I'm exact opposite of what I was when I was a kid. 
5	I've always been a bit introverted but my curiosity and general desire for good will to others has kept me a bit extroverted and goofy.\n\nBut then I went through some traumatic stuff, with many of my the closest people in my life plotting against and betraying me for months on end. I have a hard time trusting people now and am probably a bit too paranoid but I'm definitely full-on introverted now. probably to an unhealthy degree. I wish I could get back to my old self.
2	Yes, but I was only extroverted around a certain group of people or a person, I remember i was always introverted when it came to strangers or people I didnt talk to daily or regularly, 
1	Other way around if anything, altho I'm definitely not extraverted these days, just much more outgoing and initiating than I was when younger. But also I'm still young
1	You are both introverted and extraverted. Your thinking is introverted, but the way you seek ideas is extraverted. Same for Si and Fe\n\n> Also, do you find it 1000x easier to talk to adults even though you’re not incredibly mature? Partially due to finding most people your own age annoying and cringy? (This would only apply if you’re not already an adult)\n\nYes, both above and under my age range. I do well with kids too. I think the reason is the hierarchy/strength factor is well established ? You're superior to kids, so you can act a certain way, more "benevolent", while, with an older adult, you talk to a "superior" of sort, which has a sort of peace to it ?\n\nLike, no BS Se powergames, you can actually communicate TiFe wise ?
1	when I was a kid, and became very introverted when around nine. took me a while to give up.
1	It might be because when you were a kid, you were immature and blurted out literally every idea on your mind as they came - making you seem like an extrovert. And no one your age minded it because everyone *else* was immature too, so they probably said and did whatever. Also, the teachers were probably more understanding.\n\nOther things like your environment/events in your life could have also influenced you to become more introverted and less balanced for I/E.\n\nSo what I’m saying is that you may have always been an INTP, but you now prefer to hold ideas in your head (because you’ve learnt that other people now find your randomness annoying.\n\n^ me in a nutshell
583	Well, duh	
63	I also don’t get why these other people always get so emotional about their feelings. 
36	Even after getting myself to cry, after a couple tears my eyes are just like, 'thats enough'. Does a couple of tears even count as crying? 
17	Ahh the emotional train. I just hop off as soon as it boards 😂😂
39	I sometimes find emotional videos on YouTube just to "force" myself to cry, even then I can't really release all the bottled up feelings. 
13	Im have the ‘chill the fuck out we are all going to die anyway’ mentality.
20	Anybody remember when The Fault in Our Stars movie came out? I went to see it with my friend and she was really concerned that I was the only person in the theater not crying their eyes out. Watched it again at home later and really tried to get into it and forced myself to cry. This is what we do lol
16	I dont feel my emotions, i think them. 
7	I get close to tears all the time but I never cry. Whenever I want to actually cry though, I can't. 
6	I get so confused when I cry. Like I want to cry but no tears, then I get all normal and tears drop out of nowhere. And when I again focus on crying, I lose tears. Sigh.
3	I don't understand why I'm expected to need quiet, gentle attention when I'm emotional. If I want anything from a close friend or partner when I'm emotional, it's cultivating genuine understanding of my perspective as rapidly as possible.\n\nGo ahead, if you're losing the thread, blatantly interrupt me to tell me how you perceive my perspective. We can bicker for two minutes before you have that "a-ha!" moment where things click, and then talk another two minutes about why you thought what you did, and how it relates to your own experiences. Then maybe we'll even drop down a rabbit hole, to analyze what effect the difference in our perspectives has on our relationship and communication. If I'm not done sharing, I'll get there eventually.
3	I will sometimes force myself to watch something sappy to initiate an emotion outlet. It’s a good controlled emotional environment for me when I’m feeling like I’m dissociating due to lack of emotions. 
3	Does anyone else ever experience emotions and then reflect on those emotions with other emotions? Like I'll get angry and then think, "Wow, I don't usually get this angry. I'm even getting an irrational urge to almost hit something! Kind of a neat sensation, something I don't experience every day." And so I experience wonder in connection to my anger.
2	I have no emotions, what do you mean "feelings"?
1	I don’t get really emotional aboutmy feelings. I don’t really bother expressing them that much. But sometimes when a subject comes up where you kinda have to tell people how you feel, I sum up a bunch of kept-in emotions and then I get angry cos it’s making me cry. 
1	5 minutes before reading this post I started feeling. The eyes swelled with tears. My partner asked what was wrong. I said, "Nothing; I'm drying it up." One tear fell from each duct and that was it.
1	I don't understand why people get emotional over trivial things. 
1	My wife gets upset with me sometimes because she feels she has to do all the feeling for the both of us causing her emotions to skyrocket in compensation. The volume control dial on my outrage, joy, etc... just doesn't go any higher.
1	I have very strong feelings that I find overwhelming at times. I also don't like to share them and people have accused me of being a robot. Feelings are just a rollercoaster that I prefer to ride alone. Still waters and all that nonsense.
1	there is no suitable title for this!	Hi,\n\nI tried over and over and over again to make a goal, and stick to it, but they are breaking down due to my extreme doubt. I am having doubt about making goal, now, and I am everything but nihilist because I hate that state. I have a psychoanalyst, but he just tells me to get real (marriage, work, death) which I know is kind of needed, and I will do, but it is not everything and it will not be satisfying for  my mind(maybe) to see them as a final destination to get me motivated to do even these things. I need some brutal INTP honesty to help me to go through this never ending process of making goal or even not making again. I mean, I wanted to start to think, but found nothing to start upon. I mean even defeating death, AGI, and the age of abundance seems not satisfying anymore for me which were my last goal. I don't know if there is truth, or I should look for it, or I will die in the process, or is it reachable, or is there any ending or story at all, or the fact that we are just incrementally understanding the world a bit better by time can be satisfying at all, etc. \n\nMaybe too weird, but does anyone of you would help me with an hour of skype talk as a debugger and truthful person to help me in this battle with my mind(because it is definitely more powerful than me and everytime lead me to something that at the end I understand it was it's desire not mine) to find a ground to build up my understanding about where should I begin????\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	hah, your state in life isn't too far apart from mine. perhaps post a solution in case you ever find one.
1	RemindMe! 7 days ""
1	You *really* want the truth? Also PM me your skype... or can we do the google hangouts instead?
116	This.	
10	Yeah for me pretending to have a converaation with someone else in my head is thr best way for me to sort oit my thoughts.
5	Why wouldn't everyone do this?  Rehearsing the conversation in advance really cuts down on the thinking-time when you actually do it.  Composing a coherent and accurate response takes more time than most people are willing to wait.  If I wrote a bunch in advance, though, I can just pull them out of the archive as I need them.\n\nThey're already correctly phrased and vetted to be strictly accurate.  Everyone should do this.
2	Anyone else miss the Attitude Era?
1	Holy shit, are you me???!!?
110	This is me	
10	It's like I need a translator or something.  English is what comes out but it seems that english isn't what others hear.  
9	lmfao. Hydration cylinder xD
3	Wish he said Affirmative at the end
2	Excuse me, may I have a hydration cylinder
2	Why the fuck are you spewing this self-indulgent INF crap on INTP?
9	Being an INTP in Australia (Sp society) I feel like I haven’t had the same struggle as American INTPs. Do any of think this could be because America is a SJ society	
8	Better to live in a country founded by SP petty criminals than one founded by SJ religious fanatics? Makes sense to me.
3	Aussies are generally relaxed and let each other just do their own thing. If you want to stay quietly working in a project, your choice... plus there's plenty of space to just be out of the way if necessary too. Aus society is more about surviving the elements than looking fancy, and mad professors are helpful in that mission!
1	I don't know if you are right or not, but I am tempted to move to Australia just to find out.
1	dunno, I'm having a similar experience in NZ as you are.
1	No, that's how "ENTJ"s think, not "INTP"s. "INTP"s think in terms of civilization level unconstrained by space.
0	I didn't think there were any INTPs in the southern hemisphere.
22	So just now I wrote a bunch of text end then removed it. Because of inconsistency in it. And I'm curious now how often this happens to other intp people?	
11	I did this about 7 times yesterday writing one paragraph. After I write something I analyze it, second guess it, and eventually start over until I feel like it’s perfect. 
7	Whenever it gets too long and has too much content, it loses its purpose. Most of the time I'm trying to drill one point home.
3	I'm now thinking about how much interesting things are not written because of this huh
2	Yes
2	Yeah I end up writing something rambling and ultimately pointless, without realizing.  But sometimes I just post it anyway, thinking somebody might find it interesting. So all that writing doesnt go to waste.
2	This is a feature, not a bug.  The great thing about written communication is that it allows editing.
2	Often I tend to ramble when I'm typing. When I reread what I write I realize that I bring up a ton of points that are connected but I skip steps in connecting the points.
2	Almost every single time I write a text or comment.
2	I think the Cat Stevens phrase, "All day, e'ery day" is appropriate here.
2	Yeah it usually ends up as a topic within a topic within a topic I realize it’s irrelevant, go back one topic talk about that a bit then go back tot he original topic then turns into another topic and it’s all just one big mess, and I delete most of it and turn it simple and basically try to sum down everything I had already typed up, or just give a more basic response, I think that’s just INTP nature 
2	It's pretty frequent for me. I'll be writing some point down and just get lost in the flow of things and end up in some disjointed topic and then backtrack. If I really want what I write to have some semblance of coherence I revise it multiple time in my head first before putting it down. Probably stop half way through to cross reference something to avoid inconsistencies or spelling errors(embarrassingly often). And even after all this, I might be dissatisfied with it. 
2	Or you realize you can say it all with 2 sentence so you delete a paragraph. lol
2	I second guess everything I write, especially back when I was a student. When I was in school, I often re read and edit my papers at least ten times just to make sure my pieces are coherent and have no leaps in logic. Even when posting on reddit, I tend to rethink and edit my comments to make sure they are consistent and actually relevant to what I wish to articulate. 
2	I often delete my giant walls of text right before I hit send on Reddit. As such, the things that usually make it on my Reddit account are usually only shorter things.
1	Just did same a few seconds ago. Still doing it while writing this comment. \nI have so many points to make and rather than make them one by one I try to sum as many of them up into 3 sentences and hope the reader has sufficient intuition to extract the many different points from my statement. \nI end up with a not so clear (but quite fluent) rant. 
0	INTP women, what's something you can't stand about other women?	As an INTP female, I will open our discussion with the *wonderful* topic of children.\n\nI can't stand when most women have kids. While I do want kids of my own at some point, me and my husband (ESFP for the curious) want to get our doctorates first. I understand that most people don't want things like that and a lot of women are fine having children early on, but I feel sick whenever I see young women having kids. It just feels like most of them are throwing away their lives. Most women seem to either drop out of what they were doing before to have children or were never doing anything with their life in the first place so it's a fast, easy way to find purpose. Your entire life cannot revolve around your children, and you can't use children to fill gaps in your existence. That just creates a horrible life for you and your child. I know that all too well from my own mother. You need to actually think rationally about the decision and decide at what point in your life you want to have them. If you're too hormone enraged to do so, use your significant other to help you have a rational discussion. It is way too important a decision to only be guided by impulse.\n\nObviously this comes with the complication that plenty of women don't plan to have children. Those people are fine. While I believe in abortion during the early stages of pregnancy, there's reasons to not be okay with it. What I'm not fine with is people who are completely for abortion yet would drop their entire lives if they got pregnant.\n\nAlso, even if you're a guy, feel free to share what you also dislike about women, because let's be real, sometimes they suck.
9	The need some women have to tear down other women.
6	Its easier to have kids when you’re young and full of energy and you can always go back to work after they are in school.  Your fertility window closes rapidly the longer you wait\n\nThe end of western civilization will be due to women treating their careers like children and their actual flesh and blood children as pets.
6	I don't like women who don't support other women. Men stick together and help each other. I despise women who don't help other women. especially at work. \n\nI also despise women who are flirty at work, love attention so they wear short skirts, show lots of cleavage, and giggle a lot. It encourages men to devalue them and other women as well. Included in this are women having sex with men at work and purposely getting pregnant to get child support money.\n\nOtherwise, I love women. I am gay as hell for them.\n\n
2	You know there are women who genuinely feel complete and satisfied by raising a family, right?
2	I'm a guy, but I'm gonna share my mum's experience, she is an ISTP, she is open about disliking young children, she worked full time for the first half of my life, it was only when we moved countries that she spent more time with me, she has recently began working again.
3	“Other women” is a tricky term. We’re all individuals, but some pattern I’ve noticed about them that affects me too, is their sensitivity. I’ve been banned from communities or actively disliked by them for either having an opinion they don’t agree with or behaving like... well, an NTP type, making fun of everything, sometimes in immature ways, you know. But I’m a good natured person, yet they become haters over this. Super odd to me.\n\nP.S. I’m childfree myself and while I agree to your view on women who choose to get children, it doesn’t bother me at all,  because it’s not my business, and it doesn’t affect me in any way.\n\nP.P.S. your post reminded me of the butterfly meme. The butterfly is “having a child,” the guy is “some women,” and the bottom text is “is this a personality?”
3	I just get bothered by how women tend to let their emotions make their decisions. Some men do this sometimes too. We're all probably prone to it at some degree but I just dont think how people will or may feel about something should be part of the decision making process. And somehow your choice is their choice, they just HAVE to give you their opinion.\n\nContrary to what my username may have you believe, I'm actually just an 18 yo female college student (picked username after the name of a stuffed animal lol), so I don't know much about the choosing to be a parent process yet lol. I go to a tech school and am an engineering major so I have 1 (one) friend (woman) other than my roommates and shes more of a thinking type than feeling. My roommate can be on the emotional side and it can be frustrating. She gets mad at me for things I sometimes feel like don't make any sense. I don't know. Making friends in college is tough, especially when you're a girl in a school thats like 20-something percent (?) girls.\n\nOn another note, I think you'll be a great mom someday. You take your time and think rationally and that level headedness I think is something important for children to have growing up. Teenagers can be emotional and if they can open up to someone like you that could be really helpful I think.
6	Has anyone gotten really into drawing as an adult despite having no earlier interest (beyond appreciating art)?	I've only tried drawing very seriously once as a teenager, during a one hour session. It was okay and I kind of got into it, though I wouldn't say I loved it. Drawing is the kind of hobby where I feel like if someone is interested and has the means to try it, by the time they're an adult they would already have done a fair bit of it regardless of how spectacular or unspectacular they are at it. By this reasoning, I assume it's not for me even though I've barely tried it (mostly because I already think I am bad at it and have no idea how to draw anything). Is my assumption wrong? Have any of you been late hobbyists in drawing or any other artistic hobby that you were apathetic to for most of your life?
2	I started when I was 12. Used it to get through school without dying of boredom. At my graduation, one of my teachers gave me a notepad and a pencil. He said it was strange to talk to me when I wasn’t drawing something.
1	Yes, and the only reason I gave it a shot was because someone typed me as isfp and I wanted to know if that stereotype held true.  As it happens, I'm not isfp, but I am good at visual art.  It shocked the hell out of my husband and my family, and me, as I've lived my life convinced I couldn't draw a stick figure.  This all went down a year ago, and this past February I had my first exhibition.  It's been a trip.
4	Can anyone relate?	
6	my interests are unlimited which overwhelms my brain, so I absolutely do nothing which makes me hate myself 
2	Dear lord, get this man Robinhood and a subscription to r/wallstreetbets ASAP
1	people who write this much in text messages make me cringe
3	Not interesting. Just whatever.	Needed to walk, I really just don't want to be home. Wandered around the liquor aisle, ready to spend $50 on something smooth and strong, but I dunno anything about this stuff. Don't want to waste money on something I don't like, but I'm tired of beer and cheap vodka.\n\nTook a couple-hour walk and stopped at a bar thinking "I'll just chill with the bartender and try drinks till I find one I like." I don't go to bars, and now I remember why. \n\nHad a plan how I would talk to the bartender. Was great till I opened my mouth. I'm such an amazing thinker and the worst communicator. Did I really just ask for a sweet whiskey?\n\nThis guy is looking at me to be communicative, but I'm shit at that, why do you think I'm here in the first place, guy? If I was ANY good with people, you think I'd be sitting in this corner by myself?
2	You can get a sweet whisky. It's lovely
2	If you are interested in whiskeys, I can provide recommendations based on previous experiments I have run. I decided one day that I wanted to learn about whiskey and started with bottom brand whiskeys and slowly drank my way up the ladder. 
6	Anyone just have a weird dislike for intjs?	Is this something commonplace here? Thoughts, opinions?\n\n*Edit* I believe it could be that the majority of intjs I've seen have been on Instagram and Instagram is infamous for creating bad people
5	I met one once who put “tests highly as INTJ” on his resume. That was a bad first impression.
6	I don't know any INTJs, but ENTJs are *very* hit or miss with me. I either get along great with them or they irritate me to no end. 
5	I have a weird attraction towards them 
3	My dad is an INTJ. We have a great relationship, but there were occasions when we butt heads with eachother. He is extremely adamant about his Ni abstractions, and as an INTP I sometimes sound dismissive toward his assertions because I'm naturally skeptical. He doesn't judge me and is pretty chill and supportive, but he doesn't really "get" my thought process and often tells me I'm impractical and I have to "adjust" my mindset. Most of the time we get along very well; we are both introverted thinkers, so despite our close relationship, we give each other a lot space and privacy, and because we are not overly sensitive or emotional, we can tolerate each other's insensitivity and bluntness. As far as emotions and feelings goes, we are each other's critic, he can be very insensitive to others believes and perspectives (trickster Fe), while I can be socially awkward and accidentally rude (inferior Fe). 
2	Hey
2	My husband of 24 years is an INTJ and I am an INTP. We had many ups and downs over the years but the thing that has always kept us together is we can "talk" to each other. No matter how angry we were with one another if we had a conversation we were able to get over it. He is my best friend and as far as I know the only human who has truly understood me. 
2	Mostly just jealously.
1	Why?
1	Yes. My friend and enemy is an INTJ.  He's very helpful most of the time, but we often quarrel over stupid things that he says when he thinks his way of thinking is the ONLY way to be correct. 
1	My dislike toward anyone stems from ignorance. \n\nINTJs seem to have a thought out play for their goals.\n\nThere are too many elements and variables for some goals to be realistic, and that could be a source to a lot of friction between the two. \n\nThere are instances where INTJs will be able to stick with and follow through on a plan that an INTP wouldn't do in twice the time. \n\nINTPs excel in platforms where there are minimal time constraints, and minimal rules but follow logic. Video games, writing, composing, commenting on online boards could come natural given proper education and resources. \n\nTL/DR: INTJ will win quick plan with a reasonable goal. INTP can add to plan and remove from plan over time to make it better. 
1	I don't trust INTJs not to fuck with people for fun. Being manipulated angers me, and I don't like to watch it happen either. They can be good to work with. I like doing projects with them. The over confident ones are a big turn off. My ego and arrogance is big enough for both of us.\n\nHowever, I'd take them over an ESFJ, Male ENTP, or Male INFJ.  I can't comment on female ENTP because I don't think I ever met one. \n\nMale INFJ is my most distrusted type of person. I avoid them at all costs. Bad experiences myself and bad stories from others. \n\nI'd take a female INFJ any day though. Lovely people. I assume female ENTPs are likewise great people.\n
1	I have a solidly based hate of 3 INTJs I know
0	^^^
6	I feel bad for people who disagree w/ me	For real, you just look really dumb.
18	I would agree with you, but then we both would be wrong.
8	Ever been on r/iamverysmart?
11	I really feel for you.  I mean, so young, and you already have figured everything out. It must be torment spending the rest of your life without anything new or more to learn. I guess you could dispense your wisdom and knowledge, but that seems one sided and must get old. I got most things wrong on purpose when I was younger so I would still have something to do at my age now. Funny thing is, I still keep getting things wrong and having fun doing it. Actually, I realized that I have learned a lot of things by being wrong, but I never learned anything by being right. 
3	I actually like your snarky comments and blunt honesty even if it is a little extra at times. However you are also superrrrrr extra at times. Anyways, have a good one.
5	heliotach, you’ve changed somehow. i can’t quite put my finger on it. before, your comments were insightful and bright in a concentrated form; now that’s mixed together with something that i associate with the specific type of sadness felt when looking at the state of the world through a righteous perspective. it reminds me of soberness or sanity. have you gained 010?
2	It depends on what\n\nLike, once I'm convinced that I'm right (and only then), I enter my "full nitpicks" mode (with the greater general points being made too, of course) and will pick appart everything you say, which usually frustrates them to no end. \n\nI dunno why I do that, I'm not even emotionally invested when I do that.
2	If you don't mind the question, what was you goal in posting this? Just trying to understand what you were trying to accomplish or get out of this. 
1	What are you trying to prove here? If you are always right, why do you even care if others disagree with you? I wouldn't argue with a five years old because I know better and I understand there is no point. So, if you are so sure of yourself, you should be indifferent to others instead of being triggered like this. Do you honestly feel that insecure about yourself that you must compensate it with a sign of arrogance? Unless you are really suffering from certain psychological illness such as NPD, I doubt you are as confident as you are pretending to be. Do you know how sometimes short people try to act tough to mask their sense of vulnerability and inferiority? You remind me of those people, the only difference is your insecurity probably isn't rooted in your height, but your own fragile ego about an intellect that you are not at peace with. 
2	So do you. It is a general thing. Not unique to those who disagree with you. Humans have a habit of looking really dumb. There are few exceptions, and neither I nor you are one of them.
2	Troll

-1	Thank you. All of us should keep our pride intact. At 54 I have found peace and happiness in my life, I find myself still madly in love with my wife after 31 years, I have two sons whom I love more than I thought possible, I am successful and recognized in my career, and I find ways to contribute to society. Not bad for an idiot I would say.
3	The Geography of Fruit	
1	A good video once again. I like your posts. 
1	your videos don't suck too much.\n 👍\n
13	Useful tip in order to better concentrate, when in browser enter full screen mode (F11). You'll be less distracted by other things.	
1	I do this when I can, but often times I have to switch between two or three tabs frequently in order to do what I'm trying to do so full screen just makes that worse lol \n\nWhen I can use it though full screen definitely helps though. 
1	Damn. Now I am distracted by that F11 key.
4	Need help talking to my SIL (30F)	We are driving right now to see my brother and sister in laws and am kind of dreading it. I am an INFP (27 F) and it feels like I am talking to a cold stone wall sometimes. She is a physical therapist and I work as a manufacturing engineer.  All my closest friends are in the "diplomat" category. Shared interests with her are Pulitzer prize books, cooking and yoga. I rarely initiate conversation with her because the few times I've tried I'm met with a cold response. I think she can take me in small doses but everyone I know says it's really easy to talk to me. I feel things a lot and don't think very logically. \nHer husband is an INFP actually but he enjoys debating.   Anyway, any help or tips would be awesome. I know never to talk about celebrities or my feelings.
2	Don’t give up. Be willing to persist a little in order to hear her thoughts. \n\nFar too often in my life, people ask me a question, to which I give a short, emotionless response. Then they immediately move on to something else, assuming I’m uninterested and dismissing either them or the topic, when it’s actually quite the opposite. I’m actually thinking over the topic in my head before saying more because I care about it enough to want to formulate an answer with precision and accuracy. \n\nGive her time to think. Don’t take it personally when she doesn’t respond with much initially. 
2	Huh, my INFP daughter and I have great conversations. Though mostly I think it's her talking. She is so smart about things. I think your SIL is. a big old cold introvert, and it's OK to just exist in the same space she does. She has a lot of deep emotion under the hood. I know I do.\n\n\nYou know what I like, little thoughtful gifts. She might not tho. But if someone knew I loved some kinda food and brought my fat ass a nibble of it. I'd be a happy cat. Like oh, I picked you up some black licorice 'cause I know you love it.   Food, snacks, such a practical and kind gift.\n\nAsk the INFP husband lol. He should know what she likes.
1	The good old 'what's up' might work...  \n\n\nOther than that, it's not like you're obliged to have a warm relationship with every relative in your family. If you guys don't click then what's the harm in that, might as well just stop trying to please everyone. Just do your own thing, if she wants to join in and have a chat with you she's welcome to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom my own perspective I've never felt like being buddy-buddy with my siblings' SO's was somehow crucial to anyone's happiness. My sibs aren't me, and that their way of connecting to their partners is different from how I get close to people is totally normal. I wouldn't be surprised if your sis in law also just does not feel too bothered by this lack of a more than 'hey, sup, bye' connection. As long as I'm not being somehow singled out for exclusion and people treat me with a normal level of respect I'm a-ok with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just legit never feel like what the world needs right now is me pretending I wholly and deeply connect to my brother's fiance or the dudes my younger sis brings home. They're here for my brother, for my sister, not for me, so... what's the fuss? I don't hate them and I hope they can tell, I just don't feel like I need to be a huge part of their lives. Knowing people well and maintaining a bond takes freaking effort, and I can sustain only so many connections I truly give a shit about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust treat your sis in law like she's the house cat, she's doin' her own thing and unless she's practically hissing and bitching, or slipping away to hide, she's prolly cool with you. Just not motivated to be your buddy-friend.  \n\n\nAnd that says nothing about you, just her own tastes and y'know, that irrational side everyone has that makes us like certain people a lot and just kinda remain lukewarm about others. You might be a cat person, any individual cat might not be a you-person.
1	I love INFP females.  I struggle with INFP men tho, so maybe there is the same sex dynamic issue going on here too.  It's not helpful, but in true intp style I could tell you what's wrong with those interactions (you already know that) but less so what's right.  The one thing that occurs to me is joint activity. I think this would be an exercising of Ne in a myers-briggs capacity. I love to do random things with INFPs, and not so random ... play cards, cook, watch mutually acceptable tv (this included 'love island' with a girl I was in to! ha!) ... things like this maybe? Also, maybe something with a physical element, again so game or other ... tWiStEr!?  I hope this suggestion doesn't seem trite or disingenuous ... it's well intentioned.  I hope you realise ... you're entirely enigmatic to us too! :)

3	INTPs and disappointment	I've talked about this before but how do you as an INTP handle disappointment?\nMe, I just lock myself inside my head and try rationalize everything leading up to what caused me to be disappointed and try to figure out what made me disappointed. It's my way of compartmentalizing it. 
5	As a romantic person I am often disappointed by my fantasies being destroyed. As a cynic I remind myself that none of it matters in the end so why should I care about my own happiness and then I let it go/bottle it up till I have nervous breakdown.
2	I did that for 45 years and then discovered that it was the worst thing I could possibly do. Disappointment is an emotion, and we do not have emotions for a single or logical reason. But my INTP brain insisted on figuring it out, so I replayed and examined it in my mind. And each time I did, I felt the same disappointment just like the first time. I could keep at it for weeks or months.\n\nThen I learned that my emotions are not me, and that they do not control my actions or thinking. They are just perfectly natural things that pop up in my head. I realized that I was reacting to them without thinking. When I became enraged, I used to punch holes in the wall.  The rage did not make me do it, I chose to.\n\nI learned when I was disappointed to notice that fact. I would think, "I am disappointed." That process alone gave me some distance from it. I also learned to quit judging my disappointment or me for being disappointed.  I suspect that "what is wrong with you" may be the most common thought I had when I was younger. Disappointment and other emotions are natural. By design, emotions ebb and flow. never lasting that long. So we feel disappointed and decide to change our actions, or we just go something to let it pass. But when we think about it over and over again, it does not go away.\n\nSometimes when I am disappointed, I decide to do things differently. Other times, I realize that there is nothing I could have or could do differently. When things do not go my way, I tend to be disappointed. So a lot of time, I just recognize that I am disappointed, and I try to gently soothe myself. But I try to soothe the disappointment without thinking about what caused it. And then I find myself thinking about other things, and I let it go.\n\nTrying to make sense of disappointment and other emotions left me severely depression for way too long. 
1	Depends. If it's my SO, I'm heartbroken. Devestated. The world has somehow ended. And then I immediately forgive. If it's literally anything else, it's whatever. I immediately remind myself of all the other options I have and I'm really not bothered. 
1	I just say "fuck it" and move on, unless it's something I did there is no point elaborating
3	INTP goals - The nature of INTP goals?	As the title - What is the nature of the INTPs goals, and how does this influence the extent to which they are achieved, and the perception of 'success' both to the self and to others?  What can be done to improve the outward perception? How do we harness our functional stack to make societally valuable contributions?   Man .... sorry about all the questions! But, any thoughts?
12	To understand *everything* 
6	Maximum Potential. 
2	ack. come on you (non-gender-specific)-guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlike I said ... I want help outputting usefulness in to society.  something that THEY would deem useful!  i also want (some) validation, and (some) money for the effort!  It's a very practical question in a way.  
33	Morality based on cognitive functions (dark/light)	Selfish vs Selfless, \n\nTakers vs Givers! \n\nMorality I believe is about objective/subjective preference in using our cognitive functions. I'm still working on it, but it roughly goes like this:\n\nObjective: (light) \n\n- Truth/Consistency (Ti)\n\n- Empathy/Compassion (Fi)\n\n- Problem-solving/Organizing (Te)\n\n- Peace/Harmony (Fe)\n\n- Passion/Beauty (Ni)\n\n- Progress/Honor (Si) \n\n- Open-mindedness/Perspectives (Ne) \n\n- Freedom/Liberty (Se) \n\n\nSubjective: (dark) \n\n- Rationalization/Ignorance (Ti) \n\n- Selfishness/Desire (Fi) \n\n- Profiteering/Monetizing (Te) \n\n- Attracting/Manipulation (Fe) \n\n- Ambition/Narcissism (Ni) \n\n- Tradition/Status (Si) \n\n- Collecting/Variety (Ne) \n\n- Power/Dominance (Se) \n\n\nPeople generally have either a subjective or an objective outlook to life. People who are objective (light) in their values are better suited for the public sector, and people with a subjective (dark) outlook are only suitable for the private sector. \n\n. \n\n- Light types: \n\n(suitable for public sector: Government, Judiciary, Education... ) \n\nINTP - ISTJ - ISFP - INFJ\n\nESTP - ENTJ - ENFP - ESFJ\n\n. \n\n- Dark types: \n\n(suitable for private sector: Business, Manufacturing, Banking... ) \n\nINTJ - ISTP - ISFJ - INFP\n\nESTJ - ENTP - ENFJ - ESFP\n\n. \n\n----------—--------—---------—-----------—--------------—----\n\nEdit: A recent and similar academic research shows some people have a dark core: \n\nDark Core of personality, by Copenhagen university, where dark traits are defined as subjective.\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-dark-core-of-personality/
10	further explanation would be interesting
4	Complicated concepts like cognitive functions usually can't be broken down to be either good or bad, light out evil. \n\nThere is potential for both in it depending on the circumstances and how they are being used. \n\nFor example Fi can be strong and fighting for well developed values, or selfish and unreasonably sticking to shallow uninformed opinions. \n\nNe can be creative and bring new ideas or seek possibilities but it can also be an unstoppable force of chaos and destruction. \n\nMost people who talk about type paradoxes simply don't have enough information to order those seemingly contradictory attributes into a more refined system where they exist perfectly fine next to each other. 
3	Interesting. Would the placement of the function affect if one is more light/dark with it? Or would it just be based on the individual and their preference? 
2	i don't think you understand mbti very well. what you used to describe objective/subjective facets of the cognitive functions are values or concepts that don't belong to any function in particular. there is no such thing as objective Ti, Ni, Si, or Fi, and the extraverted functions are (on their own) objective. Te uses factual data to make a system to draw conclusions from, Fe makes judgements based on the real values of the group. Se takes in everything it perceives outwardly, Ne takes in everything it perceives inwardly. Si takes in specific information it perceives outwardly and processes it, Ni takes in specific information it perceives inwardly and processes it. Ti uses subjective reasoning to make judgements, Fi uses subjective values to make judgements. all introverted functions are inherently subjective and aims to gain deep understanding, whereas extraverted functions are objective and aim to have a broad understanding of everything. everyone uses two subjective and two objective functions, and no type is really more objective than any other. morality has nothing to do with the cognitive functions, and it isn't inherently subjective or objective. 
2	ENFP here. Really interesting considering that I consider myself more "selfless" than "selfish" and am recently leaving the finance industry (which I dislike) to join consulting involving government clients. The opportunities there seemed to align much closer to my own personal values.
2	What distinguishes a light type from a dark type? 
2	Hm, I was pretty dark though in my teen years/early twenties. But I'm more light now.
2	This is fascinating to me. When I was younger, I tested INTJ and struggled with self-hating narcissism, loneliness, and depression. Some point after I made a conscious choice to start trying to better relate to people and connect more, my personality test results started showing I was ISTJ instead. I now wonder if my effort is what caused the change in results.
2	This post and cited study scream of idealistic bias, particularly since in practice the private sector has to act with more objectivity than the public sector- which has the freedom to make decisions based on subjectivity 
2	Fascinating... I'm inclined to agree. I've always just referred to it as 'shadow function.' I can tell a lot of work has gone into this. Thank you for sharing. Are you writing a paper on this?
2	It’s interesting but framing it as light/dark gives it some sort of moral connotation that imo is not needed

1	I like this because the order of my functions is the order in which I value all of those thing 
1	But what’s the point with the dichotomy of light and dark? You do know there’s an apparent value placement when it’s put like that? Nevertheless, I think selfishness can be of great use if you want to get things done. But that might just be my ”dark” side speaking haha. 
1	Link you posted at the bottom doesn't have anything in common with mbti.. you just subjectively trying to fit functions to categories. And the part I'm not agreeing is how ? and why?  \n\n I agree with division to private and public sector, some types should fit better there and there but calling it light and dark is too close too evil and good, maybe that's why many people are confused ? Same you can just  call one group as "useless" and second one as "hard-working people".  \n\n  \n > Objective processing=Perception (P)\n\nP isn't perception and what is objective here ?  \n\nAnd my main concern what about shadow functions ?
1	I understand that this dark/light dichotomy can be hurtful to some. What's more hurtful in my perspective, is to deny reality, enabling pain and suffering to continue in a global scale. \n\nPeople baing light or dark at their core, is already stablished by academic research that I linked at the bottom. \n\nLight ppl can do bad things, and dark ppl can do good things. All i'm arguing for is to exclude dark types from the public sector, as it doesn't make sense to choose leaders and politicians who would put their own benefits above those that they're representing. Same subjective tendencies that are bad for government, are good for business and banking, where the game can be defined as zero sum (win-lose). \n\nI would welcome your constructive criticism you all, this is my PhD proposal that I've been researching for a while (ongoing), and i have to remain impartial to my observations and results. \n\nEdit: \n\nAndrew Yang (democratic presidential candidate for US 2020) is proposing a psychologist to be present at the White House at all times, frequently meeting with everyone! Many psychologists are warning about current political leaders. The problem with selfish and low-empathy ppl in public office is real, global, and dangerous, and needs to be addressed. 
1	This is bad. You're completely ignoring the role of ego development. If you use typology to create divides based on shallow levels of understanding, rather than as tools for human growth, you're missing the point. Also, INFP as a dark type? Behave. 
1	I don’t find this true one bit. I think it’s overall what each type deems important. I know some “light” enfj’s and some “dark” enfj’s. Really just depends on their morals/what they deem right or wrong. They’ll use their functions however they want (for good or evil) \nYou need more observations to back this theory up tbh too many holes. 
1	I don't think you can split for light vs dark types like that. \n\nENTPs can be selfless in nature. Obama is an ENTP.. I don't think you'd want to exclude the "light" ones from your list..   (Selfless vs selfish is more a Fe vs Fi thing) \n\nAnd even then, you can't brake it exactly like that because you have ESTJs with Fe 8th that justifies being selfish to accomplish their goals as they will make things better for the greater good. Having an effect of being selfless behind the scenes from justified Fi values. \n\nNow Trump is ESFP+Narcissist, and his greatest tool, Fi in 2nd, really does make everything about self-gain. We can also see how a rejection of Ti (blindspot in 7th) may not favorable for a president. \n\nEdit: However the ESFP is also known as a good politician, as they can observe what the popular feeling/thinking is, and adopt it themselves. Not that it means it will be the optimal decision..
1	The hardest part about morality is predicting the future
1	I don’t understand why you’ve decided half the types are evil. Or how you’ve even decided which ones are which.

4	Approaching an INTP	Hello Guys, an ENTJ (male) speaking..\n\nI need your advice, so I have had a crush on this girl in college for about 4 years, and things have escalated during those years so badly that I have became obssesed about her, the thing is she's an INTP very introverted and she rarely shares anything on her facebook account or in classes, which I believe that her ambiguity have intrigued and was very seductive towards my end. \n\nI've been in two relationships during the time that I had feelings for her and I started developing feelings for her shortly after I ended up a very toxic relation ship that broke me, the thing is that when I get into a relationship with someone else I truly want to devote my self to them but I can't, because I'm thinking about her all the time...\n\nSo what I did is that I've approached her a year ago and confronted her shortly after she had finished her final exam at that semester in college, I have told her that I had feelings for her and that I would like to know her more... etc, when I was done she asked me with a smile "that's it?" And I replied by saying "yes".\n\nTill this day I'm the one who always texts her, and she barely replies, most of the times she just sees my messages without texting back, I've talked with her face to face and asked her if she wasn't interested in me, if she didn't want me to text her or if she was already with someone else, as an ENTJ I hate ambiguity and I also hate the perceiving nature as when she says that she doesn't  know and would like to see things through.. \n\nHelp me guys, what to do?
7	As an INTP, I like talking about ideas more than feelings. Try to find out what mutual interests you have and go from there.
6	raw milk
4	As a female INTP I agree with the advice above, start talking about common interests. Ask what kinda stuff she likes to do. I also started talking to someone due to mutual hatred, which turned into idea sharing, which turned into friendship, which lastly turned into a relationship.
3	>I've talked with her face to face and asked her if she wasn't interested in me, if she didn't want me to text her or if she was already with someone else\n\nAll she said was that she doesn't know? I can't speak for her, but I know that I've encountered somewhat similar situations so I could give my perspective on that. I'm an extremely private person so if some guy develops an "obsessive" crush on me I usually think of it as him projecting something, some image, onto me. For me, I have to have an intellectual connection and just chemistry in general with someone first, and then maybe if we're lucky feelings will develop somewhere down the line, but that's way down the line. So I can't put much weight to a guy's feelings because he doesn't actually know me. It's honestly usually just uncomfortable and off-putting to me, tenfold if it's not someone I'm actively interested in as well. \n\nYour situation could be any number of things, but I would say INTP or not don't let people keep you on a string (whether they're intentionally doing it or not). I don't know the extent of your relationship but if this thing has been stretched out over years I think it could be that she's either just oblivious to your feelings or ^(maybe) you're not getting the hint. Admittedly, I'm usually pretty horrible at texting back, but that's not the case if it's someone I like and am interested in so... In any case, I think you should be more direct with her just one more time. Maybe not necessarily asking her point-blank if she likes you, but like to go on an actual date so it's clear what your intentions are but you're not overloading it with a bunch of feelings and commitment or finality. \n\n&#x200B;
3	> for about 4 years, and things have escalated during those years\n\nSeems like they didn't, actually\n\n> I've been in two relationships during the time that I had feelings for her and I started developing feelings for her shortly after I ended up a very toxic relation ship that broke me, the thing is that when I get into a relationship with someone else I truly want to devote my self to them but I can't\n\nYou're too needy/invested, which is why you get burned\n\n> I have told her that I had feelings for her and that I would like to know her more... etc, when I was done she asked me with a smile "that's it?" And I replied by saying "yes".\nTill this day I'm the one who always texts her, and she barely replies, most of the times she just sees my messages without texting back, I've talked with her face to face and asked her if she wasn't interested in me, if she didn't want me to text her or if she was already with someone else\n\nWew. I dunno/am far from an expert on how to talk to girls and all that, but seems to me like you did everything you shouldn't. 
3	Frankly speaking, she doesn't like you. \n\nI think your approach is totally wrong. You don't approach INTP female like you approach normal female. Sorry to say, it won't work.\n\nFor most of women, the sequence will be like: attraction - relationship - connection\n\nBut for female INTP:\nattraction - connection - relationship\n\nYou need to build connection first. And to build connection you have to rouse her intellectually.\n\nMostly these are the stages of my relationships. \n\nFirst, there is a confirmation "Oh....he's an okay looking."\n\nSecond, "Wait he's smart as well, I can have debate with him and it doesn't turn ugly. He's ok with me challenging his ideas. And he doesn't feel like his manhood is threatened by me questioning his silly commentaries. Ok...cool."\n\nThird, "Wonder what he's doing right now? Ohhh..this topic..I need to remember this so when I meet him we can discuss about this." \n\nBy the third phase, he has successfully integrated himself to my life. And there is the excitement I feel when sharing every simple and minutiae details of my life with him. Including texting, I'll reply him asap or even starting silly conversation simply just to get his reaction and get laugh from him.
2	So when I was a young INTP I didn't people well. Still don't actually. Once I received a letter stating a fellow student had a crush on me. I crumpled it into a ball and proceeded to pretend it never happened as I was incredibly uncomfortable with the interaction. I feel like this girls reaction is only slightly less clear of a rejection than mine. It's not healthy to be obsessed that much with someone. What do you actually even like/know about her? In my own experience if I pick up on any needy/obsessive/unstable vibes I lose interest. Also if you hate ambiguity you're in for a bad time. 
2	When dealing with an INTP you have to be upfront and obvious. You can't just walk up to her and say, "I like you." You have yo say something like, "Would you be interested in starting a relationship?" or something of the sort. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTPs are Se polar so she probably didn't even notice your big-dick energy when you attempted to speak to her in person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe worst case scenario, is that she will hurt your feelings by telling you up front that she is not interested in you.
1	Well, if you do not do something, your fragile ENTJ brain will explode. \n\nSince you mention classes and college, I assume that you both are probably in your early 20's. Back when I was 20, we did not have cable TV let alone the internet, so things were very different but still the same.\n\nI personally find it harder to understand young female INTPs than males. I suspect that their experience growing up has different pressures and problems than mine. Many of them seem to think that they are not feminine enough or not feminine in the right way. But they still seem to go through the same existential angst. \n\nIt sounds like you want to tell her that you want a relationship with her, and I suspect that would overwhelming. It might jump far ahead of where she can go. Take the pressure off and just ask her out to something. Give some thought to what you think that you both would enjoy. If you choose something just for her, you will be bored, and that boredom will come across as boredom with her. Let the end of the date go where it does. Don't try to make her set another date if she does not seem inclined, and just tell her how much you enjoyed your time with her, but don't make it into something that it isn't.\n\nI think this is tricky for you because you want to let things go at her speed, but you cannot depend on her to make things happen. I really think that you just have to make small but meaningful steps and let things develop as they will.\n\nI have a lot of insane theories. Way more than anyone here knows about. But when I think of courting an INTP, I always remember the book Le Petit Prince (the Little Prince) by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. In the story, there is a fox who wishes to befriend the little prince, but he insists that the Prince tame him. For some reason, that always felt like the perfect way for someone to tame me. \n\nYou only live once. You might regret not doing or saying something when you are older, but you would never regret taking a chance. 
1	So... I might be missing something here, but have you just asked her out on a date? 
735	Anybody else like this??

77	Extroverted when comfortable 
31	There’s always an in-between
28	So every introvert? \n\nBeing introverted doesn’t mean you don’t talk, it means you’ll be more comfortable talking in familiar situations or crowds and less in unfamiliar. \n\nSome drugs and alcohol will dull the introverted parts of your brain, turning you more extroverted. You think less, are therefor less externally driven (external stimulus -> think about it), and temporarily become extroverted. 
12	Nah! That's what INFJs are: They can be 0 or 1 in literally anything and same applies to their extraversion.\n\nI have read it at many places that INFJs are most extroverted introverts & ENTPs are most introverted extroverts - making both of the types feel as out of place!\n\nFor INTPs it's like, if the discussion is about their field of interest they can talk straight for 3 hrs & if not, they are as silent as thin air!
4	Sometimes im just in a jolly ass mood and ill strike up conversations with anybody even random strangers. Then other times i wont talk to a single soul. 
4	Yes, but that's usually because I *have* done four lines of coke.
8	(INFP) Hey! We were just chatting about this over at r/INFP! It seems we do, at least.
3	Strangers: whisper everything\nFriends: shout inside jokes\nClose friends: stare at one point getting lost in thoughts
3	A perfect description if me
2	Now imagine the third world War is already under full effect. Society suppressed us all so we rarely let out our inner passions and thrive together in our individuality.\n\nThat's my hypothesis. 
2	I've never related to anything as much as I do this 
2	Yes
2	I'm like this,  apparently it's called ambivert
1	YUP. \n\nThe in-between feels so unobtainable. 
1	r/me_irl so much lol
1	Yes. It can happen in the same night/day/moment, it's like you run out of fuel and nothing can come out anymore. 
1	YES
1	This is me BECAUSE I'm maxed out on adderall and shit but it mostly just keeps me level headed. \n\nCocaine doesn't work almost at all mentally, and too expensive lol
1	This is pretty accurate lol
1	With strangers if i feel like chatting i could be the one driving the conversation with the goal of keeping it or making it fun or meaningful or both, if it fails i tend to lose interest.  \n\nI know for a fact that i can talk non stop, it doesn't exhaust me at all.\n\nIf you are getting exhausted by conversations there is a very good chance that you are pretending to be someone you are not, and people can only like you if you show the real you. \n 
1	No it's all noise
1	Yup, INTPs are primarily intoverted, but are also extaverted... Actually, that’s the definition of an introvert. What a coincidence.
1	Uber drivers hate me because of these two moods
1	Why am I like this.... I’m INFJ
1	yeah im a gay straight man
1	Meeeeeeeeeee
1	This works for /r/Bipolar as well. Ina manic phase now and I was yammering away 
1	I love this community. This is exactly how I feel. Is there anyway to be more extroverted?
1	Yeah that's me but I wouldn't call it extroverted introvert rather just being weird or something.
1	perfect description of me
1	More than 2 people in a group and i just shut down
1	Sounds like an ENTP thing 
2	Do You Ever Smile When You See Someone Crying?	Not because you think it's funny, just because it takes a huge toll on Fe. Even if it's just on TV. Happy tears, sad tears, any tears, DO you often smile? I've seen other INTPs do this, I do this, it's an interesting reaction that feelers can't understand for the life of them.
2	Well I don't do that but if my husband's upset and I'm also upset, he'll often look at me and ask "why are you smiling?!" because apparently I can't show expressions very well. So, close.
1	Yes
8	Being ignored by SO	What is your reaction to SO ignoring your efforts (to have a good, functioning relationship), or being emotionally unavailable or detached for over a few weeks? Or are you that person? 
16	They get cut from the team 
9	I try to give more. I try to be more attentive in a genuine way. I kiss her goodbye when she leaves and i kiss her hello when she returns. I tell her that I love her at odd times when I feel it. When we have been apart for a while, I ask her where she was and what she did. \n\nThe last thing I would do is to say that she is ignoring me or being unavailable. Instead, I accept that something is bothering her and that it may take time for her to work it out. I make myself completely available to her if she wants my thoughts or advice, but I never offer them. \n\nI remember that she is the person I love, and that the way she is acting now is just the way she is acting. It is not who she is or who we are. Doing all this can be the hardest thing in the world, but it also is one of the truest expressions of my love for her.
4	Start saying your goodbyes. Ghosting is a sign of immaturity. If you’re partner expects you to come crawling back to talk to them or doesn’r explain to you that they need space; leaving you in the dust to hold your dick while they figure themselves out; that is not a partner for you. \n\nThe mature thing to do would be to tell them you can’t do this anymore but honestly I wouldn’t blame you if you just decided to ghost then back.
1	I'm that one. There is only so much free time and a good deal of mine is alone.
1	I am that person; the more emotional I feel the less emotional I look and act. And the quieter I get.\n\nBe willing to compromise, and so will I. Stick around when I retreat / hide and I'll be there when you need to talk. But it'll be a slow process; if you need to talk, see me, message all the time, I'll need to hide all the time. There has to be give and take. But there has to also be patience and perseverance, on both sides.\n\nMy last ex and I, we both persevered. It took time, years in fact, to earn each other's trust and feel safe enough (for me) to open up and (for him) to chill the eff out. But it made all the difference; it made love possible.\n\nPoint being, if either of us had given up on the other or on an 'us', there'd have been no 'us'. And, more,  neither of us would've gained anything as individuals.\n\nThat's how relationships work, and why they don't.
1	I think it more depends on the dynamic of the relationship. My roommate and her boyfriend have been together for a while and they're really happy. They respect each other's needs. My roommate can distance herself when she's upset/stressed and he often just comes to be with her because he knows how she is. Shes ready to talk when she's ready to talk. He seems to give off an extrovert vibe, but he respects her introvercy and just wanting to be by herself (but wants to be here for whenever she is ready to talk lol). I had actually told him once that I thought that their relationship was unhealthy and one sided because she blocked him out (my roommate got really pissed at me; INTPs need to learn to respect other's feelings/emotions but hey he asked for my opinion...), but I think I was wrong. The way their relationship is works for them. And its not that she doesn't put effort in, she just needs that break and is more emotionally drained when she has to talk about whatever is stressing her. And when he has a problem shes always available to listen because she understands he needs to get it out. Shes a great listener and because she takes her time to go over things in her head she can offer great advice too. I think really think this is one of those cases where opposites attract.\n\nSo in conclusion, people are different and it really depends on what works for you. If you are really bothered by things like this by someone that's a different story. People just need to find people they have the ability to understand I think. If you're bothered because someone can't communicate with you the way you would like, it probably won't work because the frustration would build. How people communicate is how we show our love, so if someone isn't communicating with you how you would like, it would be very hard to feel loved. That's just what I think but honestly don't take this too seriously because I'm bad with relationships. I just share what I observe and how I interpret it lol
1	There may be a reason for their behavior, or that’s just who they are at this moment.  Sometimes you have to give the person space for them to come to you.  If too much space is required, even after multiple discussions, they may not be the right person for you.  That’s ok, live, learn, love.\n\n
1	Your SO isn't for you if that's their version of telling you something is wrong, because that's INTPs version of telling people something is wrong. \n\nIf you both do this, they aren'y right for you. You're going to have to develope your Fe a lot so you can be comfortable approaching them and forcing them to tell you their emotions. Pretty much impossible to keep that up your whole life.

1	What hobbies/side-projects have made you feel satisfied and held your interest?	Up until graduating basically the only thing I did was school and video games (mainly MMOs). \n\nAfter getting a good job and landing in the real world I starting to feel this itch in my brain for a new challenge.\n\nAt first I thought I’d try the things I had neglected. Made friends, starting doing all the crazy stuff that seemed fun from the outside, partying, doing drugs. It was fun, but eventually I was over it.\n\nNext thought I’d try relationships. Brushed up on my pickup game, dated and banged a lot of women, eventually met one I really liked and was with for two years before things started to go bad and I broke up with her. Now I feel over that as well.\n\nNow the itch is back. I’ve never really stuck with a hobby, usually the same story of being all about it for a short time then eventually moving on. Think the problem is I need something really fucking challenging.\n\nThought about trying coding or perhaps music production (always been a big fan of electronic music). Also thought about about the stock market as that is very challenging, but also seems boring and I’m happy with the amount of money I have currently.\n\nWhat are you guys into?
2	Create something that will benefit the world, mad inventor style.
1	-I also like electronic music but probably could never do music production lol.\n-I joined a club that builds an RC airplane every year. Really cool, I'm on the electronics team. Maybe try building something? Theres a lot on Instructables.\n-I'm learning to code in C++, pretty cool I think. You can learn to program an arduino.\n-Fixing things can be fun. You can see how things work and sometimes change them up a bit. Also reverse engineering.\nThats all I can think of right now, sorry.
1	I'm learning about networked electronics. NodeRed and MQTT look fun.  
1	Reading books and drawing pretty pictures. Eventually arguing with some internet-stranger. But seriously, reading is nice.
1	I am kind of a serial hobby/skill collector. The following have kept my attention long enough to make an impact on my life. \n\n- Language learning: Semi-useful, interesting skill that has gotten cheaper (arguably free, but if you want to really learn a language conversationally, you will probably be better off taking an actual class) recently. It definitely opens up how you think about the world to be able to see it from different cultural viewpoints.\n\n- Longsword fencing: Get involved with a local HEMA club and do their beginners course. You get to learn actual sword fighting and might make a few friends in the process. \n\n- Knitting: This was actually really fun and informative. So much in the world is made through a process that I had very little clue about before taking this one up. A bonus, you get to challenge a lot of people's belief that it is just for girls. There is definitely a lack of men in this hobby and it is fun to mess with people's biases. \n\n- Juggling/object manipulation/contact juggling: Relatively cheap. You can learn on your own or in a club. Always nice to be able to pull out a really weird skill like contact juggling when you are bored some where. \n\n- Fixing electronics/general electrician work: Very useful skill to be able to break out a multimeter and actually diagnose an electrical issue. \n\n- Beekeeping: Beekeeping was... interesting. The hive died after the first year, but I learned a lot. I plan to get back into it in a year or so. \n\n- Brewing: Learn to make your own beer the way you want it made. Then... drink it?

3	Can you explain a little bit I'm new to mbti and all meanings of letters. Ideal would be if you give some example or something like this
1	Quite accurate from my experience
0	Cats or Dogs?	Let’s solve this modern day enigma bois and vote it out on which animal you prefer by upvoting either cat or dog!
14	Cats
8	Dogs
3	Dogs. Why would I prefer something that thinks it owns me?
3	Robots
2	Cats\n\nEdit: Oof sorry still getting used to Reddit. I'll give reasoning as an apology. You have to earn a cat's love and respect. 
1	How about clean home with unlimited freedom? But from those two, prefer dogs because they're not assholes.

9	Except the Wizard image for the INFJ should be the INTP ... 'coz of [ME](https://imgur.com/M0TyoJY) ...   \n\n\nSee us INTP Wizards do exist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can find ME and many other MBTI types with the chat-a-holics 24/7 here:  [INTP Chat](https://s.reddit.com/channel/234819_b801be46e50b71c8f933ce4f082b3450a394f57f)   \ncome one, come all ... 
6	I really enjoyed "KING FUCK OF SHIT MOUNTAIN".
2	Wife is ISFJ, I am INTP.  Both totally accurate. Can confirm. 
2	Damn. Pain for everyone 
1	Pretty sure I was ISTP in my high school days. Now INTP because I’m no longer edgy and full of teen angst.
1	Also seen the sociopathic game of thrones for ENTJ
17	World: People are dying of cancer and there are giant space rocks that could crush us at any moment. Me: Gets warning for trying to understand the rules better.	
3	Joins discord server, asked to read book of rules. Ask why there are so many rules. Get banned instantly. Read rules from screenshot. Asking why wasn't against the rules. 
1	Btw I did try to not be annoying and explain so those neurotypical people could understand.
1	I’m amused that someone actually entertained your idea in the first place.
1	The wilful lack of intelligence applied by this interviewer. The debating with no attempt at understanding on behalf of the interviewer. THE LACK OF F*CKING LOGIC!!	
2	"Herald Journalist" lol. This is just pathetic.
1	"I don't read your book as walking the line, I read you book as a Let's return to order"  \n\n  \n\n"Then I think you should read it more carefully."  \n\n  \n\nLove it.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Can someone give me a synopsis? Based on the facial expressions alone i can tell that this Simon guy rather not be there and he will be completely closed and Jordan will be trapped in the, "Trying to explain how to breathe to an idiot" land.
14	Do you guys feel like an absolute piece of shit when you have to lie to someone?	
8	I used to lie pathologically from about 6 - 18. Now I don't care to, and not because it makes me feel bad, but simply because I don't see the point in it?
5	Lies yes. Not saying the *whole* truth because of context relieves me of it. But brutal honesty people hate.\n\nI feel like shit when I lie to myself.
5	Depends, if the lie is to help them then no. If I actually have to lie then I’d rather just not say anything at all.
2	i'm gay in homohobist society, gotta have to lie every time but mostly i feel shit because of it
2	Only if I really respect the other person. Otherwise I donut give a fuck
1	Yes and I get confused 
1	I really don’t like it but if I’m in the exact wrong mood I will.\n\nOnly to people who deserve it though
1	No.... because I don't lie to people. Don't ask a question that you don't want an answer to.
1	I don't lie because I know I can't lie.
1	I don't care about white lies (lies to make people feel better: "What do you think of my new haircut?" "It's FABULOUS!"... it's not actually fabulous at all). I can white lie all day long if it makes the people around me happy.\n\nI feel tense if I lie about something more objective, like global warming. It's more like I let people get away with thinking things I don't think are true to keep the peace. I can't be bothered to get into disagreements with most people because most people can't leave their emotions behind and be rational. So I just STFU about things, even if it makes me uncomfortable.
1	To someone for me: yes. To someone for someone else: no. To authority figures like professors and LE: never.
1	Absolutely. I feel like I'm going to die inside unless I have an exceptionally solid logical reason why the lie is the best thing to do for everyone in the situation. Even then it's like someone is grating my insides with a cheese grinder unless it's life or death.\n\nOn the other hand, I can lie effortlessly to law enforcement or authority when I believe that my well being is at stake over an arbitrary rule that means nothing. I.E. Weed, etc.
1	Yes, so I don't do it anymore. I never told any lies before the age of 10 or so, even my mother who basically hated me would attest to this (though she was a huge liar, so go figure).
1	Nope. I'm analyzing if the lie was effective, how it plays out, etc, etc.\n\nI don't really lie, though. Closest thing I do is sarcasm once in a while. \n\n
1	Hmmm, I think quite often. Like, if you show me a drawing I don't like, and ask me about it, if we weren't close enough and I felt pressured to... Hide my true feelings about it (it sucks), I may do it, but man, I'd feel it would brake some cog or lever somewhere in my brain in the process. I may actually stop doing that, not worth the effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I do lie, and often it is to soothe a situation in which I assume the truth will not be well received, but lying won't directly hurt the other. Like making an excuse for getting late somewhere when the real reason is too hard to explain, etc. But the drawing thing... Man, somebody has to tell you!
1	I enjoy it, but it's a useful social tool. 
1	Not at all, I only lie when there's a reason to and that's enough justification for me 
1	If it’s going to save my ass without negative consequences for anyone else I don’t really have a problem, but it normally takes a bit of thought before presentation
1	Unless it’s deadpan sarcasm (which I enjoy far too much), I have an extremely difficult time lying to people (even when they ask me to!)\n\nHeck, I only engage in sarcasm as a rhetorical tool to emphasize the truth!  Everything about _dishonesty_ goes antipodal to my aesthetic pursuing the truth.\n\nNow, when I’m in a bad situation where it would be bad to lie outright, I elevate my speech to be so abstract that they cannot follow me.\n\nThis is to protect their emotions (since abstract logic and emotions have such a difficult time engaging with eachother).
1	I rarely have times where I need to lie. If I do it's often small lies just to get out of a situation. I actually enjoy being honest and blunt so lying is something I avoid.
1	only to specific people, not companies
4	What are INTP good at practically speaking?	I often have a hard time conceptualizing the INTP place.\n\nI think we are great system designers. We think of a bunch of different possibilities when we have a goal. While the ENTP might move on, we just keep iterating through more and more possibilities until we have a logical proof of something. I.e. we are good at finding truth. This iterating through possibilities is also really good for setting up perfectly stable systems, but these don't really exist that much in real life. I think INTP would be great entrepreneurs for making a system that works without himself, but then after that where is he supposed to go? Make another system?\n\nAre we good troubleshooters of systems too?\n\nIt just feels like I'm designing a system for which I have no place in. As if the world could exist without me.\n\nReally my only example of "do" things I am good at have been video games(FPS and MOBA), and random-element card games. I can solve problems, but typically they are like...moral issues. It's like beyond "truth" what are we good at? I would think tactics within an understood system, because the Ti-Ne axis(which is my explanation for FPS skill), but its hard to see what an Ne user would be good at versus an Se user.
4	We are. At logically sifting through multiples point of views or ideas. We're good at everything abstract thinking...\n\nActually, probably the best at abstract thinking if we go only by the functions, with only the ENTPs as contenders.
4	Limiting thoughts. Ew! Don't do that to yourself. "Being an INTP" really just means that you have a certain way of approaching and processing your enviroment. This doesn't restrict what you can do or learn or become, character-wise. \n\nWhat are INTPs good at practically speaking? Anything they practice for a long period of time. Sorry to be a lame-o. I don't mean to break out dusty old adages but as far as skills go, practice > MBTI. There are far more limiting factors to your abilities than being an INTP, like your intelligence or physical prowess.
1	I don't know, we're pretty impractical (along with INFPs). That's kind of the point I think.\n\nI feel like INTPs are like pure research in science; society needs people who go off and try to figure out what's true just for the sake of knowing what's true. Doing that actually leads to advancements that would never exist if you simply did what was immeidately practical.\n\nMore than that, the truth itself is valuable, even without any pragmatic results. It's like beauty (the INFP value); not everything has to serve some ulterior purpose.
1	Doing everything wrong the first time so I and others can do it right future times.
1	As a designer, your fundamental conception of design is completely wrong. You don’t design for yourself; never ever do you. Design is always for whatever the goal or client wants. As soon as you start designing for yourself, you’ve already jumped down the rabbit hole. Because what are you working for? Yourself? This is why many people who believe themselves to be designers or system engineers, whatever you want to call it make the most convoluted confusing mess of systems. I see it all the time, the IT guy that thinks hes a software dev and starts customizing form fields for himself because he knows best, and before you know it, the entire system is this confusing jumble of customization vs standardization that no one can figure out. Design is all about planning and function towards a defined goal; not an undefined one. 
1	Believe it or not, most folks are just working a job, and not using any skills that they're good at.\n\nMost people in this world are no more than average, and that is who this world is designed for.\n\nYou feel you have no place because you are beyond average, and this world isn't made for folks like that. You feel empty while others are just doing what comes naturally.\n\nThe humans in control don't want humans that look for truth or deeper meaning, so they make it a tough place for us.
1	I'm struggling with this at the moment -  in a rather particuar manner as apposed to the pervasive general INTP angst.  If I may clarify the problem as I see it at present .... this sounds particularly shallow, but at the moment I want cash!  If I could monitise my abilitys somehow, enough to settle every conceiveable debt and future outgoing then I'd be much happier with my lack of practical existence.  I'd just spend my time travelling. I'd still do very intp stuff ... observe from the sidelines, watch the interactions and marvel in at it, but I think I'd feel better having been released from that societal obligation that is money. I think I could channel my thoughts and efforts in to something semi-creative in that instance .... a book maybe.  Does this resonate at all?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking there should be a massive INTP commune.  Pool resources, buy in chefs and cleaners so we can just so whatever the fuck we like! :)
1	A friend shared a metaphor that may be helpful as I struggled with something similar.\n\nI dedicated most of my adult life to a particular line of work. There was a lot of variety and complexity and growth within that line of work, but it was all very much in the same theme. I'm at the point where I'm considering moving on and doing other things, but I got so good at this theme, leaving it feels devastating and considering I can't take it all with me, it makes me wonder if it was all "worth it."  \n\nI liken my career to getting really good at filling glasses with different kinds of liquids, or shuffling liquids from one glass to another. Pour some milk in this one, tea in this one, combine them together in this one, etc. I got realllly good at manipulating liquids and combining them into new forms and changing them and moving them around etc.\n\nBut now what if I want to start playing with solids? I don't know anything about working with dirt, or sand, or cotton. It feels awful.  Starting from scratch after making this enormous investment in liquids. What was it all for? It was really depressing.\n\nAnd my friend shared something that honestly completely shifted my perspective on my entire life and career. She said, "You didn't get good at working with liquids. You became an expert at building containers. Liquid was just the medium you used to put into the incredible containers you built."\n\nWe can do whatever we want and put whatever we want to into our containers. The long thread of meaning is building the discipline of container building. The *approach* is the common thread that gets better and better over time.\n
19	Damn. You're an interesting find.	I was diagnosed ADHD about 5 years ago. I've been trying to learn to cope since. Lurking ADHD sub for a while, getting jealous of all the people stopping in and finding everything relatable instantly. That wasn't me, at all. I could relate to SOME things, but I didn't quite get the feeling I belonged there. \n\nThen I found this sub. And holy shit. Everyone, and everything is so familiar. I feel like I've found a library of all of my own thoughts expressed in one forum. \n\nNow, I'm going to be honest, I'm not one to generalize people into specific psychological types. I don't think anyone can be completely labeled and anyone who locks themselves into a Jungian personality type is pretty ignorant. I am very irritated when I see these sorts of labels in tinder profile and such, but out of curiosity I took "the test" and lo and behold y'all make me wanna cry a bit.\n\nEnd story, please continue with your lives. Thank you.
16	Nice story. I am 54 and was diagnosed with ADHD in 2014. Around that time, I stumbled across MBTI and took a few tests, all of turned out strongly INTP. A while later, my curiosity got the better of me, and a few searches led me here.\n\nMy wife still laughs about it. After browsing around for a while, I shouted at the top of my voice, "I HAVE PEOPLE! I FOUND MY PEOPLE! And I had. I later visited all the other MBTI subreddits and hated them.\n\nThis is such a wonderful place. No you are not a freaking; you are normal. I don't care about any tests. These are my people, and I belong here.\n\nStick around.

1	I've got a med disorder similar to both bipolar and schizophrenia. Thought my whole issue with the world was due to my disorders and childhood traumas. Then I come here and some folks process info similarly. Not the same by any stretch but the similarities were striking.\n\nEdit: They write me Rxs for dexedrine but I don't really take it and I've never received a diagnosis of ADHD. I initially received addy to be able to make it to an 8am class but now I only take it when I have a 6am shift.

3	A useful tip my therapist gave me -- "you need to learn to trust the guy that made that decision."\n\nDo you trust yourself right now to evaluate a situation -- analyze it (perhaps analyze it to death) from all the angles, aggregate all of that data into whatever mental model and use it to determine an outcome?   I'm guessing the answer to that is yes.  \n\nAnd you had that same ability whenever you made the decision you're now spinning over. So you need to trust that that guy/[gender-appropriate-noun] used that ability then and made the right decision.\n\nThe only reason to go back and re-evaluate a decision is when there is truly *new external* information. Not new random info you invented in your head, not new angles that you suddenly came up with now that you hadn't come up with then, etc.  New info is like, the basic rules changed, or the basic facts changed.  (As far as relationships are  concerned, that means things like "it was a long distance relationship but one of us moved" or "the job was killing him and making him an asshole and he realized that and quit" .. not "I should've appreciated her more" or "I could've learned to live with her dismissive attitude")\n\nAlso, always remember that you fall in love when you're actually with a person, not when you're apart.  When you break up you're dealing with oxytocin withdrawal which is a real chemical addiction that you're coping with - don't trust *anything* while that's going on.  It's completely toxic for an INTP. You will spin incredible tales and move the earth to get your oxytocin fix. It will end up destroying both you and the other person. You will trick yourself and the other person into thinking you're someone you're not.  We have a gift but that gift is very dangerous when another person and a broken heart is involved.\n(Kevin Uxbridge on TNG is my favorite metaphor for the crazy powers of a broken hearted INTP :)
2	A metric fucktonne of weed and booze for you I prescribe you sir. Also a good cry is in order.
2	So I used this trick in past still don't now why I stopped doing this as it gives me a lot more concentration. When you doing something always have notebook with you and whenever you got idea just write it to notebook so you can check/do that latter ( you will probably will never check all of them :D), and then just continue what you are doing.
2	I do this thing when I feel I've fucked up where I obsess over the thing I did and can't stop beating myself up about it. Is this what you're talking about? If so, this is what I've learned to do, through Jungian psychology.\n\nBasically, what happens is you have an inner motherfucker who enjoys making you feel like shit (if you're a woman - if you're a man it's an inner ball busting bitch). I don't really know what guys are supposed to do but I've found as a woman, I tell him yes, he's absolutely right, let's not talk about it anymore and then I mentally leave the conversation. Works like a charm.\n\nI think if you're a man you generally need to put your anima in her place but  I don't know this 100% as it's not my personal issue. 
2	Apathy is to stop yourself from thinking about it and feeling it.\n\n**The main INTP coping mechanism(?)/emotional defense system IS apathy.**  So if you're INTP, youre wanting that built-in defense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll tell you from recent experience.  A horrible feeling (like depression, heartache, or what you feel) is like a terrible injury (a gunshot wound, or broken bone).  Apathy is like injecting morphine into it.  It stops the pain for a while, but it doesnt heal the the injury.  Eventually you will have to introspect and work through it, like getting surgery on the wound.  It's painful, but it has to be done so you can heal.

1	16Personalities	So I've seen some hate on the 16 personalities test on here before but idk why. I've done multiple tests before and most of them seem not as well done or polished in my opinion. Is there a reason everyone hates 16 personalities? Or is there a better test I've just missed out on? Any input would be welcome. 
5	16 personalities is a great way to get into MBTI; Hell its how I got into MBTI. The thing is its not a super specific about well anything. It bases conclusions off like common behaviors that certain archetypes exhibit. The problem is how it chooses to use these common behaviors as a basis for its definition of a type. So for example lets say a common trait of INTP's are super lazy, then it uses this as a basis for well if you're super lazy you are an INTP. Except the thing is that this behavioral trait is not  linked exclusively to being INTP. 16 Personalities gives you more of a wishy washy feeling of what each type is like and how you could possible fit into the picture but it also plays big into stereotypes. Once you discover MBTI people try to steer you away from that because that's not what MBTI is about. MBTI is a structure or framework that alludes to certain behaviorial aspects of certain people it doesn't say if you do this this and this you are this. That's cookie cutter mentality. Hope this helps.
5	You raise an interesting question. I am something of an outlier here because I do not know my function stack from a pancake stack. And don't even get me started on ennegrams, whatever they are. I randomly came across this whole idea from some stupid Facebook marketing thing. My wife insisted that I take this test that was vaguely like 16 personalities. It generated a chart. She and all her friends were blotches in the center, and I was entirely crammed into one quarter of it. They said that it just proves I am a weirdo.\n\nI looked around and took a few tests, all of which said I was INTP.  Some of the description fit, and some was dead wrong. So I looked around and fell into this place. After looking around for a while, I shouted out loud, "I have people! I found my people!" My wife will never let me live that down. But it was true.  For the first time in my life, I had found people who seemed like me. I felt like I understood them and they understood me. I checked out the other MBTI subreddits and felt like a different species. \n\nThat was all I needed to know. I am an INTP because the people here are my people, not because of some test. And finding my people was all I wanted. I don't need someone else to tell me about my deeper self.  I may be the only person here who is done with MBTI.
6	Can somone explain gifted/normal ratio in this image?And this chart?	
18	It's BS, though. Like, 225 IQ for us ? Seriously ? That's twice the average. \n\nAlso, no source, no numbers, no definiton of what "gifted" or "normal" means, nothing... \n\n
14	All I learned from this is that S is for stupid
3	So I'm able to understand that intp's are smartest but not meaning of numbers
1	the ratio of gifted:normal for the various types is shown. The bottom IQ part is doubtable since the average IQ is supposed to be 100 but the 100 is way over to the left instead of the middle
1	This is probably fabricated, I can't see how an average ESTP is less gifted than say an average ENFJ. \n\nHere are some facts:\n\nFact: ISTJs, ESTPs and INTPs are highly represented in math. (which requires a higher IQ) \n\nFact: INTJs are highly represented in business and finance. (which requires a drive to win)\n\nI would say types who want to win above all else, may practice for the IQ test, and get better results compared to others who enter the test with no prior training.\n\nNot only proper sampling and testing is important, it's important to know if ppl have been training for the IQ test or not. As an older person and an academic-level educater, INTJs I've met in real life haven't been that impressive (and I've met many). 
1	This is shit
1	looks very wrong
2	The origin of the enneagram (...it's also a dance)	
1	So I went down a bit of a rabbit hole yesterday researching this guy named George Gurdjieff. He was a mystic who developed a series of dances - you may actually recognize the 'movements' if you watched the show The OA or The Magicians.\n\nAnyway, I realized that he's the one who actually popularized the enneagram and made a dance based on it. It's at ~43:00 in the video. (the dance recital starts at 5:00)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality
13	Lost in thought	I was in the middle of being productive when my focus on the project faded a little and I suddenly found myself spending an hour on imagining a conversation with a fictional therapist to whom I explained a few minor issues with my personality in the longest and most detailed way possible.\n\nSomehow I went from working on a project to crying over losing a chess game to an 8 year old that one time 6 years ago...\n\nHow are your drift-offs going?
6	I can't have normal conversations with people because I think about what I'm saying so hard that I lose focus of how the words actually come out of my mouth
2	Pretty good. I just had a nice drift off about the wonders of math. Idk man, math is just cool. There's something so satisfying when you understand it and it just works. It allows us to do amazing things.\n\nI don't know if any of you believe in a god, but I was just thinking that although math is a man-made concept, God must be the greatest mathematician. The symmetry of the world, the complexity of it and He was kind enough to keep it simple enough that we could find a way to kind of understand it lol. We now have the ability to make and create things, change things, because of its concepts. Maybe He put the ideas in our head, maybe he didn't. Still interesting to think about. I love math.\n\nIn one of my engineering classes we were talking about Honda building a humanoid robot. We were wondering why? I think its because people respect people with power. Honda claims it was just research/cuz its cool but I think its really just not a waste of money because it earns them respect and the research can be applied to many other things (TERMINATOR). Although people may not believe in a God, we still respect people who have power like one. The power to make a robot that imitates God's creation is not a force to be reckoned with (like Cyberdyne Systems). We look up to people like this, and fear them. Maybe we're all god fearing in a sense. We fear things we don't understand, and sometimes people that understand things better than us. It makes them an advanced company, more than just another automaker (and whatever else they do).\n\nAnd now I'm thinking about robotic hands and why they're so difficult to make.  In my class we also talked about while there have been many improvements in artificial intelligence, mechanics seems to lag a bit behind. The speaker who came to our class was working on robotic hand designs (he taught one to use nunchucks but thats beside the point). He explained how hands require many different sensors and we have the ability to perform delicate tasks that its very difficult to teach a robot to do. We also talked about how a robot can't be "smarter" than the people who made it (at least at this point in time). So yes, he had to learn to use nunchucks to teach the robot lol.\n\nAnd theres a lovely demonstration of INTP stream of consciousness lol\n\nAnother interesting thing about INTPs, anybody else make a lot of generalizations? It pisses of my friends sometimes but I just see the pattern and make the connection. Idk. I think the world is as simple as we choose to see it/think about it, generalizations can make things easier to understand. So yep

11	Anyone go to bed super late?	Just curious
16	I go to bed early, but then stay up on my phone and shit super late 
7	It's almost 7am. I'm considering going to sleep soon, just one more youtube video...
4	Yes. I'm more functional during the wee hours of the day.
3	I stay up late almost every night, it differs, but I would say my bedtime is 1-4am. I always catch myself eating bad as hell when it gets late! 
2	Relatable. In high school my parents made me go to bed at 9 pm, but naturally I would be on my phone until like 3 am or 4. Now I'm in college. Its 2 am and I'm on my phone. Its either be on my phone or stare off into space thinking about whatever INTP brain decides is a cool topic. At least now that I'm out of the house I don't have to hide. 
2	I'd like to but I have a job
2	Sup? It’s 12:54am. 
2	4:29AM here insomnia has been killing me recently.
2	It’s almost 2am. I’ll probably be up until at least 4am. I’m researching neurotransmitters for a class assignment because my dumbass procrastinated doing this assignment. 
2	No, early. As in early in the morning.
1	Generally yea, been a night owl my whole life.  Although there was a time when I woke up naturally at about 7am after I spent a ridiculous amount of effort trying to fix my sleep.  It was great.  But then work set me back to late schedule again
1	In college I’d be up until 2 but now I get to work at 7 so I try to be asleep by 1
1	To the point where 'when did you last sleep' can often be answered more accurately by naming a day rather than an hour.
1	Yes. My usual bed time is around 3:00. Sometimes I'll really fuck up and realize that it's 7 or 8 in the morning before forcing myself to sleep. I occasionally don't sleep because its super late and I need to get up early, so staying awake is easier than waking up (not a good idea).
1	Every damn night.  That's my chance to unwind,  kids and husband are asleep, no one needs anything,  no expectations to fulfill, just me any my thoughts.  I generally zone out for a couple hours with reddit and a show I like playing in the background, not really focusing on either.  I always regret it in the morning, but damn is it nice to just exist as I am for a bit.
1	Nope.  In bed between 10 or 11 and up at 6.  Usually on weekends too.  I get too bored late at night.  
1	Need help for a Scheme i am concocting	I live in the rust belt. Lots of unused land and housing and buildings. Some areas have Urban Homesteading Developments and some don't. I want to acquire as much land and as many houses as possible.\n\nFellow INTPs and anyone else interested, how would you go about this if you were in my situation?\n\nThere are a few things to consider. I have some money, although not a lot, to work with, and a lot of time on my hands.\n\nI've thought of several avenues that i could take. I've considered taking advantage of adverse possession laws. Ive considered buying some places from the city for cheap. Ive considered petitioning land owners to purchase the land immediately next door to them for a dollar (a thing you can do here) to sell to me for a dollar after the fact. I have a couple friends who are essentially willing to do the same to help me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat i would like to know is how would you go about this yourselves?\n\nWhat would you do in terms of acquiring cheap and or fast manpower?\n\nHow would you go about gathering funds in a creative way to support this venture?\n\nDoes anyone know of any established groups or people who do something similar to this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIve already begun taking and digging up plots of land that are otherwise not being used by the city and not under threat of being bought for one reason or another. I have 3 complete lots dug up in an effort to begin an urban farm on them, and a single house that i may gain possession of, which i have been working on for a couple years now, that i technically don't own. (adverse possession will kick in after a certain amount of time, and i will legally own them after, so long as i am not actively discouraged from doing anything by the lands owners.)\n\nthe end game of this is a sort of mass land re-management idea that i am trying to execute. I have done a fair amount of research, and systematically there aren't many issues to be had, my main issue is resources. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone with ideas or advice please feel free to share. think creatively and think big. I need loopholes.
2	Where do i sign up
1	Sheer awesomeness. I’m very excited for you and would like to hear how this pans out. \n\nOne thing I noticed missing from your post was leverage through debt financing. I’d cast a wide net and speak to a wide variety of mortgage lenders, commercial lenders, and other alternative lenders to learn what programs or packages might be available for you. \n\nEdit: Also many programs are available specific for farm land. Cheers!
1	Hans, es ist Zeit für Anschluss!  
1	I have a friend in Sudan that knows a guy in the Emirates; He's a very wealthy prince of an oil baron and has a lot of extra money to invest. I find your idea intriguing and let's say I'm willing to start the initial investment at 1 million. If you're interested post me back a mail order check in the amount of $30, 001 to account 34-539BYA at Western Credit Union (there should be one in your town near you) and I can assure you that I can secure your investment capital. Hope to hear back from you soon friend. :) :) :)

0	People die, I do not feel a thing.	Over the years my 4 grandparents and a few uncles and aunts died. These are the people who I grew up with. Other family members cry and mourn, but I don't feel anything at all. \n\nInstead my concern becomes how to condole to their families. I just feel condolence is a waste of words. There is nothing I can say that would ease their pain of loss, so what is the point?\n\nOh boy, we the INTPs are different, very different
7	I was the same way and realized that I did not feel connected to anyone. That lack of connection left me without feeling anything when my father died. Largely through mindfulness, I developed connections with people and reality in general, and thinking of the loss of my father now makes me sad.
3	One thing is not feeling another is showing feeling, are you sure that you don't feel anything?
3	Maybe you're not that attached to your family..\n
1	[deleted]
1	I felt that I didn't have connections to my grandmother when she passed away. However, I cried the most and most often when she passed. I think knowing that all the potential from her ended their was what really hit me.
1	Relatable to an extent. I feel something but it's more along the lines of "damn, I'll never see that dude again" and I move on. I've tried to dive into why I'm not very affected by it and the answer I've always come up with is "Sadness won't change anything, so there's no reason to be sad" 
1	Yea, sometimes I feel like I'm faking the feelings I show people. Like if someone cries, it actually takes effort to offer them support (like a hug) and it makes me uncomfortable. For most people it just looks like its instinct for them and genuine. I think that INTPs just learn to force feelings/emotions when the situation demands it because they're things we instinctively block. We want to keep things rational.
19	Anyone else feel awkward when someone asks, “How’s it going?” Or, “How are you?”	I don’t know why but it just feels like this robotic interaction in society that is so inauthentic and done just out of habit and courtesy. Most likely, no one REALLY wants to here anything other than “good/fine, how are you?” This bugs me but I don’t know how else to approach a situation like this, any thoughts or can you possibly relate?
32	In a psychiatrist's office:\n\nHi, how are you doing?\n\nGood, thank you.\n\nGlad to hear. So, what brings you here today?\n\nI'm not doing so good.
13	Yeah, it bugs me, I usually reply with a silence that's a beat too long and then say 'yes' very emphatically. \n\nI have a friend who stops, looks at the ground, then makes very direct eye contact and tells people exactly what state he's in. Even though he's good/fine 99% of the time, the fact that he stops to check himself to see adds a level of sincerity to it, and it definitely impacts the way people reply to him.\n\nIt might be automatic on their part to ask, but it can be an in to a genuine human moment if one desires it.   
12	Nah. The key is not to take these questions literally. When someone says these words, what they’re *actually* asking is, “What do you want to talk about?”\n\nIf you want to build a connection with someone, share your genuine self. They ask how you’re doing, tell them honestly, “Good. Last night I spent 3 hours on Wikipedia reading about Greek mythology, but by the end I had somehow moved on to carbon nanotubes.”\n\nIf they’re destined to be your friend, they will excitedly ask you to share what you’ve learned. If not, well, at least they’ve learned something about your true self. \n\nNobody *actually* wants to hear and discuss the generic answers. It’s just a song and dance that people do. 
6	"How are you" really bothers me because even though I know the question isn't meant to be literal, I feel some genuine guilt if I flat out answer with a lie. But I also feel a little bad about putting someone in the spot of answering to "I'm extremely depressed and haven't felt happiness since the age of 6" when they never really cared in the first place.\n\nSo the question has a 100% success rate in making me feel uncomfortable. I wish society used a less meaningful and intimate question to initiate conversations. Something along the lines of "Do you want to talk to me?"
3	It is how we acknowledge each other and is far better than "fuck you." When I am asked I often answer with fabulous. People not infrequently comment on that, and I tell them that how you are doing at any given moment is a matter of choice, not circumstance. Many enjoyable conversations have followed 
2	Good thanks, you? Great! *walks off*\n\nI don't like it either, only because I know they don't want an honest answer.\nWhen I ask someone how they are, it's because I genuinely want to know if they are okay. Chances are they're someone I like who looks a bit down, and I want them to know they can vent if they need to.
2	If it’s in passing, I see it for what it is and treat it as a greeting, so I’ll respond to a “what’s up” with a “hey” and a nod.\n\nIf it’s in a conversation, it’s just a formality to start the small talk and you can easily just segue into something else. 
2	I dislike the question because I don't wish to delve into how I feel all the time,  especially when all that is expected is a pointless "fine thanks" anyway. 
1	I just say awesome
1	My stock answer with strangers and loose acquaintances is either, "Good!" or "Can't Complain!"\n\nMy stock answer with people I'm closer to is, "I'm alright," with the inflection adjusted to suit my current state.\n\nThat way, I'm answering truthfully no matter what, even if it's merely a social nicety.
1	It doesn't bother me at all. It's part of what I privately think of as the human primate lice picking ritual; other primates sit around and pick bugs from each other's fur. This isn't mainly or even primarily to pick lice, it's to strengthen bonds. So "How are you?" or "Nice weather, innit?" aren't really about you, or the weather, it's just a nice, friendly "Hey, I acknowledge you!   \nWe're friends!"\n\nExtended bullshit conversations are the same thing. I can talk (or, more accurately listen) to people's random nonsense because it's not \*really\* about what they're talking about, it's about making bonds with each other; ie. picking each other's metaphorical lice.
1	I think it's important to remind yourself that 99% of the time they're not literally asking "How are you", but rather just using one of several variants of "Hello".  A "sup" or "hey" is a sufficient response.
1	INTP or ENTP	I don't know what the hell am I, maybe I suffer from a multiple personality disorder, problem is, the n the t the p are all near the hundred percent mark, but the E and the I are confusing, I am 49% E and 51% I, sometimes I love being the center of attention, I even stream for live audience and I love doing it most of the time. Sometimes when I'm in a place with alot of people I get nervous and I want to be home alone not talking to anyone and just fap alone in the dark with my phone in airplane mode. When I was a kid I suffered from sociophobia because I was bullied  in school because of my intellectual superiority but when I'm sure that the people I'm with won't hurt me or something I am a very outgoing person. I think that I have figured it all out after thinking about this today for hours with my conclusion being that INTPs are just ENTPs with mental disorders
5	You should look into the actual functions instead of just taking a test with percentages.\n\nWatch this video https://youtu.be/cXTvyyxdv3s\nYou could also check out the other videos on his channel. That guy knows his stuff\n\nThe whole percentage thing is bullshit. People are set as a certain type, but they don’t behave like the type ALL the time. There’s your ego (your main type), your subconscious, your unconscious, and your superego. All different types
2	ANTP\n\nLol.
1	Yep. Similar I/E thing with me. Mental disorders, hence I
1	Streaming is not extroverted.  It's quite detached and you don't have anywhere near the same social drain you would have to deal with if there were 20 people in your room talking to you.\n\nI would say you are simply a talkative introvert
1	Claims “intellectual superiority,” thinks you suffer from a severe personality disorder because a pseudo scientific test told you that you’re neither strongly extroverted or introverted. Alright lol. 
1	I am pretty sure that you are yourself. And you sound just fine to me. The way that MBTI is supposed to work is that it will produce a generally accurate description of your approach to life. Trying to make yourself fit into a type or worrying that you don't meet the criteria for any type is backwards.\n\nIf you test in the middle in I and E, then you probably are in the middle, with characteristics of both. Sounds great to me.
1	> I think that I have figured it all out after thinking about this today for hours with my conclusion being that INTPs are just ENTPs with mental disorders \n\nYou put hours of thought into this pseudo science system and that's your conclusion. lol\n\n&#x200B;
1	Any learning and retaining new hobby tips from older INTPS	I’m making my third attempt at learning java from no coding background whatsoever.  Every time I try and pick up a hobby I start dwelling on the cons and convince myself it ain’t worth it because XYZ reason.  I’m also not going to be telling anybody about what I’m up to.
4	I've had more hobbies than I can count, and ironically math is one of them.   \n\n\nSeriously though, after some years I've noticed that my hobbies has started to converge into each other. Guitar, physics, math, guitarpedals, programming has all converged into one mega-hobby. Having multiple hobbies that synergize makes it more worth the effort. 
4	If there is even a modicum of satisfaction available for you by doing it right now, it's worth doing.\n\nImagine how much learning a simple coding language will influence everything else you are going to learn in the future for the rest of your life. Even if you do nothing with java, merely learning java offers valuable lessons that bleed into other areas of your life. For whatever you learn, you also become better at learning itself. Then, when you find something you REALLY yearn to learn, you will be able to learn it the best and the fastest way possible.\n\nIf you are under 30, disregard all concerns over what you are learning in particular. Learn anything and do it alot. In a decade or two everything you have learned will start to fuse together into new broader areas of knowledge, eventually giving you transcontextual expertise that only few humans on the planet possess. It is hard to see any cons in THAT.
1	INTP vs. INFP: either soulless machines or emotional wrecks?	Hey,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tested as an INTP with 10% more T, but what I consider to be an INTP/INFP cusp. In attempts to get the most accurate picture of myself, I started reading literature about both types and browsing their associated forums. I identify more with the INTP experience in equilibrium, but when my life veers towards the extremes the opposite is true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(TLDR: my soul yearns for freedom and transcendence, either through love or through escape)\n\nWhen things are really bad, I become extremely emotional and turbulent. I don't cry, but I do impractical things (i.e. skipping class to go for a walk in the forest, or taking a random flight across the world and not answering calls for a week.) When I decide to do these things, it's on a whim, and once I've left I can't come back for awhile even if I know it'd be in my best interest to stay. During these times I also write a lot, and it tends to be vague and metaphorical. My only solace is being part of the chain of human suffering that reifies us and binds our experiences together. When things are really good, I become spontaneous and romantic. I take more of an interest in fashion and go on as many random excursions as possible. I create a soundtrack for the era, accompanying my inner real of daydreams as I consume the universe's offerings. I want to see la vie en rose, even if reality doesn't mirror it. And when I fall in love, I don't care about what makes sense. I allow my soul to collide with that of another, and seek, rather than anything grounded, a blissful oblivion. A field to lay in, responsibilities to abandon, an empty street to skip through. Afterwards, I spend a lot of time looking at the sky or the ceiling and sifting through memories. It often impedes my productivity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(TLDR: the preponderance of evidence shows I'm INTP despite being sentimental and squishy)\n\nIn spite of this, I've taken the Meyers-Briggs perhaps 20 times, and on at least 10 different sites. I've never gotten anything other than INTP. It seems that an INTP superpower is burying emotions, but when it comes to romance my emotions bury me. I also am very nostalgic and sentimental about life as a whole, an attitude INTP's don't seem to have. If I weren't an INTP, I wouldn't consistently get that result. However, it seems like, to some extent, to be an INTP is to be emotionally-neutral, and my emotional world is often vivid and overpowering. It seems that, to be an INTP, one must take more interest in the realm of knowledge than the realm of experience. I take equal interest in both. Finally, I'm not sure if any INTP's have ever written a poem or worn lipstick without being forced!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(TLDR: INTP is cold robot, INFP is emotional pile of goop, no in between?)\n\nI noticed something weird about the forums associated with those two types. INTP's seem to be (or at least have the self-image of being) foreigners to emotion, whereas INFP's make a big deal about experiencing emotions more intensely than others. Perhaps being like this isn't necessitated, and all of you just want to preserve a particular picture of your identities. However, maybe the way the two types present themselves actually corresponds to the reality they experience. If this is the case, it seems like there's no middle ground, which makes little sense unless the other letters cause the F/P rift to operate as an intense dichotomy. It is obvious that INFP's and INTP's have a different functional stack, which would explain their divergent experiences despite surface-level similarity. However, if you are cuspy, do you have a cuspy functional stack, or must you definitively fall on one side?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(TLDR: is the emotional void an essential element of INTPness? Can the logic we are so proud of be coexistent with emotion? I ask these questions and more.)\n\nIs there a one-drop rule for INTP's, where having one drop of emotional unpredictability renders you ineligible for the label? Must thinking and feeling even be irreconcilable? It seems that if emotions are present during a rational process, the decision comes from emotion. However, if that process yields the same decision in the absence of emotions, the decision now comes from reason. If an element can be removed from the process, however, it cannot be the source of its result. Therefore, my intuition is that only decisions that originate from emotion can truly be said to stem from emotion. That said, there seems to be an implication that sentimental types cannot have their intellectual outputs trusted. Am I less logical, less rational, less INTP because I'm a bit of an existentialist at heart? Or is there a way for me to reconcile my experiences with what I've been categorized as?
3	There is no such thing as a cusp - this ain't astrology!  ﾍ(￣ ￣ ﾍ)\n\nINTPs and INFPs are really different.... even though there are a lot of similarities. I'm an INTP and I can get \*very\* emotional and sentimental. I love me some tragic stories yippeeeee!! But I have a hard time responding to actual real peoples' emotional needs (to my ISFJ fiance's consternation). \n\nDifferences between INTPs and INFPs:\n\n\- Dominant function: INTP's hero is introverted thinking. We're super mega good at creating conceptual frameworks in our heads. No one is better at figuring out not only what is true, but what subtle gradation of true it is. Is this concept rock solid, or is it something that seems like it might be true, but maybe not. INFPs can't really do this. INFP hero is introverted feeling; they know exactly what they feel (I don't know about other INTPs but I struggle with this). They're deeply moral. They can also practice what Personalty Hackers calls "emotional jujitsu;" they're able to emotionally manipulate other people into doing what they want, often without the other person knowing it. INTPs cannot do this AT ALL.\n\n\- Inferior function: INTP inferior is extroverted feeling. We feel shame all the time because we really want to make people happy but we feel like we're total failures in that regard. INFP inferior is extroverted thinking. They feel shame because they want to be competent, productive, and successful but often feel like failures in that regard.\n\nINTPs and INFPs share second and third functions but their primary and inferiors are pretty much opposite. I don't know, if I was going to guess I'd say you're an INFP simply for the following reason: INTPs usually know exactly who they are as soon as they see their description. It's like "FINALLY someone understands meeee!!!!" INFPs, on the other hand, usually have a hard time knowing who they are because they naturally "feel into" others; an INFP is like a emotional chameleon who understands people from the inside out.
3	This keeps coming up on the sub but the difference between an intp and infp is 1 letter in the mbti system but really they are fundamentally nothing alike. INTP’s operate cognitively off the Ti - Ne stack whereas INFP’s operate off the Fi - Ne stack. The basic difference is your preferred or initial decision making process. An INTP will make decisions largely based off Ti which is (internal logic) whereas an INFP will make decisions based largely their Fi (internal feeling) These two value systems alone are complete polar of each other and nothing alike. Where INTP’s like to remain objective and calculating in using their Ti. An Fi dom would make decisions largely based off how they are feeling at the time using their emotional quotient. \n\nDeciding if you are an INTP vs INFP is like trying to figure out if you’re an apple or an eggplant. It really isn’t that hard. Our Fi lies at the bottom of our shadow function stack. Emotion is like the furthest thing from our reality. If you think your an infp cuz you switched a t for an f, I have no idea what to say. Ya’ll need to stop reading 16 personalities for god sakes, its honestly tilting af. \n\nA better comparison would be INTP to ENTP where the Ti - Ne is swapped with Ne - Ti; this would be like comparing gala apples to red delicious. These types are more closely related in their cognitive functions. \n\nHere’s an initial resource to get you started. https://www.typeinmind.com/fine
2	>  It seems that an INTP superpower is burying emotions, but when it comes to romance my emotions bury me. \n\nINTPs have a very rich emotional life, we're just oblivious to other peoples emotions and crappy at expressing our own.   \n\n\n> I also am very nostalgic and sentimental about life as a whole, an attitude INTP's don't seem to have.  \n\nIt's called Ti-Si loop. And INTPs experience it frequently.   \n\n\nTo others we might seem as warm robots. But personally I frequently feel like an emotional pile of confetti, despite seeming cold and rational to other people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

1	INTP Yelp Reviewers	Anyone write a lot of Yelp reviews? What's your "criteria", or whatever you go by like?\n\nI think of the whole experience, like "Could I take this experience 5 out of 5 straight chances?", Compared to trying something new first. I think to fine-tune some ratings but come on it's only 5 stars.\n\nI don't consistently use it. But get ***really*** passionate about writing negative reviews (when I absolutely have to). 
2	Exactly this. I would only ever write a review if the person  would benefit from it because I personally knew them OR if the experience was so atrocious that I decided to go through the hassle of even making an account on that platform to hate-fueled write 10 pages long of vitriol and prepare to completely rek face as I like to call it. Then I think about how much work that would be and then go do something else.
1	Nah. On the contrary though, when I am compelled to write a review on Yelp, Google, or Facebook, it’s pretty much always because I was so deeply grateful for an extremely *positive* experience that I wanted to tell everyone and spread the love. \n\nNever really had a terrible experience anywhere I can think of. 
2	Disscusion about "How are you?" when and why you use this question?

3	God I want him banned
6	Alright guys. I need some help. I broke up with my ISFJ gf and I feel like I’m completely lost.	TL;DR   I broke up with my gf and I can’t handle the fact that it was over something so seeming little as her not asking me questions. We broke up once before for about a week and I got back with her because I thought I made a stupid mistake. Now it feels the same.\n\nShe was the nicest most caring girl in the world and I just decided to never talk to her again? What is that all about? We were dating for a year and over the course of it I guess I felt like she wasn’t very intellectually stimulating. Like I’d go over to her house once a week and expect her to have things to tell me and ask me about what I was up to, but I’d get there and she’d be totally in the present. She’d always say stuff like, “hey so what should we eat tonight” or “do you wanna watch that new movie”.\n\nWhere is the context?? Like I’m your life partner don’t you wanna know how my week was, if I saw that crazy news story, if I was feeling ok about my classes?? When I’d ask her about her week she’d give me two word answers and try to steer the convo back to what we were right about to do. I just longed for her to give me more conversationally. \n\nIt sucks that everything else about her was perfect. You have ideas of loving someone forever and then they just slightly misalign with your needs and you’re forced to abandon them forever. It’s crazy to me.\n\nFirst relationship btw. If anyone can help I’d really appreciate it.
4	First relationship jitters? It’s tough with the introverted part of ourselves to leave a partner whom we were close and intimate with and go back to the world without that personal connection and face the possibility of having to connect with a different individual. \nI understand your partner not seeming as complex or thinking the same way you do being frustrating and maybe it’s time for you to move on so that they can. Their life isn’t something you can call upon or manipulate just because you feel lonely or lost. \nI would suggest, just move on and stay the course. Just be you. Do the best at what you choose to do, whether it’s work or hobbies and eventually the right person will fit into your life.  As stressful as it seems, you have to meet new people and smile at that girl you fancy. You can’t squeeze other in to your life and you can’t bend yourself out of shape to fit them in. Like in a puzzle, they have to be the right piece. 
3	You did the right thing. Chances are you not being in the present would have grated on her eventually, so this was a doomed effort from the start. Ending relationships always sucks, especially when you have an emotional attachment to the person, but like INTP's do, you've got to follow through on your head with this one. It's gonna hurt for a bit, so don't rush into anything new or you'll be asking for more pain, just learn from it and grow a bit. Who knows, maybe as you and she grow you'll meet back up further down the road and be a better match.
2	Sorry about your breakup. It gets better. I think it will be very hard for her to forget the breakups. Not a mistake on you though.\n\nI dumped an ISFJ before too. She appeared perfect at first, but we fell off soon after she pushed really traditional roles onto me. Expected me to make every decision when I'm mostly laid-back. She eventually became very short on context, preferring to talk solely about the next family event or her inner struggle to be productive (despite being a doctor).\n\nShe was extremely passive aggressive. She got cheated before and was sensitive to her "hunches" being true. She dreamed (yes dreamed) that I cheated and blew up on me about it.. 6 months after the dream... I took extensive notes to listen to what would make her feel better. Eventually she triggered me by calling me selfish and disrespectful for not "just acknowledging" her feelings. All I was guilty of was not being good at PDA and saying I love her a lot. Improved it with someone else though ;)\n\nCouples therapy ended with me lecturing both her AND the counselor. Never knew I could be so powerful arguing. They teamed up and made me make a decision before I had time to process things so I dumped her. Couple days later I was on Tinder having a ball.  :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can be fine, man. Get some RadioHead and Tequila but remember the structure you need in your life.\n\nWith an INTJ now and she's a much easier fit. BTW THANK YOU for the TL;DR at the beginning! Made me read it lol
2	I'm sorry about your break up. I have seen this situation in multiple relationships between intuitive and sensing types. I guess we need someone to keep up with our head, conversation wise. And sensing types might not provide us with that need as they are grounded in the present moment by default. \n\n\n>You have ideas of loving someone forever and then they just slightly misalign with your needs and you’re forced to abandon them forever.\n\nYup. Pretty sure that's what an ISFP was thinking when he left me. 🤷‍♀️\n
2	You’re totally Ti-Si looping now.
2	N types will struggle in relationships with S types.  It can work but it takes an incredible amount of perseverance and respect and patience on both sides, more than some are willing to give.  The reason she didn't talk to you is because the things she finds interesting and the things you find interesting at a macro level are in conflict.  She is enriched by talking about matter of fact things like what's for dinner, a chore that needs to be done, when she's going to fill up the gas in the car.  But to N types, those things are exhausting and there's little value in making them conversation pieces.\n\nLearn from the relationship and move on.  Time heals everything!
2	I was in an identical relationship. You made the right decision breaking up with her, a relationship like that can't survive. 
12	Little life experiments	Anyone else do this?\n\nLittle life experiments over periods of time? I'm obsessed with optimising my life and will do things like the below constantly:\n\nI'll be vegan for a month\n\nI'll eliminate sugar for a while\n\nI'll sleep 10 hours a night for 6 months then try 4 (and monitor my productivity)\n\nI'll sleep on my back, try the side then decide what works best\n\nI'll deliberately use my non-dominant hand for a day a week\n\nI'll read about ways to communicate with people and run experiments all day at work. (Today I'll smile more, today I'll mimic tone, posture, mannerisms)\n\nI'll walk in a direct line to my destination because I know it's faster\n\nI eliminated TV for a month JUST to see if I could... Now I haven't watched it for 9 years. \n\nI'll try anything once. If I like it it sticks, if I don't, it's onto the next. \n\n\nSO many more examples... I'm curious.
9	All the time. Usually several going at once because I'm impatient.
8	I have ideas for doing stuff like that all the time; problem is 99% of the time im too lazy to follow through with them.  LOL
3	yep,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\- removing sugar from diet\n\n\- less meat\n\n\- grey scale phone\n\n\- meditation\n\n&#x200B;
3	Tried vegan. Close ppl gave way too much shit to keep it up lol\n\ngood idea on the non-dom hand!\n\nfastest route to work. Hung up on two.\n\nbest way to leave work without talking\n\nbest morning routine
3	Yeah I have issues sticking to the no sugar / carb things tho. \n\nCurrently removing caffeine. 
2	I think I’m INFJ and I do this all the time! This post made me excited that I’m not the only one haha!\n\nI did the non-dominant hand thing for two weeks once... I thought my brain would fall out, it was so difficult. 
2	Yup exactly.  How would you know if you don’t try?  Although the worse is when I get in a cycle of trying the same things because I wanted to try it again with a slight adjustment
1	yes except I'm too lazy to apply the test for long enough to notice any difference
15	Do any of you other INTPs have huge egos?	Like, I have an ego about my looks, my intellect, how good I am at my job, that my hobbies and preferences are superior/interesting, etc. \n\nI also go around verbalizing this, and I’m under the impression my friends and coworkers just think I’m adorable for it (because of my stellar personality IRL) instead of obnoxious. On the Internet though, I try to stay humble. Anyone else like this? 
28	I do think I have an ego, but I'm also ashamed of myself for it. I try my best to stay humble because I fear one day someone very intelligent is going to see through all my bullshit and strike down that ego to discover my deeply rooted insecurity. 
14	I have this problem where I feel that I am better than almost everyone else but at the same time I know I'm not good enough
7	Contextually, yeah.\n\nI consume a shitload of info (articles, podcasts, etc) and have read close to 200 non-fiction books in the past couple of years so it’s no surprise that I get a lot of comments on being smart by random people on the internet and IRL. And I’m a natural contrarian, so I also feel a little less prone to biases, which I always view as a plus in rationality. Because of all this, yeah, I’m pretty confident that relative to the average person and in the context of certain subjects (especially psychology), I probably know more. I don’t think I’m STEM smart though and I always feel lacking for not being proficient in areas like physics. And I still consider myself to be a slow learner... My only natural skill has always been in reading comprehension and I like to read a lot, so there you go. \n\nAesthetically, I get complimented a lot, so I’m confident in that area as well (low range of attractive, like a soft 7 lol) \n\nI’m insecure about my likability as a person though. Birds of the same feather tend to flock together and I don’t think a lot of people would particularly like my true self. It also doesn’t help that I’m quiet more often than not and no matter how much people try to make introversion out to be a strength, it’s definitely true that it’s not the best trait to have when it comes to broad appeal in the social, business, and dating realms. I don’t think I care about being liked as much as the average person, but I still don’t want to be disliked. Part of why I lift weights, dress well, and try to be more knowledgeable is in an attempt to be just a tiny bit more likable. 
5	Sure. If you have to have one, why not big?
4	Yeah I have a huge ego but I'm very humble about it. \n\nI know (or at least tell myself and believe) I am incredible - Looks, personality, talent, discipline. \n\nBUT I never share that with anyone. I'll just smile to myself most of the time. \n\nIn the rare occasions that I do choose to prove it, I'm always right and it just boosts it more. \n\nHaha good times. 
3	I don't act like I'm better than everyone else, I am better than everyone else 
3	I have one; I just don't identify with it.
2	The only time someone told me I had a big ego was when I was a freshman in high school baseball and got to play a seniors position because I was way better.\n\nLike ok dude thanks for the advice
2	It may be a self defense mechanism. 
2	There is a world of 1difference between "I am good" and "I am better."\n\n"I am good" is empowering and will get you through difficult times.\n\n"I am better" is never true and leads to difficult times.
2	Somehow, I have both a thunderous ego and an extremely fragile sense of self worth.\n\nI like to think they balance each other out. 
2	From what I can tell the INTP types are the smartest but they don't realize it themselves. The only types that do realize it are the INTJ types. The INTJ types can plan ahead and know everyone's strength and weaknesses. The INTP types are shit socially but are secretly geniuses in disguise. Also known as Jacks of all trades. If you got an INTJ and an INTP together they could potentially run the perfect doomsday cult and even know when doomsday is coming to the correct date.
2	I'm the smartest person alive. And I'm a fucking idiot.\n\nThat pretty much sums up how I feel overall but I still have a narcissism problem somehow. I'm perfectly aware that I'm no Albert Einstein...but I also feel like I'd be lying if I said that I'm not smarter than the average person.\n\nI don't know why it's so difficult for me to embrace the completely obvious fact that I'm not better than everyone else. In fact, I'm probably much, much worse than the average person at everything in life that actually has some kind of use or significance.\n\nA good IQ test score and knowledge of obscure facts shouldn't be enough to rise my ego as high as it is.
2	Everyone has an ego - it's fundamentally what your conscience mind is. Whether it's big or small isn't so much the question, more so healthy or unhealthy, which is determined by how much of how you view yourself is based in a realistic fashion. If you think you're the smartest person to have ever lived, then obviously it's over inflated, because it's not true (probably). If you think you're a worthless waste of space with no potential, it's the inverse, but also not true. If you have a solid grasp of your actual capabilities and shortcomings, it'd be deemed "healthy."
2	I've been told I've got one, because "I want to be right". Which smells bullshitty.\n\nYes, I want to be right. That's why once I found what's "right", I'm not going to move. Why would I ? Most of the time, that's unconvincing BS being spouted at me, and me not changing my mind is somehow arrogance... They thus reply with that "big ego" thing because they lost/fell bad about themselves.\n\nNot like being proven wrong is bad for you, if anything, it's great.\n\nBut really, I don't have one. Each time I brag, I tend to fail right afterward, and when I enter things like an underdog, I do rather well. (Ie, don't put the spotlight on yourself. The element of surprise is good.) \n\n> I have an ego about my looks\n\nNot really above that, though. Like, I'm barely starting to be aware of/figure out what's my place in that attractiveness hierarchy. I really didn't pay attention before. 
1	Look at enneagram type 3 and 4.
1	No I have a bruised one. One that keeps most of the world at arms length.
1	\nYes, when I was younger and insecure, the more secure you feel the less you need to convince yourself and the world how special you are. 
1	Not really ego but I prioritize my self respect over anything and anyone.\n\nBasically don't think that you can think of me as a fool or underestimate me and still be in any kind of relationship with me dattebayo
1	I always say I have an 80ft ego made of glass, I’ll think I’m hot shit but I can easily be tipped over and think just shitty. Always figured it had more so do with my body dysmorphic disorder then anything else. \n\nI don’t tell people either except my close friends or my boyfriend tho. Wouldn’t tell my coworkers I think I’m awesome today or I hate myself today. 
1	Lol no, I’m only just overcoming the crippling self-hatred that began in middle school. I still don’t have a lot of confidence and tend to doubt all of my abilities. People tell me I’m smart, but I struggle to believe them because that self-loathing is fucking stubborn. 
191	Found the INTP	
68	Is it just me who's thinking that a real INTP would've not bothered to write a long ass post even if he/she did doubt that the OP is bs?
45	Elementary, my dear Watson.
14	A classic INTP wouldn't use very anecdotal evidence as an argument, let alone their very first one. I didn't even want to read past that. Because they've seen some black eyes, it's literally impossible for any black eye ever to look differently from what they've seen?\n\n I've had a black eye before (not from a beating, but from a small home accident, mind you) that was all the things they claim black eyes can't be: not swollen at all, uniformly purplish blue (until fading to yellow after two weeks). \n\nAlso, a fresh bruise might be swollen, but not fading to different colours, while an old bruise might be different colours, but not swollen. I wouldn't think any bruise would be both of those things at any given time. \n\nAll in all, in the first point, this person is arguing from anecdotal evidence as well as false assumptions about provable facts. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not saying she's not lying 
11	DEATH TO FALSE FLAGS!
27	The broken nose part is weird for an INTP. He's like saying "you can't heal a broken nose in 5 days, and in those photos 5 days apart your nose looks exactly the same" like no shit, if a nose is broken, it does look about the same in 5 days.
9	Wasn't the guy who did the investigation wrong and forced to apologise?
3	INTJ more like it
3	INTJ probably, I'd be too lazy to write all that shit and would have just written fake
4	Just a tip: Never intervene in third party encounters. If it is a couple's situation, you will probably get fucked even worse, sometimes by both of them. 
2	Never thought I'd see the day that r/pussypassdenied leaked into INTP
1	The last part is stupid.
1	Oh, this is awesome. I hate it when people say we have too much time on our hands, this is the kind of stuff I live for
1	"Nobody would lie about a thing like X."...says the person who is apparently too sheltered to have encountered...ya know...other humans.    Seriously surprised "Nobody would lie about a thing like X" isn't a meme...or a massive, all pervasive meme.
1	This text is the abstract example of waste of time. 
0	TL;DR: if it wears makeup, it's a lying hustler trying to manipulate you.
0	"I'm sorry, but I don't think..." <pause>\n\nWROTE NO INTP EVER!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!1. time 2. all the more damning 3. time 4. valid scope of disclosure 5. a question is not evidence 6. appeal to authority 7. appeal to ignorance!<
7	I'm an INTP who doesn't have autism/aspergers	Just wondering if there's anymore. 
12	...... not sure if you're trolling or what 🤔 😆
5	As far as I'm aware I don't. lol(although I'm sure a lot of people think I do)
3	I was thinking about, little while ago: I bet there are tons of people diagnosed with Asperger's when they're really just INT\_s.  Ive heard it's actually surprisingly common.\n\nHeck, when I was having an identity crisis, I suspected myself to be autistic; though I didnt fit the symptoms.\n\n(Learning about MBTI and finding out im INTP completely killed that crisis.  Brought me out of a couple year long depression.  It's a blessing.)
2	Congratulations. 
2	Unsure which is more socially debilitating.
2	Vaccines almost got um boys.
1	Why not?
1	Lol most aren't on the spectrum. 
1	Nope, not possible im afraid, sorry
1	I've never been diagnosed, but I have a friend who has and she's convinced I'm non normative.  I can't seem to convince her I'm just intp (she's intj).  \n\nWe have the best conversations.

16	Anyone else find themselves constantly disregarding advice they've asked for?	I find myself in this situation alot. For example, I was having trouble with my course load this semester and thought it might be best to drop a class, but I wasn't sure if I was just choosing the "nuclear option"...er...more of a "mini-nuke option" I guess.\n\nAnyways, I asked my girlfriend of 4 years (shes INFJ) what she thought about it. She acknowledged that my idea was a way to do it, but advised that I buckle down and push through it. I then proceeded to drop the course a week later because I didn't really put effort into buckling down.\n\nMy theory is that I ask for advice wanting the other person to approve of my decision, but when they don't agree 100%, I make a half assed effort to follow their differing advice for a short while because I don't want them to think I didn't value their opinion. But then I just do what I planned to in the first place. It doesn't always work out for me in the end, yet I still do this constantly. Maybe it is an overwhelming desire to think for myself that causes me to do this? I dont know...\n\nJust wondering if any other INTPs have this habit or if it is something I've picked up along the way.
13	The real question is, why ask if you already know the answer? And the real answer is that you are just looking for validation from others in your decision. 
6	Happens all the time. I always have these fantastic brilliant ideas for projects or the future and I excitedly tell my wife, ISFJ, and ask her what she thinks and she always goes “It will be hard” or “how will you have the time” and things like that. Then I get internally upset, because I had already though about that and worked out a plan and also because I think I asking her, my most trusted person, isn’t to get a second opinion on the logistics of the matter but for validation that yes it is a good idea and that I am so clever. Which now I say it sounds very egotistical and needy. But if she doesn’t get as excited as me I lose all motivation. So nowadays I just start things and don’t tell her. As long as it doesn’t cost money of course. Still get side tracked and move on to other stuff though. 
2	It's common to ask for advice in order to seek approval, but the part about pretending to follow it is just your own personal habit. It's more common for someone who disregards advice to not follow it at all. The way you behave seems like you are insecure and self-conscious.
1	I don't follow blindly any advice, but I ask it to receive feedback on the thing in progress. Sometimes another point of view can open your eyes, other times it won't, but it's better to take it as a data point to consider.
3	What's your favourite place for MBTI tests?	I always have the urge to redo it once in a while since I don't always feel like it's right. Most of the time I use 16personalities bc they've got a nice interface (and it turns out to be INTP) but I once did it on a different site and the result is different. Do you guys experience the same thing too? 
7	No. Answers are bound to become biased as you retake any test. 
2	Tests are far from the best way to go about typing yourself. It’s a useful tool in the introductory phase in so far as ballparking what your type might be, but it’s not something you should rely on if you intend to go further into understanding yourself.\n\n\nThe best way is to learn about the 8 cognitive functions and all the other concepts associated with them, and type yourself based on your understanding of them. Of course this means that you’re not exactly an authority on the matter making it likely for mistypes to happen, but just remain open to the possibility that you could be any type and keep reevaluating yourself until you are confident that you have decided on your correct type.\n\n\nThere are a myriad of sources for this stuff online and even a bunch of YT channels that cover it, so research will be easy. Your flair indicates that you’re stuck between INTP and INFP, so I would focus on determining the difference between the Ti+Fe functions (INTP) and the Fi+Te functions (INFP) once you learn about the nature of each function.\n\n
218	The worst thing you can say to an INTP?	I'll start:\n\n"Your observations aren't valuable, interesting, new, or even logical." 
432	"Because I said so" 
129	“You don’t know what you’re doing. You can’t do it. Your ideas aren’t practical/worth anything.\n\nEspecially when I haven’t even tested out all of the possibilities I have.
84	"From now on you're eternally condemned to researching an extremely vapid topic using wildly inaccurate methods, mostly involving interviewing people who have no idea what they’re talking about."\n\nI tell it to every INTP I meet ;p
82	"Listen to what I mean, not what I say."
90	"You don't actually want to fix the problem."  \n\n\n"Because I said so."
116	You will be graded on how well you followed the rubric 
136	To an INTP who loves you: anything devaluing and insulting his/her INTP-super loyalty and/or love. \n\nIt's a spell so simple and so powerful, that it could break the super-loyalty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn INTP's love and loyalty is like their most prized and valuable possession, that they give to you.  If you mock it, throw it away, destroy it, etc, the INTP might just destroy the world.
76	Accusations of selfish motives.\n\n\nEventually I sarcastically admit to it. Like yeah I'm doing the cutting because I wanted the biggest piece for myself. Sure, that's it. Now see if I'll ever lift a finger for you again.
76	"Let's go around the room and talk about our feelings."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Your stuff was a mess, so I organized it for you!" 
95	"You're entitled to your opinion."\n\nWell, yeah, that was kind of a given, but my long-winded discourse was meant to demonstrate that my argument is not just an opinion. Why not just say, "I don't feel like defending / can't defend my own position right now. Can we please change the subject?"
65	“You should be more social.”
22	“But I’m the boss.”
66	"Because this is the way we've always done it."
21	"Why are you so quiet?"\n\n
19	"Your merit will not be based on the quality of your work, but how loudly you talk about it"
21	“You have so much potential but you don’t do anything with it”\n
40	The internet is broken.
18	“I’ll be over in ten minutes”
17	"How do you feel?"
47	"You don't actually care about me."
13	"Welcome to your new job as an air steward"
14	*You're a creep.*\n\n\nOh, I'm so sorry. I was trying, albeit struggling, to show some effort resembling that of caring towards you? Now excuse me, while I unpack these cans of apathy so that even when you die in front of me, I'll just shrug and even be annoyed by a dead body within close proximity to me.
29	"Why do you have to be right about everything?"
29	She said, and I quote:  "You know Mike, you don't need to understand EVERYTHING."
28	Whan you argue woth someone and use actual arguments, but they just insult you and think they won. Nothing more infuriating 
13	"You're very self centered and narcissistic" 
13	"Cool." After you've extensively expressed your interest in a topic. 
33	‘Because I said so’ makes me want to repeatedly stab the person in the neck with a screwdriver.
11	"I feel like... so that's why we are doing it this way."
10	"You have very little depth to you"\n\n"You're close-minded"\n\n"You're judgmental"
9	Let’s break into small groups
20	Just don't try to bullshit us, because we will pick up on it in record timing.
8	"How are you"
8	"It works this way just because it does. Take my word for it."\n\nI mean, are you trying to kill me? 
8	Tell them to do something that they are already about to do. 
7	Authority should be respected with no questions whatsoever. \n\nI struggle with the concept of authority - when the authority of a certain person or thing is not deserved or clarified. Tell me why should I respect you and if you don't have a valid reason, there's no respect to be given from me.
5	"You know nothing", when discussing some susbject the person who says this is deeply biased in.
7	"Science isn't always right. Some things, you have to believe." 
4	Shut up, you're stupid.
5	"Because that's how it's done."
6	Damn, you have gotten worse at *insert thing here*\n\nLike fuck off aight
5	"Show your work" or "Explain how you solved the problem" at school.
6	“Everybody has an opinion” - my mom 
13	Ohohoh, my sweet, summer child. When I read your title, so many horrifying and subjectively offensive things came to mind. *And then* I saw your example.\n\nWithout a shred of irony, sarcasm or any intention remotely close to that, I'd damn near *smile* if someone said that to me. It means that they necessarily listened to my opinions, considered them and - here comes the winner - *they have better observations than I do, which I hope they are willing to share!*\n\nThings moreso along the lines of "You're right about what you said, but how could you say that?! That's so rude!" really piss me off.
20	[Insert gods, zodiacs, supersitions]
9	"you make a good argument, but homeopathy worked for my spastic colon"\n\n"You have to believe first, then it will make sense"\n\n"Okay you win. I can't argue with you anymore"\n\n"Oh well I have my beliefs and you have yours. Let's just agree to disagree"
4	I flew off the handle on someone when they said "who cares, I'll never use that information" (paraphrased) 
4	2 hour team meeting over lunch hour with a soft end, but you forgot to pack your lunch again, and no you can't duck out to get anything, but Hugh from Quality Assurance brought in a hot box of KFC for some reason, just for himself, sitting under the desk emanating greasy waves, and you skipped breakfast this morning again. Meanwhile they asked you to *present* a report for this one, at 10am this morning, when no one knew this meeting was going to happen in the first place, but you've only got half the relevant data because you're still waiting for three coworkers in other departments to actually send you some of the missing information, and you've been waiting on them for three weeks regardless. And in order to get this presentation finished, you had to crunch all morning scouring through code notes that look like spaghetti that were written by a former college who since left the company three years ago and no one has been able to get in touch with.
5	«*I like what you say, but I don't always believe/trust you.*»\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDamn, that aunt hurt me deep when she left a debate about **science** saying this.

4	“Wait. You didn’t know that?”
4	"Lets agree to disagree."\n\n\nBut it's not an opinion, you are wrong.
3	“Not good enough.” 😔
3	When you say something very very deep based on some scientific research, (and you already kind of knew this, but still bothers you), and say it to someone, and they use the most primitive explanation ever possible from a human being, because you said something that broke their logical brain and they got back to animal part, to tell you how unimaginably stupid you are to say that.
3	Good for you 
3	**"Why are you so antisocial?"**\n\nSeveral months ago, (an ESFx?) somebody said that to me.  (He tries way too hard to be funny.)  I was already highly stressed, being in an extremely crowded room standing by myself.\n\nWhen he said that, my whole body jerked; like a fight-or-flight response or something.  Ive never experienced that before.  But I was enraged, and politely but with quite obvious anger, said "Im an introverted person.  I don't interact with people like you do.  (Cant remember the rest)."  He said "I was kidding! I was just kidding!", looked embarrassed, and walked off.  We havent spoke since.  \n\nKinda regret that, but I couldnt help it.  But he took things WAAAAY too far anyway.  Eventually, I was going to have to tell him that I dont appreciate that stuff.
3	All of my family members hate arguing with me because of my constant “Cause and Effect logic” as well as “moral logic” I use. And here’s the whammy:\n\n“You’re under my roof.”\nAnd\n“Stop trying to be logical about this.”\n

To which you think, "Oh, they must know something important that I don't."  Then almost before you can register the flash of the blade, they draw a dagger and slice off the anchor, rope and all.  As you're trying to figure out what just happened you stutter, "Du Du Dude?  What the actual f#$k?" They pull out your invaluable navigation tools; the compass, sextant, sun stone, looking glass, maps and star charts.  One by one, they throw them into the ocean, a slight giggle is heard after the first, and with each passing item the laughter becomes deeper, darker, and more maniacal.

As you begin to reassess the situation, you realize that all the navigational aids are gone and your water craft is slowly unraveling.  Standing in front of the mast looking up at the grinning corpse which has done so much to ensure your slow demise, you realize the raft was sabotaged when you were out.  Upon closer inspection, you notice that all of the bindings of the raft have been partially sliced through, making each wave feel like it will unravel your craft.  \n\nIn one last moment of disbelief you hurl your arms into the air as if to ask why, in this moment you smell something familiar, faint and distant, your mind wanders trying to place it.  Memories swirl through your mind; a scraped knee, a busted lip, an unexpected nosebleed.  As all the possibilities coalesce into reality, you fall to your knees, a sudden cough abruptly brings your mind to the present as you notice a red mist out of the bottom right corner of your vision.

2	Aderall treated my adhd how can i treat INTP?!	Its like doing the same things but more focused,\nLost in my thoughts but more focused,\nProcrastinating but more focused,\nDont give a f*cK about school but.... more focussed\n   
3	I am in the same situation. I recently was assessed and was prescribed Vyvanse- I knew this pill wasn’t the cure, but I expected more of a “set of tools” so to say. It increases my attentiveness, but for motivation? Not at all. I still neglect my school work to pursue my interests, focus is still pointed inward, and everything that needs to be done remains still unfinished. What I THINK, is maybe my level of maturity, I have these tools, but not quite the compendency to properly utilize them. \n\nThe main self-problem I’m focussing on now is a big tenant in Peterson’s philosophy; “Do not do what is expedient, do what is meaningful” I fantasize myself as a professor, teaching students, delving into abstractions within abstractions, yet I do not do the work that is required to reach that goal; I leave it in the air, “When I’m older I’ll learn how to properly prioritize” “I know this is a problem now, but I’m sure after a few years I’ll outgrow it” “No need to worry, when you’re 30 everything will fall into place”- I currently do not have a solution, ironic, but I do hope it will come with time. Most of us on this Reddit page are most likely late teens/ early twenties, just know that whatever you’re going through, a good percentage of us too have gone, or are going through it. 
2	Added all makes me feel like I’m on drugs (well because i am). And it makes me can’t sleep.  No go.  There is more focus but I can imagine it changing my brain after prolonged use.  Going the hard route with behavioral and habit changes

1	My best advise is try some physical activity’s, run a mile everyday,  try to turn your mind energy into physical energy. I don’t know how your school system is, but I talked to my councilor and got physical education as my first period, and it really helped me in high school. I hope you find your solution.

5	Do you believe mental illness and personality type are connected?	I've wondered this as both my father and I (found on the Spectrum as High Functioning Autistics) are both INT- I'm P he's J. I've noticed our behaviors are similar to what I can assume to be mentally healthy people who also are to fall under INTP. Mind you my mother is ESTP and has no history of mental illness, so I don't get this from her. (Still love you to death mom.) \n\nThoughts?
6	I think they are connected in the same way IQ and personality types are. In this sense IQ comes before personality, but people with high IQ are more likely to grow to be intuitive's. Now I don't actually know, but I'm assuming people on the spectrum, people who have aspergers, ect. are more likely to grow up and develop to be an certain types such as INTx's. My brother is an INTJ he has aspergers, and my Father is INT-J as well and he as aspergers too. As far as I know I don't have either, but lol.
5	Sometimes but not always. I'm INTP and although I've made a lot of autistic and Aspergers friends purely because we have things in common, outside of my lethargic depression I'm mentally healthy and my whole family is. 
2	plausible but if you mix cheerios and lucky charms are you eating cheerios or lucky charms or both? 
2	I've studied Jungian personality and enneagram quite extensively the last 2 years; I would say the symptomology and characterization of mental disorders of universal consensus via documents such as the DSM, are, if anything, scientific observations on the devolution and disintegration (and the various kinds of them) of the structures of the psyche as ascribed by these major schools of thought and even others, such as socionics, big five, etc. 
2	So! I’ve actually been very interested in this question for a while- I haven’t yet figured everything out, but I have some pieces that you may be able to stitch together.\n\nSo “mental illness” is a vague term, many behaviors could be seen as an illness, but like most things, it is multidimensional, meaning it falls on a spectrum. Imagine a bell curve, the interesting points are on either ends, the extremes. Mental illness, and whatever “it” encompasses, resides on the extreme emergence of behavior. What can be diagnosed is what is debilitating, meaning you and your father likely share behaviors of those with autism, but where you and he reside on the spectrum is short of extreme, hence why “High Functioning” was established (similar behaviors, but not debilitating to the point that it gravely hinders normal function).\n\nSo where does personality come into play? Personality is also multidimensional, there are genetic factors and environmental. Genetics predispose us to certain afflintites, abilities, and proclivities- INTP/J’s are predisposed for rational analysis, similar to how the mind of someone with Autism may think (do not glorify autism, most with that disorder are NOT geniuses). Rather than connected, I believe a better word would be *correlated*. INTP’s are more likely to have Personality Cluster A Disorders, the schizotypal type- Schizoid PD is something that comes to mind, and much of what is Schizoid can be confused with Aspergers/Autism. \n\nA side note- Mental Illness can affect anyone of any personality. It too has genetic and environmental factors. What I suppose is that the genes that code for personality has the possibility of predisposing you to a potential mental. An example, gene sequence 1-10 activate in the pattern of 7,8,10,6,9,5,1,3,2,4- this sequence results in the personality type INTP, however, because the result of INTP required the sequence to begin with 7,8,10, it also now predisposes the INTP to elicit behaviors classified as a disorder or illness, and the extreme of that behavior can be contrasted to lesser examples and diagnosed. \n\nAnd a caveat, this comes from my knowledge of Psychology, which is perpetually lacking, and from my own assumptions. I have a dissertation from a PhD student on Schizoid Personality Disorder I can send you if you’d like, it does cover some of what you’re asking, Jung and MBTI included too. I hope whatever I typed might help a theory in the making, and maybe even an answer. 
1	Yes. \n\nThats something iv'e really observed over different types, especially unhealthy ones. 
1	I Believe Mental illnesses can lead you to test or mistype as a certain type sometimes
5	How to recognize if somone is flirting or being nice?	
9	Tell them "Wow, you're so nice" and see if they change their behavior.
3	My rule of thumb is that it’s more likely to be flirting if that same behavior would be kinda weird coming from a sibling or member of the same sex (in the context that y’all aren’t gay). Also if that same behavior would seem sketchy if someone were doing it in front of their bf/gf. \n\nStill, you can’t know for sure. I’ve met some people who I’d consider to be full blown flirting, only to find out it’s their natural personality and they meant nothing by it... and then others who were super shy/reserved and admitted later on that they did like me, but in hindsight all they ever did was be friendly and present. It’s just a game of probability in the end. 
2	You flirt back, if they keep flirting with you then you up your flirt game until one person spills the beans.
1	The styles of flirting or being nice vary from person to person. Why dont you just flirt or be nice to a person without thinking if  they feel the same? What do YOU feel about them?  If you think this is impossible for you I believe you have to work on your fear of rejection. 
22	Do you have feeling that other people have too much physical contacts, like greetings and other dumb things?	
39	yes, but I'm also quite jealous of that closeness. I wish I knew how to casually nudge someones arm while we're having a conversation, or hug someone randomly just to show I care; all the ESFJs I know do that without even thinking about it and it just seems so nice and personable? sometimes I really I feel like I'm missing out on being a human being
4	For all of you people who fantasize about being cyborg husks running on logic and reason, have a listen to Metallica-Spite out the bone. Its somewhat on this topic.
5	Nope. Those are appropriate gestures of politeness and affection. 
2	Absolutely.
2	Nope.. I hug people all the time, i think is a nice greeting gesture.. 
2	No. On the contrary, I think modern humans in first-world society are largely suffering from a deficiency in physical contact with other humans, which is a basic need. 
2	I have a touchy friend, and I've mentioned to them that I dislike being touched (INTP reasons and HFA reasons). They hug everyone. Sweet kid but too touchy. I have resented walking my friend to their class as I almost physically recoil from the hugs. I've come to the middle ground of a one arm hug over the shoulder. But sometimes it's a full on run up, hug, spin, and lets me go mid-flight. It's a lot. And its commonplace at my school to be this touchy with your friends in the halls. Kids would have each other in headlocks walking to math and holding hands to history. I have no idea how people can touch each other for that long and not feel like they're being creepy, or a pest. 
1	The only time I care about that is if it’s happening to me or if the person receiving looks significantly uncomfortable. If two adults want to kiss every time they see each other that’s none of my business. 
1	No.
1	These are gestures to show the human being standing in front of you that you don't consider him to be a threat and are willing enough to share him a place at least in the outer circle of your in group.  \n
1	And that's why I like handshakes. If someone opens their arms to a hug, or suddenly approaches, quickly taking their hand while giving their eyes a quick glance asserts some space without creating too much distance. Not squeezing their hands (not trying to crush them) also shows some respect, instead of turning the action into some kind of stupid power struggle/competition.\n\nSome people feel awkward about being put down on their greeting, so they never do it again. And what is there to complain about hand shakes? It's practical. >!nevermind my hand fetish!<
1	How to befriend an INTJ?	Hello all, my roommate in college is an INTJ; really smart dude, could use a dash of color but beyond that I think he’s really interesting. How exactly do I make him my friend? We’re both very introverted, though we live together most nights go by without a word said, every now and then I blurt out something I’m thinking of to bounce off him, but he’s always disinterested and doesn’t offer any depth in his responses. We don’t necessarily dislike each other, but we also don’t necessarily like each other. Does anyone know how to interact with this type? I don’t want small talk, I honestly just want an intelligent wall to talk to every now and then 
6	"hey, you interest me. would you be interested in developing some kind of friendship?  I honestly just want an intelligent wall to talk to every now and then"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nvery efficient if you wish to be transparent
3	Come up with something meaningful and useful to do together. \n\nAll us NTs can be desperately guilty of this - not valuing friendship for friendship’s sake and only engaging in activities we can rationally determine as valuable. 
2	Vague but try to find common interests or ask about his life plan.. Hopefully you connect well and he thinks you of you as useful.. Nothing personal but if not stay patient.
2	You literally have to wait for him to ask you for feedback. They're very firm with what they want for themselves that penetrating that barrier would only do harm than good. Once they come to you for an opinion, be super honest and make sure you have a lengthy patience when they respond to your idea with something like, *"But according to this and that... so I don't think I would agree with you."*.\n\n\nTrust me. It's very infuriating getting shoved into the corner after giving your honest and thought-out opinions. That's just how they really are... as much as we do not immediately be trusting of what others think because it contradicts to how we interpreted it, ourselves.
1	Thinking about INTJ friends I have and INTJ responses I've seen here, I would say try find a third party to focus on rather than 1 on 1 conversation, such as a movie, TED talk, video game, or other people.  Find a situation where you can demonstrate your value (intelligence, creativity) in an indirect way.  Something else to get the ball rolling and before you know it you'll be locked in a deep conversation and BFFs.  An escape room comes to mind as an ideal situation but I'm not sure how realistic that is for you at your current position.
8	Understanding my INTP sister	Hello, I'm looking for advice on how to understand my sister. Last night she was talking about how her psychologist made her take different personality tests to help understand herself better, and in the Myers-Briggs type she qualified as INTP. I'm trying to wrap my head around that because I'm reading what I find online and they're described as logical, problem-solving, often considered unemotional. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this is my sister, the girl who SCREAMS at our other sister when she fails to "understand" something (usually a difference of opinion, or our younger sister is pointing out my sister's faulty thinking or how she's trying to get away with doing nothing at home). The same girl who won't go outside without being "properly" dressed and who gets embarrassed when her family behaves "abnormally" in public, aka dancing or making loud jokes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe says her friends call her logical and detached because she goes in search of solutions instead of comforting them for their problems, and she says she is often silent when she realizes the other person is voicing a problem that in fact seems stupid to her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know INTPs are NOT unemotional, but I'm trying to wrap my head around on what kind of logic you guys follow. To me it seems pretty straightforward - you like to know how A becomes Z, so that means understanding B, C, D etc. But then again she's fiercely loyal, even to people who would never bat an eye for her, and she gets overheated when a discussion doesn't go her way, and she says all decisions seem gray to her because nothing will truly be extreme, and she tends to imitate her peers to fit in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm an INFP myself, 25, and she's 19, if that helps. I'd just like to understand her better because I love her and want to help with her anxiety attacks. I've told her to tell me what I can do to help but she is silent on that respect, and she is very reserved on certain things. Do you have any advice?
9	Thing is, not all INTP’s are the same. Our behavior or under the hood functioning is similar in our cognitive function stack but have you ever heard of enneagram. I read some base INTP behavior in your post but also some behaviorial issues. Part of that is just who your sister is, she could also be clashing with other people in your family. The label itself is not indicative of the way a person will behave. It merely provides insight into a person’s thought process and their resultant. \n\nI’d recommend you look into the enneagram system and theorize what your sister’s type is and it will allow you to gain a better understanding of how to approach her. As of now, based on the way shes behaving there’s too many extrapolations of possible causes to her behavior just based on the INTP label alone. For the most part the “screaming” is really the abnormality here but it could be that maybe she feels cornered / threatened or frustrated that no one else can relate to her. \n\nEither way, if you want to know more and be there for your sister, my best advice is to just talk to her and really get to know her better. Psychoanalyzing someone will only get you so far and tbh it sounds like she needs someone to at least understand her. For me personally, I spent a lot of my early 20’s embroiled in the fact that no one “gets me” and spent a lot of years just too afraid to express myself because I was afraid of the negative interactions with others. Really, it was me in the end that needed to understand other’s better and most of my life turned around shortly after that.
8	My own take on this is that many younger INTPs insist that they have no emotions, which cannot be true. I have come to believe that what INTPs tend to lack when young is not emotions, but emotional regulation. I think that this occurs because we try to deal with emotions by thinking about them instead of by experiencing them.\n\nEveryone gets frustrated when other people do not share their beliefs, but to INTPs, our beliefs are not just beliefs, but facts that our rational minds have deduced. When people disagree, they are denying reality. When we get angry about it, our brains need to understand why they could be so wrong, and that just replays everyone over and over, making us angrier and angrier. \n\nHer statement that everything is shades of gray is typical for a 19-year old INTP, but I suspect that your experience is different. Our minds tell us that everything is gray when our conclusions are more black and white. I seriously doubt that anything can be done about that.\n\nINTPs often cannot just accept that others disagree. While most may see it as a difference of opinion, our young minds tend to see things as correct or wrong. The idea that we have wrong thoughts in our head is threatening, and when other people have wrong thoughts in their heads, we can have an urgent need to correct it for their own good.\n\nINTPs tend to be fiercely loyal as you describe, although it is a different kind of loyalty. We are loyal to our ideas, and that plays out as loyalty to people.  That does not change or diminish the fact that we are loyal to people, just serves to help understand it.\n\nAt 19, your sister is at what appears to the age of highest angst for INTPs. And oddly enough, at 25, you are right at the age where brain development is complete, and the medial prefrontal cortex takes over emotional regulation. That might make you feel farther apart from your sister.\n\nLooking back to when I was 19, I see a lot of myself in your description of your sister. I think that things that would have soothed me include showing respect for my intelligence and thinking, but it has to be genuine; unconditional acceptance so that I would not feel like my thoughts had to be right; and an exposure to mindfulness in general. \n\nYou mention a psychologist. I am way off the reservation here, but in my own experience, I have come to believe that traditional cognitive behavioral therapy is not really a good thing for INTPS. More cognitive thinking is not what I needed at least. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) on the other hand, changed my life. I have found that simply turning younger INTPs onto mindfulness will often make a difference. The best resource for mindfulness that I have found is the University of California San Diego. The general website is [https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/pages/default.aspx](https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/pages/default.aspx). There are mp3 files of exercises at [https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/programs/mbsr/Pages/audio.aspx](https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/programs/mbsr/Pages/audio.aspx).\n\nI was a train wreck at 19. Things started to change around 21 and were markedly better by 28, or so I thought. Then things completely changed by 35 and again at 45.  At every step along the way, I thought that I had arrived and would not change again.  Now that I am 54, I know that I am the final real me. So it goes.\n\nA lot of 19-year old INTPs, including me, feel like there is something wrong with them. We just don't fit, and we are certain that we never will. A few people I encountered made me feel like I was just fine, and those people made a huge difference in my life.
6	You seem to be describing an INTP, so what don't you understand? She still immature. I acted that way when I was young.\n\nThe only thing I don't think you're getting is how INTPs think. We don't care about getting from A to Z and certainly not by following points in linear fashion (b to c to d, etc.). We think big picture, out of order, and chaotically. There's a good chance that we aren't trying to get to Z at all because we know that K is the real solution anyway. We're thinking about F, I, and K all at once, and we use logic and intuition to solve the problem.\n\nPoint is, INTPs and INFPs are incredibly similar. We're private, loyal, deeply emotional, and hyperintuitive. Our biggest difference is that we make decisions and choices based on logical thinking instead of appropriate emotions like INFPs do. We try to disassociate from emotions when making decisions, and that doesn't always work (I.e. socializing).
6	Your sister and me seem share a lot of the same less desirable traits. \n\nThe “ rage quitting” when someone argues on an topic that is emotional for her. \n\nThe going silent when someone won’t stop sharing an idea that I find boring/ stupid. \n\nThe giving advice instead of comfort. \n\n\nThe thing is you have to remember your sister has just as many feelings as you do, she just prefers to solve problems with logic. INTPs tend to have lower emotional intelligence and with better problem solving/ reasoning abilities. To us we WANT to be helpful, we WANT to give good advice to people we care about, because we care we are giving what we think to be the best side of ourselves. We give our logic in the way you give your support, we are trying to do our best. \n\nIt’s hard for us ( especially when it’s a new problem) to accept that something might not be able to be solved by logic or maybe that the other person won’t attempt to solve it by logic. So when a problem in our own lives can’t really be solved by logic, or if the problem is with our own emotions it’s really hard to remain level and maybe blow up a bit. \n\n\n\nAs for the clinging to shitty friends and needing to be dressed a certain way, that’s insecurity and winner winner chicken dinner I can relate to that too. \nBeing a girl with low Fe people act like you are strange, also I’m sure as you know being an introvert yourself it’s hard to go up and introduce yourself. It will take time and effort on her part to grow her confidence. Yet again this will be hard for her because it deals directly with feelings. \n
4	This is going to be fun.\n\n>SCREAMS at our other sister when she fails to "understand" something \n\nINTPs are generally very good at understanding concepts and when they are younger they don't realise that other people can't do it as easily. Frustration at the stupidity of other people is pretty common amongst the xNTxs.\n\n>The same girl who won't go outside without being "properly" dressed and who gets embarrassed when her family behaves "abnormally" in public, aka dancing or making loud jokes.\n\nThis is anxiety. Also fairly common amongst XNTPs.\n\n>goes in search of solutions instead of comforting them for their problems\n\nComforting may feel nice, but it doesn't actually change anything\n\n>she says she is often silent when she realizes the other person is voicing a problem that in fact seems stupid to her\n\nOne person can't cure all the stupidity in the world and sometimes we're just tired so we ignore it.\n\n>you like to know how A becomes Z, so that means understanding B, C, D etc.\n\nLogic is much more complicated than that. Instead of letters from one language imagine an infinite number of letters and numbers that are all connected to each other. (xNTPs like to find the connections between all of these even if it's nearly impossible to finish. Its just fun.\n\n>she gets overheated when a discussion doesn't go her way\n\nIt is often hard to put into words what we know in our brain and I imagine its a skill she will learn to develop\n\n>she tends to imitate her peers to fit in.\n\nAgain, anxiety.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask :)\n\nHope I helped you understand your sister.\n\n&#x200B;
3	INTPs aren't completely unemotional but they need a bit of help to understand emotions.  \n\nInstead of just stating  the emotion, try giving a cause-effect explanation for any emotions you're trying to convey.  This will start to build an internal checklist of things to look for and consider when she 'calculates' future emotions
3	She sounds like an INTP to me. Shes a weirdo like us but just doesn't want to broadcast it. Shes a teenager lol. We tend to get pissed when people dont see the things we see, which could explain her going off on her sister. I'm usually just dismissive (fine, whatever, i don't care) when someone doesnt notice the things but its her sister so she wants her to pick up the patterns she sees so it frustrates her. Shes probably just more detached from her friends because she doesnt care what they think as much.
2	Not all of those things are considered INTP things but those are the actions of are typical of some INTPs, it’s important to understand that the system is not a one size fits all but yeah an INTP can be described as a logical person with emotional inner workings for things such as trust and self awareness 
1	An INTP surrounded by stupid people trying to understand their problems is like an 8 foot tall person trying to get into an airplane seat.  \n\nThey are hoing to get irritable and be very upset when you can’t or won’t listen to them and they’re eventually just gonna get off the plane because its not working
1	damn, it's like you just described me exactly. I thought I was super emotional for an intp but I guess it's not that uncommon. I'm trying not to be so immature and dramatic but yeah, that's definitely how I act around my family
1	INTPs live in their heads for the most part and yes tend to be unemotional to a point. We applaud ourselves on our analytical abilities.\n\nHer screaming at her sister? Imagine for a moment how you would feel if someone told you that you are not good at something you are proud of. That is why she reacts badly.\n\nOur unemotionality covers both her looking for solutions and her shutting down. It is normally a matter of "I don't see why you are getting so upset"\n\nThe embarrassment is probably from what she sees as the family acting illogically.\n\nThe clothes I would say is just a quirk that is her own
1	Sounds like autism spectrum? \n\nI was also surprised to learn she's 19. I figured 13-14 based on her behavior
1	As a 20 yo INTP, your sister sounds a lot like me.\n\n\nINTPs can get weird about some things. I'm also especially sensitive to how we behave, and if it's not "appropriate" I get really uncomfortable. It's inferior Fe.
1	When it comes to INTP female, you need to remove your bias that female is more emotional. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister was just like me when I was 14\~16. INTPs are proud of their intelligence. So, number 1 rule is not to give any statement, "That is just stupid/You're so stupid/Because I said so." You are violating the 1 thing that is sacred for INTP, our intelligence and logical brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring my teenage years, I just didn't see how people cannot catch up my train of thought. Especially my sister, I didn't scream at her, but when we were having a conversation, I really really didn't like to repeat my explanation. Let's say, we talk about A-B-C, my mind already traveled to F, because easier for INTP brain to find pattern and relations. Our brain just like tentacles spreading all over directions. But my sister still stuck on C. So, I need to backtrack to C, and taught her step by step through D, E, and reaching F. And worse, I needed to do it twice. Do you know how annoying it is to repeatedly explaining something? When my mind already move to another direction. This is where the frustration came, and the feeling of "No one understand me." \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then, we don't recognize it as feeling. So, we normalize it with our logic and push it deeper. Try doing that few times, you're going to reach the boiling point. And not knowing how to act on it, INTP will lash out. I did, and hurt my mom's feeling. Even until now, when I looked back my teenage years, I still felt so terrible. But the best thing about my family is that we stick together no matter what. Somehow, it seeped in my brain that family is a safe place to fall. Because, face it, you're family, you're bonded for life. This alter my perception, and change the way I express my feeling. So, for me, it needs conscious effort to say how I feel in a civilized manner, before it spill over and I lash out on everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is also why I told my sister, if you have problems, you don't come to me. Instead of listening, I will try to give you solution. Just like normal men's behavior whenever women wants to complain or just need someone to listen to them. She goes to my mother then. Problem solved. But then, she do recognize my ability to be objective and offer her a workable solution. So sometimes, after she finished call with my mom, she would call me to get solution. So, it's working great, and she has best of both worlds, a listener + a problem solver.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think it's right to say that INTP is not emotional. We do feel emotions, even sometimes more strongly than some other people. What we lack is the ability to act on it (put word to it), or as someone say here, "emotional regulation". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd regarding the need to be properly dressed when going outside, or gets embarrassed when someone in family doing something stupid. Well, she's 19 and still in school, where they have their own definition of cool. It's just a normal stuff all teenagers going through, the yearning to be cool/popular, but at the same time, knowing deep down inside that it's a stupid thing to do. But she's still lack of confidence to go through her own way, so she conforms to the norm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne way that I find out helpful to "regulate" my emotions is by writing. Because then I can put some words to whatever it is that going through my mind and my heart, and try to find the balance between the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther thing that I find out helpful is the "non-judgement" and just understanding from my mom. Gosh, now, my eyes start to sting. She just gave me space without any comments, not even tried poking at my emotions and why I lashed out earlier. Often after me lashing out, I would cry myself to sleep, and the next day, her simple question of what I want for breakfast, just break the ice for me. It's just a simple gesture really, like my brother messing with my hair or my sister buying me chocolate, that let me know they are OK with my emotional outburst and it is not the end of the world. I do feel embarrassed about it though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it was during college when I found out I am INTP and that I have weakness of processing emotions and that is OK. Also I lived in a dormitory with tens of girls that made me have role models of how to handle emotions. After graduation and living on my own abroad, then I realize I can only depend on myself to handle my emotions so that I don't lash out on other people. Although it doesn't hurt to know that I have a safe place which is my family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPs: You're a great brother. 
1	Hero Ti\n\nParent Ne\n\nChild Si\n\nInferior Fe\n\nNemesis Te\n\nCritical Ni\n\nTrickster Se\n\nDemon Fi\n\nHere is my interpretation of your description. In my opinion she does display the traits of an INTP.  INTP emotions are usually  intense or underwhelming. When they appear they will appear very child like this includes positive and negative emotions. INTP's tend to want to share their thoughts with people they care about and believe to be ill-informed(Nemesis Te). However, they have also tend to have a short fuse for incompetence or people who do not learn quickly. This usually the sign of an immature INTP.\n\nThe reason she is annoyed when the family does embarrassing things in public is due to inferior Fe. Fe is all about being aware of the collective groups values and maintaining social harmony. The personality types with inferior Fe will generally be afraid of making others feel bad or disrupting social harmony. They may also pay extra attention to it because it is their insecurity. They also might believe they are adept at utilizing the function, but in reality they are most likely not. Also the reason she dresses terribly is due to her trickster Se, she is not really aware of anything going on in the present or it takes extra energy for her to do so.\n\nShe is develops strong loyalty to particular things due to Si. She probably has positive experiences associated with said thing or she feels a strong sense of duty, thus loyalty ensues.\n\nBlending in with groups of people, is due to a combination of things. The desire to maintain social harmony comes from Fe, especially since it's inferior she will be afraid of disrupting that. Her Ne will allow her to see many perspectives and she will have strong collection of memories, due to Si, that will allow access memories of past experiences. She can systematize all the Ne, Se, and Fe information with Ti. This will allow her to emulate other people and blend in.\n\nIt might be hard for you to understand her fears regarding social harmony due to the fact that you have Parent Fi, in general you would be more aware of your emotional state as opposed to others.\n\nP.S. INTP personality types love to be acknowledged. Like if you got room of their highly esteemed peers to give a standing ovation for something they achieved, they would be smitten. They may not display joy on their face, but they will carry that memory with them for ever.\n\nSecond P.S. Ask her what she thinks, INTP like it when people value their thoughts. Hell I haven't read the comments yet, but I'm guessing the INTPs in this post are giving you a ton to read.
1	> But this is my sister, the girl who SCREAMS at our other sister when she fails to "understand" something (usually a difference of opinion, or our younger sister is pointing out my sister's faulty thinking or how she's trying to get away with doing nothing at home). The same girl who won't go outside without being "properly" dressed and who gets embarrassed when her family behaves "abnormally" in public, aka dancing or making loud jokes.\n​\n\nYou want to rant or to be helped ?\n\n> I know INTPs are NOT unemotional, but I'm trying to wrap my head around on what kind of logic you guys follow. To me it seems pretty straightforward - you like to know how A becomes Z, so that means understanding B, C, D etc. \n\nThis doesn't mean anything, typology wise\n\n> \n
1	studying autism aspies helps
0	She sounds like an INFJ to me, her judging your parents and you for ''abnormal social behavior'' seems like Fe Parent, not wanting to go out without being properly dressed seems like Se Inferior (it's an INTPs trickster, they don't care about it, she does) alongside you saying she's logical, which fits Ti child, and it's very rare to get someone wrong on the introversion side, so who knows; she seems like an INFJ from what little I've read
3	The Big Picture	
1	Am I mystiped?	
2	yes..  you *mistyped*
0	Astrology anyone?	If I bring it up, will the topic then fill the comment section with dislike over the topic?
1	MBTI is my preferred form of astrology. The thing about astrology is not so much that there is no evidence for it, but the question that even if it were true, how could we ever figure it out, seeing that we are subject to it.
1	Probably, which is funny because it's no different than the Enneagram bullshit that people eat up around here. MBTI is a step up but still falls short of modern psychology. Too bad there aren't really subreddits for IPIP response percentiles.
1	Yes man. All in. 
1	To an extent.  I'm on the Pisces-Aries cusp with moon in Aquarius and it's pretty accurate up to that point, but full natal charts are as bullshit as the entire function theory (even more so, if that's possible).  My first two functions do a fine job of describing me, the third and fourth are a bit more dubious, then it just kind of goes off the deep end as it gets into axes, loops, grips, et. al.
1	I'm more like cosmology guy
1	I personally am a Cancer sun and  Sagittarius Moon. Also amusingly enough when I do my tests I'm 2% from being an INFP ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
0	Yes
1	Flatterers, Grovelers, and Unnaturally Friendly People	Twice in my working life, I've ended up with two co-workers who fit the titular description (one a confirmed ESFJ)--they flatter, they grovel, they excessively rain down compliments over everyone, they'll thank you a minimum of twice for even the most menial favors, and apologize no less than 75 times for the slightest inconveniences, approaching you like frightened prey while doing so. \n\nLest you're picturing some trembling sadsack with no confidence, picture instead the real life version of Ned Flanders, only without the charming naivete.\n\nThese people are absolutely caustic to me; I almost prefer working with rude curmudgeons than with these unnaturally upbeat colleagues.\n\nWhile I do enjoy naturally cheerful people, and a well delivered line of encouragement is like a balm to my soul, these unnaturally cheerful souls make me crazy. Adding to that is the fact that I appear to be the only one around truly bothered by them. Everyone else either takes them in stride, or  adores them and laps their flattery up. \n\nOne theory I have regarding these folks is that they always seem to target me as a "project" that needs their brand of "cheering up," so they're here to save the day... and I resent the crap out of that. \n\nAnyone else face some similar feelings? Any advice?\n\nEDIT: By "unnaturally friendly," I don't mean friendliness that might not come naturally to someone, and they might have to hone that skill  through discipline and practice (e.g. someone who has learned the art of small talk so as not to appear so cold); I mean friendliness that is excessive and above what is deemed standard and acceptable (e.g. someone who is practically moved to tears over how awesome they think you are for your choice in peanut butter).
3	Haha we have one at our office. It doesn’t help that she is a cute short old lady with a loud cartoonish voice. I try to avoid her whenever I can. I am rarely in the mood for her “good morning”s in the afternoon or the same old small talk about each other’s clothes. She also  consistently “offers help” on her way out as she passes my office (we work in completely different departments so she couldn’t help anyway). I can see how she probably makes excellent first impressions and that her attitude could make her very successful in a front office setting or even entertainment but I find it excessive in a busy back-office environment. 
2	They bother me  2
2	I intensely dislike them.\n\nDo you want actual tips on how to deal with them? Or just polling the crowd on experiences and opinions?
1	I really enjoy being friendly for no reason (within the capacity of my limited social battery of course) and complimenting and boosting people up a lot. I actually wish more people would know I’m being serious. I don’t apologize a lot though. 
1	I must have not been paying attention when they set the acceptable standards for being friendly. Life's a bitch when people are who they are instead of who they should be.
3	unpopular opinion - most gaslighting is overestimation of ones perception	peoples senses are prone to failure, so is storage, so is context and the memory corrupts in time, or even right when its recalled due to context.  \ni think most people really misjudge how unreliable memory and perception is.   \npersonally i always focus on values not specific words. and conclusions rather than process.
3	I think people, particularly stupid people who've been awarded power beyond their character, have a tendency to greatly overestimate their perceptive abilities. It's not that they've forgotten things, they literally lack the intellectual ability to perceive all the details necessary to draw a meaningful conclusion, but they do so anyway and then viciously defend their conclusion.
3	Gaslighting is another one of those words that has become inflated and misused. A few years ago, nobody had heard it, let alone knew what it meant. People forget that gaslighting is an intentional form of abuse, often used to undermine prisoners of war psychologically. It does not encompass people simply remember things differently (or poorly), which is universal.
1	Causation isn't the same as correlation. imo.
1	Memories change Everytime they are accessed. Values are judgments based on flawed memories. You seem to claiming objectivity in a reality that exists only in your mind.
1	There is rationalism and empiricism.  Foundational parts of philosophy.\n\nRationalism can fail because we can have errors in our reason.\n\nEmpiricism can fail because our senses can be deceived. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidenote: people tend to be weighted more towards one side, either (little r) rationalism or (little e) empiricism.  We iNtuitives are weighted more rational; Sensors are weighted more empirical. 
1	Your posts are overestimation of your perception.
6	INTP in College Social Life	Was always afraid of having a boring college experience and not having friends, so I joined greek life. Doesn't seem like a common thing for INTP's to do. Anyone else go out of their comfort zone to get a better social life? No regrets, on my part. I'm graduating and while I had to put up with social pressures, some anxiety from archaic social expectations, etc... I think getting out of the house (or dorm) to interact with people was well worth it. Definitely feel more fulfilled when I have the chance to socialize despite preferring to spend most of my time alone. 
5	Well fraternities don't exist where i'm from but I can assure you that during the first weeks of college I acted as an ENTJ and spent way to much time at parties and getting involved in other sort of activities.\n\nI believe it was well worth it, since it was during that time I met most of my current friends. \n\nSince then i've returned to my INTP self and have spent more time at home. \n
3	I was in a fraternity at a large party school.  I wouldn’t recommend doing it because you will always feel out of place and it’s expensive.  Yes, you might fit in better with a smaller fraternity, but the cons with smaller fraternities are not worth dealing with.
3	I joined a fraternity.\n\nDidn’t much care for it at first because the older guys were retarded pricks however we got some cooler people and grew much larger after I became an upper classman.\n\nDon’t fall for the bait.  College is 100% about you getting a top tier major (Stem, medicine, law, etc).  It has been co-opted by the government to turn it into a 50k dollar vacation for idiots to turn them into debt and wage slaves.  But if you get your useful degree as your top priority, you can still have some fun too.\n\nI liked how being Greek forced me to keep up a minimum of socializing.  Its not for everyone but its great if you know how to use it 
2	Congratulations on making that decision and keeping it. I made a big leap near the end of college, and surprisingly I survived just as you did. In the end, we have to make our peace with the rest of the world and find a way to be part of it. It sounds like you were precocious and jumped while others like me were still coming up with reasons not to. I think that you will find your brave decision to be beneficial for the rest of your life.
2	Yep. My college self is why I am still unsure whether or not I’m actually an ENTP. I was a big time social butterfly. Multiple social groups to hang with, partying twice a week. People saying that they met me because I randomly started talking to them like I knew them. Friends both in my dorm and in most of my classes. One person was walking with me and in the span of five minutes, probably ten people greeted me in passing to which she said, “Wow, you know EVERYONE, it’s almost disgusting” \n\nBut after leaving that scene and dealing with a year long bout of depression, I was totally isolated. And I’m past the depression now, but I’ve lost all desire to socialize and now I get the annoying “You don’t talk much, do you?” comments. 
1	Yeah its called the internet, yw :)
2	Are you people have bad handwrite?	
4	Yes, my handwriting is usually messy, hard to read . Though, I can write in a calligraphic manner if I want to.
7	yes my handwriting is messy and not beautiful lol!
5	Does the Pope fuck little kids?
5	Me: *writes paper that should be more than enough for an A* \n  \nTeacher: *couldn't read it because of bad handwriting*  **F**
3	Mine is messy, but I can right pretty **ok.** I prefer not to, as it takes me like 3x as long though.
2	Yes thanks to being forced to switch handedness because of a medical condition
2	I have bad good handwriting. All characters are unambiguous\n(7 is barred, 1 has a serif, Y has a vertical line), but they won't all\nbe the same size or within the lines.
1	My penmanship has probably gotten compliments well into the double digits by now, to the point where I literally expect people to comment on it whenever I write on the whiteboard. Might be due to my smaller hands. I’m also alright at drawing. 
1	Nope, I have good and clear hand write, courtesy of my parents who used to check my note books daily and scolded me if they cannot read my writing.
0	need advice on an intp --warning long	Hi guys,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo female INFJ here in desperate need of some advice on how to go about this situation with an INTP. Background/relevant info: I am pretty attractive girl -trying to be modest, but also honest. I am in a top grad school for physics and personality wise-I don't suck ..I think. Anyways, I meet a boy, also very attractive, studying stats at the same grad school as me and he's INTP. Short and sweet: instant connection, got intimate quickly, but had a fiery crash and burn.. he one day had an emotional freak out that completely blind sided me. I was trying to reason with him about it, but he was just being very unreasonable and SO cold. he basically said he's not emotionally ready for a relationship, to which I responded that's fine we can just be friends, and that's when he said he was not interested in getting to know me. Mind you, the day before we are hanging out and everything was fine. I kinda went off at this.. admittedly, I was pretty hurt and said some things out of anger/sadness I really should not have because of what I found out next.. In response to my lash out to his lash out, he says he's dropping out of grad school... and that's when I knew something was really up that he wasn't telling me. But of course, instead of doing the normal human thing and ghosting the dude that just savagely ended things with me, I bombarded him with messages because I'm closet psycho.. no not really.. just felt really guilty that I was mean to him when he was going through something and I didn't initially pick up on it.. So I apologized profusely but shit just kept hitting the fan every time I tried to do so/get him to tell me what was going on.. yea, retrospect is a brat, I definitely made it worse.. so eventually he just blocked me (on everything but insta- he unfollowed me on that) all together.. yikes yikes yikes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was 9 months ago. He doesn't go to grad school with me any more.. and maybe I am crazy because I have not forgotten about him. Maybe i just still feel guilty idk. I've tried reaching out to him on insta about 3 months after... no response. then tried again two months later.. no response. The odd thing is, the latter time I tried to follow him on it (because I unfollowed too back then).. and he rejected my follow request.. but then immediately made his account public.. so I just followed him normally and messaged him.. no response, but did not block me either.. I stayed following him for about two weeks.. but I just felt weird doing so because I didn't want him to think I was some stalker chick lol so I unfollowed again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow it's been four months since I last tried to reach out. and we weren't even together that long but little things I see remind me of him and make me wish that he was still around. i almost want to reach back out and try again, but i have been resisting the urge to do because i think it would be creepy considering the ratio of time that we were together and the time that has passed. i just really want to know he's okay now tho. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry for the novel. if you guys have any advice, i thank you in advance !!
3	He seems pretty adamant about not wanting to talk to you. I’d back off and let him have his own space. If he wants to reconnect with you in the future so be it, but I would chill on contacting him again every few months.
2	First, you should know that you have single-handedly doubled the number of wet dreams that will occur tonight.  Good looking, personality and a graduate student at a top graduate school in Physics. Talk about a pink unicorn. All of us are envious of him and volunteer to replace him. Well, not me, I am happily married. But I digress. \n\nThe things you describe remind me of myself when I was younger. A lot of younger INTPs deny their emotions and do everything they can to suppress them. Emotions, however, will not be suppressed, and when we try, they come back more powerfully. If we have not learned to regulate our emotions, which many of us haven't at that age, they will wash over us and do whatever they want. \n\nIf you two became intimate quickly and he found himself in unknown territory, then he probably would run back to safety. His statement that he was not ready for a relationship is something that I have said when I really wanted a relationship with someone but was terrified of the idea. \n\nI also think that when INTPs are hurt, we can hang onto it for a long time. We keep trying to figure out why were hurt, which just replays everything over again in our minds and reignites the hurt. I have brooded over things for years. \n\nA lot of people would say to just drop it and move on, but you seem to have feelings for him, and he seems to have had feelings for you in the past. As I see it, life is too short and we have too few chances to just let one slip away. You might want to consider what is the best way to let him know how you feel. I grew up with a constant fear of rejection, and when someone accepted me, it felt like it would only make the rejection worse when it came. I also was depressed all my life, and that just made matters worse, although I now think that a lot of it was emotional regulation.\n\nThinking back, I think that what would have reached me most effectively is to be told that someone missed me, that they were sad because I was gone. I hate to make people sad. I have said this a few other times, but you might be surprised at the effect of a handwritten letter.  Yes, people still do those. 
7	Toxic 'relationship' dynamics	Okay so I (20F) thought to post this first in INTP because I am one and I thought you guys could give me some logical, perhaps obscure reasoning to help me out with this. (also enneagram type 4 if it helps).\n\nWe're not even dating. Its a toxic relationship... He doesn't contact me for 3 days... I don't contact him for four next time. I'm a chameleon and I'll act the way you're acting to me... yet I feel like I'm *waiting* for him to show me he wants me, or give me some assertion that he wants me in some way - *any-way...* but I get nothing. It both draws me to him and drives me absolutely *Fucking* insane.\n\nPlease spare me the 'you deserve better' advice because It's going to take a lot more to crack this shell. I need sound logic. I almost 'thrive' of off this dynamic but I wish I could just block him out of my life and move on but the thought that he would probably let me and 'not care' more than I do makes me furious. He even told me he doesn't know what he wants which almost screams 'not entirely sure about you but feel indifferent to whatever happens' but I still want him. He remains the only guy I've felt a pinge of sexual attraction to. Up until him, every other guy almost repulsed me.\n\nThe one thing I cannot get over is this particular feeling he gives me. I doubt it is love. Its the feeling of 'never getting enough'. For example, I can think of him - but feel as if I never remember what it felt like when we were together. I always am chasing to 'relive' the reality of him that I cope with the anxieties of his avoidant behavior in between our catch ups. Just thinking of him makes me cry for reasons I don't even know and I doubt he even cares about me.\n\nAnd I can never seem to do anything right with him. Its like I get a spike of confidence, think I don't need him and then hours later I'm wondering if maybe he also wishes he could make it work but doesn't know how. I feel crazy just asking him about this so I keep a cool head on most of the time but I'm turbulent inside.\n\n... wow. I'm actually addicted to him. Gosh all I want is to experience him. Over and over but fuck I can't handle it. Help.\n\n\---------------------------------\n\nUpdate: I basically confronted him (over text) saying that I felt like i couldn't do anything right with him/ that i feel like we're playing ball/ that I wanted to know what he felt...\n\nDick left me on read.\n\nI don't know if that tells me more than it should... I feel like he's probably just fed up. Not to mention, this is after I didn't contact him for a few days and so its kindof like after I act completely disinterested im asking 'what are we' indirectly and I can see where the mixed mssg might come to play. I'm kinda done (as I've seeminly said a bunch of times).
5	Simple. You're playing games and not being true to yourself. You're trying to "punish" him for not contacting you by doing the same. The thing is, you're only hurting yourself. \n\nAll you have to do is be honest with your feelings and let him know. He will give you his response. 
6	Seems to me like you are torn between what your brain wants (love & him) and what your logical mind was (to not be in this relationship anymore). I dont have enough detail to give you an opinion regarding whether you should remain in this relationship or not, however all i can say is to stop playing games. No relationship succeeds like this.\n\nFrom the little information i can get about him (ignoring you to some extent, appearing as to not care about an eventual break up, avoidant behavior, cannot be pleased(?)), it would appear that he may be slightly "using" you. As other people said this is pretty similar to sociopatic behavior in relationships but i wont make any claims as i do not know enough. What im trying to say is, be careful of manipulation. Leaving you boiling alone, desiring him, is a textbook manipulation technique to maintain your interest in him.\n\nIf my assumptions are correct, this may not be his first relationship where he does this. Do you mind providing some additional information such as behavior patterns, how he acts when with your, how he acts in public and with other people, etc?
6	Sounds like you’re attracted to him but you’re also playing hard to get and getting burned by it. You’re playing games and then wondering why he’s playing games. I think you’re both being immature about it and also with your feelings. You’re practically dripping with the thought about being with him, then why don’t you just... be with him? \n\nWhen you’re tired of playing tag, why don’t you tell him to get some balls and lock you down. It sounds like you really need a good dicking from him anyways.
3	> We're not even dating. Its a toxic relationship... He doesn't contact me for 3 days... I don't contact him for four next time. I'm a chameleon and I'll act the way you're acting to me... yet I feel like I'm waiting for him to show me he wants me, or give me some assertion that he wants me in some way - any-way... but I get nothing. It both draws me to him and drives me absolutely Fucking insane.\n\nThat's not toxic... (Or can it be a toxic relationship if there's no relationship ?)\n\n> Please spare me the 'you deserve better' advice\n\nHaha, I wouldn't say that at all.\n\n> the thought that he would probably let me and 'not care' more than I do makes me furious.\n\nSooo, You just want to have the last word ?\n\n> I'm wondering if maybe he also wishes he could make it work but doesn't know how.\n\nIf my impression of you is right, he definitely wouldn't know how. Especially when you want to break off a relationship that didn't even start yet...\n\nLike, you've got some work to do, on yourself. Untangling that mess in your brain into something that make sense
5	I’m an INFJ but my F and T are only points apart. That being said, I’ll try to give you some ‘logic’ but more so through some reflective questions. \n\n-What are your values, and is your behavior and his behavior aligned with those values?\n-Do you think a person who doesn’t know what they want in life is going to be able to be available for you emotionally and available to fulfill your needs in a consistent manner? And given that you’re a 4, you likely have a lot of feelings. \n-If you had to describe your relationship with him now, with one or two words, what would it/they be? Can you imagine feeling this same way years down the line? What is the trajectory of your life going to be be like with him?\n-He probably also gives you a dopamine hit, meaning that when you go days without talking you likely have low levels of dopamine and perhaps high cortisol if you’re stressed, but when you talk to him again, your brain starts releasing dopamine. You’re not so much addicted to him but the effect he has on you, or maybe better said, the effect you allow him to have on you. But I’m also thinking if it’s conditioning as well...but i haven’t fully developed that thought yet.\n-Feelings are fleeting, just because we feel something doesn’t make it true. If we base our life off of feelings we’re going to be a fucking rollercoaster. \n-Finally, my therapist always tells me to consider if I’m acting out of fear or love. Are you staying with him because of fear (maybe losing something) or out of love (love for yourself and for him)?\n\nIf you’re not receiving some type of professional help, such as therapy, I’d encourage you to look into it because these aren’t surface issues. There’s more below the surface. Just a thought. Best of luck!
2	You love this guy because women love the dark triad for evolutionary reasons.\n\nThe way sociopathy works is they give you everything at first so they can determine what you want, then they remove what you want and use it to control you.  My friend was a massive sociopath and told me that essentially verbatum.  I watched him do it again and again to dozens of young girls, like a machine.\n\nThey also tend to be very attractive like vampires, which is why Twylight was so popular with females.\n\nAs a 20 year old female you are literally the ideal prey for male sociopaths.  They will all come after you and you’ll just revel in it because attention is heroin to young females.
2	Yeesh--you've got some stuff you need to work out. \n\nNot only are you playing games with this guy and it's not working with him, but you're giving clear signals that you're trying to...what...absorb him? Those are two things unhealthy about YOU.\n\nYou really need to work on just being happy with your self and your own works.
2	I know that you want a logical answer, but your problem is not a logical one. At 20, I doubt that will make any sense to you. It would not have to me. \n\nThe fact that he does contact you after you disappear for 4 days suggests that he does care for you. He may or may not have romantic feelings, but when I was your age, I did not stay in touch with women unless I had romantic feelings. And there were a few for whom I had such strong romantic desire.  Who knows, they might have similar feelings for me. I will never know because I could not say anything until they gave me a sign. And when I thought they might have, I thought about it and convinced myself that it was too uncertain.\n\nThat sounds like you, but it may also be what he is going through. So it is entirely possible that you want him and he wants you, but neither of you will act. In 20 years you may meet up and discover your mutual feelings so that you can wonder about what might have been.\n\nIf you continue on your present course, it is hard to see how anything will change except that circumstances will separate you, and you will draft apart. In the meantime, your fixation on him most likely will hinder the formation of other relationships, leaving you stuck right where you are.\n\nSo let's look at this logically. You sound miserable, which I was at your age. Stuck. The cause of your misery is uncertainty about your relationship with him. If you knew that he had no interest in a serious relationship, then you might feel hurt, but you would recover and move on. If you learned that he did have interest in you, things might be great except for kicking yourself over waiting so long. If you do nothing, then you are completely controlled by what he does, and he does not even know that. \n\nWhat are the logical reasons not to express your interest?  Hmm. Well, if you do, then you might be hurt.  But you are hurting now, and it seems likely you will feel that pain at some time anyway. Doing nothing has no path to happiness. Doing something on the other hand, might accelerate your pain, or it might make you happy. I am not finding much logic here.\n\nThis is all very easy for me to say now. I was infatuated with a woman, but was too terrified to say anything. One night she asked me why I was looking at her funny, and no matter how much I dodged and weaved, she demanded an answer. I finally said, "I am having problems thinking of you as just a friend," and I thought "there, I finally said it." But she said that she did not understand what I meant and continued to torture me for an explanation. I finally said, "I want to ask you out, but don't know how to." I knew then that I was so dead. But she smiled and said, "You just did silly. And I feel the same way." We have been married 31 years.\n\nMy point is that it is OK to be vulnerable and even to lead with your vulnerability. It sure sounds to me like he probably has an interest in you but is too shy to say. It is so tempting to try to put him on the spot and make him state his interest, but that would not be fair. \n\nDo not look before you leap. Just jump.

1	Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away.
1	You sound so much like me.  I found some self-help stuff (Abraham Hicks) and learned to be happy without the dopamine rush from the guy I was obsessed with.  It's a struggle but getting better all the time
1	You could post something on social media with another guy or show that you don’t need him with a post with your friends. That would pressure him into making a decision. 🤷🏼‍♂️
3	INTPs, did you sneak out as a teen?	I did 2 or 3 times with my older siblings for ice cream at 3 AM. 
15	Why would I sneak out when the internet is already in my house?
7	I didn't give a fuck, I just did whatever. Parent's didn't really understand me so they didn't really question it. 
6	I think my parents liked it. "*Ohh look he's going to be social"* 😅
4	Quite a few times. My dad once caught me in the morning climbing up the ladder sneaking back into my bedroom window. 
3	Yea but mostly just to walk my dog in the middle of the night. Sometimes I just wanted to go for a walk and clear my head so I would just walk my dog. It pissed off my parents and poor Max was tired lol but I dont know how much it was "sneaking out." Got in trouble when I got home late usually though.
3	I did. I was doing Night Ops, and writing about it on Totse. 
2	Hells yes
2	Well, not teen, but as a toddler, but my grandma and parents told me stories about me simply grabbing my blanket and walking away from home in the middle of the night lol, quite far away sometimes, i dont remember any of it..
3	Habits and routine	How are you guys handling habits?   \nFrom generic stuff like washing your teeth when you get up to complex things like maintaining a daily/weekly/monthly routine.  \nI often find that I need to maintain a focus to be able to keep a habit (even brushing teeth). If I try to start a habit after a while it fades away. This can be trouble some, my colleagues easily adapt to a new repetitive thing we must do at work like filling some new form before submitting work. I'm all over the place usually! I don't even have a specific time I wake up, sometimes it's 5 in the morning ~~sometimes~~ most of the times it's 10 ((ish)ish) take or give on hour.  \nI don't even do entertainment in a routine fashion, each day I do something different, random and interesting.  \nThe only thing that makes me do something repeatedly is shame (of smelling for example, so I shower each morning) and fear of loosing my hair (so I apply a substance to it).   \n\n\nSo, what is your experience with habits and routines, can you keep them, do you enjoy them, do you run from them, do you get depressed when you have to do the same thing every time (like waking up at 7 each day)?
5	Up work home regret bed
3	I can keep them for awhile but they do take conscious effort. Like working out and my skin care routine. I enjoy both but I normally need to be reminded or encouraged to follow through. \n\nI normally can be easily convinced to stay in a routine tho if a friend does it with me. Other people keep me accountable best.
3	I try to make the habit or routine I'm trying to reinforce the easiest and most accessible option so that it doesn't take much effort at all to keep up
2	Depends on the simplicity, cognitively speaking. \n\nBrushing my teeth is easy enough that I can do it even when I’m tired or hungover. Making my bed became a habit after about forty days. Going to the gym is something I find intrinsically rewarding and have done for the past decade, so while I might procrastinate leaving for the gym for a few hours, I do still go. \n\nThe rest depends on my ADHD medication. For example, on medication, I’ve meditated for 10 - 20 minutes almost daily since around 2015, but the moment I take a break from my meds, those years of consistency don’t carry over and I have zero desire to even meditate for a minute. 
3	Does it bother anyone else when things are done wrong or in an efficient manner	Inefficient*
12	yes. I try not to let it bother me though. Humans are dumb
3	Yes. I'm a terrible teacher because I'll take the project into my own hands instead of letting the other person learn through experience. I have to remind myself to not be so bothered.
3	Way back in the day, nothing bothered me more.  It practically made my skin crawl to see people doing things wrong. Being in the car when my wife was parallel parking was pure torture. It is better now.  People still do the same stupid and wrong things, but I have finally accepted that it does not matter, and that my way is not necessarily the right way. \n\nMy life changed when I realized that they were not going to change, and I could either learn to calmly accept  that fact or be miserable all my life.
2	I'm inclined to say yes, but I have realized my frustration towards others' mistakes is based on my own sense of ego. Whenever I see incompetence in others, I validate my own abilities to mask my own insecurity. The opposite is also true, due to my self doubt, others' competence often does intimidate me because it makes me feel inadequate. In the end of the day, I try my best not to let others bother me because we all have to deal with our own limitations and utilize our own strengths. 
2	I used to work at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  They had a super inefficient system of dishwashing, where someone wiped the food out the dishes with paper towels, before sending them to the dishwasher worker.  And I was the sucker who did that pre-washing.\n\nSo the literal psychopath boss wanted me to take the dishes, in the totes, back to the dishwasher regardless of how many dishes were in it.  Even 1 plate.\n\nProblem there, is it took the washer a good 10 minutes to wash the totes.  And I was spamming her with totes, so we got backed-up with dishes really bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI developed a system so I would fill up a tote before sending it to the washer, and leftover dirty empty totes would be re-used by the waiters.  Less totes were being washed unnecessarily, and we were more efficient.\n\nSo control freak boss kept shouting at me, telling me to do it her way.  I usually ignored her, until one day I deceided it was time for some r/MaliciousCompliance.  I did it her way.  Exactly.  And we were so backed up, that we ran out of clean dishes.  Then she came screaming and hollering at me, telling me to go faster (when it was physically impossible to).  And she told me to do it her way, to which I said I was doing it her way.  She didnt believe me, because she thought she, WHO NEVER ONCE DID DISHES EVER, thought her made up system was infallible.  It infuriates me to this day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:  I worked at a restaurant.  Did dishes my own way, instead of the boss's inefficient way.  I did it her way, dirty dishes piled up, then blamed me for it when it was her fault.
2	I just assume I'm better than everyone so I simply accept that everyone is most likely going to do things badly and inefficiently
1	No, it doesn't bother me when things are done in an efficient manner.
1	I was quickly typing while doing a group assignment I meant inefficient 
2	Things I miss.	Totse.com. (the old one)\n\n
1	I miss you
1	StumbleUpon.\n\nMy Japan trip.\n\nThe wonder of True Detective S1 and S3.
22	Dolphins checking out squirrels	
5	I'm glad I live in an area where I can see dolphins in their natural environment. Amazing creatures.

34	How do other INTPs keep hobbies?	I want to be a writer, do parkour, and play D&D. But everything is too interesting, I just jump from concept to concept hourly. How do y'all keep focused on one thing, like a writing project? Forcing myself to do something daily helps, but I slack off. I'm beginning to annoying the hell out of myself because I see friends around me with accomplishments and years of one hobby and I'm here with nothing to show but vague trivia on several hundred subjects.\n\nTLDR: How do I focus on a project/hobby when everything's so fascinating? 
28	Think of focus not in hours or minutes but in months and years. Once I stopped worrying about sticking to some arbitrary timeline, and started focusing on what I wanted out of my hobby, everything seemed to click. It also helps my hobbies are singular so I don't have to rely on others for my enjoyment. I paint miniatures, collect magic cards, and practice digital photography to give you an idea. 
15	write dnd sessions about characters who parkour. gg.
4	Can't. I get into way too many things and get lost in it all. Can't focus my time effectively into anything in particular. Video game collecting, snowsports, blacksmithing, digital art, music production, tinkering with electronics, etc etc etc. I can't restrain myself and jump obsessively from thing to thing without ever deeply committing to any of them. Such an ADD mind.
3	Umm same? No idea. INTPs are just too easily distracted. Every time I try to take up a hobby I just kind of forget other things (I have on a few occasions passed out from forgetting to eat/drink). Try joining a club that meets a lot so that you can go to some of the meetings when youre free/remember. I joined an electrical team that builds an RC plane every year and I almost always end up going to 2 out of the 4 meetings every week because I often forget.
2	It just *very* slowly improves with time, lol.
2	I just go with the flow. They're hobbies for a reason and not your main thing. Enjoy it while it interests you. I have several unfinished projects that I return to from time to time. I've accepted I may never finish any of them. Lol its the journey that matters, not the destination. 
2	I'm not sure, there are a lot of hobbies I want to get back into like hiking and biking and rock climbing but for me a hobby doesn't become consistant until I either have a compelling reason to do it and clear consequences for not doing it. I recently became obsessed with learning how to trade the stock market since it could potentially mean not having to work years down the road. Like many things in my life it's either all or nothing, I either commit to it and it becomes the focal point of my life or it's just another though and idea to put on the list of things I should be doing. 
2	I feel your paaaainnn!!! There are too many interesting things to do in the world! Personally, I have been lucky enough to find one that I feel is my purpose in life and I always try to do that. Everything else revolves in and out of my life. But I always make sure to spend time every week on my main, most important activity. \n\nI've also learned to say "no" to things that would be awesome to do if I didn't have to work, sleep, and was immortal. These are all really good/ /fun/ worthwhile things but I always ask myself if it's progressing the most important thing in my life, or taking time away from it. Small, fun timewasters (like watching youtube or playing video games, or reading reddit) are one thing, but huge time commitments (like starting a youtube channel) are out.\n\nI just wish I lived forever!!!!  (ಥ\_ʖಥ)
1	umm just try anything you find interest. i have that kind of short-term obsession too but it usually disappear when i already try it.
1	Why do you want to be a writer, do parkour, and play D&D?  Or maybe the question is why do you want to master or excel in those fields?  It really sounds like deep down you don't want to be an expert in them.\n\n\n\nThe real problem is that you are comparing yourself to others.  The greatest strength of MBTI is that it demonstrates that every type has strengths and weaknesses.  You have strengths that your friends do not.  So don't be bothered if they have strengths that you don't.
1	I don't!\n\nWell, to be more clear:\n\nI have a D&D group that meets approximately every month or so. So, it's a fun thing to do with friends that has a prescribed time and date. I'm not the dungeon master, so there's nothing much there.\n\nWriting. Just write at your own tempo. Many famous writers don't get their first book published until later in their lives. I like to write when I feel inspired, but I don't force myself otherwise. \n\nI also knit. I keep focused on the project more if I'm making it for somebody. Often when I think I'm doing something for others, I tend to stay focused longer. Of course, as long as they didn't know I was making it for them in the first place, I can always change my mind if I like it for myself.\n\nMy other hobbies include embroidery, video games, Japanese, aaandd a bunch of other stuff. You don't have to accomplish one thing or have only one hobby. There's an expression "jack of all trades, master of none, is better than a master of one". Just do what interests you and keep track of when you feel particularly motivated. Is it the weather? Keeping a person in mind? Having a due date with a concrete punishment? Or making mini "accomplishment checkpoints" for yourself? When you realize a motivation, keep track of it and think about why it motivates you and how to transfer it to other times. You'll catch the rhythm of determination and discipline. 
1	I like beer. I like its flavour, aroma and effect. I like talking about beer in detail. So my hobby became brewing beer. Because why not?  Now I make beer, and when I make it, I am rewarded by having beer I like ready and on tap.\n\nMy advice, find a hobby that rewards you in some way.
1	Wait until your so pissed of at your self that you dedicate a fixed time for the hobby that is most interesting to you. Than when you watch forged in fire and want to take up blacksmithing, remind yourself your focusing on your one hobby and any time you pour i to a new hobby will take away from the other.\n\nSo in a nutshell... Self discipline.
1	I can't. Firstly, it is simply impossible because i get bored very easily. Whatever i start doing i get bored of it in 2 hours! It gets so uninteresting so quickly that i can't mentally handle doing it anymore.  Secondly, There are so many things to do that i can't choose one and on top of that i'm very indecisive so i wind up with literal nothing. 
1	I know literally exactly what you mean! I really want to get into parkour and d&d too also philosophy. Lemme know if you figure something out please. I'm really annoyed at the intp with staying focused on one task, and actually doing that one task.
1	For me, external commitments are key. If I have someone else holding me accountable (like a teacher, boss, or regularly-scheduled gaming group) I'm more likely to follow through on something. I may not like committing myself to a writers workshop or something like that, but I've learned I'm more likely to follow through if accountability is there.
1	Just do fun stuff. Who cares how long you do it for?
1	I'm always keeping my hobbies open, like, i love drawing and painting, but i usually draw in 2-3 months intervals. I have some stable hobbies, to which i always return, but of course as i said, the intervals are not as consistent as people would think. And i have some temporary hobbies, which i usually do when i'm not doing one of my "stable" hobbies.
1	You gotta get so far in debt to the hobby that you can't back out. 
1	>But everything is too interesting\n\nYou don't deserve this quality. Give it to me. I wish I had even two things that I found too interesting.
1	I used to change hobby every other month because I wanted the hobby to give me something. \n\nWhen my hobby didn't make me instantly rich or famous I changed to another hobby hoping that this time it would click.\n\nOne day a couple of months ago I read Victor Frankl's Man's search for meaning (the part about the psychology of prisoners). I realized that I have value because I am who I am. I don't need to prove myself to anyone. I could sit on my fat ass and still have value. My life have value and meaning because I am human. That day I let all my hobbies go because I already have what I need; I feel valued from the inside.\n\nNow I do things because I like to do them not because I want something. I also realized that my longest standing hobby is to build stuff. I have built furniture and am currently building a microgrowery out of an Ikea closet. I like to build stuff because that involves design, production and optimization. \n\nExternal things can't give you anything. It's like buying a second sofa. Sure, you are happy about it for 1 week. But then what?\n\n
1	I set a grand challenge at the end and commit. \n\nFor example - I booked an IRONMAN triathlon 6 months ago. It's always been on my bucket list and while I'm young enough I've decided to just book it. \n\nThis means I HAVE to train or I'll embarrass myself. \n\nWhen I was learning a new language I quit my job and booked a 6 month contract abroad. I HAD to learn it or i wouldn't be able to communicate and therefore have no money. \n\nWhere possible, I like to have something I'm working towards. Ideally it's so big it scares most people. My ego and belief in my iron discipline will force me to get it done. \n\nHaving said that, there's a LOT I don't keep up with. Writing a book, learning an instrument, learning sign language, martial arts, St John's Ambulance. SO much to do!!

1	I don't think this is a bad thing. It shows that we think a lot and have lots of ideas that we are too catious (rightfully so) to put out there because they could come off in ways we don't want them to. Also, the difficult to understand part just means we don't have many shitty and/or shallow conversations.

3	Prone to be 2nd?	I am a multiple-times-tested INTP. However, I just finished college with a degree in business information technology and I’m currently applying for junior jobs. I do have average grades, maybe better than average but not outstanding. My resume is fine, my motivational letters are written quite well. Finally, I have been invited to 3 job interviews. Nevertheless, it seems as I am prone to be the one that constantly ends up on the 2nd place. Could it be that this is an INTP thing? According to my experience, INTPs are not the ones that stay in someone’s head for a long time. Sometimes it feels as if some people do not even notice INTPs. It seems like we’re chameleons. Could it be that the fact that INTPs don’t like being the center of attention leads them to sort of manipulate themselves so that they cannot really exploit their full potential in some situations and thus rather end up being second than first? And if so, is there anything one can do about it? When the interview partners called me to give feedback, they always told me that I did quite well, but that there is at least one or 2 persons that did better (and it always sounded quite authentic). One interview partner even recommended me to a workmate of his (nevertheless, that job did not interest me).\n\nThis is just a theory of mine and I would love to know what you guys think about it. I know that I am not the only one in the situation I am right now, and I am quite sure that I will end up finding a job I really like. It’s just that it sucks. And I have experienced the exact same situation in my past with searching jobs (however, I ultimately found quite a good one last time this happened). Nevertheless, this made me thinking whether this could be an INTP thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	\nAs a kid I preferred 2nd consciously and unconscious. Just not being near middle or bottom of the pack. \n\nTo me it's usually good enough, and first place used to come with a subjective social burden in my head. Plus 2nd you kind of won but didn't have to try extremely hard, you know?\n\nI also had insecurities where I prefer to let people win so they'd keep playing with me. Ridiculous but I still prefer it haha.\n\nE: as far as job competition just be cutthroat. 
3	Interviewing is a fucked up and partially random process.  You’ll probably have to do a dozen at least before getting hired
2	Also what you went through and the thing is we tend to be just too neutral. You have to realize that some of these other candidates that walk into interview rooms are colourful people. We are like bland oatmeal. Interviews aren’t about how well you can do the job; that’s how you got there in the first place. Interviews are essentially a big fucking popularity contest. People are looking at you as an individual. Being personable or outstanding and loud is how you pass this phase of the interview process. If you just so happen to have a common interest with the interviewer, like you’re in high business and play golf; then that’s why you got hired. It literally is like a pissing contest as if high school wasn’t bad enough. \n\nHowever, I’d recommend you just be who you are as the people who “hire” you may think that you don’t fit into their work culture or environment. Being fake may either drain you too much if you do get hired or just may be a bad culture fit overall. You will eventually get hired by someone who does think you are a good fit. Think about how you can be more distinguishable from others but still be yourself. Hope this helps.
2	The strangest and most helpful interviewing advice I ever received was, "Never forget that you are bridge crew."\n\nI said WTF? I am a lawyer, what does bridge crew have to do with anything. And he said, "Oh I thought you would get it.  It's a Star Trek thing. The people who die in Start Trek are all the red shirts.  None of the bridge crew ever die."\n\nIt took a while, but I came to understand what he meant. I learned to go into interviews as someone who perfectly qualified for the position and checking them out to see if I wanted to work there. Not an arrogant jerk, more of a subtle change of perspective. It made all the difference for me.
1	I'm INTP and I love being the center of attention. Do you have a source on that one?\n\nI think introverts like to reflect on things and gather full intelligence instead of reaching a conclusion early on in their thought. Extraverts tend to act before they think and understand people (because they are part of the outer-world) better. \n\nJung himself who outlined these ideas in his book said he would never want a person to try to limit herself because of their type. It was more a method to understand an irreconcilable fundamental difference in understanding.
1	It is not faking it at all. It is knowing and accepting that you are fully qualified and have no need to prove yourself.

2	  \n\n#       “Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed.”     \n\n ―        Friedrich Nietzsche      \nThe truth is an ugly thing for some ppl, they like hearing beautiful lies, but never an honest truth! 
1	I found the trick is to be honest but tactful. Make 'em want to hear the truth.
1	Let's be honest, some people can't handle the truth. They say that they want to hear the truth from us but in reality, they just want to hear from us what they expected to hear.\n\n\nWhen I'm in a conversation with anyone and they happened to ask my **honest** opinion, I always start up with, *"Do you REALLY(eyes wide open; vocal tone changes to give emphasis) want to hear the truth?"*
1	These days, every inviting smile is just pretense to set you up. To turn the tables, just start out any encounter by accusing them of everything they're setting you up for. Essentially, this means telling people from the get-go that you don't like their attitude, or their tone of voice, and you may as well call them a racist bigot homophobe rapist too while you're at it, since that's what they're angling to accuse you of. 
1	Very funny! And so true for me, even though I'm an infp. I think people should just wear a t-shirt that says\nwhatever they want to hear from other people. Like, tell me I'm pretty, creative, a genius, etc.

13	Thought: Maybe INTPs just aren't cut out for relationships	My last relationship ended basically just because I'm an INTP. My SO and I took personality tests (yes it was my dumbass INTP idea) and determined that it just wouldn't work. It seemed illogical to keep trying to make it work, but it also seemed illogical to break up over a personality test. But the truth is the test pointed out things that we both couldn't stand about each other. We realized that these were traits engraved in us, and it also seemed wrong to try to change for another person. But that got me thinking, will anyone be compatible for an INTP to be in a relationship with? INTPs tend to be distant, absent minded, and insensitive, and these traits make it really hard to get close to anyone. Traits that we may value can be seen as cruel or rude to others (like our honesty and independence). Maybe we're just not cut out for relationships?\n\nUpdate: I realize this sounds like a stupid reason to break up but we were having problems and the test pointed out things about ourselves that we decided we couldn't change or tolerate about each other. I am NOT looking for someone to analyze my past relationship, just wondering if there are any INTPs out there who have successfully created a stable, healthy relationship without changing themselves. I, personally, dont think its right to change to be with someone. But INTPs are difficult to work with. Just curious, thanks all\n\nPS. It was my first attempt at a relationship so chill lol\n\nUpdate: Congrats to all you INTPs who have found someone you can be yourself with. God bless and good luck :)
17	As an INTP I've found that I get along really well with ENTJ's.
6	I would stick with the N-types; they will understand your thought process better and see the world in the same way.  You may still get under eachother's skin, but at least you will be living in the same world and the divide will not be so hard to bridge with some communication.
9	Of course there are compatible people out there! \n\nYou think you’re the only one to nerd out on fringe topics? Only INTPs desire company one minute and then shoo away their partner the next because of a fascinating link on Wikipedia and they fell down the rabbit hole...\n\nRelationships take work, so when you want to be alone and they want company, you find a way to make things work. However, finding a partner that not only understands your need for diving deep into weird theories, but also shares that trait (or our many other weird NT quirks) is what makes it work.\n\nThe MBTI quiz revealed what you already knew, it just gave you an excuse to pull the trigger with an “It’s not you, it’s me. Except it’s not me either, but let’s call it quits with no hard feelings, m’kay?” 
4	Some cold hard facts from your local INTP\n\n1. The only reason not to be in a relationship is because you don't want it.\n\n2. There is at least one person you can be happy with. Like, there's a shitload of people out there.\n\n3. The next relationship will be always better than the previous one because you learned. So you'll eventually end up with someone well fit for you.\n\n4. I am an insentitive, anti-social, arrogant piece of garbage and guess who I'm dating? Somebody who doesn't get offended, appreciates honesty, is introverted and genuinely thinks I am smart and to be admired for that. That person happens to be an INFP but many types could be like that.\n\n5. It really depends on how well are your functions developed. Two INTPs can be so different and so the people they date. \n\n6. I'm in an enviroment which is loaded with intuitives so I never particularly bonded with a sensor and those usually turn me off anyway. I agree with others that N types work well with each other. Also STs with tertiary N could work. SFs are scary to date, honestly. ExxxJs like to be dominant and controlling sometimes which I personally hate, but you may not.\n\n7. In conclusion, best types to date are: ENTP, ENFP, INFP, INTJ, ISTP and other INTPs\n\n
3	ENTP's are like unicorns, hope you can find one  \nESFJ can work, but its like a work  \n
11	lol, this is pathetic. 
2	It’s been a while since I’ve seriously dated anyone but I recently took a chance on dating a ISFJ. It didn’t work out but we ended on great terms. Relationships are hard, no doubt. Don’t let a label ruin a chance at happiness. Just focus on yourself and a make yourself  better with each and everyday.  It’ll take some time but hopefully you’ll realize this. Good luck to all my fellow INTP’s out there. 
2	I find my Fe takes over when I meet people, and I easily bring people in. But once I get comfortable and the honeymoon phase passes, my dominant Ti comes back and I also come off as distant and indifferent. I never lose interest, but they never seem to understand that. I haven't had luck in long term relationships because of this, but I also think that you'll eventually find someone that will understand/accept this, same way you'll have to understand/accept their quirks 
2	I don’t understand these cold distant insensitive descriptions. I always score very strongly INTP but I am the opposite of these when it comes to significant others 
2	INFJs are great, and they seem to like INTPs for some reason. Might be worth looking into. 
2	I am in a happy relationship with an ENFP. He has the same idea as me that people in a relationship don't form a whole, but each person is their own. He's very reasonable and knows I don't mean to hurt him when I (absentmindedly) react or answer in a somewhat distant way to something and vice versa. We are both adults with both our hobbies, jobs and friends. We have a strong common ground on humour and morales. It's also possible to talk about all the possibilities and ideas in theory without one of us getting upset over the challenge. Sometimes I'm the weaker part in explaining things and my point of view, because of a language barrier, though (I'm German, he's Scottish)\nBut boi if we'd debate in my native language... :D\n\nThat being said: Even INTPs can be in a happy relationship. It just has to be the right person on your side.\n\n
2	Its hard to keep a relationship if you don’t like controlling other people, which we don’t.\n\nAlso one of the reasons women love the dark triad and psychopaths.
2	I'm with an ENTJ and we work very well together 😊 INTP's usually get along with any xNTx types, try keeping that in mind when you're looking for a relationship! 
2	> dumbass INTP idea \n\nHey, you can't have good ideas without bad ideas.  *And sometimes good things come from seemingly bad ideas.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like a stupid/bad idea to dry out seaweed, burn it, and mix the ashes with sulfuric acid.  But that's how  Barnard Courtois discovered Iodine in 1811.
2	INTP's and INFP's are generally very compatible with certain outliers of course. They are very similar and the feeling/thinking difference tend to balance each other out.
3	Yo relationship didn’t end cuz you were INTP, it ended cuz of yo own dumbass. You let a label tell you how to run your life and you deserve it so because you let it happen. Every relationship requires work and effort. Did you think it was going to be served to you on a silver spoon?
1	what type were they??
1	It doesn't only sounds like a stupid reason, it is one too. Why not stop and think a little ?\n\nThere are 16 types, and eitheir you date someone like you, ie, of the same type, or you date someone pretty different. Of course it was going to point out some problems...\n\nAlso prety stupid to decide on that without researching further. You probably relied on the descriptions, tha are unreliable, and the interplay is actually quite complex.\n\n
1	You're calling it illogical, but you're still taking it at face value.  Is it possible that you guys broke up over other shit and that the personality test was just something convenient to blame it on?
1	I think when you dont get along with someone, you just both have to work on it. If you think that changing something about yourself for the sake of relationship is bad, then dont go to relationship. Im not saying you should completely change your personality but I think for a working relationship both of you have to work on it and change yourself to be better.. Honestly, what is the point of a relationship when you dont improve yourself together?  \nWell there are some exceptions when people find each other and it just works out and you dont really have to work on it that much but this is not very common I think, but you can try to find someone like that..\n\nAlso, this is just my opinion so it doesnt have to work like that for everyone of course..
1	I've been in a relationship for 6 years, ATM me and my GF live together 4 days of week and the other 3 separated for reasons it's not relevant to discuss.\n\nI think the most important aspect for an INTP is for your partner to be a friend/companion more so than a lover. In my not modest opinion you can have sex and pleasure with just anybody, but it takes more to build a long lasting connection, the other person needs to keep you interested, stimulated, and at the same time don't invade your personal space and give you room to breathe.
1	*Yawn* Yet another person whining about how "hard" it is being an INTP. Blah, blah, blah. It's kind of sad how individuals like you use this test as an excuse for your problems in relationships...
1	Nuuuuuuu! You \*are\* cut out for a relationship.... maybe just not yet.  :(  I'm an INTP too and it took me a really, really, really REALLY long time to find someone but I did. Sometimes we have to mature a little. I know that I would have driven him away if we'd met when I was young and still struggling with stuff. Not that I'm perfect now, but I have a much better handle on feelings and that helps a lot. And my SO takes care of the practical stuff, lol (he's an ISFJ). \n\nI'll second looking for an ENTJ - they're widely regarded as the best match for INTPs for good reason; you give each other what the other needs, and at the same level. Like, an ENTJ will give you lots of data for your introverted thinking mind to crunch... and you will return excellent analyses that the ENTJ is looking for. ENTJ will drag you out to have fun WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT (but you will end up enjoying it). And since you both have feeling as your weakest function you can be soft and sweet together, and you won't judge each other for being immature in this area. I've also found INTJ's to be a very easy relationship but good luck finding one!\n\nThat being said, I do think challenging relationships can work well. Like, my ISFJ fiance and I; we help each other out in our weaknesses, and (generally) work to be understanding of them. We try to push ourselves out of our comfort zones; I try to be more emotionally available when he needs to vent, and he understands when I get tired and need to be by myself to recharge. From my observation, we both appear to have developed our inferior functions quite a bit; I really try to make people feel good (extroverted feeling), and he loves cracking jokes and being wacky (extroverted intuition). It also helps that we share a lot of interests.\n\nDon't give up! But maybe also work on developing yourself and making yourself someone who can be a good partner in a relationship?
1	Almost all of my relationships have been long distance ones, and I think that helped a lot (they all lasted several years).  Basically I liked them a lot, but stay over there please! 
31	Do you ever do common things to don't seem weird	For example when I'm agitated while I'm talking to someone I blow my nose even if I don't need it because that is something people do, or I nod and try to keep a relaxed voice, or I fidget with everything I have in my hands anyway the point is *I do all of this just to appear normal because if it were me I would just stare at who I'm talking to* and appear weird with arms straight down and looking constantly at your eyes, so I imitate habits to don't seem autistic
11	One of my friends always looks at his wrist when someone mentions the time. I've never seen him wear a watch. 
7	Well when I don't think what I'm doing I naturaly move arms in some senseful way. But when I start being aware of my body language I immediatly get confused and imitate "normal" body language
6	I don't know if it's necessarily a common thing, but I've developed a couple of body language habits to indicate I'm listening. Rubbing the side/bridge of my nose and crossing and recrossing my arms are the two big ones. And, thinking about it, they both kind of started because I didn't know what else to do with my hands during conversation. 
7	Looking constantly in someone's eyes is not an autistic trait, stereotypically speaking. Fidgeting is often considered distracting and annoying to other people. You're better off being yourself. That's not a platitude. It just sounds like a lot of effort without any need for it.
4	[deleted]
2	Recently I developed the gesture of rubbing my chin when discussing an idea to make it look like I'm contemplating. Sometimes, I also affect looking up and staring in the distance to seem like I'm thinking or looking down to make it seem like I'm recalling something. In all of these cases, I'm actually preoccupied with the actions and not actually thinking about what I'm pretending to be thinking. I don't know if these are necessarily weird. It's weird that I have to affect these actions  to create an impression. 
1	When interacting with strangers (and thus, stressed) I frequently itch my nose, and straighten my glasses.  I guess it's a self-soothing thing or something like that.
1	Honestly I feel like staring at someone arms down super serious I feel like it would be a good intimidation technique
1	I sniffle. It's become a form of punctuation first and a symptom of allergies second.
1	I actually do much of common things, although they doesn't really make sense to me...
0	I went to the club several times just to "socialize". Worst thing. 
13	Sometimes...	I sometimes meet intuitive people that I mesh well with and talking with them feels like a miracle. It feels like I can breathe. I walk around with so much in my head and only the right kind of mind can get it out of me. But I so seldom meet these minds, and live far away now from the ones I have met that it can feel unbearably lonely at times. I just want to talk to a fellow human mammal who gets it.. 
8	Why did you qualify human with mammal? 
4	Looking back at my post, it comes across as harsh, which was my intent. I do think that INTPs sometimes expect to live life on their terms and reject changing or compromise. How can we expect others to accommodate us if we will not meet them half way.\n\nI also see a lot of INTPs complain that conversations are painful or boring. Again, if you want to spend your life interacting with 3 percent of the population, have at it. INTPs seem quick to say that they are not better than other people, but other people are worse. We carry a deep conceit early in life.\n\nGrowing up require every type to develop a fluency with other types. We have to be able to converse and communicate with ENFJe, and they have to learn to talk to us.\n\nThe sad thing about MBTI is that it focuses on our differences. There is a hell of a lot that we have in common, but some people seem to think that we are different species.
1	I’ve felt this way about people too, although I don’t know if I connected with them for the same reasons you did; I’m curious, so can you elaborate on what causes the connection?
1	If you think about, it, aren't you really saying that most people are not worthy of a conversation with you? Seems like the most arrogant thing a person could say. Aren't you basically asking the world to meet you on your terms? Do you think that if you took the time to get to know people, you might find that they are interesting and complicated people with a lot to offer? Have you ever attempted to have conversations with them on their terms?\n\nJust curious.
4	a dream i just woke up from	i had a dream about some stubborn fuck who wanted to go through a doorway he thought went to heaven despite everyone telling him it went to hell.  \nhe ends up in some area filled with different colored tentacles like from a sea anemone and a voice speaks to him which he thinks is god (its the devil).  \neach of the tentacles is a person who came here before, which then was absorbed by the devil, losing their mind and self and becoming a part of the whole. this starts to happen to the fucker, but he is too stubborn and his will is too strong. when he realizes what is happening he says “fuck no” and literally climbs his way out of hell. yet he still thought it was heaven and god trying to absorb him.  \n  \nby the way has anyone seen that ted talk that displayed all of the proteins in your body working as literal machines?  \n  \nalso, the stubborn character in my dream was squidward tentacles.  
1	Waht.
1	But no squidbagging? 
1	If you are in a INTP sub you should understand Jung's basic theory at least. He said, only when we meet out shadow (hell) we can know our light (heaven). This "stubborn fuck" isn't wrong at all. The problem the dream is presenting here, is that, maybe you have encountered your shadow, but when that happens you can integrate it or you can identify with your shadow and start acting like it. (like it absorbs you). You have to in a way understand that heaven and hell is the same after all, is just the two sides of a coin. But you shouldn't stay in one side, you have to live in both. Have you come to a realization in your real life? Why your Ego relates to a "stubborn fuck" or "squid ward tentacles"? Could they be a part of your shadow that you have to integrate to go to heaven?
1	Watch the Joe Rogan podcast with Alex Jones from yesterday.  This dream aligns with what was discussed there\n\nWhen you dream your mind opens like a gateway to other dimensions and other dimentional beings come to make deals with you.  You only get confronted by the evil ones because only evil seeks to control others.  The good ones you have to seek out because they don’t like to meddle in the affairs of other beings.\n\nIts also what the Lord of the Rings is about, and most of our famous stories and shared experiences.

4	The dumb sorority type	Going to a state university, I am surrounded by this type. Every girl is walking around with a shirt consisting of ransom Greek letters and they all look the same and act the same. This is how they appear to me at least. I was talking to my friend the other day and he told me he’s actually into that type and I’m find that type very unappealing. Anyone else deal with this. Just generalizing all sorority girls to that dumb, blonde, shallow type. I know I’m probably wrong but I’ve thought that way for so long that it’s kind of sewn into how I think. \n\nI’m in a public speaking class with mostly girls of this type and it’s only supported this opinion. I just sit there and slowly lose brain cells listening to them be fake af and say the dumbest things. 
16	It's just as small-minded to judge sorority girls as dumb and shallow as it is to judge gamers as worthless losers.\n\nLife is much better when you actively choose to perceive the people around you as individuals who you could always understand better, regardless of the other categories it is convenient to generalize them into.
5	Birds of a feather flock together. Sororities definitely attract a certain type. The type that are mostly extroverted and WANT to conform and be part of the group and make friends who like similar things. Since these traits are not exactly very INTP-ish, I guess it’s normal not to feel any sense of...connection with these girls.\n\nIt’s not your fault that you don’t like the type of people these organizations attract most. But I don’t think that this is a reason to discount or look down on all individuals from that organization. Try your best man. Keep that open mind. An open mind is one that learns most.\n\n
4	Sounds like your having a completely normal college experience. Be very careful with that type, or just avoid at all costs. \n\nThey are being taught to steal, cheat, lie, and do whatever it takes to get whatever they want. And the scary part is their wants are irrational.
6	This sounds like a sexually confused, slightly misogynistic identity crisis cop-out, tbh. Why hate on those sorority types when there are SO MANY other types of women out there? Those girls are “fitting in” to that stereotype to attract males of the same ilk. Not you. Just stay in your lane (when you find it) and there will be girls of “your type” who have been waiting for you to finally figure it out. 
5	I was going to say  the classic line of “ don’t judge a book by its cover” however I joined a sorority and I dropped out in my second year. I understand what you mean, I left because so many of the girls seemed to almost to bring those traits out in each other it was nearly impossible to have a deep connection with any of them. \n\nCollege is a fun time if you let it, try talking to other freshman in common areas. If someone has similar taste in music that’s easy enough to strike up convo.  \n\nThat being said having a few extroverted friends even if they aren’t the deepest connection can be helpful in having a full “ college experience”.
2	In my experience they're hot and worth the small amount of effort for "casual" friends. They know of parties, dress extremely nice and might have access to test banks. 
2	I was absolutely prejudiced about sororities and then joined one. Granted, it was at a school where Greek life isn’t a huge part of the culture, but I joined because the girls in it were some of the smartest, most accomplished people I’d met at the school. The alumnae from when I was there are now people like a Pulitzer Prize winner and another was a one of the Forbes under-30. \n\nIt sounds like you’re leaping to conclusions before genuinely giving them a chance, so your conclusions end up being more of self-fulfilling prophecies. I get it! That was me, too.
2	Soroities and Fraternities are brainwashing cults for wannabe elitists. 
2	You shouldn’t judge women merely on outward appearance. Some women try to conform to the stereotype you are describing to “fit in” due to insecurities.\n\nYou should talk to them before you “assume” they’re stupid. If after talking to them you realize that they actually are stupid then fair enough.\n\nTo judge simply based on appearance is shallow.\n

-1	Women are very prone to social pressure, groupthink, group identity, and grooming\n\nI never much cared for Sorority girls either and I went to a school with a huge Greek culture and was in a Fraternity\n\nWhat I also noticed was every sorority recruited basically the same kind of look.  The DZs were all the hot fake blondes, the Alpha Phis were all the hot brunettes, the DGs were the future divorced power moms, the XO’s were all the cute girl next door looking girls, Phi Mu was almost all girls who were kinda cute but had some deformity (mildly fat, bad smell, hook nose, bad teeth, etc), and then lots were mostly fat chicks.\n\nJust get used to it, females prefer to exist in a hive mind state.  It makes them feel safe.

2	Yes the a few weeks ago I said “the ones, what are they called, the thing that makes things, it’s a you and a me. HUMAN, that’s the one I was thinking of” I promise this is real

2	Oh, like an actual shepherd?  At first, I thought this was some kind of archetype.  No, but now that I think about it, it'd probably be an alright gig, except for all the human correlations to sheep and being shepherded (by another human) and it would likely piss me off if it didn't help me gain some compassion.

3	Try to avoid it. I usually just smile and talk to them like I would to a child who is having a tantrum. It pisses most of them off. 
2	Like your freedom depends on it. People like this are literally slaves, and their goal is to try to enslave you too. You better be prepared to defend yourself rabidly. I suggest having multiple holes dug up beforehand, just in case. 
2	No, you don't. It will, in fact, make you the asshole in that situation. Be the better person.
2	Keep asking questions. \nIf they don't have solid argument, they will fall to their own trap.
1	Arguing is not what most people consider fun. "Hi, let's have a disagreement." But wait, we just want an honest exchange of ideas. Our mins are totally open. Of course, the last time I was proven wrong was in the womb, but I cannot help it if I am right.\n\nWhy won't people let me show them why they are wrong?
0	First you would have to find such a mythical person. Everyone has arguments, and they are valid.  Just ask them. It is so frustrating because they just will not listen to reason. As soon as they start to talk, my mind starts to prepare a detailed explanation why they are wrong.\n\nOf course, when I am preparing a response, I am not really listening anymore. I certainly  not considering why they believe what they do or trying to find the truth in their beliefs.  I already know that I am right.  Wait a second, that's their problem. They know they are right and will not listen to other viewpoints. \n\nBut it is different. They are wrong and will not listen to reason.  I am right and will not listen to nonsense. Those people need to change.
8	Do you guys start working on another thing even though you have a deadline for something else?	Like when you're working on a school project and then suddenly you remember you write music so you suddenly have the drive to work on you're own personal projects at this inconvenient time. Then once you're schedule is free and you can do whatever you want, you lose the drive for your personal project and feel as though there's nothing worth doing.\n\nHow often does this happen to you?
4	It is really hard for me to get started on something if I am not trying to finish something else. I call it cross-procrastination.
1	Just like you wrote I thinked that it's me only
1	Yes, this happens quite often.
1	shut up, this is a stupid ass question
1	All the time. I always get inspiration to do some unrelated project that isn't school work, when the deadline for an assignment is closing in... and most of the time I proceed with the unrelated project, but never end up finishing it.
1	2-3 times a day
1	The struggle is real.\n\nI'm far better about it than I used to be.\n\nI think it, like most procrastination, is anxiety-related. One has trouble making forward progress on a project, next steps aren't 100% clear, and the stakes are high. So, in order to relieve the anxiety, the brain looks for an easy dopamine-hit quick-win. Starting a new project, where the first steps are clear (or playing a game, cleaning something, etc.) pushes that dopamine button, and gives a feeling of "accomplishment," thereby relieving anxiety.
1	Basically me all the time. Singing, listening to music, binging on Broadway bootlegs. You name it and then wowwwwww look it’s 1am already 
1	Every day at work, unfortunately.
7	Envy is the cause of my unhappiness	Last night I had a relevation that it's my envy that's driving my unhappiness and stagnation in life. \n\nEnvy: a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck.\n\nI'm envious of friends who are more social and outgoing than me.\n\nI'm envious of others who are in relationships.\n\nI'm envious of those who are in majors/careers they are passionate/skilled in.\n\nI'm envious of peers in leadership positions who have superior work ethic, ideas, creativity, articulation, confidence and are still accomplishing more than I am. \n\nI'm envious of those with qualities that I lack. \n\nI do feel like a perfectionist, which is bad when I don't have the ability to back that up and no self-compassion to forgive and move on. I fixate on how flawed and incomplete I am, and envy how the grass is greener on the other side. It might be better if I stop comparing and just be the best me, but I'm not even good at typical INTP strengths. There are plenty of other non-INTP who can analyze and deconstruct far better than I can.\n\nIf I'm inferior in everything, what am I? 
6	> If I'm inferior in everything, what am I? \n\nA human being, just like everyone else. The fact that you're able to take a critical look at yourself makes you stand out from 80% of the population. Don't live your life in comparison to others. Take responsibility for yourself and take action towards something you want or believe in. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Props for not using the word jaleousy, but beside that, isn't envy fuel for growth ? Say, you're envious of something, so you try to get it too ?\n\n> If I'm inferior in everything, what am I?\n\nInferior to some people, and superior to some ?
1	Making judgments is the true root cause of most unhappiness, and I count 15 judgments in your short post. Sounds like you totally suck in every possible way. That is not true of course, but when you keep telling yourself that, it becomes your reality. Lose the judgments, and you will discover that you are just fine and lose the unhappiness.
1	INTP are 4th function Fe-Principles, and 8th function Fi-"Devilish/Transformational".\n\nEnvy is Fe, and I suppose fretting over Envy is Fi, as is getting over it.\n\nYou have envy over Principles which you personally have no desire to actually accomplish. You don't really want to be the teacher or doctor or lawyer you envy, and ultimately you'd just like to have some coherent experience of Fe Principles. \n\nSince your Principles are 4th functional, they're not congruent with your 1st three functions, which are Ti-Data, Ne-Observation, & Si-Action. \n\nWithout coherent Principles, Fe will substitute the Principles others possess and exhibit, which you don't have, which is Envy. Fe Principles develop over time. In the mean time, find motivations which aren't based on some else's world. For example, if someone envied their favorite athletes, they'd be better of not watching sports.\n\n> There are plenty of other non-INTP who can analyze and deconstruct far better than I can.\n\nThe shouldn't be a surprise. Where analysis is based in Principles, other types exhibit 1st or 2nd function Ni or Si Principles. For INTP, analysis is geared towards 4th function Fe Principles. Fe is geared towards harmony, or in a more analytical sense, generality and universality.\n\nExploiting existing Principles via Ni or Si can certain be and seem something to envy, consider that only Fe develops generic and universal Principles.\n\nIn another sense, having Fe Principles means  you can't let the world "break you" before your Fe Principles develops. Realizing your Fe Principles naturally takes longer than 1st or 2nd function embodiment of Principles via Ni or Si would.\n\nIn the mean time, you're learning far more that you realize, which over time develops into Fe Principles.\n\nSimilar logic could apply to FP types and their Te Principles. 
1	Or you can be using it as an excuse for self-pity so you don't have to try and be uncomfortable.  Not saying it to be mean or anything, being serious.  Use the feeling that you are lacking to motivate yourself to do better.  How do you know you can't be better without ever trying?
1	How old are you?
1	Nothing good comes of comparing others to yourself imo. 
1	I don't know anyone my age that has all those checked off.\n\nBeing social is for idiots. The vast majority of people out there are complete and utter idiots. Keep the smart ones that care for you close, everyone is literally just there to prevent the world from stopping. 
3	Brave Web Browser	Anyone tried it? I'm considering boycotting Google.\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/TrKiBSm](https://imgur.com/gallery/TrKiBSm)\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/SyGoung](https://imgur.com/gallery/SyGoung)\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/4OK5iGk](https://imgur.com/gallery/4OK5iGk)
2	Chrome sucks. Not just on the computer but on the phone as well. Too resource intensive. I use Opera. Everything chrome does without the inevitable slowdown
2	Ive tried it, it's kinda slow and glitchy.  (at least for me)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirefox is actually better that chrome now.  And I can confirm.  I slapped on an adblocker, and havent looked back.  Though I keep chrome around, for the few things it can do that Firefox can't, and as a backup.\n\nBut I highly recommend boycotting google.  Switching to firefox is pretty much my first step.
1	Been testing out the browser. It's based on the chrome framework so all your extensions (should) work natively. They started me off with 10 dollars worth of BAT coin in my coinbase wallet as well as an additional $6 in the browser itself. If you want to view ads you get paid in BAT tokens but that's not available yet. You can also support sites you go to by sharing your ad revenue with the site. Seems pretty interesting so far. Best part is they don't track your data and they block ads that attempt to do so. 
1	Most browsers are switching to the Chrome's rendering engine anyway. They are kind of all the same.\n
1	I have it, but I don’t use it much. I mainly use Chrome out of habit, even though Vivaldi is my default browser.\n\nI think Vivaldi is good with speed once it is open, but it is slower than the other browsers to open.
1	I personally have been using dolphin for the past year or so and it seems to work really great 
1	I much prefer Firefox. 
1	Brave is based on Chomium - so you wouldn't really boycott Google.
9	How Do I Help an INTP With Depression?	So, my best friend is an INTP, and he struggles with depression, and as such, I was wondering, how should I help him? INTPs who came out of this, what did you do? Thanks.
20	go over to his house and force him to do stuff
10	Introduce him to Jordan Peterson's online lectures (youtube). At least for me, it was a fantastic help.\n\nLacking purpose/meaning, and not having a responsibility to do or work at anything, is soul crushing. My depression was/is centered around inactivity, and as I put myself in positions that make me responsible for more, I feel better all around.
5	I am 54 and was depressed all my life until recently. I spent a lot of time alone. A part of me always wished that I was not alone but I could never make myself join other people.\n\nI had this recurrent wish that someone would come take my hand and pull me into the sunshine to play. Not try to help me or cheer me up, just do something with me.\n\nPeople sometimes asked me if I wanted to do something, and I always said no. For some reason I needed them to take me, not give me a choice.\n\nI have no idea if anyone else feels this way, and I do not know if it would have helped because no one ever tried. But I wanted it more than anything.\n\nIf you want to try this, pick something that you both like. Active is better. Not contrived like miniature golf. Playing basketball would be good. Tell him to come with you. Don't give him a choice or he will say no. Do not say anything about his depression. No "isn't this better." Just enjoy the moment. If it seems to work, tell him, "thanks. I enjoyed that. Let's do it again"\n\nAgain, I might be way off base. But it could not do any harm.
3	Not sure how this will work for him but what works for me when it really hits, Just having someone to throw all the thoughts at works. The negative ones, positive ones, having that deep (some times repeating) meaningful conversation that gets all the words swirling in my head out helps a lot. \n\nThe other part that helps..which i hate to admit, is going outside. Doing something completely different from the normal routine of life. Stimulation from outside vs inside I think is the best way. 
2	make him a coffee but spike it with a shit ton of cayanne pepper
2	It's tough, depression is usually a lack of meaning in your life, whether it's sudden or not.\n\nBe there for them no matter how much they try to push you away, they will know if you are halfway out the door, it's a lot harder to get out of depression yourself, especially after your friends reject you. Try to slowly get them going, the goal is for them to set their own very achievable goals for some easy wins, and make a habit out of it and let it grow.\n\nTry to sneak in some exercise in the morning with a proper breakfast.\n
2	Get him to stop knowing that he's thinking. Get his mind off his mind. Something that demands his attention so he can't wallow. Maybe an amusement park, or go paintballing. Something that gets that brain of his to stop its routine.
2	For me I get upset when people try encourage or say nice things about my life and it only makes the depressed state worse (not depression but sometimes I wonder). For me when I'm in one of those moods patience and maybe silent sitting nearby helps me. But I also like to know there is someone and they are there with me through it even if they don't do anything or know what's wrong.
2	Nothing is worse than when someone essentially says, "you're depressed, let's do something to cheer you up." Thanks, you just made it worse. Now drag me out to do something that you want to do because you want me along, and my depression would blow a fuse. But the second I think you are doing it because I am depressed, it will return over clocked. I have no idea if others feel the same, and it would be hard to carry off, but man, I wanted that so much.
1	First thing with an intp is logic. Logically persuade him nobody benefits from depression.\nSecond thing is, I found my depression to be much more related to hormonal/physiological stuff. Eating healthy, exercising, doing stuff he enjoys doing can help. And medication. Doesn't have to be complicated. I enjoy taking a big dump for eg.\nIt would be nice if he/she could get a boyfriend/girlfriend. Hook him up if he's unable to do it themselves.
1	Everyone needs to be loved. As an introvert, I may not go to social gatherings a lot, but still would love to get invited. Make them feel loved. Geniunely.
1	I don't really know what advice to give you because when I was depressed, i just isolated myself and let no one know about it. But perhaps you could start by letting him vent to you? Inferior Fe in my experience makes us run away from talking it out but it can be a great help if given a chance.
1	My depression waxes and wanes; I really have no control over it. Outside influences cause it shift but it's always present. Reaching out to them, just saying hello how's life is about all you can do. Listen to what they have to ramble about if they need to rant.
1	Weed.
1	Does this friend work in the service industry? He probably needs money to pay bills and buy food. 
1	Get him out of his comfort zone fast.  Force him to act now and think about it later than think now and act later.
1	Logically explain to him that depression is illogical and inefficient 
0	You can’t
0	Don't be a fixer. A lot of people, sometimes when they know someone is depressed, would quickly want them to be happy and okay by saying, "nah bro it's all in your head"  "just get up, eat healthy and exercise" expecting that after saying your 'magic generic words' we'd all be magically okay.\n\nOf course not you fucking twats. We know it. We don't appreciate help that we perceive as them undermining the sickness and that "it's just mindset".\n\nYou must understand that coming out of depression **is a process.** I'd really really appreciate a person who'd physically, mentally, emotionally, **be there** for me and with me as I go through that tough times. We might be good that week and crash and burn the next. Don't expect this as a smooth sailing journey, that shit can trip you up at unexpected times.\n\nIf you really wanna help this person, you gotta ready yourself through thick and thin. You'd be frustrated and angry but that's okay. We're frustrated with ourselves too. Much frustrated than you are. So as much as you'd like to help us, make sure you have breaks every now and then.\n\nNot someone who'd spout all the logic and facts, pros and cons of depression. Coz we get it. We know all of it. We'd just further hide if you do it. Preaching won't work. Someone empathetic and understanding would be nice. Someone who goes through the process would be nice.\n\nP.S. Excuse me for my strong words because I just feel this topic in a personal level. I appreciate how you're asking how to help. I just want you to know the gravity of the situation.
15	Just wanted to share	I used to be pretty depressed and had a horrible worldview. I thought that people didn't change, that I was just who I was and others were just how they were. I found physics and maths interesting, others didn't. I dreaded school every day because I never did the work, and went home and wasted my afternoons playing nothing but games and watching videos. I rationalised my existence by saying that my purpose was to advance human knowledge, that was the only way I mattered to the world. Nobody would find me of worth unless I contributed to the world in a helpful manner, and the only way I could see to do that was by advancing scientific knowledge. When my close friends (lord knows why they were my friends) started seeing girls and I eventually was peer pressured into going to social events and drinking alcohol, I remember asking myself what I had going for me as a person. I didn't think I was attractive, I did nothing but play games and knew nothing but science facts. I had next to no interesting experiences, and I had no will nor capacity for change. I was as boring as they come and stuck.\n\nAnyway, I remember discovering a poem that really summarised my perceived purpose in life called "A noiseless patient spider" by Walt Whitman. I remember spending some time memorising it because it really just struck such a chord with me. Someone else actually understood how I felt about the world. I'll paste it down below.\n\nI always figured that the second stanza was written from the perspective of some ethereal being, commenting on how humanity as a whole is in a universe of mystery, and how our scientific endeavours are akin to the spider's filaments, searching for evidence that helps us to work out how the universe functions. I can't stress just how much I felt this poem coincided with my worldview, and served to reinforce that my purpose is to 'launch filaments' my own for the sake of the rest of humanity and fulfill my purpose.\n\n"A noiseless patient spider, \nI mark’d where on a little promontory it stood isolated, \nMark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, \nIt launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself, \nEver unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them. \n\nAnd you O my soul where you stand, \nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space, \nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them, \nTill the bridge you will need be form’d, till the ductile anchor hold, \nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul."\n\n\nFast forward at least 2 years, I found psychology and began questioning my worldview. After a long experience with a mentally ill ex, I realised that other people just perceive the world differently. I was beginning to hate myself and my behaviour, realising how much I was lagging behind everyone else. I spent my freshman year at university hiding from my flatmates, playing games and avoiding work. I had always thought that the idea that people couldn't change was quite depressing, but I eventually realised that it was false, but that it would take time. I realised that the reason I was so dissatisfied with life was my worldview. I pursued counselling, read books, watched lectures (admittedly to avoid my university work, but I truly felt like this was more important to me), and I made slow progress. Nowadays I'm wayy less anxious, more social, I've been through a lot, I'm planning new experiences and sorting out my life, taking on new burdens and responsibilities to make me more fulfilled, I'm really a whole new person to who I used to be and I don't take the time to appreciate that as much as I should.\n\nI recently decided to look at the poem again, not thinking much, and it's suddenly so clear to me now that the second stanza is directed specifically at the reader. *I* am the person searching to make sense of the world around me. It's not about science or rooting out facts about the universe, it's about man's search for meaning. I once thought myself so insignificant that I couldn't even conceive that it was directed at me. The complexity of 'the human experience' was so lost on me that I couldn't see what there was to even search for in life besides scientific knowledge. No wonder I didn't believe people could change. The one poem I found to represent the meaning of my earlier depressing life is also one that summarises my journey into who I am now. I'm embarrassed to say but it's genuinely brought me to tears just thinking about it all. It's like the whole thing is just too fucking poetic lol. A gossamer thread finally did catch somewhere :')\n\nI thought it was a nice little story, and figured I should spend the time to write it out rather than let my memory degrade it over time. Hopefully you guys can appreciate it too.\n\n
7	😭 a great story depicting the growth of an INTP youth. I was much the same as a kiddo. I'm glad that I have matured and learned to accept my changing inner person. I learned to accept my emotions and spirituality. Life gets better every day.\n\nPart of growing up as an INTP is learning that knowledge is both invaluable and worthless at the same time. INTPs love paradoxes. There's a big one living in each of us.
3	Thank you for sharing this. I'll share mine story too, if you don't mind (I've done it anyway and it turned out huge woops)\n\nIn middle school I remember having a certain circle of friends, and I loved communication. Although generally I was quiet, I was the bubbliest one in a familiar company. Then something happened, and in high school I started just not giving a toss about having a social life whatsoever; I believed that knowledge in its pure form is the most important and valuable thing. I wasn't snob about this, just didn't see a point in anything else.\n\nIn uni that changed a bit again, I met a very close friend, and those couple of years we spent together were simply great: I started to communicate with people more, and really loved friend's company. But everything changed after when she had to leave, and I realised I had a crush on her (which, probably luckily, died out even before it became full-blown). Maybe that, and me being unsure of my future (while in the last year of studies, I wasn't sure about me continuing my career in exactly that field), led me to the nastiest depression I've ever had: I nearly stopped socialising, was a useless human being who was just staying at home for several days in a row and who was listening to heavy classical music non-stop (if I do that, that means I'm in a very, *very* bad state), and could do things I loved before (draw and play music). I'm grateful that couple of friends checked on me occasionally though.\n\nAfter that followed a bit better, but still quite passive year. During it I started to cultivate my interest in music more; and later on, after attending one concert of my favourite band, something *finally* clicked in my head, and I'm *still* motivated as hell to play and write music. And I really want this in my life; I'm working on it to actually be my life: I finally took a full time job (before I've only tried freelance) for saving up for a guitar and moving out to a different country for continuing doing that. Plus, I'm glad that I met a friend with whom I share this goal.\n\nI'm not sure whether someone will find it helpful, but your example reminded me of my path. Being a socially curious child, then completely uninterested in people, then regaining interested in people and then loosing passion for everything I cherished, and all this just to be reborn in a way. I started to love people and humanity immensely, and the way how we're able to connect in so many different ways, which I consider a miracle of the life. And how I became a much more stronger person with a clearer mindset.\n\nAnd it all stems from understanding yourself, and where you stand/want to stand in this world. That's what truly makes a person feel fulfilled I think. In my case it's bringing joy to people with what I do.\n\nJust as you did, I used journals, but that was mainly to pour out all of the heaviest stuff. That really helped at the moment, but when I re-read them now, I see how my perception of.. everything I suppose, finally became more defined and concrete. And it continues to form in a more conscious way. For example, that friend who left met her future husband this way; I've actually attended their wedding this winter. And you know what? I didn't feel anything of the jealousy specter. Just the acknowledgment that she's on her life path, and I'm on my own; and they're a great couple. (I do have to admit that our relationship with my friend became colder prior to the wedding, but that's a different story which deserves a whooole separate post; this one is already too long, but if anyone's curious I don't mind writing more).\n\nThe reasonable thing to do was to enjoy a current moment (that used to be *very* hard for me; still sometimes is, but I learn). So I've just danced like there's no tomorrow on that wedding. Music was great, I love to dance, the rest is clear; and I got numerous compliments on my moves from people, what's not to love about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for this wall of text; again, I really hope that someone will find this useful/inspiring/entertaining.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I'm stuck on the perpetual depressed stage need help / motivation 😭😭
1	What a great story! I love it - it resonates so much with me, too.\n\nLearning about the MBTI was so liberating for me. I was born into a family of feeling/sensation/extroverts and I always felt like a failure simply for being who I was. Letting go of all of that alllowed me love and appreciate who I was; I actually really, really like being an INTP now. I mean not \*everything\* about being an INTP - I still struggle with motivation - but I feel like so long as I go at my own pace, and give myself time to mess around, I'm slowly but surely progressing.\n\nThere's a place for every type. The world would be a much worse off place without us... but I also don't think that we need to justify our existence either. I firmly believe we're born as we are for a reason, and finding out that unique reason is the most important thing we can do. Sounds like you're doing pretty well in that department.  :)

1	There are brain scans that measure the amount of brain activity  no idea if it matches what you want.
1	The part of the brain that is active is critical. So it would not be one score.
1	I built something like that 3 years ago with an arduino and a star wars mindforce hack.\n\nI had two different programs.  One to measure deep concentration.

Then you just measure time spent in one state vs another and smooth it out for a more accurate measure.\n\nWish I could just give you my code, but its lost on an irretrievable kaput HDD

2	Poll for a theory on INTPs: Did you guys have a group of friends in your childhood with whom you where intimate?	
5	I had one close friend until sixth grade when she changed schools. After that I have never felt connected to any one. Like I talk to people but everyone feels more like acquaintances.
3	Never. My friends have been shit my entire life. Right now I have pretty great group of friends but in childhood I only had one friend for a long while I was really close with but he ditched me in middle school for no apparent reason.
1	I had a solid group of friends in my primary school (elementary) bit I think that's due to there only being 80 kids at school and everyone in my school lived in local villages so people naturally became friends. When I went to secondary school it all went downhill. Going from 80 to 1200 kids is a big big culture shock and I was the only kid from my primary that went to my secondary so I was alone for a while. 
1	Yep, past tense though.
1	Nope.
1	Intimate? Childhood? Nope. Not even now. My social life is terrible. 
1	In my elementary school days, I was much more extraverted and popular (I was the smartest in my class and really nice and funny). My artistic talent attracted many others, so I made 6 best friends over and other friendly acquantices over the course of the years. Then in my middle school, I bubbled down, got fewer friends 3 friends. In my second year of middle school, I made 1 best friend, who I would sit with during lunch. That's it, the others were just former friends and classmates. This went on to high school.\n\n\nI don't know if I was an INTP in my elementary school (I don't remember much), but I assume that my inferior Fe was well fed with junk food (aka compliments). I am was in a sugar high in my sparkley perfect world, but then that broke after puberty hit me. I became more self aware and slowly started closing off from others and eventually their compliments. So yeah, now I only have very few friends. \n\n
1	I never did btw, even with my closest friends we rarely hang out
1	I did have school friends that would change every year, but no best friends or anything.
1	I had one really good friend in early primary school  and then nothing until my SO
1	I had one but moved a lot until high school. By then I didn't care and knew college would be better socially. 
1	Nah. I had a couple people that I felt a connection with and the rest were just people from various social groups I hung out with. Honestly, I just felt like we were a bunch of assholes. Didn't really like anyone and felt like most people were boring clones of the same person.
1	Yeah. Not in childhood, but in adolescence, I was blessed with friends I'd die for and who I knew I could trust with my life. Another group of friends, I hung out with more often but always wished we'd be more mentally intimate. Those friendships have deepened now though, a decade later, and definitely become more intimate.
1	I always had a small group of friends that were okay with me even if I ditched them from time to time to do my own thing. But no, none of them were intimate in the sense that I talked with them about what I really think or share my weirder interests with. 
1	I met some of my best friends in grade 4 and 6 in primary school. I am now 24 years old and we are all still best friends, pretty much like brothers without all the fighting. I feel very lucky to have friends like this and I haven't really been able to make any other close friends, just acquaintances like most people have said here.  
0	Have you ever had sex with someone who annoys you?	Like all they do is fucking talk and talk and talk and it's like shut the fuck up and take this dick in your mouth. \n\n\nThis bitch never stops fucking talking. Going on and on about irrelevant shit. \n\n\nI fuck her anyway because I'm horny and my girlfriend blocked me when I said I wanted her to have my kid. Now she posts about space and fucking animals. Crazy ho. 
9	“Have you ever had sex” stopped reading there.\nNo

13	How do you feel about texts with exclamation marks?	Am I the only one that just gets triggered whenever your friend sends you a message that ends with that enthusiastic "!" ? \n\nFor some reason I feel like the exclamation mark not only adds distance between you and the person, but also makes it sound super fake, which is what irritates me. If someone said "It was nice to see you again!" It feels so fake to me.\n\n\n"Yea, that was such a good movie" sounds like an honest genuine opinion to me while "Yea, that was such a good movie!" sounds like you are saying something just to reply to me and you may or may not think it the movie was actually good at all. \n\nI understand that the exclamation point today is often used as a sign of politeness, but I just can't help but feel almost offended when I receive one. Its like wow why are you being polite to me, am I just some acquaintence you need to put on a good impression to? This triggers me immensely  and I absolutely hate it. Do you guys feel this at all? I've expressed this to my friends whenever they send me one and I always say please never send me one ever again lol.  
9	I'm very guilty of the -exclamation marks\n\nIt never actually came to mind but I tend to use it when I want to get a point across. \n\nBut with the way you put the examples next to one another. The one without the exclamation mark does sound more personal. \n\nHuh... maybe that's why me and my old friend are drifting? I'll try and use it less and see how it goes lol.\n\n
5	In my experience people often use them to convey excitement to be talking to you or to show that they like you.\n\nIt can feel a little tiring to then have to respond in turn with exclamation marks to match their enthusiasm but it’s just part of reassuring them that you reciprocate their positive feelings.\n\n
8	Tip: the real purpose of an exclamation is to convey sarcasm
4	Thats the factorial sign.  It indicates that you are supposed to run that text through the gamma function
3	it’s something done by soulless abominations in lieu of substance and meaning. take a good look at how truly vacuous and empty of a gesture it is.\n\nwhen you interact with these people you’re interacting with beings from a dimension totally void of soul; they’re an abyss of meaninglessness and when you look into their empty eyes you’ll get more of an idea how deeply void of meaning they are
2	I feel nothing. Original or real purpose is prob far from how it's used now. I use it to convey better communication to people who use/like them most.\n\nE: unless! We're talking about my favorite stuff. 
2	Seemingly random "emojis" is what confuses me.  Trying to figure out exactly what theyre trying to communicate.\n\nLike "why did you put 3 "100" emojis behind that?  It makes no sense!  I dont understand what you're trying to convey!"
2	I only use it to be polite with people I'm not close with. still bothers me tho 
1	[deleted]
1	I don't think I even notice when someone sends me an exclamation mark. I use them myself very sparsely and only when I am actually excited about whatever I'm sending
1	I use them often when designing web pages.
1	¡no es bueno!
0	They're fucked! I imagine the person speaking in a high pitched voice with like a broom in their ass! I use them if I'm trying to sound friendly, non-threatening or even ditzy! Usually the types of people that use them are also the types of people who end every text with xx
3	Would you trade your life for knowing the truth?	
17	I already have both. Would trade them for 5 inches of height.
7	Isn't that what happens when you die?  So eventually we all trade our lives for the truth.
4	When I left Mormonism it felt like I was trading my life for the truth. 
5	I already know the truth\n\nPee is stored in the balls
2	No. What good is the truth if there is no life. How do you utilize the truth?
1	What kind of truth?
1	Yes

2	None of you accept this as real or possible. It's been happening for 20 years.  
2	holy shit
1	The photo you posted is fake, current chimeras as just simple embryos or rat-mice chimeras
1	The first photo is an art piece:\nhttps://cosmosmagazine.com/society/the-art-of-patricia-piccinini-questioning-of-what-it-means-to-be-human\n\nVery well made, but the linear interpolation of two DNA sequences does not necessarily yield a valid creature.
0	Not a single person posting here is genuine INTP.	Right?\n\nJust lost ENTP.
9	INTPs are unable to communicate with other humans? that makes a lot of sense. nice analysis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/s
4	Unless you are implying INTPs cannot communicate with others, even on an anonymous form like reddit, there is no reason to assume most of us are ENTPs. Posting on reddit is something an introvert would like to do. 
4	Can confirm. I'm actually a giraffe.
3	why do you assume we don't subconsciously need validation
2	I am sure 100% of INTPs browse this sub but I am suspicious that INTPs cover 50% of the posters
2	You are almost correct.  I am a genuine INTP, but everyone else here is a wannabe. 
1	True, except that there is in fact pretty much no difference between an ENTP and an INTP. Both only have like a 10% difference between each other. So yeah. 
1	so you're assuming we are extroverts? 
1	Just depressed people in general
1	Lol what a troll
1	How so, friend OP?
1	We’re the biggest MBTI sub for a reason.\n\nWe hate socializing, and that makes us _very good at it_. 🙃
1	No True Scotsman.
0	No maybe somone is just shocked because that people like them exists at all.\nedit: and different people have different levels of introvesion
3	I’m either in a state of perpetual thinking or doing.	I can’t be functional at both at the same time. For example, if I’m trying to refine my mind to the point where I’m finally thinking clearly and making good decisions, it’s very difficult to get myself to take any kind of action because I’m constantly questioning concepts and decisions and it slows everything down, sometimes to the point where I don’t do anything. But the benefit is that I feel sure of myself.\nBut, if I try to work on a project for a week or two and solely focus on that, suppressing my indecision, it feels like I’ve lost a part of myself and I get stuck in a state of complete doubt afterwards that can only be fixed by getting in that thinking state again, which can take a week. I hate this loop and I don’t know how to fix it.
2	Why not sit down and try to trigger these states by your own will? Pin down what kind of energy fundamentally defines your physical experience in each mode of consciousness, then learn to remember the internal atmosphere felt during, in order to later recall (and thus recreate) it at will. With just a few hours of practice you learn to conveniently shift from one cognitive mode to another throughout the day. In the end it is about generating any kind of energy and learning to transmute it into the desired form, or frequency, which will then alter the frequencies of your brainwaves (gamma, theta, alpha...), and thus determine whether you are more engaged in actions happening within the internal or the external reality.
2	I can relate. I guess the solution is eitheir Think, then act (so, with a full thinking/planning phase, and once it's done, it's done. No modifications while you're applying, and eventually a diagnostic once you're done to see where you fialed or did well), or Switching back and forth quickly ? ("I don't know what to do between thoses two choices, but eitheir way, I can at least do this for now")\n\nNot like I'm doing the above myself, tbh, but no choice but to accept it, right ? Do other types (if it's an INTP thing) even think and act at the same time ? \n\n\n\n\n\n
2	thought process controlling your actions is correct because it's on a higher level than action, so keep that up.\n\nreflect on how to deal with this questioning that brings you to inaction. is it worth doing questioning for accurate thinking, or worth assuming you're correct for the sake of action? it probably depends on the situation. if so, can you create a way of evaluating the situation for the right decision? \n\nthe point is there are lots of ways to go about thinking about this. you just have to think about it.
5	How do you men wear you facial hair.	I wear a beard only because I find shaving everyday to be extremely inefficient.  Anyone relate?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: That might be sexist of me.  The ladies should feel free to post if they struggle with this.
3	Shave like once a week
3	Just a goatee sorta thing because my cheeks are quite poor for facial hair.
5	I go through cycles of shaving and regretting.
2	I can't grow a beard to save my life and I would hate it anyways so I'm clean shaven. \n\nSide note: My father is 6'6" and 300lbs., built like a brick house. He can grow the most manly beard there is. I'm 5'9" and got my mother's frame. 
2	Growing a full beard since august.  Pretty much just dont like shaving or trimming lol
1	I hate shaving too. I have a short beard. I trim it every couple weeks.
1	I never clean shave because my neck always gets terrible razor burn.\n\nBut right now Im on a full beard and full untrimmed stash kick. It's been growing for over 3 months now and I keep it maintained (brushed oiled etc)\n\nChicks dig it, but its messy as hell to eat (my stash tastes half my food every time) and I drink from straws whenever possible.
1	2 plats that go down to my chest
1	I'm keeping it trimmed to a short stubble. I don't mind shaving so much but the frizzy nature of my hair renders each close shave a nightmare the next day. 
1	Same. I have holes in it, but it starting to look not so bad.
1	I try to grow a mountain man beard, but it turns out to be a mountain boy instead.
1	Same as King Leonidis in 300
1	Haven't trimmed in 2.5 years, haven't been clean shaven in 3
1	I wear it because it looks good. I trim my full beard to 9 or 8 mm, 5 mm for the mustache. Could be denser on the cheeks, but overall I think I look way better with it, than without it. \n\nI'm a vain INTP, AMA.
1	Yep, I hate tedious chores. My beard trimming interval has grown and grown over time. Now I let it go for 6 months-2 years or so. I don't even like it being that long; I just hate the task of trimming it.
1	20yo male. I'm half Asian so the maximum amount of facial hair I get is a pedo-stache and pubes on me chin. Used to keep the pubes and shave the pedo, but I've been going 100% shave twice a week for about half a year now. I feel I look good and my friends say I look better so I'm good.\n\nEdit: HOWEVER, if I'm not gonna be seeing people for a long time then I'll go caveman. No shave, no shower, no anything involving hygiene.
1	I use hair clippers with no guard to shave my facial hair. I don't see myself shaving again unless it's a requirement to make 120k+ a year. 
1	I would have a beard... if I could grow a beard...\n\nIf I went without shaving for a few months, I would have a thin-density heroin addict mustache with a miserably failed white-knight neckbeard, fit for a fedora.\n\n&#x200B;
0	So people do you walk "mehanicaly"?	
4	I wouldnt say I walk mechanically, but  - like breathing - if I focus on my walking I become conscious of it and walk weirdly. For example quickly crossing a road or something.\nAccording to people who have seen me walking I apparently stride slightly when walking, so now I'm self aware all the time. \nBut when I think about walking as I'm walking I try and keep my body on the same level, sort of like a kestrel head as it's flying. That makes me look like I'm walking mechanically.\n I also walk quite fast, as I have OCD as it comes to walking. For example I view a crowded corridor or street to have walking lanes, so it peeves me of when a group of people all walk shoulder to shoulder in a crowd. It also somehow peeves me off when ppl don't follow my imaginary lanes, despite having no knowledge they exist. \nAny other INTP do this?
3	I sometimes talk or interact mechanical. Or show mechanical body language/eye contact. Never walked mechanical however.
3	I need to focus on paying attention to my surroundings when I walk so I actually do end up walking very mechanically
3	I have spent years teaching myself how to walk with an anatomically efficient gait. I'm fucking dynamic.
3	I've been told that I walk like "an unbroken pair of chopsticks."
2	When alone I tend to walk mechanically. When with others I'm focused on them so legs go on auto pilot.
1	Haha, when I was 16 a girl told me I walked like Frankenstein. To this day I still kind of walk weird--on my tip toes when I'm barefoot. Otherwise I walk normally but fairly fast.
1	Apparently one of my arms doesn't swing when I walk. 
1	Sometimes I do this thing where I place my heel and sometimes my toe at the edge of a crack or connecting piece on the floor. I'm not superstitious or anything but it's more like a game or painting.  Sometimes I then decide to step on the crack XD!!!

10	Fashion	Is it weird that I am an INTP male who is into fashion? I rarely see other INTP males with a good fashion sense
9	This does seem relatively uncommon, but I’m an INTP that’s super into fashion as well. Well, technically I’d say that I’m not into fashion (I don’t care about trends or rules of fashion), but I am very heavily into clothes. I really like coming up with different outfits and how much I like what I’m wearing can significantly affect my mood. 
5	meh, it might just be that it got your attention and your intuition did the rest. so long as you avoid uncomfortable clothing, im pretty confident that you typed correctly
4	I love fashion and wish I had more friends to talk about and expand my knowledge on fashion. I also enjoy art in general. I think looking cool is cool.\n\nI find fashion a bit paradoxical at times. On one hand I don't care how others think I look. On the other hand looking cool is something that can be achieved with a lot of outside thought, which I need. I find fashion to be a weird mix between independent and dependent. \n\nSome days I look ugly physically or fashion wise, or at least feel ugly. Although, it definitely has an effect on my confidence I don't allow it to own me and am able to ignore the ugly.
4	se trickster makes it nearly impossible  
2	I understand male fashion, but at the same time I don't care about my clothes.\n\nUsually I dress in a black t-shirt (with or without something printed on it), and shorts or jeans depending on the weather (it helps my employer doesn't have a dress code). It's kinda my personal uniform, a la Steve Jobs.
2	Btw , I always dress in an mostly all black fit
2	I can wear the most bland clothing and not care but at the same time I don't mind something a bit more fashionable either. Just depends when, where, what and my mood.
1	It's very uncommon but we exist!\n
1	You can be good at anything.
1	I could care less about what I wear
1	Haha. Im so don't give a fuck about my 'fashion'. I'm a male nurse so I have my scrubs provided by work. I have plain hanes t-shirts of various colors. 3 packs for $10. I have gym shorts of various colors. I have 1 pair of jeans, 1 pair of khaki pants, 1 pair khaki shorts. 3 polo shirts. 1 pair ofTennis shoes \n, 1 pair birkenstocks, 1 pair boots and 1 pair of black dress shoes. That's my entire wardrobe. I live in the south so it's 90% of the time I'm in gym shorts and plain t-shirt 
1	I make a conscious effort just because I know it is important. This can turn into being "into it" in my opinion.
1	I'm not "into fashion," whatever that means, but I dress nicely because I care about my appearance - both to myself, and to the people around me. Dress for success I guess. There was a study released a decade ago, I don't remember the source, which proved that people who dressed "up" for exams scored higher on the exams. Causative or correlative relationship? Debatable.
1	INTP female, hate fashion (its arbitrariness infuriates me) but love style 
1	I'd sort of like to but there are 4 factors that make it too inconvenient: money - obviously, being overweight, thinking it's a waste to just add or replace clothing items when I have enough in a good shape and most importantly, the inconvenience of choosing and trying different stuff in shops.\n\nI don't like spending a lot of time in clothes shops + rarely anything properly fits my taste in them. There's always something that makes me disinterested in a clothing item - usually to make it somewhat more "cool" or "old-fashioned" - I'd prefer really minimalistic looking practical stuff but there's always some sort of "stylish" detail that detracts from the potential perfection of the thing.\n\nOnline shopping could deal with that but the inconsistency of sizes is super annoying and makes me avoid it - it always feels like a gamble and the cut is difficult to judge. For example, I have 2 different pants of the same size from a certain company but ones are great and the other look baggy.\n\nI wish there was a service where you could scan your body and then customize like in video games (Watchdogs comes to mind). I'd spend a lot of time experimenting in that but I hate doing it in real life
1	I really enjoy it, but I'm a woman so that maybe makes it more typical. Then again I'm a lesbian...
1	Seems like more of an infp thing.  My infp sister is really into clothes...just not the clotges of the average person.  Shes into making her own clothes and wearing odd things.
1	Ggaaaayyyy \n\nNo I’m kidding 
4	Any J.Cole fans here?	If you're not a fan that's fine, ignore this post. If you are a fan, why are you a fan? \n\nWhat's your favourite song? Why is it your favourite? 
7	Big fan. Middle child just came out and is a good song.\n She Knows is my favorite song because I'm a fan of CULTS who were sampled in the song. Miss America is great  because of the shout out to Immortal Technique (also a fan) Forbidden Fruit, Tale of Two Cities and GOMD are also great.
3	She knows, & wet dreams. 
1	Big fan as well. Among the faves not already listed (Wet Dreamz, Tale of Two Cities): Love Yourz & Sparks Will Fly
0	INTP/INFP breakup help!!!	My ex(INTP) started med school long distance, and I felt so distant from him (he doesn't really express his love and I felt really insecure about it for a while now). He apologized that the time he uses to study and socialize is his priority and was feeling guilty about leaving me lonely so I had to cut it before I got hurt even more and I thought it'd help him only focus on studying. \n\nWe had our fair share of crying, he was the one that really tried to open up his emotions during the relationship, and now that I think about the breakup I was the only one that talked for two hours, wishing him good luck, while he sobbed over the phone. I'm now worried I might have hurt him and now he's going to bottle things up even more. \n\nIt's been three days, we've had our closure messages, and I really really miss him. I'm going to try and survive a month without contacting him so that he can move on. I accept the fact that he'll probably have moved on, but can't help but think maybe he's waiting for my contact. A few days before the breakup, he told me that he would be always waiting for me. I also told him I would genuinely like to be friends with him someday. \n\nA part of me wants him but I also want him to move on. What would he feel right now? Do you think he genuinely ever loved me? He's the one who confessed, but at the end I feel like he cared for me out of obligation. Sorry for the scatterbrained post.
9	InTP's are extremely loyal to those they care about. But also soul crushungly independent.\nIf you want to be with him, be with him. Just make up your mind. We hate indecisiveness, and are attracted to assertiveness. 
4	If you're thinking of making up, do it before he moves on. Because once he mentally (and emotionally, but not necessarily) moves on, your chances of winning him back are very slim. 
2	He's sad. He'd love to study med school instead right now but you dumped him. Probably hurts and doesn't make a whole lot of full sense. He won't forget you, but once a makeup lacks full logic to him you'll prolly never get dude back.\n\n\nF 
2	Poor men, getting so heavily emotionally invested in these creatures that can't help but always be rocking the boat lol.
3	I am a bit confused. It kind of sounds like both of you wanted to have a relationship, and you cut it off out of fears about the future.\n\nA lot of what you describe sounds like normal INTP behavior. INTPs have problems with distant relationships because for a lot of us, out of sight is out of mind, and absence does not make the heart grow fonder. It is not that we don't care. The thought just does come into our heads because there are so many other thoughts. Part of us also thinks that if we said "I love you" before, we don't need to keep saying it unless we stop loving you or you ask. I mean, we don't constantly tell our friends that we like them. \n\nIf he sobbed for two hours, he has very strong feelings for you. No way for me to know it is love, but the overall impression that I get is that he cared for you deeply. INTPs do tend to have very deep feelings for the people in their lives even if we do not show them all the time. I don't think that there is any question that you hurt him, but if the relationship is over, then that is unavoidable and nothing you did wrong.\n\nThe potential good news is that INTPs tend to be introspective and to to have some idea what they are like. When people tell us that we never say "I love you," we see that it is true. A lot of us also realize that our ways will not satisfy the wants and needs of most people in a deep relationship. We can and will change our behavior to meet those wants and needs.\n\nDid you ever tell him what you needed and were not getting? Did you tell him that you felt insecure about it? Do you really love him? We INTPs sometimes need to be knocked over the head with things, but we usually do not mind. \n\nBased on my own experience, when an INTP says that he will wait for you forever, he may not wait forever, but he will not be on Tinder the next day. I suspect that he is waiting. \n\nIf you actually care for him, you might consider talking to him and giving him another chance. Most people would reject an attempt to restore a relationship, but I think that INTPs are different. Especially if he he knew that you cut it off because you were insecure and lonely.  We are the experts on insecure and lonely. But if you do, you have to make it entirely safe for him. He has to know that being vulnerable will not just lead to more pain. \n\nI know this is a bizarre answer to your question. You have to understand that I have been married to my INFJ wife for 31 years. It tears me up to see relationships end for no good reason, and I am the eternal romantic optimist. If you want to end the relationship, then you should do so. Yes it will hurt him, but everyone is hurt when that happens. He may not deal with the hurt very effectively, but you cannot change that. If you want to end the relationship, you have done nothing wrong. In fact, you have been kind and graceful about it. \n\nI wish you the best whatever you decide to do.
1	If he knows that things are over for good then he will be okay in the end. On the other hand, since you were the one who ended things, any doubts about whether there is a chance to get back together might hurt him unnecessarily.
1	Yes he did love you
1	Why throw it all away for a minor bump?
1	You know I don't need her permission to do things. I really don't. Really. I mean really. I don't.
2	INTP deliberating on possible relationship	Long story short, I’m 28 [f] and he’s 23. We met online and our interactions were first sexual but quickly became affectionate and we developed feelings for one another. We expressed these feelings and it basically morphed into a relationship. After a month I ended the relationship for personal reasons, he said he understood, we lost touch for almost a month and he initiated contact, and we remained good friends but discussed how we still had affection for one another. After a few months I expressed my feelings for him and desire to be in a relationship again. He said we couldn’t say “yes” or “no” and would like to see how things would play out. We’ve had open communication and have expressed our thoughts and feelings to one another. He continues to be unsure of what he’d like to decide regarding being in a relationship and I respect that. We continue to talk every day because we have a continuous conversation through text. \nSo, I’m wondering, how can I give him space, meaning, should I be friendly but not flirty? Should I wait for him to initiate the conversation if our continuous conversation ends? In which ways can I allow him the mental space to process things in his own time and pace? \n\nGiven my infj-ness, i tend to overthink things but i also respect him and care about him, so I never want to be pushy or intrusive with my feelings. And also out of curiosity, given your guys’ intp insight, do I have a chance? Of course, i know there’s many factors, and i didn’t give the full details but the overall gist.  \n\nThanks in advance :)
3	I'd say give it a chance but he seems to be keeping you at arms length for now since you burned him once already and he probably wants to see a little more consistency out of you before he commits to you to make sure hes not getting baited again. Having our feelings withdrawn and drawn in is not pleasant for us. It may be easier for you to detach but from what you wrote it seems that he's wary of a repeat of your 1 month stint.\n\nIf you're sure this is for you OP then my advice would be to stay consistent and its probably going to be 4-5 months before he actually says hey lets make this official again. As far as I'm concerned he probably still has feels for you but you are pretty much on a probationary period so what you want to do with this info is completely up to you.
-5	You’re too old for him\n\nYou’re 28.  You have MAYBE 3-5 more years where having a child will be easy.  After that its highly probable to turn into a nightmare ride on the assisted feetility carousel, and your children are at high risk of birth defects if you have any at all.\n\nThat is not what he is going to want to go through at 28-30 years old. When you’re in your mid 30’s.\n\nThis relationship sounds like something teenagers do and makes absolutely no sense for either of you unless its just for casual sex\n\n\n
1	Maybe you people would know. Looking for a subreddit.	I often have ideas that have a serious content but I don't want to be taken seriously. Along the lines of poking gentle fun at things like religion and politics.\n\nUnpopular opinion - its not really an opinion, just more of an observation\n\nShower thoughts - this sub seems to be about silly things. It is fun to read at times.\n\nReligious and political subs - I'm not looking to be praised or vilified, which is what most likely would happen.\n\nAny help out there.\n\nEdit: To give you an idea what I am talking about\n\n- I can make a halfway reasonable argument that the events surrounding Donald Trump can be a conspiracy to elect a woman president.\n\n- Maybe area 51 is a distraction to keep people from looking for the real place that the US military is keeping it secrets\n\n- There is currently a pizza hut commercial that is a take on the song "I like big butts" so are they saying their pizza would give you a big ass?\n\nAgain, these are just ideas that come to mind and I don't believe it. In just playing with the idea
2	How about 4chan?
2	No restrictions on /r/INTP

1	Hey this subreddit is not about silly things.Our thought are momentous.\n\nSeriously, I came to MBTI later in life. I tested INTP but was not sure. I found this place, and everyone seemed a lot like me. First place I ever fit in. So then I spent some time in the subreddits for the other types. A lot of them made my skin crawl. None of them were populated by my people. This place is. That was all I needed to know.
1	You've already found the sub. It's here.
4	Would you give your DNA to a company like 23 and Me?	Do you trust them to not abuse your personal information?
8	I wouldn't even pay to have a DNA analysis. What's even the point? They do only ancestry, right ?\n\nI wouldn't trust them, but what would they use it for, tho ? They could sell it to someone, but what would that someone do with it ? All the data used is either to market to us, or spy on us. If it's just research purposes, I don't really mind, except that I would be paying instead of receiving money for my DNA.\n\nIt's not like your DNA can predict your actions.\n\nWell, there could be a Black Swan event in the near future, so might as well play it safe.\n\n  
5	As others have said, my personal information is already abused in a multitude of ways. I don’t particularly mind if a company has a sample of my DNA (which is but one sample of millions) and I’m not going to fret over my DNA being used in genetic research. There are much more significant threats to my security and privacy than a company using my DNA to research treatments for genetic disorders. 
5	The privacy apathy in this thread sickens me. \n\nFor what it’s worth I did 23&Me and it’s something I really regret. I did it rigghhhtttt before that one serial killer was caught because of a similar service. And it’s like, ok, this is now just a surveillance database. \n\nAnd the worst part of it is that their methods of genotyping are basically trash so you can have twins who get wildly different results. 
5	my personal information already abused by facebook, local online store apps and my phone service provider. why not add more things on the list? is 1 hair enough?
3	Isn't it known fact the info is bought by life insurance companies, or data brokers to sell to insurance companies? Why on earth would I 'trust' them?
2	My curiosity outweighs my cautiousness.
2	No, what if I want to become a serial killer in the future? That would absolutely ruin me.
2	Can’t ancestry dna companies sell your info to insurance and pharma companies so they can hike up prices on trending genetic illnesses?
2	No, 1. they are highly inaccurate this has been demonstrated on several occasions, 2. they are highly unethical, and untrustworthy 3. I get paid jack nothing for them making large sums of money off my data, and on top of that, they get paid 4. The science on DNA is relatively in its infancy and it's highly likely that rather than using it for good they will be using it for negative agendas
2	I mean, can they even do anything you're not giving them passwords and stuff
2	DNA is a very abundant resource, yours and mine doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.
1	Might as well.  Big data already knows everything about me.  I might as well get some info back from them
1	Just try to keep your DNA a secret. You're leaving it everywhere you go. And, as we saw with the Golden State Killer, there are already vast databases of your genetic relatives so your DNA fingerprint can be extrapolated. The DNA privacy game is already over.
1	I already did. As somebody else already said, curiosity outweighed caution. I want my genetic information, and a service like 23AndMe is a way to get it. There is a law that prevents health insurers from using genetic information to deny coverage, and even if they did, I think I would choose suicide over a life dependent on constant medical care or monitoring. You end up dead anyway. I've heard about the possibility of life insurers using genetic information to raise prices or deny coverage, but don't care that much about life insurance. I have it through my employer, but if I had to go through any sort of examination or application process to get it, I wouldn't bother.
1	Nope. I choose not to be a part of their possible data collection and experiment. 
0	Sometimes it feels like ENTP are just better than INTP	Just seems like they are more charismatic, more outgoing and better with people, more inventive, and faster responding than us. Like Ti dominants like learning....but once we understand the entirety of the system it loses its interest for us lol. And for Ti it has no desire to actually act on its complete knowledge. Simply knowing is enough for it. Thinking is primarily concerned with how to achieve practical goals and yet INTP upon learning how to achieve practical goals with knowledge no longer desires to even achieve it... like the one thing we are good at we don't even want to act on? ENTP on the other hand like to perceice what becomes a thinking goal but because their Ne is extraverted they desire to actually see it happen and actually create the freaking thing.\n\nI just don't understand how INTP are better in any way other than literally like...learning...to do nothing with it. It makes me frustrated.\n\nI used to think maybe since we were thinking dominants we are faster at solving problems, but ENTP are not only faster because of intuition dominant(until we have a holistic model with Ti...but they can achieve that too...) but also they actually act on it. Like once they achieve a holistic model with their Ti they would be more inventive with solutions from Ne. What good is being "focused" if it doesn't yield any real advantage...why would Ti dominance make you faster once you have a whole model? Couldn't ENTP just slowly arrive at the whole model too and then their dom Ne make them faster again... so it's like they are faster in the beginning...faster in the end...and they are better with people. Why be an INTP at all?\n\nNot only that ENTP is more creative because their Ne is not intrinsically limited by Ti's focus. It's just off the wall. Our Ti just lends a consistency to our art. At this point it's like : better at problem solving, more adaptive, better at making people laugh, more creative...wtf
6	I checked in with the ENTP people, and they all confirmed that they are "way" better than us. In fact, they said they are the best type. Then, out of curiosity, I asked all the other MBTI types, and they all said they were the best type. \n\nI was disappointed, but then the other types started to tell the others that they were not the best type. That started a big fight about who was best. Things got scary and I slipped out before there was any bloodshed.\n\nThe way I see it, we should take on whoever wins for the title. They will be weakened by the fight. If INTP is better, that would change everything and solve all my problems. I thought I was going to have to become ENTP, and that would have been a pain.
5	In my experience ENTPs don't achieve the same level of detail in their understanding. They're better at the higher level overview and reasoning about things from a more people-centric point of view. We're better at the super nitty gritty technical inner workings. Both have their place. I work together with an ENTP and I think we complement each other very nicely because of this difference.
3	They're faster/better at pissing people off. Loudly impatient, condescending before they fully understand situations. Jump the guns and don't finish stuff just like us sometimes. Louder versions of us that I've seen. Did I say they piss people off? \n\nMore to like about being us imo. \n\nE: also really stepping up Fe and other functions/tasks can get you better than them. Then you can go back to doing nothing with those skills until an ENTP tries you. 
3	We're better talking online. They're better in person.
2	It is not a contest.
1	>Just seems like they are more charismatic, more outgoing and better with people, more inventive, and faster responding than us. \n\nThat's if you care about being charismatic and quick witted. I'm more of an introvert so it doesn't bother me. I also enjoy taking my time solving problems so I understand it completely and don't miss anything.\n\n>Thinking is primarily concerned with **how to achieve practical goals** and  yet INTP upon learning how to achieve practical goals with knowledge no  longer desires to even achieve it... \n\nYou answered your own question. Like you said, thinking is primarily concerned with **how to achieve** practical goals so it has nothing to do with **needing to fulfill them** as it already knows how to if it ever needed to. \n\n>I just don't understand how INTP are better  in any way other than literally like...learning...to do nothing with  it. It makes me frustrated.\n\nWhy does it matter to you so much that INTPs are better? Not all INTPs are gonna be better/worse than the other types anyways. You seem to be putting a lot of emotion into this. I'd question yourself about your obsession with personality types.
1	There is no MBTI meta luckily, or we would have to worry about sucking. \n\nINTPs aren't good for nothing, you just have to determine what you're good at, what type of person you are, and where that fits in. 
1	Well now I have met the both. You two should kiss and make up.
1	We're not going classes in an RPG though, what you decide to do is more important than how. 
1	You're accepting your shortcomings by letting 4 MBTI letters dictate your actions. You're capable of taking action, you just need to do it. Stop it with "type envy". You are in control of your mind and body. Take some responsibility.
1	INTPs feel more comfortable with using logic (Ti) to examine past experiences  (Si), and then come up with new stuff(Ne), with a huge weakness being our inability to communicate effectively(Fe).\n\nENTPs feel more comfortable with coming up with new ideas (Ne) and telling others (Fe), and only after that do they use logic(Ti) . They also tend not learn from past experiences(Si). \n\nTo sum this up, we tend to concentrate on the reasoning behind things to come up with answers, while ENTPs think of many answers and then rule them out using logic. That makes more social, since they have many things to talk about, but when it comes to think rationally, it is something they actually have to try to accomplish, while to us it comes naturally.
21	I'm the most sarcastic, honest person I know	Should those things contradict each other? Why be sarcastic if you're an honest person, or vice versa?
13	Welcome to the club
12	You mean you don't willfully tailor your speech to manipulate others for selfish, petty reasons? Weirdo...
7	Nope. They typically compliment each other. Honest people typically develop a strong sense of sarcasm after experiencing having their statements rejected outright across a certain threshold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSarcasm then develops as a sort of defense mechanism mixed with a dash of reverse psychology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you were to say:\n\n"I don't think that is a good idea. Maybe we should try X?" The average person will reject it impulsively without fully considering it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you were to phrase the above as:\n\n"Yeah. That is a GREAT idea. There is NO way that can go wrong. X? pffft." It forces the average person to critically think  because rejecting that statement is an acceptance of the previous statement.
7	Conveying truth with sarcasm is an art. 
3	Sarcastic and honest or a passive aggressive asshole? 
2	Conveying truth with sarcasm is an art. 
2	Well, the Cambridge dictionary defines sarcasm as "remarks that mean the opposite of what they say, made to criticize .someone or something in a way that is amusing to others but annoying to the person criticised."\n\nNow I am a lawyer so I have a flexible personal definition of honest, but if this were a trial and you were my client, you would hang.\n\nSarcasm and honesty are antithetical to each other. If you are one, you cannot be the other. Given a choice, I would recommend honesty.
1	They don't.\n\nSarcasm is a way to be honest/say "You said something dumb" without saying it outright. It's not very nice, if I trust other's people reaction who don't like it.\n\n
0	I see a loophole. Every time you get caught in a lie you just say "I was being sarcastic". 
8	What’s your current obsession or rabbit hole topic?	For me lately I can’t stop watching videos debunking that humans have actually ever been to the moon. While in my mind I can see the possibility that we have been to the moon and the possibility that the powers that be just ran an elaborate hoax on us. \n\nThis topic is really sticking now though because my mind loves chewing on the bone of doubt and possible betrayals. HaHa!\n\nI’m looking forward to the next topic my mind will be consumed with. I’ve pretty much watched all the YouTube videos on this subject and it’s just getting redundant and annoying at this point. 😜🤓
8	The whole moon thing is flipfloppy for me.\n\nI can go for months fully believing that it was all a hoax.  And then for months believing we did go.  And it flipflops indefinitely.  \n\nBut...\n\nI eventually stopped caring, and now hate the topic with a passion, cuz it's a goddamn waste of valuable time, and I can never know the truth.  \n\nKinda like God.  I used to care so much, but now I'm just Agnostic and dont give a fuck at all anymore.\n\nSo it seems that once I realize that a definitive truth on a topic may actually never be attainable, I drop it.\n\nBut getting to that point of realization though, can take....years lol\n\nMy current obsession is the history of sex within religious rites.  God I'm so fucking wierd.....but also, probably not?\n
8	My current rabbit hole is rabbit holes.
6	Mormonism; grew up in it and until recently had no clue the real history behind it. Spoiler alert: it’s about a con man trying to get rich and get his dick wet, that went on to become a massive (relative) religion with over $50b in worth and control over at least one state in the union. By all scientific definitions it’s a cult, but of course no one on the inside can see that.
4	Lately for me it's been liches and trying to come up with a dnd character that would be enjoyable, fun, and able to become a lich eventually without tipping off the party for like 15 levels lol. 
4	Real estate investing
5	Building a bedroom in my basement. I'm well down the rabbit hole and mostly ironing out very detailed, specific parts of it at this point. I spend more time thinking about it than actually working on it, because I have kids.\n\nAlso, a revolving door of software architecture conundrums from work. These change daily/weekly.\n\nAnd designing a fence to build this spring/summer. The current one is about to totally fall apart. Gotta design something slightly unusual, so I'm not a boring normie, but pleasing too. Can't be too hard or time consuming to build, and can't be too expensive...\n\nMaybe putting up solar panels. Climate change keeps getting more grim and I can't believe how poorly we are handling the situation. I have already addressed most of the big variables at my disposal (transportation, diet, energy efficiency, signing up for renewable energy, training my kids to give a shit). So maybe solar is next. I don't really have a budget for it, but it seems like the best possible thing to borrow for.\n\nAnd then all the perennial background plans that rotate through my head for years on end... rewiring the remainder of the house, redoing the plumbing, running buried power to the garage, building another bathroom...
4	Psychedelics, aliens, super intelligent ancient races, Hinduism, cooonnsssppppiiirrraaacccyyyy thhheeooorrriiieesss, the universe is an organism, the earth is alive, I wasn't a massive hippy until three years ago the fuck
3	It's actually going around different personality type subreddits and spotting paterns, seeing how the different types interact, strangely enough every medium-large post has at least 1 self proclaimed INTP giving their opinion which is followed by like 3 more telling them that they are also INTPs
3	Octopuses. I’m incredibly obsessed with octopuses and I use any opportunity I get to talk about them.
3	This INTP subreddit has been my rabbit hole LOL
2	I really haven't had much as of lately, other than the normal, but the last one was pretty much most of the spacecraft and satellites in space and on planets. Where they are, whats inside them, how they work, are they still online, whats their remaining life, what data and pics have they captured, whats their history while online, ext. 
2	Getting good spine alignment and posture 
2	Mantis shrimp. And the fact if an eagle (or any bird) ever touched me, I'd dedicate my entire life to revenge on it. People think I'm playing! 
2	Russian Doll on netflix. I'm not done obsessing yet. I looked up the soundtrack, and I keep relating things in the show to myself or to my friends or to other stuff i experience(d) so far.
2	The moon isn't real you fucking moron. Stop getting stuck between manufactured positions and learn the truth 
1	Martial arts. Especially Brazilian Jiu-jitsu

1	Looking at 3D printing designs
1	idk abt moon shit, just kind of have an obsession with multivariable functions for some reason (and cones, like wtf)
1	Oof try the grEat pyramids and the sphinx, that was a real brain teaser for me.
1	The physiology and sociology of crucifixion
0	After release of my new video i will be gone for a bit	Until may 
1	Fans need 2 hold me down until then 🤫
1	Here is a [Fan](https://imgur.com/gallery/x1l5Jze) to hold you down till then.
1	MY ACC IS GONE LOLOLOLOLOLOL 
0	Cringing at certain words and phrases	I love words and languages and writing is cool, but many words just sound somehow pathetic to me and I cannot bring myself to say them even though I know it's completely irrational.\n\nAnd it's not even 'emotional' words always (although they often are), but stuff like 'warm soup' or 'cup of coffee' or 'fresh (anything)' lol. I like these things but when someone says it I'm embarrassed.\n\nI hope I'm not crazy lol, let me know if you relate at least a bit\n
2	So! Interesting thing, it's extrapolated from basic psychology, but you might like it.\n\nDo you know how traumas are formed? And Phobias? They have a connection, as phobias are basically traumas that were never dealt with. Someone was raped right next to a fruit shop, now the notion of nature  might terrorize them. It's not the best example but an example nonetheless.\n\nNow think about fetishes. They are (or, the way they are formed can be) similar, but related to  'positive' emotions instead, and often don't need to be treated. Apply this to your situation. Somehow, those words remind you of something else, either by association or by 'conditioning'.   \n\n\nSynesthesia is like a super-form of this, I think.
1	I can't say men or women without sounding horribly sarcastic
1	That sounds bizarre lol
1	I definitely kind of relate... I don't like the words sweets, crinkle, tender (common one)... I do think it is kind of my idiosyncrasies though
5	What does r/INTP think of Jordan Peterson?	
10	Observe him stringently and his 'intelligence' may very well be self proclaimed.\nI don't believe he is anywhere near having the insight Jung had of psychology, though he tries so hard to emulate him.\nIve maybe over analyzed his lectures, and Jung's for that matter, but Jordan does not have the same depth, so to speak, as Jung did.\nBut I will agree with Jordan on one point, and that is that Jung's intelligence is frightening. The fact he is able to articulate himself with such accuracy even when using a second language terrifies me of Jung even more.\nAnyways, the first few lectures of Jordan reeled me in as it did most of you, but after watching and rewatching his lectures, studying his tone, body language, and verbiage, I started to notice 'more'.\nI think he lacks true depth to his self proclaimed intellect, but he is definitely good at stringing jargon during discussions. Most of which, if you watch Jung interviews, can be articulated with such accurate simplicity, that and idea can be expressed without the excess vocabulary. \nSo I think maybe analyze Jordan a little further, as we should do as INTP's and don't accept him at face value. \nOtherwise, that's just my own opinion. 
7	I don’t have a very high opinion of him. 
4	why think about jordo when i could be thinking about things worth thinking about? 
6	I remember someone mentioning him here before, and then somebody else was like "who, the guy who writes self help books for incels?"\n\nThat's pretty much spot on.
4	He's pretty spot-on about what he chooses to speak about. He does willfully forget about topics that would destroy his career. He does have a lot at stake and has plenty of time left to defend what he's already done. Some might say at this point, he's content being a bulwark. I say bravo.
2	The few things I watched of him were not that bad, but it was way too slow for me. He also says very basic shit, doesn't he ? It's just that he gets attacked for it, but it's not like he said anything new, or his knowledgeable on all the topic he talks about...\n\n \nI initially disliked him of sheer contrarian tendencies when he was everywhere, the whole "He's like a father for young men" was pretty annoying to me. Like, think for yourself, who the fuck needs a guru ?
2	Pseudo-intellectual but he has probably motivated a few young men to get their shit together a bit
2	He's a very important voice in a sea of stupidity.
4	I like him. He gets unfairly criticised by left (and right) wing ideologues that can't see outside of their narrow worldview.\n\nHe does say some outlandish things, like the paintings of snakes having sex pointing towards the ancients having secret knowledge about DNA and unfortunately some of his fans seem to worship him and can't just throw their hands up and say, yeah, maybe he doesn't have all the answers.\n\nI listen to his podcasts and and he's a great thinker and reflector and you can really see his experience and value. I haven't read his book yet though. It's also very refreshing as a theist to have a reasonable intellectual that I can listen to. This New Atheism philosophy BS is just egotistical nonsense. I know he is pretty coy on his religious beliefs but I don't think he's found the answers yet, and maybe he never will, but like I said, it's certainly a refreshing change from the New Atheism BS.\n\nTake the good from the things he says and you'll become a better person for sure.\n\nEDIT: Case in point in this thread with the narrow worldview. You're an incel if you long for a meaningful monogamous relationship and building a good life instead of slaying pussy and partying lmao.
1	what ew celebrity
1	Fuck him
1	his voice annoys me so i can't watch any of his videos.
1	Personally. some of his ideas seem alright to me. Other ideas of his I disagree with. I have definitely had trouble with his followers becoming irate and defensive, and ignoring my longer arguments. If he improves lives though, I'm with others and am in favour of him.
1	Kind of how when people said Donald Trump kept it real (lol), except JP is trying to help people help themselves be better members of society when so many people can barely function. So hey, I’ll take it.
0	He keeps it real 👌
0	He’s kind of a bluepill cuck, however he says things that are extremely illuminating and does a great job triggering lefties so overall I think he’s great, roughly speaking\n
3	Do you have a retirement plan	not right now because contributing a certain amount of my paycheck to something that's not fully guaranteed nor satisfactory to my current trajectory in life does not appeal to me atm.  
2	Same but I'm only 20. Everybody says you can't be too early though.
2	You might want to look into the long term effects of compounding interest. 
1	I do. I contribute about 5%. Trying to make a game of keeping more in my bank account than my retirement account, but failing because I'm terrible at saving. \n\nWorst case scenario and the economy crashes, it's not an amount I'd be too bummed about yet. 
-1	Yeah and your opinion is really stupid so I hope you are an attractive female
34	Am I the only one who walks faster than everyone I know?	I get impatient in narrow walkways.
30	No one shall walk in front of me, to pass is my mission. 
21	When I'm alone I walk quickly, but when I'm with someone I match their pace.
11	I do this. Sometimes I feel like everyone else is in slow motion. 
10	I'm either hyper focused in thought while borderline sprint walking towards whatever my destination is, matching the walking speed of whomever I'm traveling with, or walking extremely slowly while taking in all of my surroundings. There are no other walking states for me.
6	Nope, I avoid crowds and thus I tend to walk faster
6	Well, I don't know how fast all the people you know walk, but I do walk pretty fast. I hate spending time with people in public places, it's such a waste. 
7	Physical activity is pretty much a binary on/off for me, and yeah, I guess my default walking speed is double the average at the office.  Not great when you're constantly looking at the floor. . .
4	I always struggle with this, I'll walk ahead of people I'm with even my girlfriend. I dont know why, I just feel like I have to walk at a pace I'm comfortable with and I find it really hard to throttle it. 
3	My body has always been trying to catch up with where my brain is. It was worst in high school. I have learned to relax and slow down, but not until I was 40.
3	I do, I also unconsciously walk completely silent. Like I don't mean to, I just don't make noise when I walk.
3	Me & my boyfriend are both INTPs, we both walk like motherfuckers
3	I've thought about this exact same thing. Everyone is so fucking slow it blows my mind.
2	I always chalked it up to being above average in height and having a much larger stride. Generally, I feel like 80% of people walk at a pace I consider excruciatingly slow. It's uncomfortable / unnatural for me to slow down.
2	wanna race
2	Ugh, my wife hates when she has to walk any long distance with me
1	Not me, I walk sloooowerrr. I live in NYC though and I think everyone here is either on coke, or too much coffee, or both.\n\nENFPs walk the fastest IMO. Always in such a hurry to the next fun thing.
1	I'm sure there are many people in this world that walk faster than you and also faster than everyone that you know.
1	I’m the opposite. Spent quite a bit of time walking around some very dense areas in HK. Thing learned is that walking slower than the baseline means that those  faster will navigate around you, thus sparing one from the cognitive load of negotiating course adjustments. Much nicer. What’s the rush? 
11	What do you do with your opinions?	I share them with close people if we bring up the subject. But on the internet or with acquaintances I mostly tend to keep it to myself, not because I'm afraid to get it out there (and no matter how ordinary or controversial they are) but because I don't want to get into a position where I have to argue with a random person I don't care about. \n\nI often assume everyone will have their own logic and it would be a complete waste of time to try to convince someone that they are wrong. What am I to them? What I say shouldn't matter just like it doesn't matter what they think either. I would rather let them be wrong even if they are so wrong it infuriates me a bit.\n\nAnd + there are some subjects I have multiple opinions on, because sometimes I just cannot decide what works and everything gets too contradicting. \n\nAll that said, I don't mind people who do the opposite (even though I really don't see the point in arguing with strangers), as long as they aren't throwing suspiciously extreme statements around just for the sake of getting a reaction because that's even dumber.
5	shove'em up my ass
3	I mostly tell people they are facts and browbeat them into submission if they disagree. Then again, I am an attorney, so it is my job.
3	post it on reddit and argue with my right-libertarian friends (I wish I knew a single fellow centrist IRL)

2	Only when somebody says something particularly stupid will I call them out on the internet, but usually I'm the same as you.

1	if logic is challenged meaninglessly (as in without moral reason or good cultural/emotional reason) then i will pour out exactly the minimum amount required to do the damage needed, unless my purpose becomes to destroy (in the case of some dumb mannerisms), in which case all relating to the topic go out (assuming theyre complete, without any discontinuities)
1	I either laugh if they’re wrong or just walk away. It hurts when someone is factually or logically incorrect, but I see no point in correcting them if it’s not life or death. They can continue to be wrong, just as long as I don’t have to hear about it

15	Just Thought Of A Very Effective Way To Program Emotions Into An AI	Emotions flow through humans and express themselves in a number of ways. Its like a disease and symptoms. (not saying emotions are bad) emotions as a whole are the guiding force, but specific emotions like happiness are like symptoms. they are the expression of the end result. The typical approach would be to try to try to find and determine every emotion and every possible thing that effects that emotion. but that is a very complex daunting task. probably near impossible. but thats not how emotions work. That is working backwards. At the core of emotions they are simply a positive and negative feedback loop guiding actions. so to program emotions you just need to program positive and negative feedback loops. instead of creating binary actions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen the question becomes how do you figure out which things to create a positive or negative feedback on? well why start from scratch? use what we already have. Program a system to read human body language. program it to figure out how humans are feeling, and put all those feelings on a scale of positive and negative in varying degrees. make the core programming of the machine want to see positive emotions in others, and avoid negative emotions in others.  from there you let the AI do its thing. Let it experience life. let it experiment and see how its own actions effects those around it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt that point it is not much different then a human. It has emotions that guide it, but thought it what drives it. it can think and make realizations about things, and can alter how it acts or behaves, but at the core root of itself it is bound by its emotions, but cant truly change how its emotions effect it.
6	I enjoyed this, but I have my doubts.  First, I do not think that emotions are "simply a positive and negative feedback loop guiding actions." Whatever, they are, they are more complicated than that, and they only guide actions in a roundabout way. Anger may make me want to throw something, but I have to decide to do it. The key to emotion regulation in people is to see the emotion as a thing that is happening rather then the person himself. AI would need to be able to choose how to react to an emotion.\n\nYour statement that people "can't truly change how its emotions effect" them is contrary to the current understanding of emotions.  We cannot control which emotions we feel, but we can control how we react. Thinking about what caused an emotion will just throw gasoline on the fire. We INTPs respond to emotions that way all the time. Something makes us feel sad or angry, and we try to use our brains to analyze why. So we replay the events in our head, which just evokes the emotion again. Emotion regulation starts with seeing and naming the emotion, but seeing it as a thing. It is "I am angry. So what and I going to about it," not "I am angry, what made me mad?" A lot of time, the right answer is "I will do nothing and let this emotion pass," or "I will take a cold shower," or "I will call a friend."\n\nSo your AI must first generate an emotion and then determine how to respond to it.  That seems like it might be possible.  The good news is that you could limit the range or responses to what is acceptable. AI should not murder someone because it is angry.\n\nYour idea about sensing peoples' reactions to gauge their emotions is intriguing. There is a lot of science on how different emotions are expressed, so you would have some data to start with. But sensing the emotions of an AI user is very different from the AI having its own emotions. However, I could imagine AI that monitored the emotional manifestations of people and modulated its actions accordingly. So when I get pissed off at my computer for deleting my document, it would know. I like that idea. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFascinating thought.\n\n&#x200B;

1	Something tell me i dont belong in this group
1	i do not like hardcoding id prefer starting from scratch
1	just have a recursive random generator (like minecraft biomes as a function of neighboring biomes' heat), with some sort of variable that defines personality. for example, try the implicit function for the circle, and your constant determines how much in a mood swing the x and y coordinates change (use a parametric function for this actually, x=cos(a\*t), y=sin(a\*t) woud work, t is time and a is your random mood swinger variable)\n\nand whatever the output emotion is is comprised of a certain multidimensional vector where each dimension represents a different variable aspect of humanity, for example; logical impairment, emotional volatility, recklessness, sociability; these are then inputted into their respective functions and put back into the operating system to output a behavior (also with a random variable, called c for choice)\n\nthe choice variable shouldnt be that hard to make, as you just have quadratic functions that output solutions of 0 or 1 (binary) and have many of those to yield a more meaningful "choice".\n\nfor the random generator, just use the 5th decimal place of the cpu temperature

2	May I have some insight and advice on my INTP lover?	Before I bring this up (if I still need to) I thought I would consult other INTPs for further understanding. And perhaps I should try to posit if he feels the same. For starters, I am in INFJ. My INTP and I got together in September of last year. We were both really busy when we got together and so most of our communication was via text or voice/video chat. We rarely met in person. Now, we are less busy and around each other almost 24/7 (I have prompted him if he would like space from me and I try not to insert myself in situations he’s in), but the weird thing is that I somehow feel as if he likes me less? He is not any less kind or nice, and still does nice things but I somehow feel less “loved?” I am unsure if it is my poor self-esteem or if it is because he doesn’t *say* the things he would *type*, if that makes any sense.\n\nHe did write me a lot of handwritten notes that made me smile a lot. \n\nI suppose it’s that INTPs are better suited towards writing sometimes than speaking? \n\nAnyway, I guess my real question is the following:\n\n1. How do I tell if an INTP is losing interest?\n\n2. I’ve been thinking about this and I’ve decided that if my INTP doesn’t love me in a year or so, I would leave him but still be good friends, I hope. This is not a deadline or punishment of sorts but I want him to be happy and very much in love with someone. I don’t want him to waste time with someone he doesn’t love. Do you think this is fair or none of my business as a decision to make? I feel it’s leaning towards the latter but I feel I’m letting him down as a partner.
3	Have you talked to him about the way he displays affection towards you? Our natural Fe is inferior and our Fi is nonexistant; I feel like this more insecurity from you. I dated ENFP's in the past and they constantly came at me with the whole "Oh you don't love me anymore because I never hear you say I love you". For me words of affirmation just weren't my love language. I showed I cared for her in other ways.\n\nWriting for us is often better because it allows us to get all those complex thoughts out of our head and onto a succinct piece. It often offers more clear communication to whomever we talk to; Instead of the opposing jumbled mess that happens in our brain and out of our mouth, writing is the superior way of finding out what is really going on in our heads.\n\nI think you are assuming the worst and rather than assume you should confirm. There is no harm asking him directly if he doesn't love you anymore. We often become complacent once we are comfortable and maybe you need to also let him know that he needs to keep up his effort cuz you aren't married yet ;).
3	Great timing.  There was a post here in the last few days about the types of wives and girlfriends. I have been married to my INFJ wife for 30 years and several other people chimed in with lengthy marriages.  I have come across several references to the INTP/INTJ pairing as the "golden pair." For example, [https://pairedlife.com/compatibility/The-Golden-Pair-The-Compatibility-for-an-INTP-and-INFJ-Relationship](https://pairedlife.com/compatibility/The-Golden-Pair-The-Compatibility-for-an-INTP-and-INFJ-Relationship) and [https://personalityjunkie.com/09/infj-intp-relationships-compatibility-part-i/](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/infj-intp-relationships-compatibility-part-i/). You might enjoy those.\n\nNo on to your specific question, I am going to go out on a limb and guess that what you saw of him in texts and chats is probably more accurate than what you are seeing now. As a group, INTPs seem to be more advanced intellectually than emotionally, at least at first. A lot of get nervous in direct social communications because we have no time to think things through. There have been times when I wanted to talk to my wife about some issue, and I typed up my thoughts in a 12 page documents. Man, did she ever hate that.\n\nAnother thing that may be going on is that INTPs can sometimes disappear without leaving. We will check out and check into our heads and not notice the time. That is particularly true if we are comfortable in a relationship. It has to be frustrating, but we understand you to hear a lot of the things we leave unsaid.\n\nWe also have a fear of becoming clingy, and we can withdraw if feel like we are losing control. An INTP will not want to control you, but he will want to control the situation.\n\nAnyway, a lot of what you describe sounds like me in my 20s. I never loved my wife any less, but there were times when I assumed that she knew already. You say that he does nice things, and that probably is very significant. My wife loves popcorn, and I make it for her all the time. She does not notice, but I always give it to her as a token of my love. Maybe if you recognized the things he does for in a nice genuine way, that would make him feel good.\n\nAs good a match as INTP/INFJ may be, there is another problem. A lot of INTPs do not have much relationship experience, and we can go into a relationship expecting our lover to accommodate our wants and needs without thinking of hers.  It is not that we are selfish, just oblivious. My wife has told me on several occasions that she needs more ratification and affection, specifically meaning non-sexual affection. She is a clever woman, and each time she did, she approached it by validating and expressing affection for me so that I would not think it was a rejection. When I realized what she needed, I was thrilled to give it to her. It never felt like a burden, and satisfying her wants pleases me as much as pleases her.\n\nLastly, you talk about giving him space. He will love the sound of that, but it may not be what he wants. When we are single, we INTPs like to say that we like to be alone because we are alone and who wants to admit that they are lonely? But when we are alone, we check our tests and chat online. What I needed, at least, was a block of time to think or read without being interrupted. But it was still better if she was around. When I told her that, she said that she did not need to talk all the time and would love some time to read. So now we spend a lot of time alone together. Sometimes we are in adjacent rooms, sometimes we are apart in the same room, and then there are my favorite times that we lay against opposite ends of the couch without our legs entangled and covered with a blanket so we can both read. I just love that.\n\nYour relationship sounds wonderful. I think that he knew what you were missing he would love to deliver it.
3	1. ask him directly whether he loves you like before, this candid approach should give you all of the information you need\n2. your reasoning is 100% fair, and i (as an intp) definitely would agree to and even create similar conditions\n\nas a Ti dominant, writing is definitely easier for us, although every now and then i get put into overdrive with a stupid custom/mannerism/tradition\n\nEdit: after reading your reply to /u/meapussie i think that rather than love, appreciate strikes intps the strongest, and since appreciation is an aspect of love (not love in entirety) and is also the most genuine aspect of love, this powerful word usage could very quickly get your answers with as little harm as possible (although if he says that he does indeed appreciate you, you should inquire as to what aspects of your PERSONALITY he appreciates, and try to get him to be specific, although this might be difficult and take a significant time on his part. anyway, if any relationship/friendship with an intp doesnt work out, then either (in the case of relationships) youll still be close for what you have shared, or in the case of friends, closer to acquaintances (although you might have awkward moments if you both end up making eye contact). the only time i would outright end a relationship/friendship would be if the other person outright betrayed me (for selfishness, not logic or societal causes, for which i view as a sacrifice, not a betrayal).\n\n>For starters, I am in INFJ.\n\nyou are an\*\* INFJ\n\nin is a preposition, an is an indefinite pronoun (i think, but the point is theyre very different. its kind of like infj and infp, one letter makes a huge difference)
1	> Now, we are less busy and around each other almost 24/7 (I have prompted him if he would like space from me and I try not to insert myself in situations he’s in), but the weird thing is that I somehow feel as if he likes me less?\n\nOutstanding move.\n\nI'm sorry for laughing, but what makes you think never being here will help your case ? That whole "INTP need space" or "introverted me time" or "to recharge your battery" is kinda bullshitty in the first place, but you're taking it to eleven.\n\n> I suppose it’s that INTPs are better suited towards writing sometimes than speaking?\n\nNot really. Both have their good and bad points.\n\n> Do you think this is fair or none of my business as a decision to make? \n\nI think no plan survives Contact with the ennemy.
1	Spending 24/7 together will do that\n\nThey say you use your boat more the farther away it is.  The same might be true for girlfriends.\n\nMoving in with someone before marriage promises nothing and delivers
1	INTP   INFJ\n\nTi         Ni\n\nNe       Fe\n\nSi         Ti\n\nFe       Se\n\nTe       Ne\n\nNi        Fi\n\nSe       Te\n\nFi         Si\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe two personality type are not the most compatible. I have an INFJ mother, I know they can have trust issues and generally worry about the intentions of of others. It seems you're not getting the emotional validation you want and the problem with that is that you both have Fe in the main functional stack. Meaning you both are looking for social ques and affirmation from each other. Fe generally will adopt the emotions of others within the vicinity to maintain social harmony. As opposed to Fi which will project its emotional state regardless  of outside influences. This is why Fe works better with Fi.  Fi will state how it feels and Fe will easily pick up on that. So think of Fi as an source and Fe as an absorbent. You're having a hard time picking up his emotional display of love he naturally doesn't emit emotions. Basically both of you are trying to absorb each others emotions and no one is producing them.  It's even worse because his Fe in the inferior and Fi in the demon. Now he has Si in his function stack which is likely to make him very loyal to you. INTP will often display they care for some in non emotional ways. I do know that in general that Fe likes to be satisfied by having the actions you do for people acknowledged and to be valued. If that's the case you won't get that affirmation in a emotional response. He might state his thoughts in a unemotional way on how he values your actions. The problem is the INFJs have Te trickster  and tend not to pick up on the thoughts of others as much as they do feelings. However, if you can accept the incompatibilities and focus on the things you already give each other than it can work. However, I assume because of you Ni and Fe you have an ideal image of how your relationship should be that you possibly want to express through your Se needs.  If you focus on giving him good experiences with your Se his Si will remember for all eternity and will cause him to be loyal. 
5	Advice for INTP who want to be entrepreneurs in the future	Either leave the house or start looking into new products and inventions. Part of the problem with Ti as that it is a bit like doing math in your room. It's truth that is independent of context. As jung put it: "  Its truth, however, is so universal and symbolic, that it must first enter into the recognized and recognizable knowledge of the time, before it can become a practical truth of any real value to life. "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course any time that we use Ti we tend to have an eye towards valuable knowledge to be utilized in the real world, but you actually have to know what is in the real world to enter into the recognized and recognizable knowledge of the time. To give an example: a business needs customers(a ti truth)\n\nSo how are you gonna get your customers? Newspapers? No that'd be like building a business for the 1900s. You would use social media probably as well as online selling websites such as amazon. In order to know these things though you sort of need to have needs which INTPs don't have as a result of a fairly minimalist lifestyle(with the exception of splurging on drugs and food). Having a need forces you to seek out how you can get that need solved and that would refer you to the ways others solve problems. Once you become aware of the limitations of those mediums(the context that actually exists TODAY relative to the Ti form or model in your head), you can not only see areas for improvement but also how to use them to achieve your business goals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilarly, being aware of the newest inventions on the market(or outsourcing that work to someone else and have them give you the knowledge ;) lmao) will allow you to compete in the market better. Secure future cash flows.
2	I disagree that leaving the house in necessary to understand the surrounding world, or that you will get any prolific business insights by doing so. \n\nIn your example, you only address the need of customers and both of your solutions are online solutions. \n\nThrough meditation, I can not only know exactly how the outside world is currently, I can also view into the future and make accurate predictions. 
1	I am totally lost here. Entrepreneurs start with a product or service. Just what do you want to create? Create comes before customer and sales.\n\nYour comments about valuable knowledge to be used in the real world and not having needs because of a minimalist lifestyle seem are amusing but weird in a sick sort of way. You might want to consider a 9-5 job.

Everthing about this would be great. I've always been good with story ideas so it would be nice to put them on a page but I hate writing normally. However the number 1 perk of this would be that I could work from home and never have to leave my house.\n\nSorry for rambling but i'm guessing we all do that here.\n

3	Have you ever taken the Enneagram test?	Personally, I feel like the MBTI and Enneagram are the only 2 tests make sense to me. My MBTI is INTP (of course!) and my Enneagram result is type 5. These 2 results are pretty much matched!\n\nI’m curious about everyone’s else. Are your Enneagram type similar to INTP?
6	Intp and 9w1
6	I actually prefer the Enneagram system over the MBTI system. I find there is more commonality in enneagram types (numbers 1-9) than there is even between INTP to INTP. I've met plenty of say INTP vs INTJ 9's and we really are more similar over enneagram than we are over MBTI. Even between INTP's a 5w4 say is very different than a 9w8. Point being, when someone gives you their enneagram type, its much easier to tell what that person is like than if someone just plops down well I'm an INTP. There's a certain quality to enneagram that allows you to grasp the straws of a person's core personality without having to go into detail. Once you've met a few of a certain number of the same number for example enneagram 5's for instance which most of you guys who are INTP are; you start to know what to expect from a person behaviorally if they divulge their enneagram type to you.

1	Is there a particular political ideology any of you follow?	I’m an anarcho-capitalist. 
3	Not really. I live in France, and currently, it's not like there was really multiples options...\n\nThe guy I agree with the most is François Asselineau, who's talking about a Frexit (basically, as long as we are inside the EU, we don't really havebpolitics inside the country anymore, and the French people doesn't feel listened to since basically 2005, you can see that with Sarkozy and Hollande not being reelected, Hollande not even being allowed to rerun, or the current Anti-Macron protests. Almost 4 months in.) \n\nHe's the only guy who actually addresses that problem.m, and has a clear program. (The rest is Bs ideology and posturing). So yeah, my ideology is currently to be anti-EU because I don't buy that BS anymore.\n\nI guess it kinda makes me a Gaullist (Which basically means being pragamtic... Even though it doesn't mean anything to you guys, and doesn't mean anything even in France even though everyone use the word.) 
2	It’s so annoying. I see so many people with such strong opinions on which political ideology they follow and equally strong opinions about the ideologies they hate. But I see them as equally flawed. There are great points in every argument and then there are terrible ideas in them. So, in Australia where it is compulsory to vote, what do I do? Just pick the best of a bad bunch? It doesn’t help when topics such as renewable energy, climate change, robots taking over the workforce and human exploration of space, which I consider important, are hardly addressed. Instead of working together for a common cause, politicians seem intent on dividing the nation based on their party or personal interests. Which considering the age of some of these people, seem to be very short term interests. I’m not sure on other countries, but that’s my vibe anyway. So do I follow any? I don’t think so? I have my own goals and problems and am content with working around what ever issues the government or society builds around it self. 
1	What are you doing in your life to support your beliefs?
1	I think it's difficult to say what type of ideology I have because it's very motivated by my own value system. I look at not only right or wrong, but smart or stupid. I obviously tend towards decisions or ideologies that cater more towards right and smart and stay away from those that I perceive as wrong and stupid. \n\nA big reason why I supported Trump during the during his campaign was because he seemed anti-SJW and against this new wave of liberal nonsense, like identifying as a chair or attack helicopter, as if that was a real gender. I think the wall as an idea is ridiculous, but I think the US needs to take a harder line towards immigration anyway and start penalizing illegal immigration. 
1	Stick it to the Man
713	Oh snap!	
111	I diagnose you with INTP
43	Lol can confirm - I’m an IxTP and actually do have a diagnosis of ADHD.
14	I hate how people see being introverted as some mental disorder 
19	I feel so attacked. Sometimes I just can’t tell what’s my personality and what’s my ADD oh no.
7	I'm sure I would have been diagnosed with some attention deficit disorder or another had that been A Thing when I was in school. 
25	I found this thread through browsing r/popular, so I don't know a lot about this community. But I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD, and for anyone just looking through comments, I'm gonna lend my two cents.\n\nIf you have even a slight suspicion that you have ADHD, I highly recommend doing your research and getting an evaluation if you can. You know when you're watching a television show, and there's a big twist that you can't believe, but when you rewatch you see all the little clues and signs? Yeah, that's ADHD. \n\nBy doing research, I was able to see my behavior for what it was, get confirmation that I wasn't just lazy or destined to fail, and forgive myself for past mistakes. I've received help (therapeutic for right now but I'm going in for a health evaluation to see if medicine is right for me). More than anything, is that it feels like my body and my mind aren't a mystery for me anymore. I found people who are experiencing the same struggles I'm going through, the same financial and social issues, and even the same interests. I don't feel alone or lost, or at least not as much.\n\nWhat you need to know about ADHD;\n\n1. A lot of the symptoms seen like normal, everyday things. If you're experiencing them in ways that affect your grades or work, then it isn't normal.\n2. You are not dumb for having ADHD. ADHD works to slow down the processing speed of your mind, making it difficult to remember or act on important tasks. Imagine your mind as being a lake and an ocean, with the lake being new information and the ocean being old. Neurotypical people have a river connecting the two. People with adhd have a garden hose. You can have as vast an ocean or as deep a lake as you want, but without the right help you simply can't learn your way out of it.\n3. ADHD is a spectrum, and will affect everyone differently. There are 3 types of ADHD, and all those types of a lot of variance and crossover. It will affect you differently depending on your gender, your socioeconomic position, and whether or not your one of the many people who has ADHD paired with another tendency, like dyslexia or bipolar depression. In addition, some people will be borderline, where they have trouble focusing or acting on important tasks but not to the extent of someone who is on the far end of executive function. Even if you do not have ADHD, it can change your life to seek help.\n4. There are a lot of myths and mysteries surrounding ADHD. The image most people have of it are of a restless 7 year old boy turning into a zombie after being prescribed pills by neglectful parents. That is simply not an accurate image. Firstly, ADHD is not caused by parenting style, but by the biological structure of the brain. You can give a person with ADHD the best parents in the world, and they'll still have difficulty in certain places, and those difficulties can and will persist into adulthood. Secondly, restlessness is not the only or even a necessary symptom of ADHD. Thirdly is the idea that medicine is the only help you can get for ADHD. A lot of the improvement in my life is directly from me and those around me creating situations where I can succeed, such as professors giving me thirty minutes more to complete tests or having an additional set of notes I can look at after class. Just general therapy, that is having someone to talk to from an outside perspective has also really helped. Fourthly, and perhaps the most prominent of the myths, are medicine. Every medicine has side effects, but I am fucking sick and tired of the myth that medicine like adderall would somehow delete your emotions or creativity, or is equivalent to meth you get off the streets. It is not. It allows you to focus your emotions and creativity, to remember and actually do tasks you might not do otherwise. Many people with ADHD are thankful that their parents sought help for them when they were young, and many more, including me, are saddened that they didn't. I'm glad I found this out while still in college, but there were and are people in there 70s and 80s who will wonder why life felt so much harder for them until the day they die.\n\n5. You are not alone, you are not a failure, and you are not helpless. There will be people out there who will tell you that ADHD doesn't exist, that you're lazy and just wasting your potential, that will look at you like you're a druggie if you tell them your taking medication. You'll feel guilt at having lost so many opportunities, doubt that you aren't just making up excuses, and anger at friends and family who 'always suspected' that you had adhd but never said a damn thing. It's a hard struggle, and you'll have to wrestle with how much control your really have over your actions, but every day I'm thankful for doing my research and finding other people who know the same struggles. And it's already likely that you have a few friends who have ADHD. Having the same problems tend to bring people together, even if you aren't aware of it until after the fact. \n\nI'm gonna give a shoutout to /r/ADHD and Jessica McCabe's [How to ADHD.](https://howtoadhd.com/) Just check 'em out, and think about it.
22	Congrats! You’ve been diagnosed with autism!
3	Can confirm, am INTP and have ADD
3	Yeah, same. INTP with ADHD that wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood by my general practitioner. I still can’t decide if it’s an excuse for my lack of grit.
15	When will the MBTI community start to treat INxPs as just two other types and not as mental disorders?
3	Amphetamines don't cure INTP though 
3	As an INTP with A.D.D. i feel attacked rn
3	Uuuuh. . . INTPs aren't The Architect.  We're The Logician.  OxO;;  I think The Architect is either INFP or INTJ?  I'm not entirely sure.
2	Dude, INTP symptoms also heavily coincide with aspergers and schizophrenia. It drives me nuts, wondering what's wrong with me. 
2	Those are not the symptoms of ADD.\n\nSymptoms include limited attention and hyperactivity.\nPeople may experience:\nBehavioral: aggression, excitability, fidgeting, hyperactivity, impulsivity, irritability, lack of restraint, or persistent repetition of words or actions\nCognitive: absent-mindedness, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness, problem paying attention, or short attention span\nMood: anger, anxiety, boredom, excitement, or mood swings\nAlso common: depression or learning disability\n\nGoing with the flow is not the same as impulsiveness.
2	Delete this I’m being exposed
4	I feel attacked. 
1	It sucks to be both. 🤣
1	I’ve got ADD lol
1	This makes me question my ADHD diagnosis. Especially since the effects of medications are so inconsistent for me. Some days when I take vyvanse I cant concentrate, and some days I forget to take it, I focus on what needs to get done. Hmmmmm....
1	Supposedly, an ENTP here. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a ENTJ with ADD really (I do have it). 
1	Ah but we sure can focus.
1	I am amused. I'm more INTP-y on my meds than I off them. On that same note, I test as ENFP off my meds, INxP on them and INTP if the test focuses more on thoughts and motivations versus action regardless of if I'm medicated or not. \n\nTo my other ADHD people, isn't hyperfocus the best thing ever? I'm not even being sarcastic about that.
1	My wife really wants me to get tested for ADD/ADHD. I mean, it does seem like she has a point. I never thought of myself as having it since I'm not really hyperactive physically, but my brain really do be like that sometimes.
1	I can **give** details, only messy with my own stuff, **stay** late, can **lead** with plans, and can stick to a schedule not a **routine.**
1	My therapist said escapism is natural. Do the math. 
1	Personally i'm diagnosed with dyspraxia
1	*INTP screeching*
1	Well if this isn't the call-out of the year, I don't know what is.
1	INTP with ADD. Sometimes I wonder if I'm not actually INTP, and only test as that BECAUSE of ADD....
0	Topple impulsiveness with an enne 8 and you're done.
-1	I’m INTP and have always felt like i may be ADD, but I understand its probably just my type that makes me zone out all the time and think of random other things when people are talking about something idc about. I’m almost positive I would be diagnosed if i told a Dr. about it, but I’d rather use internal strength than drugs to overcome it. I’ve taken addy a handful of times for long car rides or for a crazy assignment, but it was mostly for energy more than anything. It kept me going and provoked incredibly long conversations for the travelling. I’m thankful my dad instilled an attitude that always made me “be a man” about things (his words) by bucking up and not giving myself any excuses. I’m sure some of you actually struggle with real ADD/ADHD, but I also think many people are just too soft and seek out medical help when they don’t need it.
-3	REEEEEEEEEE
-6	Add is a fake disorder
1	Lacking INTP skills?	So I've read up on INTPs as I'm very interested in learning more about myself and making sure that I really am an intp. However, in all my reading it always states that we are good at picking out lies and debating. However, I don't really feel like I'm very good at these things. Does this really mean that I'm just talentless? Or that I'm not really an intp? Do I just need to practice and research these things more? I just feel like a lot of the praise given to intps doesn't really apply to me, but at the same time intp does seem to be the closest to what I am. 
6	Haha, there is no such thing as INTP skills. Contrary to popular belief around here, we're are not Supermen or God's gift to debate. It is not a question of whether you are good at certain thing, but instead how you approach things in general.\n\nINTPs rely more on thinking than feeling, on evidence than hunches. That is probably the single most defining characteristic. Because we are introverts, we tend to spend a lot of time, and most of it is spent researching something. We love facts and do not care much for opinions.\n\nBut an INTP can have any interest or talent. Some think we skew towards math and science, but I have never seen any evidence.\n\nWhen I tested for INTP, I stumbled across this place and went, "Holy shit, there are other people like me." I was around 40 and never expected to have people.\n\nSo hang around for a while. If you are INTP, the people here will make sense. If you are not, you will blacklist this subreddit and need a lifetime of therapy \n\nWelcome.
3	heyyo, boiii\nAs the dude above me said, there's no super secret INTP skills\nHOWEVER\nI would recommend checking out LessWrong.com \nThat's a communtiy blog devoted to the art of human rationality, and there's a bunch of good stuff to learn about thinking rationally. Even if you're not intp, avoiding biases and conjunction fallacies will not hurt anyone 👌
3	man, its a you thing, not an us thing\n\njust intuitive it and youll be fine
2	Your type doesn't determine your skills or behavior, nor does your skills and behavior determine your type.\n\nThestack is just a matter of preference. As we prefer thinking for ourselves (Ti) over agreeing with the values of the group (Fe), and that we prefer to consider options carefully (Ne) over our own own comfort (So), we are INTPs. \n\n(Btw, we also prefer trying to understand people, TiFe, over just following whatever you want to do selfishly , FiTe. And we also prefer to take that multiple options approach over having only one, NiSe)

4	I had been building an anime meme library for over a year. Last week my phone ran out of storage and I carelessly ran deep clean and opted to delete "redundant" photos (which apparently also just includes old photos). So I lost my whole meme library. To be honest I'm not that mad or sad about it, part of me is actually relieved and thinks maybe this is a sign that I should continue toward normie development and also communicate like a normal person instead of hiding behind cute memes to say stuff or make humor I wouldn't be able to otherwise.\n\nThat said, a part of me is also tempted to scrape tens of thousands of memes and sift through them in a single weekend and thus reconstruct 90% of my library...
1	Let the nostalgia begin.....
1	Psh you guys don't have AIs for your meme libraries yet?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't either xD
1	Fuck I want a library room
1	nah, theres a better one somewhere in your meme files
1	I have 50k+ photos across my library and Google photos. Only 20 of them aren’t meme related
12	Do you guys have a great appreciation for puns?	I think they are real punny. 
12	Not when they are forced, like in this post. They need to come naturally in the moment
2	I like just about any play on words.
2	Puns and word play make me moist
1	Stop it
1	yes
1	Yes
2	How is Ne used in INTP problem solving? Compare an Ne solution to an Se solution.	Ne is seriously throwing me for a loop. Ne is a guidance by a feeling that there is something "more" behind a given thing. For example, and this is more INTP than ENTP, I will sometimes hear something and will just kinda know that if I think about that thing more that there will be valuable inferences/deductions behind it. It's almost like hearing premises and "knowing" what the deductive conclusions imply. Then it's simply a matter of building a Ti proof for what was perceived. Now with Ne dominants it's like wanting to kick a ball to observe the effects behind it. The objective possibility is the sequence of events that happen after kicking the ball, objective because...well they are LITERALLY happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo assume we have a system. A->B->C->D\n\nIf I start A then D will occur, and I want D to occur so I need to start A. Assume A is a keyhole that is a circle. Now my key is only a square so it doesn't work and doesn't unlock the use of A. I obviously have to alter my key in order to get A to start(assuming I can't alter the keyhole A and reduce it down to a square).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTi is going to present "keyhole circle-square=[http://www.ronallman.com/figrnd.gif](http://www.ronallman.com/figrnd.gif)"\n\nThen it's going to perceive with Ne possible ways of "filling up" that space. Ne's perception is going to be limited to the context of the given problem at hand. It then strikes me that once a solution is found the INTP function axis has sort of reversed. Is Ti then serving Ne's perception of the solution as "the way to make it happen" much like an ENTP Ti serves Ne.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeyond that, how are these solutions presented? Is Ne using the Ti framework to find analogues structures? What if it doesn't have access to any analogous structures? Will it default to formless materials such as plastic, metal, etc that can be molded to create the solution it needs? There must be some way in which Ne-Si are presenting solutions or perceiving information beyond simple formless "possibility."\n\nFinally, how do Ne associations work when there is no Ti or Fi framework underlying the perception. If I think tree->fire, there is no underlying Ti or Fi. It's almost just blatant association.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan someone compare an Ne-presented solution to an Se-presented solution?
2	simplify.
1	Ne is best described as your gut feeling. Forget about the whole concept of Ne/Ni for a second but it is essentially your "intuition". And now you're asking well what the fuck is intuition, and the best way I can describe it as is this like "gut feeling". Sometimes it leads you to believe something will happen but without basis and that's where your Ti comes into play. Intuition itself can be used in many different scenarios. Ever talked to someone and then gotten this weird feeling that something bad was about to happen? That's your intuition screaming at you. We tend to overlook it because our Ti is so dominant in our stack but it really is a very valuable tool. The more you learn to trust it the faster you'll jump to conclusions and the less energy you'll spend dedicated to your Ti. Think of intuition like jumping to the answer in a giant math problem and Ti is the giant equation that got you there but you cheated so fuck Ti.\n\nAn Se based solution is based off your real life facts. So things that you can see = fact. To an Se user Ne/Ni make zero sense because they literally cannot see your proof of work of how you got there. \n\nHope this helps!

6	Tips for a desperate INTP trying to study?	
5	Study the course material every day before class.  Its easier to get 10 hours that way than the night before you fail the test
5	Procrastinate until do or die mode.  Then drink coffee on top of that.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I see these replies and I laugh, because they all suggest a "little at a time" approach. Never could make that hold water for me. \n\n1: A good playlist. The fewer lyrics the better. Get pumped\n\n2: A small, easily dismissed distraction. All my classes were on a computer that "happened" to have a solid GBA emulator ;)\n\n3: A strong (for your tolerance) coffee. If you hate coffee, you haven't had it the right way yet. Took me years to find how to make the perfect cup.\n\nDrink, and allow the maelstrom to take hold. \n\nPowers such as you require come in response to a need. You may have to create that need.
7	Masturbate first. \n\nBreak the task down into smaller sections. 
2	Put mini deadlines for yourself. Like, "I must have read that to page xx by xx o clock"
2	I find it easiest when you get into a certain mindset. I think you will be able to study fine but first you must really commit to the idea and just go for it. I find that when doing something like cleaning, I avoid it at all times but then I just go all in and find that I can keep cleaning for hours.
3	***Incremental motherfucking steps.***\n\nBreak it down so small that the cost of starting the task is negligible.\n\nI'm talking, make a habit of just opening your notebooks/textbooks. That's it. For a week. Next week, open your notebooks/textbooks and study one page. Next week, two.\n\nConsistency is ***the*** key here. **Do a half assed job when your willpower isn't up to the task— DON'T EVER give up on the task without even starting.**\n\nIf you can get into the habit of continually starting, continually using your willpower to get out of inertia, soon enough you'll become used to it and be more consistent and responsible with things you have to and want to do.\n\nOne final tip: Never let the way you feel influence your decision to do something or not. The way you feel is fleeting, oftentimes if you push yourself to start doing it anyways, you fall into the rhythym and start feeling better:\n\n**Don't say "I should do [x], but I don't feel like it". Say "I should do [x], and I don't feel like it".** This reminds you that you have the power to make a decision that overrides your state of being in any given moment.\n\nI look forward to seeing progress updates. You've got this. 
1	Just start, even if it's just a paragraph (start from the main one). It is usually enough to get me started and finish it all, and even if it doesn't, you did something. Just a little bit, something that won't take you too much concentration or anything. Then you may be more willing to go on.
1	well i don’t think it’s a great advice but i really like studying since i’ve bought myself a fountain pen, writing with it makes me feel kinda accomplished and i’m almost longing to write notes
1	I wish I had something productive to recommend. Plain and simple, if a subject did not interest me, I could hardly be bothered to open a book while at: School, High School and even University. Lots of issues and hardships followed because of this.\n\nI'd still do "my worst best" to deliver the assignments, though half-assed, to just get the bare minimum score to pass the subject at the end of the term.\n\nFrom my experience full of fails, don't try to study it all the night before a test. 
1	Environment is key, pay for a shared office space, put a desk in your shed or even bathroom if you have too and definitely get rid of the phone or at least put it in flight mode. 
1	I enjoyed making my own little space. Little potted plant, organised notes, lofi hip hop beats through my headphones. Get back from lectures or whatever, make a snack, make some coffee and retreat from your day around other people into your little introverted paradise.\n\nNow the hard part, stop getting fucking distracted. Use an app to track just how much time you waste on your phone/computer, and gradually try to ween yourself away from it. Fucking meditate to train your ability to let thoughts just pass by you instead of being fueled to build a scale model of the Burj khalifa when a single stray thought comes. Set yourself a time goal each day and regardless of how you fit it in, try to reach the time goal. Over time learn from your mistakes and aim to squish all the study time into a single concise block. 
1	Any apps or websites where I can chat with people.	Getting lonelier by the day, and there's 0 people in my town that I actually like. Hoping to chat with people, but not mindless "-How are you?" kind.\n\nedit: I met a guy on "meet types" app for android, we had a nice chat, could recommend, but don't know enough about it yet.
6	>Getting lonelier by the day, and there's 0 people in my town that I actually like.\n\nSuch is the joy of being an INTP. \n\nHere's some friendly advice, get off your ass and go look a little harder. I'm sure you'll find someone whose presence you can at least tolerate. You're a very unique individual as an INTP and there's plenty of people out there who will be drawn to you exactly the way you are. Also, people aren't always as shitty as they appear to be, so have a little hope.\n\nIf you don't find anyone, then all the searching will have at least helped you pass some time productively and you'll probably discover plenty of other shit to do with your time. 
2	Yeah its called discord, go join some MBTI communities; most of them are cancer though. Have fun!

7	How Do I Get My INTP to shave	Sigh.... it's been 2 years. Maybe twice a year i see him looking well put together completely.  \nSo to start I'm an ENFP dating an INTP man. We are both in our 20s.\nI completely understand and appreciate someone's freedom in choosing how they want to carry themselves and to be honest if my partner wanted me to change something about how i looked I'd feel hurt. At the same time i put out a reasonable amount of effort to carry myself well.\nSo im not trying to change him ...\nBUT\nhe has this fuzzy little thing he calls a beard that he doesnt even shape up properly. It grows messily. IT JUST DRIVES ME INSANE. I just..i even tried to convince him to clean it up for practical reasons "hey its hard to kiss you having to sort through the forest youre cultivating" nope doesnt work.\n\nHe claims that the reason he wears it this way besides being lazy is because it helps him to filter through people. If they treat him badly based on his appearance he knows they are not people he wants to be around. He finds that purpose for it more important than my strong dislike of it and so wont clean it up for me. Ever.\nOnly when it gets to the point that it annoys him (twice a year) will he.\n\nIm frustrated and tired. \nI mean jesus hes great and cute but i feel so weird walking around with him and that messy thing he wont even clean up properly. \nAnd i know i knowwwwww i shouldnt care what people think BUT IT BOTHERS ME TOO \nWHY CANT HE JUST UNDERSTAND 😭\n\ninstead he says everyday i stay with him when he has that furby on his face , i prove that i love him, and when i get tired of it and leave well thats also good for him cause it proves i didnt enough. \nfinally i will say on the plus side he  never really comments on what i want to do with my looks so....that's good\n\nBut help me people, please. \nSorry to rant ..\n\n\nUpdate: i asked him how can i get him to shave and he said \n"Stop the entire world from being deceitful." \n\nSOS. 
24	Looks like the beard is functioning as expected.
13	Omggg!!\nSo i finally gave up because i felt badly for my attack on his beard..\n\nAnd he said that for me he will trim it.\n\nIt will probably only be this one time for the next 5 months at least but SUCCESS!!! \n\nTHANKS EVERYONE
10	Lol I would be petty and do something equally annoying like not shaving youself, wearing a weird hat, something like that. The alternative would be to win a debate against the whole shallow world hypothesis. The only argument I could offer is that imo superficial people are easy to spot by analyzing their characters for a while and asking questions, the fuzz is a weird shortcut lol Good luck 
8	Only one way through this. Grow your own beard and refuse to cut it
6	When an INTP makes up their mind there isn't much that you can do.
3	Show him this post which you wrote.
3	The arguments you are using to mean nothing to him, you must change the way you go about that.\n\nHe INTPed his way to keep his beard by finding logical reasons even though it is not GOOD wich is what immature  INTP do -Not meant to be  offensive he is in 20's - , but you can make sens too, you need to INTP him out of it. \n\nI think we might be able to help because logic is not specific to anyone and reason can reason to  INTP's.\n\nFirst off, I dont think he will shave off completly so we will try to win a low maintenance argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> He claims that the reason he wears it this way besides being lazy is  because it helps him to filter through people. If they treat him badly  based on his appearance he knows they are not people he wants to be  around. He finds that purpose for it more important than my strong  dislike of it and so wont clean it up for me. \n\n\- This is basically a rationalization of being dirty ass monkey. Let's destroy this argument !\n\na - No one can remove themselves completely from society and society does judge on the base of looks and it gets to the content after that. You do it, I do it and he does it ofc at varying degrees.\n\na=>b - Keeping the beard might make him miss out on Jop Opportunities / Great people .....\n\nc- Argue also the point that the way you feel about his beard should have more importance and give exemples on how you have high regards for his feelings about smthing too, don't forget to establish that mutual effort is a ground basis of relationships thus if you do smthing as such therefor he must.\n\nd- Mention the amount of effort you did put into this debate.\n\nLet us know how it goes.\n\n&#x200B;
3	My wife is with you. It just never occurs to me to shave until I notice. That stopped after my wife gave me a great Braun shaver. Frankly, when I saw that is does 40,000 cross cuts a minute, I knew I had to try it. Then she told me my bear scratched her during recreational activities, and that failure to use said shaver would result in a suspension of them. She was light hearted and funny when she said that, but she also looked serious. Been clean shaven ever since.\n\nThis is kind of tough because I would not tell my wife how to do her hair (as if). But it sounds like he does not have his beard because he likes the way it looks.  His statement about your staying with him proving that he loves you sounds like a lot of INTPs who think that relationships are all about others adjusting to their needs. It also sounds like he is testing you, which I find unfair and selfish. \n\nYou might try telling him that his beard bothers you, and that if making some statement to the world at large is more important than how you feel, he should rethink what matters. To be honest, "Stop the entire world from being deceitful" is a pathetic thing for an INTP to say. The entire world does not even notice him, let alone interpret the significance of his beard. There is no logic to his belief that his scraggly bears acts as a filter to find people he wants to be around. \n\nYou don't deserve this.
2	**A beard is a man's glory.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis being said.   [Mine.](https://imgur.com/M0TyoJY)   \n\n\nMeanwhile ... I'm hiding out in Chat at [**INTP**](https://s.reddit.com/channel/234819_b801be46e50b71c8f933ce4f082b3450a394f57f)   \njoin us we have many other INTP chat-a-holics  \nSome are other MBTI types - ALL are WELCOME ! 
2	Welp, the only option is to break up with him. Also I get his point but jeez. That's like saying you don't believe capitalism is good and forsaking the use of money.
2	Making an INTP care about their physical appearance is pretty much impossible 
2	I'm a female INTP and I felt this way with my male partners. \n\nI wish I asked them to sort their facial hair out! I never brought it up yet whilst I kept myself better maintained they did point things out. \n\nIt's funny seeing it in reserve. I wish I'd of been a little more direct back then and spoke my mind. 
2	If you are looking to approach this from a purely logical standpoint and he is willing to consider the totality of the situation, then he has one method that he is using to filter out the people he does not like in the world. There are likely other methods that he could discover and use to do the same task. Some of these methods may be more amenable to you. \n\nSo, if he loves you, he should be willing to at least entertain the idea that given a selection of tools for the job, choosing one that your partner likes (or at least can tolerate) is probably preferable to one that they dislike. 
2	Present a well thought out case to why using facial hair as a way to skim through people is not effective, then maybe say how it's making you feel.
2	It's important to you so communicate it so. Maybe take him out to the barber shop for an appointment kinda like a "spa day". Tell him you like him well groomed and just kinda sweet-talk him into the chair. If he really doesn't wanna go, there's nothing you can really do about it. \n\nI know I am lazy as fuck when it comes to dressing myself and poor at self care, but if my gf wanted me to "clean up", I wouldn't stop her from dragging me to go get clothes that she liked for me. Hey, I certainly wouldn't complain about getting a haircut esp if someone else was payin for it ya know.\n\nI personally think you can weasel your way into a solution op without being completely deceitful. You do catch more flies with honey than you do vinegar; if you catch my drift of course.
2	Just keep nicely insisting before an event is coming up. Could be as simple as going out to eat. \n\nIf he insists on not shaving maybe nicely ask why he doesn't want to shave. If he doesn't like his shaven face, maybe get him to trim the beard with clippers. If he hates shaving, buy him clippers.

1	The momwnt he shaves it he knows you will lose respect for him and start cheating on him with a guy with a beard
1	I respect this man.\n\nI hope he keeps his beard.
1	Did he have it when you boyfriended him? If no, tell him he's changing towards worse. If yes, then tough tiddies but you gotta realize that you can't start dating a person with the intention to change him. Date one that you can fully accept the way he is.
1	Make yourself as unattractive as possible. Test the consistency of his values. If he can't live up to his own beliefs he'll realize he's a fraud and have an existential crisis. The beard will soon be gone. 
1	Start with a compromise.  Ask him if he'd entertain trimming it back to around an even 4mm or so, as you want to see his face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
1	Your man is full of bullshit, I am INTP and I take care of myself andf I listen to my partner wishes if they are reasonable.
1	He needs to understand that this one little thing that helps him filter out people he "doesn't want to be around" is literally how the entire world works and EVERYTHING will be much easier for him when he figures that out.  Not to mention all those people can be extremely useful for networking, advancing his career, and exploring new opportunities. \nEven dogs will treat him better.  Let's see him try to rationalize his way out of that.  \n\nYou might not be the right person to help him realize this, unfortunately.  Usually this type of advice has more impact coming from another man he looks up to.  Since so many of my generation, especially the ones that at times struggle with these things, myself included, are lacking that strong male role model, I would suggest he look into self-help and meditation. 
57	I feel personally attacked.	
4	Lazy and unmotivated ?\n\nSo, having no energy for stuff you don't want to do ?\n\nYou only feel attacked because you let other people define what you should do 
6	Cannot relate.

0	Urgent Help! Revenge and payback for an INTJ with BPD	I am calling on INTJ's who are familiar with, or know first hand about living with borderline personality disorder.  \n\nI am a codependent ISFP who married an INTJ with BPD.  We did not know anything about the personality types, or that we suffered from mental disorders as well, until fairly recently.  It has explained soo much (a bit late).  We both see how and why we fell apart but none of it excuses what I did...  Instead of trying to fix my marriage, I had an affair.  I cheated on my husband over the course of 3 years.  My husband found out and we have been living in the aftermath for the last 2 years and 8 months.  I think most INTJ's would rationally (and rightfully so) leave the relationship, but he did not and will not.  His convictions, the love we once had and our children were enough to make him want to make our relationship work.  I regret having done what I did, I wish more than anything that I could take it all back and I want to make things right and I want to make my marriage work.  I knew that it wouldn't be easy but nothing could have prepared me for this.  These last couple of years have been the most tumultuous years of our lives.  He wanted to make us work but he suffered with constant internal conflicts of wanting me close yet far, extreme rage, anger and bitterness that has not subsided at all as time has gone on.  We have argued endlessly (long INTJ talks), tried counseling (no counselor could match him), I quit my job, I am accountable for my whereabouts (98% at home, proven with trackers, etc.) but nothing has helped.  We stayed together but we are living in hell.  \n\nHe rationalized that the anger hasn't subsided because he needs fair, he needs revenge and payback and then we can maybe work things out.  He began using dating apps to hook-up and give me a taste of my medicine.  He's been doing this for the last year and a half.  He is still angry most of the time, his getting even by sleeping around hasn't made the hell at home any better.  But he also needs revenge.  He has tried to convince me to avenge him by ending the man I had the affair with.  It would prove my loyalty and he would be able to stop sleeping around and would no longer be consumed by anger.  I have not left (though I did try twice) because I feel deep inside that God wants me to stay to help him through this.  Those times I almost did, my husband was the one who would not let me go. There was a time when I felt so drained, I wanted time away to recharge and go to my parent's house, but to him, any separation, even temporary, is the end of us.  He says he knows he might be able to find someone better for him but that is not what he wants, he wants our family and that is it.  If he can't have it back then he wants out of life.  If I were to leave now, he would end his life.  Divorce is not an option.\n\nWhat is keeping us here in hell is the lack of full payback (me) and revenge (the other man).  We have hurt each other so much already, I just can't take any more either.  If anyone has any insight as to how I can help my tortured husband, please tell me!  I realize that he and I speak different languages, in a sense, and I'm here because I want help understanding his.  He knows I sincerely regret what I did, but he needs me to pay.  The way things are headed, I feel like I owe a mob boss and I will stay while he goes screwing other girls, but as soon as my debt is paid then I should run.  I can't keep pretending I'm okay when he comes home and smile and initiate sex anymore.  This has been a serious mentally messed up game and I don't want to play anymore.  So to be direct, I have two questions:\n\n1)  What would be an acceptable alternate payment?  This is the only way he will stop sleeping around.\n\n2)  Is there anything else that might satisfy his need for revenge?  I need to find another way that gives him revenge. . . \n\nI know I deserve this hell for what I did, if you must tell me what a horrible human being I am, then it's your prerogative, but please try to help him out of the hell I put him in.  My attempts have failed.  Neither one of us can take it anymore, we are emotionally drained and it's showing physically too (depression, anxiety, PTSD), we can't hang on much longer.  I created a Reddit account just so that I could post this and ask for help.  I recognize I can't do this alone.  Thank you.
5	I will be honest here.  You really fucked him up by cheating on him.  He is devastated and it's probably even worse that he is an INTJ because they are masterminds.  He's trying to find a punishment exactly equal to the pain he is feeling which I think you've caught onto.\n\nI'm sorry you're in this position but there is one thing that may satisfy him. 2 chicks at the same time ;)   \n\nYou guys need major therapy asap.
4	ISFPs, INTJs.. ESFPs, ENTJs... what fucking sub am I on right now? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I know we can talk whatever here. Just felt off and that's all I could think when I went straight to comments.)
3	Do the only honorable thing you can, whore. Divorce, take nothing and go back to suck that other guys cock. 
1	Hey, I'm an INTP and I got cheated on by my ISFP girlfriend. ISFP's are infamous for their commitment issues. Anyway, we broke up and it was horrible. The pain was pretty intense and I was borderline suicidal for a while, but I've been moving on. I'm not in the exact same situation as you two, but I have a basic idea of how he feels. I think that what you did to him was really stupid, and he's right to be hurting, it's only natural for him to feel that way. That said, I'll try to be objective with my advice.\n\nFirst off, you need space. Being together is obviously twisting him into someone he's not, and the pressure that all his unresolved feelings are causing him is destroying whatever is left of the love you once had.\n\nSpace will drive him crazy because he'll probably be trapped in a negative thought loop so he'll need company 24/7. However, if he can break through that stupid loop, he'll naturally start to resolve those feelings. He'll need help to do that though, and it can't come from you because he doesn't trust you. Instead, he should be around people he trusts like his family and they shouldn't let him out of their sight since he's suicidal. You'll probably also need a therapist to check in on him constantly and to give them instructions for how to treat him right because they could make some really dumb mistakes that could be avoided with some simple instructions from someone actually trained to deal with people in his state.\n\nSpace is important because it's what he needs to properly process the emotions that are leading him down that slippery slope to suicide. He can't do that with you there since you're the cause of all that. \n\nThat said, you'll probably lose the relationship and that's okay. It's not the end of the world and your children would probably grow up into healthier people if they didn't have all the negativity of your relationship constantly hovering around them.  I say that your relationship may be unfixable because the trust required to rebuild it is clearly gone.\n\nIt's very important though that you don't go sleeping around when he's taking that time away from you. Please be considerate of his feelings this time and actually be celibate for a while. It really won't kill you to be nice.\n\nAside from that, you have plenty to consider. You've destroyed your marriage with your own two hands and the blame for that lies solely on you. Accept it and work through the feelings it causes you otherwise it will always haunt you. Stop trying to run away from the mess you've made, and actually make the effort to clean it up to the best of your ability. Accept the consequences of your actions, but don't beat yourself up too much over it. We're all human at the end of the day, and we all make mistakes. \n\nMake an effort to change who you are. Don't be a shitty person anymore. A lying cheating whore is not what you should be. If by some miracle you fix your relationship, don't make the same dumb mistakes again. If it doesn't work out, move on, but don't let history repeat itself wherever you end up.\n\nI'm sorry if my bias showed in my advice. I know it probably did, but hey, I'm human too. Either way, I hope this helps.
1	Fuck you for cheating on him. Whore
1	This guy sounds psycho. I would call the police, actually, and have him locked away. Or at least leave. You quit your job because you cheated? Lol what? How can you live like a child? 
1	First, as others have pointed out, this is INTP, so we may have a very different take on things. And I may have a very different take than others here.\n\nYou seem to be genuinely remorseful for what you did.  I have to admit the "3 years" thing hit me.  Your affair was not a casual encounter, but must have meant something. At this point, all you can do is say that you are sorry and be faithful in the future.\n\nYour husband's reaction is troubling to say the least. He has every right to be angry and hurt and even to leave you. I would not react that way, but many people would. But he chose not to. He claims that he wants to stay together, which seems to mean that he wants a relationship with you.\n\nBut he also wants revenge. Revenge has never been the basis for a successful relationship, and yours will not be the first. If he wants a relationship, then he has to distinguish between who you are and what you did. Everyone commits bad acts. Most people commit heinous acts. But that does not make them bad or heinous people. It makes them good people who committed bad and heinous acts. If he cannot make that distinction, then he will never get over his anger. \n\nHe has every right to be angry, but he is responsible for how he reacts to it. Heinous acts committed for revenge are not excuse because they were revenge. They must stand on their own and be judged for what that are. Anyone who has sex with another woman to punish you for having sex with another man should be angry at himself. And there is a difference. I do not know why you had your affair, but I doubt that it was done to hurt him. You act was wrong, but his is malicious and evil. \n\nUnderstand that you do not in any way " deserve this hell for what I did." That is bullshit. You strayed in a marriage, not killed someone. His choice is to leave you or to forgive you. No man deserves a relationship with a woman against whom he wants revenge. \n\nThere are effective modalities of therapy for emotional dysregulation. I found that dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) was vastly more helpful than anything I tried before, and one of my issues has been dealing with strong emotions, including anger.\n\nI don't think that you should try to satisfy his revenge.  Don't think that it is possible. You have the right to tell him that you know what you did was wrong and really hurt him, but that you cannot undo it. You could tell him that your affair was something that you did, not who you are. You could tell him that if judges who you are by what you did, then he can never change his view of you, and that continuing together in that case would make no sense at all. You could tell him that you are the person he married, and that you still love him. \n\nYou could tell him that the things he has done have hurt you too. You could point out that he has done exactly what you did, but he did it for the purpose of hurting you. And you could tell him that you know that he did that because he was hurt and angry, but that you know that those acts are things he did, not who he is. You could tell him that you still love him, and that you want to have a relationship, but a relationship between who you are and who he is, not between the things you have done. \n\nYou could tell him that trust is part of a relationship, not something to be earned or proven in it. You could tell him no more trackers, that he has to accept your commitment as you will accept his. If you do this, I think that you have to be fully prepared to leave if he says no. You did what you did, but you are who you are, and you do not deserve this treatment.\n\nFor context, I am 54. My wife and I became romantically involved in 1985 and married in 1987. I am certain that we both have been faithful to each other. My parents were married 52 years when my father died. So this really does not make sense to me. I am devastated when our friends get divorced, and I just do not understand how two people who loved each other could treat the other the way that some of them do. It is hard to imagine something for which I would not forgive my wife. I don't care what she does, only who she is. And thank God she accepts me for who I am.\n\nI wish you both the best.
1	Don’t date women like this
0	Not going to comment on past, because well, past is past. Advice for your future: it's not going to end if you don't end it. Divorce him. Get proof of him saying that he will commit suicide if you divorce, and get him locked up in an institution to receive professional care. He's beyond the point where his close ones or himself could help him.
0	Please get a divorce, even if that is not an option. If the guy react like this now imagine what he will be like in 10 to 20 years. Do you really want to spend the rest of your live together with someone who is this unstable?
1	Dating Trouble - Suggestions? / Venting (long post)	Hello All!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly, please be gentle XD, \n\nSo, I've been trying the online dating scene with Okcupid and wound up meeting several ladies in person.\n\nI think this site is pretty fair and they even let you message back and forth without charging, although I've paid for \n\ntheir A-List before (partly b/c I appreciate their app).  I decided to try the app just for the heck of it.  I always check profile and beliefs first to see if we would even get along in the long run, not necessarily saying there would be a long run, but just potentially...  I was looking to find somebody outside of my current friend groups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's not many group scenes that I go to, and frankly it seems pointless and exhausting to be part of a ton of groups for me.  I'm hesitant to ask any one particular girl from one of those groups because I don't want a ruin a friendship and create an awkward atmosphere, which has happened to me before.  In one particular case I enjoyed this one gal's friendship and eventually asked her out, it wasn't till several dates later that she said she wasn't interested.  We saw each other occasionally in other groups and I kind of got weird vibes from her like she was trying to lead me on, purposefully ignoring me so I'd have to go more out of my way to have normal conversation with her.  I sort of regretted dating her in first place to lose that friendship but no risk no gain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was another instance where I hung out with this girl in college here and there over two years (yeah, I know) and we had awesome conversations, and a ton in common.  She was a little aloof in a cute way, always thinking, beautiful, a very smart micro-biologist and an INTJ.  I didn't realize this at the time but I am convinced she is a high functioning Autistic, some of her actions seemed to add up.  We wrote letters back and forth and over time, I initiated two DTRs and she one initiated one DTR, a slightly constructed but rare genuine apology from her with tears in her eyes about how she hurt me.  On the final DTR when I mentioned that I "Couldn't just be friends" and that I had tried very hard to be just friends (which is true) but I had feelings for her.  It seemed that it did not even occur to her after more than a dozen letters back and forth that I still had feeling for her.  To be fair also, there are many times I miss cues, like leaning in for a kiss when the moment seemed right, but frankly I don't know how she would have reacted.  Either way it ended in awkward goodbyes with longing staredowns.  I'm not the kind of person to get physical with every girl I get crushes on but even then it would take me awhile to even get to that point.  I just want to have that one special lady, preferably wife.  It really sucked, and it made me feel like something is broken in me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell that escalated quickly... I meant that only as context of where I am coming from, but that was a long time ago.  I have several scars from relationships with friends and colleagues especially in college but if there's any theme in my life it's to, with God's grace, forgive them and move on.  I'm still at least okay friends with them to this day, one of them even lives near my area and I occasionally hang out with him.\n\nSo besides that, the most times I've dated one lady was at most three or four times.  They usually break it off because they, "Don't feel romantically interested".  To me that seems like a load of bullcrap and the least important (and very fleeting) thing that would come in time eventually anyways.  I think finding commonality and shared beliefs is harder to find and more valuable.  There was one of those relationships I did genuinely mess up because I pushed with too much texting and threatened not to text back. She was EMT with an unusual busy schedule but she was genuinely interested. I was afraid of getting ghosted when I didn't hear back from her in a week.  She got ticked, she basically said she couldn't reply back as often as i thought she could.  I said sorry, but understandably she did not pursue further.\n\nNow I'm in limbo land and sick of dating sites
2	First off I'd never heard the term DTR till today but thanks for that. It sounds like you just haven't met the right people in general. Relationships are two way streets and well if the other person isn't willing to fulfill what you want then it's just not right. No point in crying over spilt milk right? You may of been into all these women on some degree but the reality is they didn't see you the same way and eventually you will find a girl that sees you in the same light that you see her. That is the start of a genuinely positive relationship. The EMT girl, that's also a sign that a person isn't able to meet your needs. If she was only going to talk to you once a week and you were blowing up her phone daily then that's also a sign of incompatibility. You need someone that has more time in their life for you and she didn't have it to give. Sometimes no matter how compatible a match is, life circumstances get in the way. She's moving to a different country; her parents hate you, you get the point.\n\nDon't get discouraged, keep trying; but maybe narrow down your search a bitt more. Going on dating sites is good because you're in a pool of similar like minded people that are you know "looking to date" but it's also bad because well its like shooting fish in a barrel. I'd suggest trying to meet people more organically, like if you have an interest or a hobby to join groups not to look for people to date but because you generally just want to hang out with people that have similar interests. This might lead to something more but don't bust in all thirsty and shit ya know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Broad Autism Phenotype/ I need help	&#x200B;\n\nI might have broad autism phenotype. I mean, I hate when someone starts randomly singing or making noises when I try to concentrate and get my work done. It’s difficult when someone talks 10 min about “how's the weather today” and I feel like an idiot. They think that I’m rude for not listening to their bullshit, so I excuse myself and run.  After than they spread rumors and avoid me the whole year. It goes on like this, but with more people supporting “how's the weather today” side.\n\nThat’s how you end up with no shitty social skills, no job, without a driving license and a car, a virgin and not having any friends in high school for 4 years in a row.\n\nThat’s how you become useless otaku.\n\nStory of my life.\n\nI’m done.\n\nSave me from myself.\n\n&#x200B;
3	>That’s how you become useless otaku.\n\nBecoming otaku is one step away from commiting sudoku.
2	So how about you stop doing that and start doing the complete opposite?
2	Them asking about the weather is just poking you for a conversation because they're bored. If you don't feel like talking, be thankful and honest about it. If you do want to talk, take over the conversation. Try to find a common interest and just have a fun conversation about it
1	How about finding ways to compensate ?\n\nWork colleagues make noise : use headphones with music to isolate yourself. Learn to bypass the smalltalk smoothly, that's the real way to have social skills.\nEtc.
16	The most common cause of miscommunication is perceived context.	Most arguments are because someone will say something and the other will make a bad assumption on what is meant by it or add additional meanings beyond what is stated.
7	Perhaps is also could be stated as people do not hear what is said. They interpret what they think was said, to the extent that they were paying attention. You probably know the old game, Post Office, I think were one person whispers something to the person beside them and, who in turn whispers it to the next and do on down the line. Everyone is instructed to repeat what was said word for word. Then the beginning and the end of line are compared, and they might be unrelated. Studies have shown that you only need 2 people to get the Post Office effect. When people are told to listen to what is told to them, wait 5 or 10 seconds, and then write it down word for word, the results are a jumble. \n\nAdd on to this the fact that when humans listen to a statement with which they disagree, their minds immediately begin formulating a response. We cannot pay attention to the speaker while crafting a response, because the human brain does not multitask, at least not the conscious part.  We switch back and forth really fast, but pieces get lost.\n\nI have to indulge myself in an attorney anecdote. A lot of attorneys hate trial, but I love it.  Trial is my second favorite thing to do, especially jury trials. Over 28 years on more occasions than I can stand to count, I cross examined a witness and elicited an admission that crushed their case. The kind of thing where you want to take a victory lap around the courtroom. And then I would turn to the jury to hammer home the point, and they would all be looking at a pair of pigeons canoodling on the window ledge. You cannot got back for a redo. Did they hear it or not? And after the trial when you talk to the jury, no one even noticed. Then again, there may have been a tiny number of instances in which I spilled my water or ever so accidentally distracted the jury when my client was confessing his sins.\n\nThe point is that everyone (except me of course) hears everything through the filter of their beliefs, their biases, whether the coffee was hot that morning, and whether they got laid the night before. The speaker, of course, cannot possibly know how those things are playing out. On top of that if the listener disagrees, they will be switching in and out as they come up with their devastating response. \n\nYou cannot swing a dead cat around here without hitting a few INTPs who will tell you that set their biases and assumptions aside and just objectively listen to what is said.  I think their names might be Jesus and Mohammed. Of course we think that, but so does everyone else.  Quick show of hands -- how many of you let your beliefs affect your interpretation of what you hear? \n\nSo the solution of course is to stop doing that, which I will do right after I stop procrastinating. The hell of it is that even if you know you are going to that, you cannot stop it.  With mindful listening, we can improve our comprehension, but the only truly objective person is me, and I am too busy to listen. \n\nWhile I am thinking about it, that reminds me of another legal system story, again entirely true. In every U.S. or English jury trial going back hundreds of years, the judge always admonishes the jury (when do I get to admonish someone? Sounds fun) before the trial begins, "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I know that it is tempting to start reaching your conclusions as soon as you begin to hear evidence, but the law requires you to refrain from judgment until you have heard all the evidence. Evidence that may appear probative at first may not be probative in light of later evidence. The plaintiff presents his case first, and you must not reach conclusions until you have also heard the defendant's case. Do you solemnly swear to refrain from making decisions or judgments until all the evidence has been presented?" At that point, of course, they all lie and say so solemnly, "I do."\n\nWTF? Ever read a detective novel and refrained from thinking about who did it until the next to last page? It is not humanly possible to hear a story without reaching conclusions whether it is true. But the legal system is based on the appearance of fairness, and this is an essential fiction to its process.\n\nWe, I mean you, of course do the same thing in every conversation. You are constantly asking, "Do I trust this person?" "Does that make sense?" "Does she have a reason to lie or make this up?" If you didn't how would you remember it all at the end anyway?\n\nAll is not lost. There is something that we can do. We can be aware and mindful of the way that our brains work, and we can learn to be skeptical of our own conclusions.  Not easy, and your brain will only go so far down that path (it is right, after all), but even a small shift can much us much better and more effective listeners.\n\nExcept for the climate change deniers.  Those people are just nuts. Cut them down quick and hard.
2	I agree. To be more specific, I believe that the most common cause of miscommunication is the lack of context, which causes the party lacking context to spontaneously generate their own context, which is often wrong.
1	There's the problem.  What's the solution? 
1	I often read between the lines and make connections even if there is no deeper meanings beyond the words themselves. This is exactly why I'm afraid to talk to my crushes, because I usually experience both false hope and false failure from something trivial. 
1	'Well it depends'
3	I feel so stupid	Dies anyone else just constantly feel so dumb. Im currently in grade 12 and i just always feel so stupid. Regardless of the fact that im doing well in school (i get As in all my classes), i just feel so much dumber than everyone else. I can never answer questions outloud, i cant explain very well and im just horrible at paying attention. Is there a way to combat this? 
3	I think this is because unless we feel like we understand something at its most basic fundamental level then we feel we know nothing at all. Once the thing you want to learn about cannot be broken down into any more smaller pieces, once you reach that underlying level THEN you begin to truly understand something. That's when you truly feel all the pieces of the jigsaw coming together.
1	Yup all the time. I doubt my own intelligence while idiots run around pretending like they know everything. The way I deal with this is to try to learn something new everyday. Kind of hard not to do actually xD
1	Yeah, INTPs tend to doubt our own intelligence and we often second guess ourselves 
1	Often times I've found that when I feel this way is because I know I could have done better at something but just neglected it too much. I didn't answer questions in class because I was afraid my answer would be wrong, even if I had read the material and knew the answer if I felt I could or should know more about it I get this feeling that I'm dumb and keep quiet for the rest of the day.  Work or study until you feel satisfied with what you've done, not just until you finish it.\n\nAs for the attention, well INTPs will never pay attention to anything that doesn't catch our interest so for high school this is the worst, you get a bunch of classes about a lot of things you might not give a shit about, but school will get better when you pick a career, if its something you like it won't be hard paying attention. In case you really, and I mean, REALLY, can't make yourself focus on anything try Modafinil, depending on your country you can get it without prescription and its mostly harmless, it's a super focus pill that will last all day and it makes you extremely interested in whatever you are doing.
1	Very common for an INTP to second guess themselves, and for god sake do not let your schooling get in the way of your education! \n\nGrade 12 can be a huge waste of time and is no reflection of your intelligence. Start learning something you actually care about. The ancient stagnant school system can suck it. 
1	The school system is garbage anyways. Don't base your intelligence on that. Find something you're uniquely good at, then you'll be satisfied.
1	Presidents, Prime Ministers, bishops, and Monarchs	I know Abraham Lincoln and Gerard Ford are often characterized as INTPs, but what are some other world leaders and politicians who are also INTPs?\n\nWould maybe Rowan Williams or Pope Benedict be INTPs? Both of them were far more comfortable writing books and teaching at universities than actually running the Massive institutions that are the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion.\n\n\nPerhaps British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Far less flashy and way more introverted than his predecessor Tony Blair or his rivals Clegg and Cameron. He was also more of lecturer, writer, and policy wonk than an actual head of government.  Perhaps the same deal with former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon or even Theresa May.\n\nThanks\n\n
1	U.S, Presidents: James Madison and (arguably) Eisenhower.
1	I think Klaus Iohannis is an INTP
4	Do you trust people? Why? If it you didn't, but do now, how did that change?	Not sure if this is INTP related. But for long as I remember, I was bad at reading people. I still am. Since I don't know what they're like, I can't predict much about their behavior, unless it's something like 'A lead to B about 20 times for this person, so I guess A will lead to B again.' I can't put labels on people. If I do, they're very vague. It's difficult for me to say what defining traits they have.\n\n\nSince I don't know them well (except maybe for my parents and my 2 friends), I don't know how much I should trust them. Moreover, my trust score towards a person used to be either 0 or 100%, no in between. I'm trying to change that, though. I have learned that I can trust others in very shallow matters (keeping a seat for me, buying me lunch, giving me a course I don't have). But nothing more. I don't have social anxiety anymore, I guess (it used to be the case a couple of years ago). I can talk to them about very superficial things, but my personal experiences or values will be kept mostly to myself.\n\n\nMy trust issues arise even with people I am supposed to be close to and it can be hard to swallow if they're sensitive. I'm on the verge of paranoia at times. Better safe than sorry, though. Most of the time, I make the choice of ignoring these thoughts, though.\n\n\nThis distrust can be obvious with strangers and people I barely know. Paradoxically, I can tell a stranger about my weirdest thoughts and ideas, but I believe that happens because I know I won't see them again.\n\nI am not physically strong or tall. I fear going to a concert by myself because I might be hit or taken advantage of because I'm not with someone else. I do most of the things on my own, but this is one i'm not sure I can be completely safe. Also, I don't want a romantic (not sure what this word means) relationship too soon. But I'd like to try sex. I've been told to use dating apps. Again, how am I supposed to trust a stranger? My friends and family don't live in the same city as I do, so I can't have them as backup in this scenario. Though... I wouldn't want to use anyone as backup. Why place such responsibility on other people when it's my own problem?\n\n\nI always felt the need to be independent. I sense that part of it stems from the same general distrust. I like fixing things on my own, it gives me a feeling of satisfaction. But I can't do it everytime. I ponder a lot and try even strange solutions before I ask someone for help when it comes to things that matter to me. I don't like asking for help, but I know it's necessary. I feel frustrated if I see that the human I asked for help can't figure it out. What a waste of time and effort. I should've kept trying fix it by myself.\n\n\nIf I have a requirement for something to be done a certain way and if it's not met immediately, I'll keep confronting the people involved till they seem bothered by it and they do it my own way (but they seem to give you strange looks if you're that pushy) or I give up the moment I'm told 'no' and try to solve it by myself - fix it or suck it.\n\n\nAt times, it seems like everything from the outside tries to demolish my little world just because I can't completely trust anyone else but myself. If you managed to read so far, what's your experience with this? Is it even INTP related?
3	maybe because i never been hurt by people (betrayed, get talked in the back, etc) so i mostly trust them. but i also no fool that trust a beggar or charity seeking people on street, if i want to donate something i know where i can to, not to some random stranger. but other than that i trust people or i can say i love them but i still cant open myself to others. not even to someone i've been known for a long time like my parents or friends.
3	Yes and No. Trust is like belief, it's acting like you know something will happen even if you don't. You also have to believe that :.\n\n* The trusted person can do that\n* The trusted person wants to do that. Meaning he/she has your best interest in mind./won't betray you.\n* The trusted person won't do something else even with good intentions. Say, "something came up" excuses. Like, if the context/circumstances change unfavorably.\n\nPersonally, I just consider it a gamble. So I will "entrust" someone with something, but I won't make any logical leap into wishful thinking... It's always little things or stuff I wouldn't be able to do anyway.\n\nIt also mean that I depend on no one, so no one has power over me. Independence and freedom > "Trust"
3	I trust that people are ultimately self-serving
2	The best way to get something done is to do it yourself, it seems. I haaaaaaate asking for help. It feels good to fix things for sure! and i'm a mechanic! lol but when I DO need help I have to suck it up and that feels bad :/ especially when the fix is super simple\n\nIt gets lonely sometimes, not trusting people, because they simply can't be trusted with my feelings. If they let me down once, I know it might happen again. it's pretty clear after one time whether or not they're on your wavelength. i'm struggling with that myself. I have no one who really understands, i've found, so i've sort of coped by writing blogs no one reads (I don't link them anywhere, they're just for me)\n\nso i'm mostly in the same boat with you. i don't want to put my trust in someone so deeply until they've proven time and time again they're down for me. but to find out, i have to get to know people. My least favorite thing!!! Ugh I just don't do casual sex. good sex requires trust. you can wait till you find someone worth it.\n\nIdk, hope that helped, to know you're not alone. Best of luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: GIRL -- i assume you are a girl -- i am one too -- you'll be fine. go to a concert alone but have an exit plan for any given time. don't drink too much, stay near public areas, have the uber/lyft app ready or know where your car is parked, tell someone where you'll be. you are a strong confident woman who doesn't need anyone to go anywhere or do anything. just be smart about it. have fun. I'm not super tall and I never go to the gym, i just know there's nothing to be paranoid about. I don't take too much stock in all the fearmongering articles and statistics. not everyone is out to get you and if someone gets creepy on you, use that blunt honesty and scare them away. walk away. use your phone to record if you need to, call that uber. hope this isn't too much but it's just frustrating when i see people so paranoid about being "completely safe". You will never be completely safe. That's just life. Now go out there and live like your life is an average statistic which means you aren't gonna get attacked when you go out one time.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Trust nobody until they show you that you can trust them. Trust is earned.
2	I do not trust many people, although I do have an issue where people earn trust people, it is balanced out by it being equally easy to lose my trust
1	I am 54 and do not have any clear memories of how much I trusted people when I was young. I hated everyone, so I doubt that I trusted people very much. I was pretty sure that people would hurt me if they could.\n\nI also am not entirely sure exactly how and when that changed. However, I came to the realization that I mostly got what I expected from people, and I wondered if my distrust could be the cause of my problems. So sort of on a whim, I decided to try trusting people. Everyone, for anything. I just started to assume that everyone was trustworthy and see what happens.\n\nThat was 30 years ago, and the experiment continues. I have found that trusting people makes them trustworthy. I suppose that there have been times when I was cheated or ripped off, but I don't remember any at the moment. I think that it does not bother me the way that I expected it to.\n\nAmong other things, I have found that trusting people has a dramatic effect on them. People are not used to being trusted. It seems like when I trust them, they are so surprised and pleased that they feel obligated to go out of their way to show that my trust was well placed.\n\nI should add that my wife is not participating in the experiment. She is wary of strangers and always prepares for the worst. I don't put her in uncomfortable situations because that would be neither fair nor loving. Still, it drives her nuts that when I park my car in downtown Seattle, I leave my keys in the door and the door unlocked. She says someone is going to steal my car, but I have never seen anyone systematically checking parked cars for unlocked doors and looking for keys. I lock the doors at night, but only because she has asked me to. \n\nIn my experience, the world just is the not the dark and scary place I thought it was. I get what I expect, so I expect the best.
5	Finishing projects	New to this subreddit, but I can heavily relate to always being able to come up with new ideas, project or things to study that I could see down the line would benefit me, but never getting around to really leaning the knowledge necessary in order to apply them in a concrete way. I’m looking into learning a few software programs like stata, solver on excel, and getting a better understanding of my econometrics class than just what I need to get a B, but I continually move on to the next subject or idea before I have time to make these thinks applicable outside of my own head. What do you guys do in order to make your knowledge more applicable and useful outside of your own head? And how do you choose which idea to pursue?  Hope this makes sense. 
1	yeah I kind of can't finish projects alone, fortunately for me I have a good friend who has the opposite problem of being unable to continue the project through the middle section but is good at starting and finishing them.\n\nbut with single projects that I haven't finished I have:\n\nRailgun, crossbow, 5 books I haven't finished reading and I am also trying to write a post apocalypse short story
7	I struggle with this - other INTP? How do you fair with this one?	
15	"Is it kind?" We can't tick this box at times, but it's necessary to correct people.
4	Why does this guy need 3 gates on one road? They aren't even connected to a fence, you could just walk around all of them. 
2	so, this is also the 3 sieves of Socratese.\n\nFirst sieve: Truth \n\nSecond: Useful / good\n\nThird: necessary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you apply them instead to how you take in information they are super useful.  Is this news story true? is it useful - and then necessary - BAM - instead of 4 hours of news reading, you are down to 2 minutes. :D \n\n&#x200B;\n\nin General though,  you should strive to be a kind to people you associate with (but that has nothing to do with this)\n\nOf course, you should not act as if you have a compulsion to scream incoherent truths at people- but Kind is the least important one of these factors. If a friend really needs to have a piece of information that is true, and useful for them....but not kind... I will always be the kind of friend to let them know. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
2	Most will fail at #3 then.
1	the first 2 are sort of a given for me, the last one is technically one too as online text is not technically speaking
1	First gate is passed rather easily(well, not that I'm right 100% of the time, but I doubt myself enough as it is).\n\nI don't care about the second, if so, I wouldn't say anything, or I would justify everything I say by that it was necessary (this comment was necessary because OP needed it).\n\nThird is just if you want to be liked and don't mind faking it. Well, clearing it will help youressage go through, but it conflicts with the first and second, imho. Sometime, truth isn't kind, and sometimes, being mean is necessary.\n\n0/10. Silly advice. Won't apply 
1	If its true then the next 2 steps are irrelevant 
1	The third gate is for fucking feelers
1	2nd and 3rd gates- never passed them in my life
0	These are helpful for social interactions and it is a great way to modulate speech so that you don't piss someone off.\n\nA good application of this comes when letting people know true things. For example, let's say that an obese land whale walks into a bar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelling this person, "Holy shit. You are super obese. The chances of you living to the age of 70 is about 12%. You are going to die young and will leave your family with crippling debt. You are directly contributing to the sky high   \n healthcare costs."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is true, but it is not necessary, nor is it kind. Therefore, since this is not important to work, or required for proper interaction, it is better to not say anything at all.
13	So, do you humans think MBTI actually works?	
19	Subjectively, it seems to be pretty spookily accurate.\n\nI don't like that it lacks scientific rigor. I'd like to see some improvement in that area (maybe a new system).
14	When I took it, I found it to be the most accurate description of myself that I ever read. It knew me better than I knew myself practically. So if it was intended to accurately define your personality and habits, I'd say it works.\n\nThe problem comes when people use MBTI to put themselves in a box. 
7	I did not know that it was supposed to do anything. I see it as an idea, not something with a function.\n\nAs I see it, MBTI makes sense at its most basic level. The groups that it identifies share some common characteristics such that they are likely to react by thinking that others in the group are like them. For me, that was a huge benefit, because before I found this place, I thought I was a one-off, and I had no idea that I have people. But damn, I do have people, and the people here are my people. 
2	It depends what you mean by "works". Before you know whether or not something functions, you have to know what the intended function is. What is MBTI supposed to do?
2	Take this statement into consideration: \n\n\nMBTI may or may not be bullshit.
2	This question is like asking,\n\n"So, do you think psychoanalysis actually works?"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt may not be perfect, but it is one of the few models of human cognition that can be easily picked up and explained to the average person. Once it is used to derive jungian functions, it builds a predictable model that can be and is used by most social media websites, advertisers and corporations in order to build psychological profiles for both their employees and customers.
2	MBTI doesn't "work", it's just a classification. \n\nI think the categories it forms are relevant and interesting.
1	I was actually reading up on how companies such as Google and Facebook treat us very similar to “habitually inclined” algorithms. So I guess it isn’t too far off to assume that we all may be a bit less complex and more predictable than we’d like to admit. Although the data storage is constructed over years through various platforms so I don’t know where that leaves us..
1	No
1	I'm no human 
1	It sort of woks it's accurate but many people on the sub are like "Oh you're comfortable around people and actually take the lead role in group tasks, that means you are not an INTP" also a lot of this sub is just circlejerking
1	To put it simply it's just a test 
1	I have never felt so strongly that something is true based on subjective evidence alone, but MBTI is too accurate to ignore. 
1	yeah surprisingly it works.  helps you from rubbing people the wrong way.
0	Yeah definitely and anytime anybody dismisses it I give them a mental eyeroll and never bring it up again.  I absolutely don't care what it does or does not do for other people. They're all full of it and don't even know it.
-1	It's popular. And rings true to many. Like horoscopes :) hehehe who cares about reproducibility or stability? 
4	No compassion	My friends have agreed they have never seen me show compassion. It stings a bit but it’s actually pretty true. And idea how to fix this?
6	Empathy. Most INTP's are actually very sensitive on the inside and are guarded by walls because they don't want to expose their super sensitive side. To counter their emotional side they use rational and logic. But those things don't make people feel loved. Try to get in touch with your emotional side by thinking "if I were in that situation, how will I feel?" Even behaviors that you might not understand, try to understand them. Try to act out the 5 love languages to your friends and family. 
2	Methinks that your friends have an overly narrow understanding of what it means to show compassion. If you never showed compassion, would you even have any friends? \n\nA lot of INTPs were pretty beat up as kids and grew to believe that showing compassion or most positive emotions was a good way to get kicked in the balls. However, the emotional difficulties that many INTPs express seems to me more consistent with the behavior of emotionally highly sensitive people. Highly sensitive preschoolers spend a lot of time with less sensitive kids, and we are smart enough to cram our emotional reactions so deep down that they can never escape.  Problem is, they grown and get stronger down then and then come back far too powerful to control.\n\nHow is your compassion for yourself?  Do you like yourself?  Are you a good person? Do you have the same value as everyone else? When we try to suppress our outward emotions, we also restrain our positive internal emotions, which is why we are not like anyone else, do not belong here, and would be better off dead. To show compassion for others, you must first show compassion for yourself.  There, see how easily I said that? Only took me 45 years. There is hope for you.\n\nAm I right that, as Elon Musk said, your mind is a "never ending explosion?" Do you always have one foot in the past, one foot in the future, and one foot in another dimension? You as a person are stuck in the present, and if your mind is elsewhere, it will be very hard to know, let alone like, yourself.\n\nI believe that mindulness or meditation is the key to our prison. With mindfulness, you direct all of your consciousness to the present moment, to the things that your senses are telling you.  Past and future thoughts will pop up, and you notice when that happens, but you recognize that your thoughts are things, not you. And so you gently and nonjudgmentally return your attention to the present. \n\nWhen you do that, you will find you are there in the present moment. It may take a while to recognize yourself, but when you see your "self" as something other than your thoughts and emotions, I am pretty sure that you will find a good person, someone you like. \n\nThe tricky part for me was when I tried to extend mindfulness to other people. It just seemed yucky. And I was not at all sure that they were real instead of projections of my mind. Plus I knew that they were so different from me that I would hate every moment of it. \n\nBut when I tried, I discovered that they were every bit as real as I was, and I discovered that every last one of them had an interesting life story to tell and something to teach me. Staying in the present with other people was so hard because when I was people, my mind was used to giving them 10% so the rest could think important thoughts. \n\nI never felt connected to other people until a few years ago. Maybe you don't feel connected to people either.  Hard to see how you can show compassion for people without some connection, except maybe to fake it. I have come to believe that my connections with other people are what life is about. I even reconnected with my wife after we sort of lost touch after 20 years of marriage. We have been married 31 years now, and I feel more connected to her than ever.\n\nI don't know if my life experience will have any meaning for you. I can only say that you remind me a lot of my younger self when I thought that things would never change, but they did and they will again. I wish you the best.
1	Translate it into "fair and impartial."\n\n

3	F(20) INTP....I’m a junior in college and want to explore career options that will align with my personality type. Any suggestions?	Hey. I’ve recently discovered I’m an INTP. I’ve always been introverted and had an insane, consistent thirst for knowledge. I do not like to be confined to rules...I love freedom to be creative yet still use logic. I’d like a career that possibly changed the manner in which we think? But I’m not exactly sure if that’s an option. Any suggestions for career paths? Any suggestions are appreciated! 
9	Computer science?\n
2	Software development might be right up your alley. Anything that has to do with computers works, really. 
2	STEM will probably pay a lot better but I am very fulfilled as an architect. Lots of problem-solving, system-building and workflow micro-optimizations in my daily routine. I work with many ENTPs and we're a great match, kind of like outsourcing Ne. People around me are beautiful, creative and lively, and also they think I'm a dark wizard because I know programming.\n\nOne thing I really like about architecture (and the design professions in general) is that to "solve problems" you often have to reframe the problem itself. I think we INTPs are uniquely well-equipped for tackling these kinds of problems that require both creativity and intellectual rigor.    \n\nHere's a great quote on that subject from Nigel Cross's "Designerly Ways of Knowing":\n\n>"(...)Designproblems are ill-defined, ill-structured, or ’wicked’17 They are\nnot the same as the ‘puzzles’ that scientists, mathematiciansand other scholars set themselves. They are not problems forwhich all the necessary information is, or ever can be,available to the problem-solver. They are therefore notsusceptible to exhaustive analysis, and there can never be aguarantee that ‘correct’ solution-focused strategy is clearly\npreferable to go on analysing ‘the problem’, but the designer’s\ntask is to produce ‘the solution’.\n\n>(...)What designers tend to do, therefore, isto seek, or impose a ‘primary generator’ which both definesthe limits of the problem and suggests the nature of itspossible solution.\n\n>In order to cope with ill-defined problems, thedesigner has to learn to have the self-confidence to define, redefine and change the problem-as-given in the light of the\nsolution that emerges from his mind and hand. People who seek the certainty of externally structured, well-definedproblems will never appreciate the delight of being a designer(...)"\n\nAnother thing I like about the field is that the whole point of Design is getting things actually made in the real world, so I'm kind of forced to get out of my head every now and then. And it feels absolutely amazing to see something you designed get built.

26	Am I the only one who hates being complimented	I’m always thinking why are you doing this and it feels forced
19	personally it depends on what is being complimented. Appearance? Ew get the fuck away from me. Telling me "you're so smart" as a quick generalization? I hate that more than being treated like an idiot. Complimenting me on a good job or how well thought out something is? Yes plzzzzzzzzzz soak that shit up. That's the good stuff.\n\nSo I guess in a way you're right, I don't want to be complimented. I want my actions to be complimented.
10	I hate being complimented too. It just feels like they are lying. Insults are more realistic. Even if they are right with their compliments, i get embarrased and dont know what to say, so i say "okay, thanks" which makes the atmosphere quite weird. 
8	Someone: compliments me\n\nMe: “What do you want?”\n\nI already know when I did something well I don’t need to be told for validation
3	I love a compliment if I agree and I'm indifferent if I don't.
3	So I give you a hundred dollar bill, and you throw it away because it must be counterfeit. When is the last time that you complimented someone to be condescending or devious? \n\nThere are two aspects to a compliment. First there is the attribute that is being recognized, i.e., you are really smart. Second, there is the act of giving the compliment. A lot of the compliments that I have been given were not true, but the person complimenting me did not know that. \n\nTelling a person who compliments me that they are wrong seems pointless and harmful. When a person says something, the saying of it acts to create a reality in their head. Unless they are fishing for sex or something, people do not give compliments that they do not mean. And if they are fishing for sex, let them, right? Saying they are wrong also takes their attempt to connect with you, chops it off and hits them in the face with it. \n\nTry this. When someone compliments you, focus on the second rather than the first.  Most compliments are not objectively verifiable anyway. Moreover, it does not matter if it is true or not.  A compliment that overstates your character does not change your character in any way.\n\nThe fact that someone gives you a compliment is an event, and one that matters. My normal response is, "Thank you, I am glad that you feel that way." See what I have done. I have taken their declarative factual statement that I sexy and turned it into their feeling. I thanked them for feeling that way and expressing their feeling. I makes no difference whether the compliment is true, only that it was given and accepted. \n\nOf course, if you just hate people and do not want them to connect with you, you can always say, "No idiot, I am so unattractive that I cannot get an online date." Of course, when you say that, you have created your own reality in your head.  Enjoy.
2	Careless compliments affect me the same way someone saying something stupid would. I feel mildly bothered. I find myself thinking less of the person who compliments me, as if they were urging me to partake in their sense of inferiority.
2	Not a fan... ego nonsense.
2	I don't hate being complimented. I just don't know what to do with it. Often times it just makes me feel awkward. 
1	Personally I feel like I’m being lied to or made fun of when I’m complimented. They always feel disingenuous too. Like someone can tell me I’m really smart but then I think there’s nothing I can do that hasn’t been done before. I don’t feel smart or pretty or anything like that honestly. I’m no more special than the rest of everyone. 
1	Depends on the context of the compliment. If it’s noticeably fake or sarcastic, fuck em. But... Most of the time, people are genuinely trying to be sincere, but it’s not always easy to tell that if you have low self esteem. I used to really struggle with getting compliments, but then I realized that it isn’t like my day’s ruined if someone told me they liked my shoes but didn’t really mean it. It’s just words.
1	I don’t think my problem is not liking nice things being said to me. I think my problem is never believing them.
1	INTP Females:  Do you like compliments or do they make you suspicious?\n\nI suspect there is a massive difference in the volume of compliments each sex gets.
1	Usually feels condescending, so yeah
1	I'm ok when the compliment relates to the quality of a deliverable. Like yeah, I know it was good, I did my very damn best and it rocks, so thanks.\n\nI'm kinda suspicious when someone compliments my persona though. 1st thought to cross my mind... What do you want to get from me?
1	I like compliments, but not overly effusive ones or ones made in public. The latter embarrass me and I don't know what to say. Moreover they give me a weird form of performance anxiety. 
1	I hate them. I do not know how to recieve them. I generally just say no awkwardly. Yesterday someone complemented me and said that my skin was really clear and I just said "not really"
1	You are not. it's better when I think I've earned it, but mostly yeh, I hate it too.
1	Criticism and even insults, they're like being given gifts people don't always want, but that prove useful - that hoover your ex bought you for your year anniversary...not romantic, potentially passive aggressive, perhaps even misogynistic, but ultimately really fucking useful..even long after you've got rid of your ex. Point being, the skills learned from learning to take criticism and turn even insults in to useful lessons last a life time and thus are invaluable gifts.\n\nCompliments meanwhile, they're like being given an ornament as a gift - pretty, thoughtful, expensive perhaps but ultimately functionless and useless; I've no idea wtf to do with them. They're dust bunnies that clutter and booby-trap my mind till I'm too afraid to react in any manner, lest I might break something or cause a scene etc.Know compliments ain’t actually functionless, but being emotionally inept, being showered in praise feels like being backed in to a corner.\n\nOne of the few exceptions, I realised only the other day, is when a compliment is sorta' wrapped in barbs - like a subverted sugar pill. Those are like being bought a whiskey; it burns initially, but then subsides into a warm, happy feeling deep inside...and, depending on the size of the compliment, makes you fall in love with the compliment giver. Ha.
1	The only compliments that make me feel are the ones on my insecurities. I'm a bit insecure on my teeth and a tiny compliment that was more of an observation than a compliment made me feel good about myself for a really long time. I don't have many insecurities.\n\nI don't see a reason to hate compliments. People either compliment cause they're trying to be nice or they're trying to manipulate. I'm not someone that can be manipulated so why would I hate the kindness of others.
1	Someone: compliments me\n\nMe: *oh shit how do I deal with this*\n\n*Now I have to live up to their standard*\n\n*Crap, now I cant think and am fucking up all the time*
1	Sincerity makes a huge difference to me.
1	My short horror story:\n\n'I was in the store and the clerk said "Dude, cool shirt".'\n\nI seriously never know how to react to this and I always wonder why I keep wearing cool shirts with my interests on them. It's not like I'm skilled in dealing with this interaction. Why do I invite it?
1	Same here, with one exception: sports. I like hearing compliments when I make a nice shot in golf or billiards. 
1	Women caress me in groups as I stumble by. I ignore them and carry on about my way.
1	I don't ever know what to answer, but I wouldn't say I hate it.\n\nI would ask myself "why are you telling me this ? What's your objective/goal ?" though. Genuine compliments are rather rare, it seems.\n\nTbh, I almost like criticism more (not the dumb kind because you're salty I won't. debate or another). Combine the two as an actual diagnostic is the best, though. ("You're X but you suck at Y") or the kind where friends make fun of you slightly
1	Usually im not sure how to reply to compliments.  Like am I just supposed to say thankyou?

Next week i'll be back home where i'll do much the same thing, but instead of free relaxation time, i'll go to work where i'll actively attempt to avoid talking with everyone until i can go home and squirrel up in my room. I will do this until august and my next vacation. \n\nBased on the clip, I guess im kind of the alternative facts 'real' intp.

38	I love using big words, but I judge every single one of you for using unnecessarily complex language.	Can y'all relate? This is not an attack.
17	How preposterous that you would state to us that you believe our choice of words are overly sophisticated to the point of being unnecessary. I, personally am offended at your accusation and want you excommunicated from this platform.  \n\n\nJK, but I know what you mean. I often use precise words because I don't feel like I'm getting my message across 100% if I don't.
5	Can you not, not use big words or complex lexicon?  /s
5	When i have to use casual language when trying to convey say, a philosophical concept, i feel like i just stripped it of 70% of its meaning. It feels bland. \n\nAside from that, do you people also find yourselves talking in a combination of 2, 3 or more languages? For me at least certain words from different languages may be synonyms but differ in the way it sends the message, so for maximum results i end up with a multilingual abomination. 
4	[deleted]
4	I can't help, but find most of my own sentences cringey anyway, with big words, at least they sometimes sound good. I mean is there something that haven't been said before?  Does any of my sentences contribute something new to the world, and not something that everybody figures out over time?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel as if I try to make saying something new more probable by very specific wording. I don't know.
3	Yeah, big words when it's unnecessary is dumb. But sometimes you're trying to convey a more complex idea, and more sophisticated language is necessary to keep the message precise and concise.\n\nThe company is a big part of it too. Sometimes you know they're smart enough to understand your complex ideas, but don't have to the vocabulary for you to be able to get it across with the language you'd like. I have the most fun in situations like that.
2	I enjoy words with specific definitions. They should bring additional meaning when used. But using too many adjectives for no reason, or big words for simple things, it's just unnecessary.
2	Im triggered.\n\nJk, I feel the same way. The thing is sometimes using a big word makes my intended meaning come across more easily, I'm not too keen on using your vocabulary to show off. It's like when experts in a field try to explain a concept to layman using their technical jargon. Sure they may be explaining the concept totally accurately, but to the layman the accuracy is lost behind technical gibberish they've never heard of.\n\nEssentially, there is a time and a place to use a big vocabulary. 
2	I don't mind big words if they either save time or help gaining in accuracy. When it's used to fluff up a text, I mind
2	If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Albert Einstein\n\nTo me, explain something that is complicated to be simpler is an art and a mental arithmetic. I work in IT and I need to communicate with users/customers. If I explain it too detail and in high level technical language, they will not understand and it's not helpful for my job. Once I decided to do it though..it becomes something fun, although that means I will need to take 10~30 mins before meeting/discussion so I can write down my thoughts in order to make it simpler and easier to understand. Some other times, I will use drawings/schema. And some other times I will use screenshots of input/output.
2	Big is a perspective. I approximately never see someone using words that I would deem big. My own thoughts are much bigger.
1	So you'd like me to stop? I, however, am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  \n\nI can relate, it happens a lot that I try to explain something that could be explained in simple terms but I overdo it to the point of complete ridicule and just end up looking like an idiot after I do
1	I mainly use it either by accident (Thanks IGCSE english) or due to the increasingly verbose thing.
1	Often it’s because of the complexity of how we view things. When we communicate to other’s, we try and give everyone else the entire picture that we see. Think of a 3D sphere. Most people only see it from one angle and they only see what’s in front of them. Speaking as an INTP, I see all of them at once. Now try explaining that to someone that is looking at the front of the sphere what is behind the sphere. \n\nWe like to project that everyone can understand our level of understanding and that’s why when we communicate, our words and explanations come out as a needlessly large encyclopedia. It’s not enough for us to say it “simply” and it often pains us to do so. We aren’t actively trying to be long winded and convoluted. We just want to share our level of knowledge and process with others. \n\nAlso fuck this whole explanation is long winded and convoluted.\n\nTLDR; explaino complex cuz see complex. Painful to be dumb.
6	How do you deal with controversial artists?	It seems recently, there is constantly new (or newly found) controversy surrounding upcoming or famous artists. I suppose the biggest example of this was when XXXTENTACION made his breakthrough, and his assault charges came to the light. It seemed most people either continued to support him despite his past, or completely alienated themselves from his music. I for one, continued to listen to him, but did not defend his horrid past.\n\nIn other examples, I continued to listen to a certain rapper after they had stabbed another rapper (that I actually liked). And I recently told my friend I still listen to particular songs by R. Kelly because I just like them. Of course she suggest this as supporting his crimes, but I don't see it that way. \n\nI guess I have the "skill" of separating the artist from the art. Most people might find this to be selfish or a cop-out, but I guess I just don't care. I love music, and if the song is good, I will listen to it. \n\nBut the motivation for posting this was because only just yesterday I found out about the shitty past of Adam22, who I have been relying on for reports in underground hip-hop. And I have just been having the biggest cognitive dissonance. Part of me wants to keep following his youtube channel, and part of me thinks it would be morally right to stop watching him. It sucks that he is lowkey a "monopoly" on YouTube when it comes to underground interviews. Plus I really enjoyed watching his live streams of listening to Soundcloud artists. \n\nBut anyways, how do you guys deal with artists with serious baggage? Do you still listen to them? Or do you completely cut yourself off from their work? \n\n\n\n\n\n
4	You kinda need to "deal with it." (Not saying it in a douche-way or anything.) It's a thing where you look at an art piece and judge the art instead of the artist himself. Look at Bill Cosby, are you going to look at all the shows/movies he came on and alienate yourself away from them because of what he did? Maybe so, but I think it should be for other reasons.\n\n I won't watch a show, not because it had Cosby in it, but because I just didn't care about the show. Fat Albert had Cosby in it, but I'll still watch it because I liked the show. It's almost like a debate,(not really but just bear with me here) trying to not use the, "You don't like the bad guy, but yet you still support his music/shows! Hypocrite!" You can still like like art, even though you don't like the artist. You can still like the game, even though you don't like the player. You can still love your country, even though you don't like the leader... \n\n\nOr you can meme the hell out of the person to the point the he doesn't intimidate you anymore.\n \n \nName: Bill Cosby.  Class: Alchemist.  Level: MAX
4	You my good Hito, have a very promising future in the practice of law. Maybe even the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nIf I might restate your premise, good people do bad things, and bad people do good things. Everyone has committed bad acts, even Mother Theresa. I may condemn your acts because they were wrong, but it would be even more wrong for me to judge your worth based on your acts.\n\nIf I understand you, correctly, then you have articulated a fundamental part of the rule of law. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) states: "Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character." Now, the law being what it is Evidence rule 404(c) has exceptions to that rule, but let's not ruin a good story.\n\nIn 28 years as an attorney, I have had perhaps 2 or 3 clients who understood and agreed with this rule. The rest called bullshit. Many even after tried to explain it to them.\n\nImagine that you are on a jury. It is a criminal case, armed robbery. As it happens, the defendant has been convicted of armed robbery 12 times.  Do you think that you should know that? Wow, I could hear all the "of course" responses here in Seattle. \n\nLet's think about it. After I tell you about his 12 convictions, do we really need to hear anything more? I mean 12 times? The answer of course is that if I tell you about the 12 convictions, then this will be the 13th, and he is a sitting duck for any armed robbery in the area. \n\nThat is true because something about our minds seamless flows from "this is a bad person" to "he did a bad thing." How many times have you heard someone say, "How can we believe him, he is an admitted liar." Anyone here never told a lie? If all of us have lied at times, why should we be so harsh towards an "admitted liar?" I mean at least he admitted it, I never would. We do that so that we can maintain the fiction in our life narrative that we would never tell a lie (except for the ones we did, which don't count).\n\nWhat is the job of the jury? It is to determine based on the admissible evidence whether the defendant engaged in specific conduct at a specific time in a specific place. What do his prior convictions have to do with that question? Right, nada. But our brains love short cuts, especially ones that remind us only bad people do bad things. \n\nSo in the case of artists, do prior crimes change the quality of their music? Are we really so mean spirited that we would deny former criminals of any chance for redemption? Do you have any idea how may towering figures in human history started with a criminal record?\n\nI truly do think that you have shown an insight that would be beneficial in a legal career. Even if you don't want to become a lawyer, I applaud you for your instinctive understanding of such an elusive principle.\n\nStill, I am talking the United States Supreme Court.  The big one.
3	If certain music/artists brings you happiness then don't fight it. That's just the truth, you can't just say "well now I don't want this anymore" and change your emotions through sheer will. \n\nThat being said, if I have some sort of moral issue with some artist I don't feel bad about avoiding them at least for awhile. We live in an age where there's endless content and stuff being created daily. It's not that hard to replace anything if you have to.
2	Depends on the music. For the artists with serious stuffs WITH their work depicting the same thing ("abusive" artists singing lyrics mentioning "abuse", with them being the inflictor, yeah?), I don't do that. But if they don't then I still listen to their work. \nThat's in theory, but practically it's pretty hard. It depends on my level of enjoyment for their music too. 
2	Same with Kevin Spacey from House of Cards or Roman Polanski or Harvey Weinstein, if you cancel any one of these artists because of their actions, you have to cancel all of them or it would be hypocritical. \n\nI don't cancel on artists because of their actions to be honest. I still jam to Kodak Black and 6ix9ine. I don't see the point. I don't praise them as people though, don't get me wrong. I just appreciate the art and that's it.
2	Look throughout history. More often than not, artists of all kinds (musicians, writers, painters, sculptures, photographers, etc.) often have sordid pasts.  This is nothing new; the big difference being that we have so much access to information, and it's immediate.  Back before immediate, mass communication, most people wouldnt have a clue about this stuff, and many people just kept it to themselves anyway.\n\nIf you enjoy the art, then enjoy it.  if you don't then don't listen/watch/look/read it.
2	I don't pay attention to normie shit
2	I honestly don't care if they're controversial, granted the only one I had was Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.
2	i don't listen to hiphop or rap, seems like they have the most problems and also hate the way they sound anyway, so i am mostly free of this issue lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt bad listening to justin bieber for a while after he did all the stupid stuff in the news, but mostly I just listen to his 2012 album soooo i no longer care. He shaped up a bit since then anyway! I think you can like music without particularly liking the artist as a person, especially if you know nothing about an artist's personal life, but if I happen to know and it makes me uncomfortable, yeah I'd probably stop for a while at least. 
2	If the newly found info somehow sheds a new light on whatever art he has produced, and that makes me disagree with whatever he produced, then I mind. Otherwise, if it simply doesn't matter, I don't.\n\nThe rabid fans looking for excuses and the moral brigade both annoy me 
2	Well I like Louis CK still. I don’t think he did anything wrong. As far as I know, it was consensual but creepy. And the entertainment industry is bearing down on him because he does things outside the system to produce his own content. \n\nThe message doesn’t change because someone is a controversial person — someone else in the world is likely to hold said artist’s views and opinions. It just so happens that person best expressed it. If I tried to copy that piece and present it as my own, I’d be accused of plagiarism. 
2	I think if an artist is toxic, that will generally come out in their music before the baggage comes to light. I personally don't listen to music that exhibits misogyny because I don't feel like it's made for me, as a woman. I also don't really gravitate towards music that glorifies murder/violence. I'm a pretty peaceful person and I'm attracted to music that accompanies my personality. If there were an artist who had positive/pure music but a murky past, I'm not sure how I would feel. I haven't encountered that so far. I've had to make that decision often, however, with philosophy. A lot of my favorite philosophers were known to be racist/sexist, yet I still read them. Admiring knowledge can be different than admiring music though. It seems that when one appreciates intellectual products, it speaks to a desire for truth that must be satisfied at all costs. However, when one appreciates artistic products, it appears to speak to the personality instead. I suppose I have higher moral standards for the art I consume than the books I read, because the former feels more reflective of my identity.

4	What the bleep does this mean? (Simulacra and Simulation)	There's this book [Simulacra and Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation) that the Wachowskis had the main Matrix actors read before the script (one of 3 actually).\n\nThe book's description goes like this:\n\n> Develops a theory of contemporary culture that relies on displacing economic notions of cultural production with notions of cultural expenditure. This book represents an effort to rethink cultural theory from the perspective of a concept of cultural materialism, one that radically redefines postmodern formulations of the body.\n\nI'd like to read the book, but firstly I think I should be able to understand the bloody description...\n\nI feel like an ape. Normally, when I understand a sentence, I can at least rephrase it. But this shit is just beyond me. Everyone in the Matrix movie must've been a fucking genius.\n\nCould someone please, ELI5?
2	It's just a poor description.  I'm not sure where that comes from, but the wikipedia article seems like a better overview of the actual book.\n\nIn general, the idea I think it is trying to convey is that we all live in a Platonic hell where Jewy bankers mortgage our future before we even recognize it, that this is completely inescapable since it is not only individual but cultural, and that managing this therefore requires a rethinking of even basic notions such as "production" and the self.\n\nSo there are academics who write long books filled with these vague phrases such as "cultural expenditure" instead of "Jewy bankers" because the Jewy bankers responsible tend to cut the nuts off of anyone who tries to expose them, as was apparently done to the Wachowskis.\n\nWelcome to the matrix.
236	Wanting to be "normal", yet afraid to be "normal" at the same time. Anyone else suffering from this paradox?	First and foremost, I don't think I'm superior to other people, and I know I lack a lot of practical skills many people find natural. However, I often feel I'm weird and hard to relate to other people. I simultaneously wish I'm "normal" so I can connect better with people I find interesting, and to stop worrying about things most don't even care about. I'm tired of meta analyzing my thoughts and trying to psycho analyze myself because the result will always be a repetitive and endless loop. It is really embarassing because I know I'm a little snowflake who is too caught up in his own head. I spend most of my time dealing with useless thoughts instead acquiring actually useful skills.\n\nParadoxically, I'm also afraid I'm completely normal and is simply too weak and stupid to deal with my own flaws, sometimes I wonder if I'm just rationalizing my flaws to feel special so I don't have to deal with realities and the truely difficult parts of life. I often wonder if I'm not at all "special", because I think maybe I'm just like everyone else and suffer the same "symptoms" as everyone else, and the only thing I have that makes me standout is the fact that I'm simply maladjusted and take myself too seriously.
96	I once had a psychiatrist comment, "You really don't want to be ordinary, do you?" I doubled over in paid and without thinking said, "Ordinary is worse than death." We ended up talking quite a bit about that.\n\nIn my case, I have stuck out as being different since I was a preschooler.  Everyone in the world instinctively knew that I was a weirdo. I was not antisocial or anything, but I was still the last one picked for everything.\n\nAt first, that really bothered and hurt me. Why didn't other people accept me. So I developed a coping mechanism of deciding not to care what others thought about me, and a sense of superiority came along for the ride. I began to push people away without waiting for them to recoil.\n\nI have a mind that comes up with one liners in response to everything, and I knew what they were when I heard myself say them. I had no control over them, and I remembered every detail about every person so that I could strike a tender spot.\n\nThis sense of not being normal grew as I aged through high school and into college.  The thing is, a decent amount of the time, my crazy abnormal thoughts proved to be correct.  I could figure things out that others could not, so how could I not be superior. \n\nWhen I was 20, I realized what a despicable jerk I had become, and I consciously rewrote my personality when I went to France for a year abroad.  I realized that I could not stop the snappy comebacks, but I could redirect them to support and compliment people instead of tearing them down. Over the year, I made a surprising amount of progress, but my driving need to be different did not change.\n\nI wish I could say that I got over it all in my 20's, but it stayed the same or got worse.  I found myself unable to do anything the "right" or normal way. I had to do things my way, and even if my way was a lot harder, that did not matter because it was still my way.\n\nThis continued to haunt me through my 30's.  Along the way, I developed a deep and abiding disdain for normal people. I looked down on their pointless unthinking lives. And then at some point, I realized that those miserable people were happy. I would see them driving home from work all excited to see their family and friends, and they seemed not at all concerned about how they were wasting this existence.  Then I looked at my own existence and realized what a dark and depressed person I had become.  I did not want to admit it, but I would trade places with them.\n\nAnd thus began my journey to find a way out. I realized that I was not connected to anyone.  I had friends, but they were all casual and they came and went. I loved my wife, but it was on autopilot. It was no surprise that I was not connected with people because I often wondered if other people were real. I mean, think about some really stupid person you know.  Can you imagine if the only life you knew was to be that person 24 hours a day for an entire life.  Surely they must want to kill themselves.  But no, they actually seemed quite content.\n\nIt took me many years to realize that what I sought was not to connect with people as objects. I had to get to know people and care about them before I could connect, and I was going about it backwards. My two years seeing a Yogi every week was immensely helpful, and after a few tries, I discovered that everyone's life is an interesting and compelling story, and everyone has something to teach me. \n\nSo I began, mechanically at first, to make an effort to discover those life stories and the things they had to teach me. Over several years, it became less mechanical and more enjoyable, and at some point, I realized in a non-intellectual way that I was one of them, and they were like me. My need to be different slowly dissipated, and I noticed that I no longer questioned whether people were real. I began to feel connections with other people, and it felt glorious.\n\nI have to admit that at 54, I am still a work in progress.  Particularly in my work as an attorney, I still find myself fighting mainstream thought. But now it is something that I experience and notice, not a wet blanket that engulfs me.\n\nI am going to hazard a guess that you are younger than 54. My purpose in relating this to you is so that you consider whether it has any meaning for your life, and if it does, that you might not be a work in progress at 54.  I do think that a feeling of being disconnected is a part of feeling different and better. I don't have any suggestions for trying to change that other than making yourself spend the time to get to know people, one at a time, a little better. If your experience is like mine was, you might find that things you rejected are actually meaningful and enjoyable. \n\nOr, if you have the right machine, we could trade places, and I could go back to my youth and not fuck it up so much the second  time.\n\n&#x200B;
22	Every person has these feelings/thoughts you're describing. Thinking types more so, and INTPs most of all.   \n\n\nWhen this feeling gets too much I try to go out and participate in some herd-mentality activity like a music concert or sports event. It makes me feel like I have something in common with people and I feel somewhat normal for a while. 
13	I don't wanna be normal, just functional.
9	you just describe how i feel perfectly
9	I think it's a part of growing up. I've learn to give 0 fucks about that kinda stuff. Do what makes you happy with people who make you happy you don't have to fit societies mold. What's important is that you take risks that will benefit you like trying like building platonic relationships, going to that concert with friends, talking to your crush. These things will keep your mind healthy and prevent you from stagnating which as an INTP is really what should be a real concern as your mind can become a prison. The overanalyzing can create irrational fears.
7	Wow homie, you really are caught up in your head. I do it too. Different subjects. You are right it's not good. Doesn't get you anywhere, just stressed. I had a pretty bad emotional break down recently that had been building for months, yet all I had to do was break the cycle, and it's all better now. My gf helped me actually, since it was her I was stressing over. We had a very productive heart to heart talk.\n\nWhat is normal? I get wanting to fit in. I get not fitting in. If you were like others, whoever that is, you'd lose all the cool stuff you are. Do you really want to be like them or just liked by them? What would you gain by being liked by "them"? \n\nI suck at making friends, so I offer no advice. Find peace with it though, so you can let it drop instead of stressing you. See a therapist or read a book on people skills. Type Talk At Work is a good book on people skills. How to win friends and influence people is another good one. Take some action is my advice to break the cycle. \n\nYou could watch people who seem to be popular and try to figure out why that is. You might learn a few tricks that way. \n\n
5	The older I get, the less I care. I spend more time on things I enjoy these days.  There is no normal anyway. 
6	>*Who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?*\n\n\nIf you stop to think about every experience, you’ll be too busy thinking about the experiences to actually experience the things you’re thinking about. \n\nLearning how to tell your brain to shut the fuck up so you can just enjoy yourself is an invaluable skill to learn.
4	I'm stuck in a position where I am not normal and while I think it's blissful and something to be happy about, I also regret not being able to connect with people on their level. \n\nEverything from simple music tastes to life goals, I march to the beat of my own drum. The only one other person that gets me is another fellow INTP. 
2	Remember, you can appear normal to others and still be as weird as you want in your own head!
2	yes, until i really thought about it and determined there wasn't a paradox, just a confusion of means, intention, needs, and desire.\n\n\nturns out, this was the wrong question to ask.\n\n\nwhat i wanted was contentment, and happiness. what i saw was other people appearing to find this with other people, sometimes in groups, and i was not.\n\n\nhumans are wired evolutionarily to be social as a survival mechanism. to not be able to get along with the herd/pack was to be cast out and lose access to safety and resources.\n\n\nwhat was going on was i was not fulfilling a biological need. \n\n\nand by not filling this need, nor understanding that i had it, i created a vicious cycle of questions, blame, and rationalization, where i ended up both attacking and defending myself simultaneously, such as you are doing.\n\n\nthe solution is to try something new, and keep trying new things until you find something you enjoy, then keep doing it and find the others who find a similar joy.\n\n\nbecoming accepted as part of a group is easy: either hate the same things they hate (easy, quick, unfulfilling), or love the things they love (difficult, time consuming, fulfilling)\n\n\nwith me, i found my college had a group of weirdos called the [sca](https://sca.org) that loved fantasy literature and sword fighting, and as i loved the first and wanted to try the second, i had a great time learning to fight with a sword.\n\n\ni have also found a similar joy in rock climbing at a rock gym, and learned how to climb rocks. these people were nuts, in a good way, and i enjoyed that too.\n\n\nsimilar with playing hand drums for a middle eastern belly dancing troop.\n\n\nand yoga.\n\n\nand now pilates.\n\n\nand in a year, probably some form of shuffle dancing.\n\n\nbut as an introvert, i still had to balance my joy in doing these things and the people i met and enjoyed doing them with, their desire to do these activities with me, and my need for solitude. this is important, because once you've been in a group for a while, there's a lot of pressure to do group activities, and it's *really* easy to burn yourself out by overdoing the things you love with the people you love and ending up moody and resenting both the activity and the people... simply because you didn't feed your introversion.\n\n\nit's not about being normal, it's about learning how to be happy, as that's not something you're born with. \n\n\nso pick something off the beaten path and do it, find the joy in it, and the rest will take care of itself. fwiw, i recommend trying the things i've mentioned, although i might be biased :)
2	Fucken normies
1	Im scared im becoming normal
1	Oh, that me, especially since I started working around more people. Depending on the day, I am either by myself (I'd almost work for free those days). Or I am around a lot of coworkers.\n\nSo that means I stand by myself and just watch them talk to each when things aren't busy. But I feel awkward just standing there, but I also wish I knew what talk about but I also don't want to.\n\nBut thankfully there is someone working in a different department that's thankfully as awkward as I am with small talk, and we talk about world politics, science and sci-fi. It's very refreshing.
1	Nor-mal simply means that which is not bad. It is assigned using inductive reasoning so it is not necessarily right. You are right to call this a paradox, as it is an identity flaw common in simple folks that can lead to predator and prey relations if abused. "You will never know what you never had", such is the nature of 'paradoxes' they are like building a house from the inside out and forgetting to add doors.\n\nExamples Include:\n\nRisk / Reward Game Theory\n\nPositivism / Pragmatism as seen in Scientific rebellions of the early 19th century\n\nPride / Prejudice - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nm61IoNdHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nm61IoNdHg)\n\nIgnorance / Arrogance\n\nu/thenottoserious the problem you describe is being consistently emotionally rejected by a person whom has accepted predation and therefor cannot handle the reality of troubling news. You have hubris because the information you have received from such a person is contaminated with the arrogance of them refusing to accept their mortal limitations and evolve a defense or plan of action. People like them can advance through the Peter Principle because others wrongfully place trust in them since they do not compete challenging the authority of those around them. This is a false loyalty and ultimately in the end they will lash out at you with projections because its in their nature.  \n\n\nThere will always be some stupid hippy cult preaching "Acceptance & Servitude" and when they flock the substance abusing thugs will come about to prey. But the Arboreal nature of humans is a constant so there will always be a hierarchy to dissuade these basic bros.
1	I'm not 100 or for that matter 90% sure what type I am, but I have 2 good candidates of what type it can be...  \nBut you can try and guess...  \n\n\nWhile I was reading this, I in some weird sens was looking at myself, like a child watching other kits playing and having fun, but was not allowed to join in... This kit was really sad, and you was able to see that is was one of his biggest wishes in the world...  \nJust to to play with the others, and be allowed in for who he was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(learning to be valuable, not a easy thing for me...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is so much in these written words that hit so hard and straight home, that it's somewhat scary, to witness...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know, as you all wright and so many around also write... DO NOT try to fit in, be yourself....\n\nBut at one point or another, everyone breaks and can't handle the slapping over one's fingers anymore...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was younger and in the army (Had to serve here), we were allowed to go home to rest for a weekend... There was one weekend, after a week in the field, beetings, wet and cold (Most know the feeling, I think).  \nThat weekend, when I got home and lai down in my bed alone, warm and just silens, that wonderful feeling of being in a great and homey environment, where you're are allowed to be...\n\nThat feeling is something I treasure like no other, as I only experienced it very few time. Can only think of one time right now..  \nWhen with them, you just go, home relax and be free...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this makes sense... I'm looking at this painting I'm trying to paint here, and can only compare, the blue sky and the green grass with what I have internally, but much much more...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut thank you all for those words, it's wonderful to know, that one are not alone...
1	This describes my experiences so well :/
1	I have come to the conclusion I'll never be "normal". \n\nwhat is so interesting about being normal? 
1	I think meditation would benefit a lot of INTPs
1	This hasn't been on my radar for a while but I understand what you're describing. Try keeping track of these things that you perceive "normal" people do and then focus on that aspect. IE: If you keep thinking "I wish I could talk to people better" then realize that is a skill you can hone and with experience it gets easier. Know that you are the same as everyone else in that we all have no idea what's going on but also you have a unique view of the world (due to the sum of your genetics and experiences) and you should always cherish your uniqueness.
1	I wish all my problems would disappear, but without those problems, there would be nothing there. I'm an endless supply of problems
1	I’m currently trying to deal with that problem. For me “wanting to be normal but afraid of being normal” translates to a strong desire of acceptance from others alongside the need of being special.\nI believe that, in many ways, I’ve been forced to stand out since I was a child. Things I couldn’t control just added up to create the settings I grew up in (as things often do). A single parent family, being brown in an otherwise completely white and fairly racist family, being sexually abused up until I was 13 among other things, made it very difficult for me not to develop a messed up sense of self. Or you know, self-esteem.\n\nI wasn’t exactly a weirdo. Just a bit unadapted and naive maybe. I’ve been punished for it in my first year of middle school by being bullied, but most of my life I’ve been fine with others. I often say that people usually like me or don’t care about me. I know it sounds pompous but this is genuinely true, and I know why this is the case.\nIt’s said that intps are really good at understanding systems, patterns around them. for me I believe it’s the human mind and social interaction. After that first year of middle school, I started observing how people work, what they say, the way they talk, how they react, stuff that any extrovert would naturally picked up on. But I had to conscientiously learn it. That way I could copy it so that I wouldn’t stand out so much.\nAnd it worked. I’ve succeeded at role playing the outgoing, confident extrovert up until now.\n\nSo now I’m well adjusted (socially, I still have a crazily bad relationship with institutions). I have friends, I go out, I party a lot. And only my old and close friends know I’m one hell of an introverted nerd with crushing anxiety and a cocaine addiction. I’ve hidden all the damaged parts of me, the quirky bits, everything that could make people think I don’t belong with them.\nBut for some reason there’s still some part of me that wishes I could be special somehow. That I could be that one person who doesn’t quite fit but in an awesome, charismatic way and not the sad, pathetic way like I would.\n\nDespite all that, I still find myself thinking I’m better than everyone else.\nI am not. In fact I have so many issues I’m barely functioning as a human being. Yet somehow my brain manages to trick me into believing that because I “choose” to be normal I’m superior to those who didn’t. This is bullshit of course, but I only realized that recently.\nThere’s no point in working so hard to fit a mold you despise. The truth is I don’t despise the mold, I despise myself for trying to fit in the wrong one.\n\nI’m not afraid of being normal. I’m afraid of being ordinary. Of loosing myself in the mass and not being able te retrieve what used to make me a little bit special. Even in a sad way. 
1	You'll grow out of it
1	well I mean sort of, I wish i didn't have my learning disabilities but at the same time, I am sort of normal at my school because about over a quarter of my year are (I assume) NT types
1	It's called wanting to belong but not wanting to change. Thank your inferior Fe for it.
0	Does anyone else switch between INTP and ENTP?	I used to test as an ENTP and now I test as an INTP. \n\nAt some point I lost interest in socialising because most of the people I met were idiots and I was unable to relate to pretty much everyone without having a mask on. I decided that most people were shitty and closed myself up. \n\nWhen I next took the test about 3 months later, I was an INTP. Every single time after I've tested the same, but I've begun to realise of late that I do t have to be myself to everyone, and I'm going to try to rebuild my social life. This might turn me back into an ENTP. \n\nDoes anyone else find themselves switching between being one of the extroverted types and being an INTP?
6	Ehh, at the end of the day, you don't really change. ENTPs and INTPs are pretty much similiar to each other as a Google Docs is to Microsoft Word. 
4	I switch to INTJ on those not-so-reliable tests whenever I feel my life is a mess and I need to organize it. That's why I used to think I am an INTJ for a long time.
2	I am the farthest thing from an expert on MBTI, but my own observation is that the I/E distinction is the most plastic. I have been an introvert all my life, but I have learned to comfortable in groups, and I am entirely relaxed when giving a talk or speech to hundreds of people or arguing to a court. \n\nIf it were me, I would lurk here and in r/ENTP.  When I did that, I found that I saw myself here, but did not there. That was all I needed to know.
2	My best friend is an INTP and as I see whenever she's tired or hungry, she acts like an ENTP😂😂\n\nShe even played paper kissing once when she was tired 😂😂
2	I love rping as an INTP all the time. I’m really an ESTJ most days but when I’m feeling down, I switch to INFP. Somedays, I’m a little more outgoing and I put on my best ENFP before heading to the club. My best is probably INFJ when I reddit and secretly judge everyone. 
2	Yeah, I think introvert and extrovert modes are prone to change? Actually I haven't dug deep into the differences between xNTP's so enlighten me ì I'm wrong. 
1	I act like an ENTP with family, and on cognitive function tests my Ne is slightly higher than my Ti. But I am too introverted with everyone else and definitely have inferior Fe, so there's that\n\nAlso I have periods of wanting to socialize/become outgoing but it lasts for a short time
4	It's one of those days where I forgot my sunglasses, and would really like to use the sun visor...	
5	Hmmm.\n\nI wonder if most INTPs are dog people or cat people. 
5	There is a very simple solution to your problem. You grab the 4 small packets of paper, place them in the seat next to you and then lower the visor. 
1	Generally I keep anything from a doctor's office above it, ranging from appointment reminders to pamphlets. What does anyone else keep there?
1	So use it then.
4	Imagine a perfect world without those nasty emotions	A thought occurred to me that made me laugh and kept me amused for an hour. I thought I would share it so people could tell me why I am wrong. \n\nFor a bunch of thinkers, the topic of emotions sure does come up here a lot. In fact, the word emotion appears in 80 topics in the last month alone. Those seem to fit into two categories; one that discusses how to deal with emotions as an INTP, and one that rejects emotions as trash. A lot of INTPs have considered emotions to be nuisance sometime in their lives.\n\nSo that got me to thinking about the perfect INTP world without emotions. Everything would be so much better because people would be rational and do things for an objective reason.\n\nA few really great things came to mind. I doubt that there would be any wars. Wars usually start over things like hate, fear, greed, and nationalism. All emotions. Nationalism is a complex emotion, but is certainly is not rational thinking. So peace on earth at last.\n\nI don't think there would be crime either. Crimes result from envy, greed, hate, and love. Again, all emotions.  Take emotions out of the equation, and there is no logical reason to commit a crime. I guess you could argue that economically it might make sense to commit a crime if the punishment were less than the reward, but we logical people would not let that happen.\n\nSo life is looking just about perfect. Everyone would spend all day making new scientific discoveries and being polite to each other. \n\nBut wait a second. Liking and loving are emotions as is hating. In this perfect world without emotions, either everyone would be pretty much the same or people would be judged on their intelligence. But superior intelligence is a reason to respect someone, not a reason to like them. And a lover? Give me a break. \n\nSo maybe the no friends thing would be OK, but if people did not love each other, why would we procreate. Logically, a child will cost more than the potential return in later life.  Better to invest the money in stocks than in a child. Then again, logically, procreation is necessary to continue the species, so I am sure that we would figure something out.\n\nBut when they are born, babies are helpless and take a lot of time. We do that because of emotional attachment, but with that gone, it makes no sense.  I suspect that we would create baby farms where newborns could be sent and raised. If someone wanted a child later on, pretty much any one would do because a preference for one's own would be emotional. \n\nSex might continue because it feels good, but it would not really matter who or what you had sex with. In fact, I am sure that machines could provide more pleasure than a person at lower cost, so Woody Allen's Orgasmatron would be real. In fact with today's technology, we could use the product of the machines to grow babies in a machine so that people did not lose 9 months of productivity. But man, those machines would feel great.\n\nAnd surely the scientific discoveries would more than make up for friends and lovers. But hold on, what drives people to make scientific discoveries? Passion you say?  Well none of that. Logically what we have and know today is good enough. Discoveries may give price and fulfillment (emotions), but the rewards are not likely to come in our lifetimes, so the effort is a net negative. I mean when you take the desire out of a desire for invention, you don't get much invention.\n\nThe more I think about it, the harder it is to think of what people would actually do with their time. Video games are cool, but without an emotional component, we might as well be doing addition and subtraction. Most work these days does not have a good logical explanation. And TV that does make me laugh, cry or get mad would be as appealing as wallpaper.\n\nCaring may be a feeling instead of an emotion, but feelings require emotions to exist. In my perfect world, I do not see how anyone would care about anything except their own survival. Without emotions to attach us to each other, there would be no reason to have countries. The good news is that no one would be sad about not caring because sadness is an emotion. Then again, no one would be happy either. \n\nI have no idea what we would be. What is a human with no emotions like?  Contrary to popular belief, psychopaths and sociopaths do have emotions, but they are distorted. If we had no emotions, would anything matter at all? If humankind continued for millions of years or went extinct tomorrow, what difference would it make? None that I can see. \n\nOn second thought, let me have some of those emotions.
4	Without emotions our ancestors would have walk directly into danger and died the end
3	> For a bunch of thinkers, the topic of emotions sure does come up here a lot.\n\nBecause that's our weakness, whereas we are confident in our thoughts.\n\nTl,Dr btw
1	One of my favorite past-times is to logically break down emotions (of other people), so I'd be pretty bored in such a world lol. Plus while INTPs may not make decisions based primarily on emotions, there are definitely actions and opinions we form that one way or another incorporates our feelings. \n\nI feel like if the world was emotionless, humankind would end at the drop of a hat. Afterall, motivation and perseverance are stimulated from emotions as well. What would keep people from just killing themselves? But I guess you'd need motivation to do that too... \n\nDefinitely a mindfuck. 
1	I came to pretty much the same conclusion in my late teens.
1	Is planet vulcan
1	This is actually been explored in a movie. You actually described the movie so closely i hav to ask. Did you watch it\n\nThe giver\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giver_(film)\n
1	Well I tend to agree with the message presented in Frank Herbert's Dune that emotion and logic are weak by themselves as (in the case of logic) blocking emotions will cause you to grow arrogant and not question your basic beliefs and the foundation of your logic, I consider the difference between emotionless logic and a balanced mindset like the difference between fast ram and ram that's slightly slower ECC ram, also reading about the baby farms reminds me of 'Brave New World'
1	The reason why we mourn is, according to evolutionary psychology, to protect our loved ones. You don't want to mourn, mourning hurts. So, how would you go about preventing mourn? Protect your loved ones. Feeling bad emotions is a survival strategy.\n\nYou also mentioned people would commit less crime if there were no bad emotions, but I'm pretty sure that's a double edged sword. I wouldn't kill someone because I think murder is immoral. If I had no bad emotions, there would be nothing stopping me from hurting you
1	Many many times people have told me "Why don't you wanna change? Don't wanna experience the variety of emotions we have?"  \n\n\nWhy would anyone wanna do that? People are suffering and are extremely dependant without even realizing it and everything is due to those feelings.
1	There's an interesting chapter in Sapolsky's Behave about the subparts of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). He distinguishes between (1) the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) - 'the most rational, cognitive, utilitarian, unsentimental part of the PFC', and (2) the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) - 'all about the impact of emotion on decision making'. People with dlPFC damage show poor executive function, while those with vmPFC damage 'can't run as-if experiments of gut feelings - how would I feel if this outcome occurred'. There's some interesting bits too about vmPFC and dlPFC activation when people are asked to contemplate the trolley problem...  People with damaged vmPFC will sacrifice a relative to save five strangers. More mind-blowing studies in the book, you might enjoy reading it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
16	Self-help for INTPs	26 year old INTP here. Lurking this sub, I’ve noticed a lot of you suffer from overthinking, or negative thoughts. I suffered from this immensely my whole life, until about 4-5 years ago when I decided to stop letting my mind run rampant, and stop being/feeling so isolated. I started meditating and doing yoga everyday, reading and listening to self-help stuff, actually going outside and talking to people. Now I’m a wayyy different person than back then. My old self still pops up now and then. There are still some nights where I can’t fall asleep because my mind keeps racing with thoughts, and I still need quite a bit of alone time. But now I’m at least 10% happier. I can actually make friends now. I can just sit in peace without my thoughts screaming at me. \n\nHighly recommend meditation and self-help for y’all. An easy step is listening to the Tim Ferris podcast. There are also meditation apps and videos out there to get y’all started. There’s a lot of pain in this sub- this stuff can help.
4	Did you by any chance use the 10% happier meditation app? 
3	That is so wonderful to hear. At 54, I can say that my own experience has been similar, except that I would have to replace the 2 in your age with a 4. Suddenly, I feel like such a failure. When I was 26, I was a complete mess. I am joking about the failure part, but not about the complete mess part.\n\nAlthough I studied Zen Buddhism in college, I could never calm my mind to meditate. I advanced when I learned the same skills as mindfulness, and I have suggested it to others. Whatever works is the right answer. Mindfulness and meditation do not come easily or naturally to the young INTP mind, and you a great example to show that one need not wait until middle age.\n\nIf I might make a request of you, stop lurking all the time and occasionally share your experiences. A lot of people here really need to see evidence that things can be better, and you would do a lot of good.  \n\nI can't quit thinking about what life would be like if I had started at age 26.  Deep easy  breaths . . . .
2	I’m a little older than you but I come from a religious or spiritual family (buddhist). I’ve had people preach meditation to me all my life and I’ve done meditation and it just wasn’t for me. In general though I agree that most of us need to develop more spiritually and emotionally. If meditation isn’t for you, there are other avenues of self development. Even therapy (with the right therapist) can be valuable to us all. For me, I overcame most of my blocks through my own personal development and psychadelics but that’s not going to be for everyone. Point is, when people are ready to help themselves, I am sure they will ;).
2	Would you say overthinking is the father of anxiety, and the thief of joy?
1	Meditation really helped me too. I can't say it's the only reason I was able to finish my degree, but it certainly helped. 
1	I'm 21 but suffer from overthinking a lot; I know that I need to help myself somehow, but I'm not sure where to start. I'll tru some of the stuff you've recommended here, so thank you
1	Yep, meditation (meditative prayer) sets me up for the day and helps me sort my head out.. it usually consists of the Jesus Prayer (Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner) and regulated breathing.\n\nOne day I will ascend into the Cloud of Unknowing.\n\nAs a history nerd I find Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism very useful. 
16	INTP's, how do I love/date you?	What do you really like in relationships?\nWhat puts you off?\nWhat personalities are you attracted to?\n\nENFP Female here dating and INTP male currently. 
27	Just express how you feel. Things are black and white to me so if you come to me pissed off about some way I’ve been acting my first question to you is, why the fuck did you wait til it pissed you off? \n\nAlso send all the nudes.
19	I have an unhealthy attraction to feelers. Love when women initiate flirty/physical contact.\n\nI hate lies of any kind. Little lies get picked up and makes me paranoid of bigger lies.\n\nToo much complimenting is a putoff and feels manipulative\n\nI tend to be attracted to feeler types/complimentary personalities, and bubbly girls that make it hard to not be happy.\n\nENFP, INFP, INFJ, married an ESFJ, divorced an ESFJ , and tend to crush on ISFPs but those connections dont tend to work out.
16	Be honest, direct. Say it like you feel it. Maybe as INTP I am very Black and White, no grey areas as to what feelings are like.\n\nDeceit rubs me the wrong way real fast and sharp. I can't handle folk that like to bullshit they way around.
12	I probably will not align with many INTPs thoughts on this, so take it with many grains of salt. \n\n--- \n\n> What personalities are you attracted to?\n\nOften ENFPs. Usually I am attracted to artistic and bubbly girls with lots of interests. \n\n> What puts you off?\n\nEmotional unavailability. Concealing of concerns. I want to hear what they are going through. \n\n> What do you really like in relationships?\n\nRapid sharing of ideas, any conversation getting philosophical, going on adventures
6	ENFPs are a great match for INTPs. You have an uncanny ability to bring us out of our shell. Just, please, make sure to explain yourself clearly. We aren't unfeeling douchebags, but we aren't the most perceptive bunch. If you tell us what's up, we can react, and I think we are pretty good at that. \nFor instance, if you're feeling a lack of affection, (an issue I've had in most relationships) tell the man. I'll be the most affectionate motherfucker if I know that's what's wanted/expected from Me. \nSo, in summary: make your wants and needs known. \n
6	Complete honesty.\n\nNo matter how much I love or want to be around someone, if they lie to me its all over.\n\nAnd I can tell, even when I don't want to.
3	Pursue them. Don't feel like you are bugging them if you're being reasonable. (Not a crazy over-attached person. Any semi-healthy person should be able to easily tell the difference.) Try to set up events with them, and eventually they will too. Be OK with quiet dates at home or quiet places like a park during a weekday or a coffee shop. Be prepared to discuss things you enjoy, like media or news or school subjects. (Not politics, at least until you are able to figure out if you agree) Give a real, honest try to appreciate the things your INTP likes, whether it's comic books, games, movies, etc. These are very important to use and I recommend trying to 'see beneath the beneath' and look at the themes of their favorite media to understand why they enjoy it. \n\nIt took me almost a year of dating to realize I truly loved my now-wife. She did all of these things. I never had a girl that responded positively to the dumb nerdy shit I always sheepishly mentioned when asked. She texted me once a day, when I could easily go a week or two and not initiate a text without even thinking that might be perceived as bad or uninterested. \n\nShe enjoyed  being around me and wanted to hear my thoughts and opinions. That is, no joke, THE SINGLE BIGGEST TURN ON FOR INTP. NOTHING is more attractive than being legitimately asked for our opinions or ideas on things. (Note that I mean turn on as in: They will want to spend time with you. Not sexually, like you ask for their opinion and then they'll have their pants off in 5 mins. Although maybe!)
6	Dated an *ENFP* once.\n\nI'm aro/ace, so what I like in relationships are what everyone else sees secondary : companionship/close friendship, physical affection, loving securely, ...\n\nWhat attracted me (like hell) : seeing an *NP* type functioning so differently but at the same time having the same interests, the (real) open mind, the general optimism, the goofiness/childishness in which I could blend in without feeling judged, ... In general, having someone to share my adventures with, whether they're in our heads (planning trips/dates, discovering new concepts ; *Ne* stuff) or actually done.\n\nWhat made it fail/turn-offs : we both sucked at communication, she wanted things without ever daring to ask/initiate (leading her to go date someone else in my back and then never providing closure), constant need for validation (don't try to become attractive for an *INTP* ; you either already are, or never will be able to trick us), she constantly tried to make impossible things work «because this is how it feels right» and then the constant drama following it (*Fi* has been a major turn-off for me since then ; your *INTP* tells you something is impossible, better suck it up because it's true, and feelings are irrelevant to us next to truth), incapacity to take clear decisions and hold to them, ...\n\nAll in all, there was huge potential for us to be very happy together. I think it's more the one I dated who just had a massive validation/ego problem and a broken moral compass. (Abusive people tend to make their victims believe their abuse is acceptable behaviour, and when victims don't get treatment, they can end up being abusive too.)\n\nEDIT : And don't **ever** try to hide things to protect your *INTP*'s feelings ; we just end up working our asses out trying to obtain the truth through *Ti-Si* loops, and it's kinda torture for us.\n\nAnd yes, don't repress showing your feelings just because we don't reciprocate ; they were part of what I loved about her. It's an unfamiliar territory for us, but not a disliked one. :)
3	Talk to us and be honest
3	A lot of my past partners have been ENFP and I also have an unhealthy attraction to this type. Things I enjoyed were the attention and affection. Things I didn’t enjoy were betrayal. In my experience your type is very heavily feelings based and even within a long term relationship, you can peace out just like that based on your emotional compass. If I’m not doing so hot, I’m pretty sure another guy comes along that meets your emotional needs, you’d peace out fast. That is the one problem with this pairing is that INTP’s suck at communicating their emotional needs and providing emotionally for their partner and something that might be happening to you right now. \n\nYou guys are fun but hot damned if I trust another ENFP maybe I’m just biased but when you’ve been burned multiple times the same type, I can at least say its trending.\n\nOther types I’m attracted to include INTJ, INTP, ENTP, INFJ. From enneagram, I get along with other 9’s and I’m also attracted to them. I also get along with 5’s very well and 1’s. 7’s are attractive to me in theory but I’ve also met some 7’s and they are a little too wild for me.
2	I had an ENFP gf. She was really immature so she always played the "oh its nothing"  and "yeah I'm fine(she wasn't)"  game. And it got the a point which was irritating the hell out of me. I knew that she wanted to talk about her problems but wanted to me beg for her to talk about it first. So in conclusion, please please please just be honest and direct. 
2	Be open and honest. If something is wrong, say so. Say exactly what is wrong and explain why and how it bothers you. Believe me, you will have his full attention if you do that, and he will not laugh it off or belittle you, he'll look for ways to fix it. That's just how out minds work. \n\nIf we see a problem, we look for a solution immediately. We can't turn that off and most of the time we wouldn't want to anyway. You'll know one of us truly loves you when you see the lengths we're willing to go to just to make things work if we know what the issue is.\n\nNever, ever lie even if the truth hurts. Lies are ridiculously easy for us to spot, and one little lie is an indicator that you're probably lying about a lot of other stuff. Little lies will make us wary of you and big ones will make us clam up and get distant. It's a form of self defense from toxic people that's extremely effective and it will take a while to get him to come out of his shell if you mess up like that.\n\nNot lying applies even to basic stuff like compliments. Only give genuine compliments. Lies come in all shapes and sizes and every single one is irritating to us.\n\nBe genuine with your affection. Don't do generic love stuff. Study your partner so that you do stuff that you know for a fact they would love because all an INTP ever really wants is to feel understood.\nBirthdays matter a lot in this regard. Celebrate the person, not the day.\n\nLies turn us off, but the truth gets us going so if he sees that your affection is genuine, and he'll be able to tell that it is if he notices that it's tailored to him, then expect him to reciprocate to the best of his ability (which can be surprisingly a lot for some of us).\n\n
2	Be honest. We can typically see through lies and don’t get offended easily (unless you accuse us of getting offended easily, then we will get offended), and it will make life easier for both of you if you are honest. Also, try to avoid taking insult to things he might say. We can be very dry and oblivious to the emotional implications of our words. Um as for what are we attracted to... everyone is different, but INTPs tend to be sapiosexuals. (Attracted to intelligence.)
4	Being intelligent does not mean arguing with men.  That gets old real fast.  Many unintelligent women think men want a “challenge”.  Wrong.
1	Well INTPs can be the most simple people when it comes to dating, or the most picky ones. For me, there are minor details in people that instantly make me more attracted or unattracted to them.\n\n>What do you really like in relationships?\nFor me, a good partner is like a stronger friend who I can share everything with while still maintaining some degree of independence. I hate relationships where the other person is constantly nagging me with worthless details or worst wants me to change drastically.\n\n>What puts you off?\nToo much talking. Different like goals and tastes. it's hard for me to understand people who see things drastically different.\n\n>What personalities are you attracted to?\nPrimarily ENTP, ENTJ and INTJ but it varies.
1	Honesty without expectations
1	You need to be very upfront. I can speak on behalf of many here and say we don’t take hints well
1	For me, I would say like two main things.\nFirst is, dont ever lie. Like about anything, even if its stupid little lie or whatever. Its not like I can't forgive people, but for me its just hard to forget it even if it was just a little lie and it will make me doubt people.\nSecond is, if there is something annoying about me or something you dont like, just tell me. Not when it escalates into a fight but right away when you start to feel that way.\nAlso, i dont like too jealous people. I think a little jealousy is normal in every relationship but dont overdo it.\nIt is just my personal experience tho, every person is different even if we are the same type. 
1	Be direct, honest and loyal. Don't talk behind people's backs and don't play with people's emotions, these are all the things me and the 3 other INTPs I know hate
3	Do you consider yourself healthy?	Conducting a social experiment- It's interesting to know how people perceive themselves, and how they perceive this question. It would also be interesting to know what your age is
4	I'm constantly struggling to fit sleep and exercise into my life. The times I succeed, nothing can take me down. Life is good and everything is doable!\n\nWell... Queue the slip-up. Something keeps me from working out and I become more and more sedentary each day I don't until the urge to move about completely subsides. Next on the chopping block is my sleep, as a logical conclusion. I'm positively wretched at this point. No taste for live or love, nothing. \n\nUntil the day I step into the gym again. Sometimes, months have passed at this point and when the feel-good hormones of exercise flush my body, I'm almost renewed, wondering how I could've ever lived without this feeling. \n\nJeeeeez, I sound like an addict. 
3	I am 54 and have an incurable autoimmune disease that will kill me if I go off my meds. I have lived with depression most of my life. My sleep is random, and my diet consists mostly of the things that I should not eat. In response to your question, hell yeah, I consider myself healthy. Planning to climb Mount Rainier this year and thinking about a trip to Guatemala to search the jungle for Mayan treasures. To be honest, I don't think that I am ever going to die.
3	Simply no. Too lazy to go into detail right now (16 btw)
2	I'm a teen. My sleep routine is inconsistent as fuck, all the "exercise" I do is walking around 40 minutes per day, and doing as many push ups as I can and  one hundreds sit ups every once in a while. \n\nI used to overeat (had some anxiety and stress problems) but this hasn't happened in a while, and my anxiety problems are mostly solved. My diet is very healthy. \n\nI'm not fit, and I don't like my shape, but I'm better than average in this regard. Have some light muscle to compensate for not being slim, I guess. \n\nSo, overall, I'm "ok" in health. Only my sleep needs serious work.\n\noh yeah. I'm INTJ.
1	I don't overindulge in anything and if I do eat/drink more of something it's not to an extreme. Like i started drinking coffee about every other day now, and sometimes I eat too many carbs because bread and pizza are amazing but whatever. I literally have never gone to the gym because i hate getting sore or sweaty -- luckily I never look like I need to thanks to naturally quick metabolism. I'm healthy enough. age 28 female
1	Im kind of skinny fat.  Working on building myself up with weight training but still not tight in the midsection.  Progress is being made though.  Bmi is 24.  28 yo
1	It's a ..uh working goal of mine.\n I see the importance of a healthy lifetsyle and have decided it would greatly benefit me. However, in reality i never schedule time and conjure up any motivation to exercise and i end up eating whatever will quiet my stomach and fill me till the next hunger without much thought.\n Then I mentally curse myself when the feelings of grogginess kick in :|
1	I am a 30's male INTP. I consider myself mentally healthy and physically adequate. I have good stamina and enough strength to be able to deal with nearly all of the feats of strength I need to. My latest trial in that was moving a medium-sized anvil. So, on the strength side, I would say that a medium-sized anvil about 50 yards is on the border of what I am capable of alone.\n\nI do like to run. On a good day, I can do 10 miles or so. I usually give out due to lack of time rather than need to stop.
1	not really, I am a bit overweight but I go to the gym now so that might change.\n\nEDT: 15 BTW
1	considering my hereditiary baggage, far from healthy. \n\ni do what i can though, exercise, sleep, diet. if i drop dead in 5 minutes at least i won't have regrets about not taking better care of myself.
1	Yes. I am oddly conscious about my physical appearance (not becuase of others, I just want to look good for myself? I don’t rlly care what others think). So I eat healthy and exercise regularly. So yeah. 
1	No
1	I eat whatever I feel like, up to and including ice cream for breakfast. But I have a very busy, moderately labourious job. I burn calories there for sure. I’ve always naturally kept a reasonably decent weight (bmi: 22.5), and I do like vegetables and such. My vices are sugar and weed. Aside from diet and exercise I very rarely get sick and I don’t have any noteworthy health issues so I would say yes I am healthy. 27F.
1	I’m healthy. I used to be skinnyfat before I met my husband. When I started dating him, he was really into the gym, and we would go together but I kind of always dreaded it. After years of habitually going with him, it’s now a hobby that I enjoy by myself.\n\nAlso, I’m really great at counting macros. It’s like a game. 
1	I'm 21 male. In terms of physical health, hell yeah! I am healthy as fuck. I don't get a lot of exercise however. But I poop everyday. I eat healthy. A good share of fruits, vegetables, meat, etc. My test results are really good.\nIn terms of mental health, I used to be depressed in the past, sometimes maniac, but more depression. I'm sort of okay now. I've gotten over it but it does return to me when things don't go right. I'm lonely, even though not nececcerily alone. I want more friends but I cannot find the right people. Recently I was in a dispute with my parents over stuff that didn't really matter.
103	Social media infuriates me	People are so fucking stupid. I don't want to be a new post on r/iamverysmart, but it really seems like almost everyone on Reddit is so closed off to different opinions, and just fueled by emotion, with walls of unsubstantiated 'evidence' being the foundation of their opinions. Every political sub I've seen is a horrible horrible echochamber. I read all these posts and I feel almost obliged to provide people with alternative ideas to balance out the clearly fucked up mental balance they have, but there's so much shit backed up in their head that it'd take days to make any progress.\nHalf the people on this sub seem depressed, but at least the majority of you are open to entertaining new ideas and can learn to recognise logical discrepancies in your own arguments.\n\nI don't know how to cope with it anymore. I want to contest my own opinions and learn to understand others' but it seems like so many people just have opinions that are fucking insane that I'll just go mental in the process. Then when you notice an insanity-trend with certain beliefs, you worry whether you're strawmanning people to shit or accurately assessing the situation, so you need more data to work out an answer. It's an endless loop of torment.  I want to help people open their mind, but there's no reward there, it's all stress. Changing your worldview takes ages, and I'm almost expecting my words to instantly achieve it, and them to have the humility to admit to it. It's not going to happen, so why the fuck do I feel so compelled to keep doing it.\n\nWith social media, it seems everyone has a voice, but nobody has a voice. There is an echochamber that everyone can cram themselves into, with the respective ideology slowly taking over their brains. Again, not to be a cliché, but I truly admire people like Jordan Peterson because it seems like he's genuinely trying to be an objective person, trying to get to the truth. I honestly can't think of many people who I feel have that quality about them, but I feel like the world should be the opposite way around, with ideologues being the minority. I'm thinking that social media has made it too easy to hide from perceived-to-be-dissenting opinions, so we've ended up with far too many people whose opinions have received too much reinforcement to warrant reassessment. The only solution I forsee is a form of social media where diversity of understanding is incentivised, and likes/dislikes don't affect visibility. Or simply no social media at all. YouTube recommendations, Reddit subs, Facebook pages, followed twitter pages, etc. all take you down ideological rabbit holes and I feel something has to be done about it. I can't help but think of the evolutionary reasons we're inclined to find a home in an ideological niche and commit to it, and how this behaviour might have been beneficial in small tribes/communities, but how it's now gone off the rails following the introduction of widespread media. It seems as though I'd be happiest having never found the internet and living in a small tribe in the wild, struggling for survival and squatting over dirt holes. Ugh
60	Heres the thing about being an INTP.  We love truth so when we see "untruths" being spouted around.....we get upset.\n\nAs an INTP myself, I constantly try to get others to see the other side of whatever garbage they're spewing.\n\nThis means in conservative spaces I get called an SJW snowflake, in liberal spaces I get called a racist nazi bigot, in trans spaces i get called a truscum transmedicalist transphobe,  in feminist forums I get called a CIS white male sexist.\n\nNo matter where I go, when I give an opinion, I get labeled something that I'm not. \n\nHow can I be a liberal SJW republican racist nazi, transphobe cis white antifeminist male.  \n\nWhen I'm literally just a centrist libertarian trans-woman\n\n Makes no sense.  But when you give opinions that counter the narratives among niche ideological groups....you automatically get lumped in with the people that group despises.  \n\nIt's sad.  Its herd mentality at its finest.\n\n
10	Check out r/changemyview
11	One, calm down lol. Social media isn’t important enough to get this upset over.\n\nSecond of all, social media is a very bad place to look for objective political discourse, or objective discourse at all, due to how most of it is structured. Echo chambers will happen because of course people will only willingly associate themselves with people with whom they agree. No one is using social media to debate. There are better platforms for this. Make a group of friends or something with whom you can have these discussions\n\nAnd third, this is just human nature; people want to fit in, generally speaking, which means they will tend to adopt similar ideas, and those which appear contrarian. You’ll see it in many social circles in general.
6	Social media was invented by reclusive males who hated society.  \n\nIts no wonder it is the way it is
3	A lot of people are satisfied with things being almost accurate, but almost accurate isn't accurate at all, it's almost worse because it's well disguised and widely accepted.. but that's kind of what relativism has brought to our society in every fundemental way unfortunately. 
6	I agree completely. It's so easy to isolate oneself from opposing viewpoints on social media. Individuals only follow accounts, pages, and subreddits that conform to their world views. This action, in and of itself, is not bad - most of us aren't going to follow pages which espouse ideas that are diametrically opposed to our own. But, as you said, this creates an echochamber. People put forth fallacious arguments which are never subject to any kind of criticism. If an individual argues against a site/page's prevailing ideology, he/she will be met only with ad hominem attacks. \n\nFor instance, I once argued that Stalin essentially created an artificial famine in Ukraine. For this, I was called a Nazi. Apparently, anyone who dislikes Stalin is a Nazi. Even Jews, like me.\n\nThis problem no longer exists only on social media. I think it is a significant issue in universities. On campuses across the US, a culture of anti-intellectualism has prevailed. Social and political groups isolate themselves from differing ideas and deride anyone brave enough to express a dissenting view. Both clubs and classes are ideologically driven, propounding only liberal to far-left arguments, which inevitably revolve around identity politics. \n\nOn my campus, students  who support Israel have been told to transfer. The Republican club, too afraid to publicly express itself, has been forced underground. I am neither a Republican nor a staunch supporter of Israel, but it both worries and angers me that anyone who dares speak up against a highly coercive ideological narrative is shunned into silence. 
2	Is it possible that many schools just aren’t fostering the art of persuasion with guidelines? I didn’t grow up with any that I could clearly remember. I argue emotionally before I play devil’s advocate, emotionally...
2	I can understand your frustration with people being too close minded to see a different perspective. I have it quite often as well. You are trying to enrich their life and help them see more objectively and they are just pissed off and closed to any perspective that would be helpful to everyone involved. \n\nMy observations are that people that you are trying to convince are having a specific set of experiences and the best way to make them listen is to understand it deeply. It's pretty logical actually to think about it - from their perspective your words might sound exactly like those from the opposite camp - the people that very often made their life miserable. So why would they listen? They heard this shit before anyway. I\n\nYou believe in truth and finding the most objective solution or idea like any INTP should. But it's not the purpose of everybodys life (like you noticed). Here you will find a lot of confirmations from people of similar beliefs... Because people do like to surround themselves with similar beliefs even if those are the belief that you should be open minded and looking for objectivety. \n\nBut is it always a bad thing? \n\nIt might be for sure, but i don't think it needs to be. This is how humans connect and work and to some degree allows us to make any decisions and actions. But what makes it easier to interract with people of different set of ideas (which is a very healthy thing imho) is empathy. I'm not talking about being emotional, no. I'm not talking about feeling the feelings other feel, but the empathy that allows you to analyze how people came to conclusions they came to. Some people are too far gone, but a solid group of people are able to be convinced by arguments if they are well cut to them. Even on the internet.\n\n\nBest wishes on your journey\n\nFellow *NTP \n\n
2	It’s awful. When people debate, it’s more of a show of who looks more correct; a boxing match, it’s sensational. No one is trying to form a correct truth, so no one is willing to contradict themselves to find the right way. No one is intellectually honest enough for discussions to be worth it. From media, people have opinions prepackaged in bit-sized pieces where people already did the fallacious thinking for them already, and it already aligns with what they believe already, and they don’t question it. That’s a problem. People may hear “question everything”, but they only question the things they already don’t like. And they never question their own minds. Because if they don’t, they’ll always be right with a load of people to back them up, regardless of any opposing force.
1	Some people are dumbasses... That doesn't make your opinions any more correct. \n\nIf correcting people is compulsory for you, you may just be a self-righteous asshole.\n\nAlso, you can always step away from social media. Nobody going to stop you. 
2	This looks like a huge wall of projection. 
1	hi OP, i understand the sentiment. i think this is the kind of conversation you want to have with a close friend or s/o; something like [the bench scene of MIB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2ppyMUlXfM)
1	I learn to guard stupid things against my emotion at about 23yo
1	Just the ones that post, the ones who don't out number them.
1	Yep. Sounds like something I would write.
1	Try Voat if you dare, but it's a bit of an echo chamber in a way. Leftists and conservatives (like in the_Donald) can't tolerate being there, so that's what makes the echos happen there. The difference with leftist and conservative echo chambers is that they become that way by means of banning dissenting opinions. Nobody gets banned on Voat unless you're spamming or maybe for a complicated system scam. You don't get banned for saying what you think. If you say something leftist, you will get a lot of negative responses, though. 
1	> Every ~~political~~ sub I've seen is a horrible horrible echochamber. I\n\nFTFY, seriously, there is a handful of subreddits where you can have your own opinion and not get banned or heavily downvoted. places where you can have a discussion.\n\nand when you get heavily downvoted you can barely post there (once per 15 minutes or once per hour). the problem with negative karma on subreddit is that it reduces your post rate, so it's pretty hard even to answer all the people attacking you there. i don't care if i get tons of downvotes, but it directly reduces my ability to answer the criticism.\n\n\nthat is the bane of technology - you get personalitzed search results on google, and that can close you off in a security bubble. you can ban people you don't like on various sites, just contributing to the problem. sure, some of them deserve it but on many cases you just filter out the critics and remove ability to hold a discussion.
1	Let them be. It is not worth it. 
1	Have the same. I'm always trying to show people that they can left a lot of the topics open. That you don't need to decide that something is like that and no more. People tend to believe in something often only because it's connected with groups they sympatize with. It's really frustrating that they can't look at their own group, from a different angle. I have an INTJ friend that is focused on facts and definitions of everything. He is 100% law obidient, he doesn't doubt in anything that he found reasonable sources for. It makes me crazy that we can discuss a lot of stuff but when it comes to something he found legitimate sources he stops thinking. I doubt in everything. I can believe someone's professional opinion but still I left the possibility that he can be wrong. For me, end of the source is not the end of topic. 
1	I feel you bruh. It's like being stuck in an endless paradox. With an argument I'm usually always on both sides, since to me nothing matters more than the best conclusion that can be reached. What annoys me is how you get labelled as a defeater if you comply with the other party's perspective. I think this is one of the main reasons everyone sticks so hard to their own point or whatever opinion they have.\nI had a discussion about it with an INTJ friend and she said that she does change her opinion mid argument but doesn't say it out loud. And later when the topic is said somewhere else she expressed her new opinion. Sounds shitty af but this is how you survive in this sad thing we call society. If we spent more time on getting actual shit done instead of arguing then the world would be 10x better.
1	You are not alone, INT brother. Or sister. Or whatever your gender is. \n\n^(equality)
1	Jordan Peterson has said some things of value but he most definitely is not impartial.\nHe’s very clever in that he only discusses subjects where his ideology can win. Mostly identity politics on college campuses where he is very much correct.\n\nAt the same time he does not address the economic realities of the world since the financial crash and likes to paint pictures of society where the most hard working are successful based mostly on hard work alone. He ignores corruption and the robber barons in society that have bought off most of the political systems in numerous countries. He also turns a blind eye to US imperialism when speaking about the muslim world.\n\nHe is rarely if ever questioned on issues like these because he is invariably interviewed by either right wing sympathizers or liberal identity zealots who try to paint him as sexist which plays in to his hands.\n\nOn the rare occasion that he does get cornered on one of these issues he concedes the point and moves on quickly. But the majority of his output goes against what he concedes is true and actually paints a completely different picture. \nThe most common form of propaganda is omission.\nPeterson certainly uses this tactic.\n\nPeterson is most definitely right wing and he has also referenced “studies” from racist sources too.\n\nAs for your original point, yes a lot of people are emotional when it comes to politics. It means they are less logical but we can’t really rewire most people on the planet just as much as you can’t be forced to value emotion over logic. \nI am INTP and I know how frustrating it can be when you’re right an people are wrong. But you can also be wrong.\n\nWith regard to Peterson I believe you have most definitely been taken in.\nI was enamoured with him for a while but having done more research in to him I believe I have seen his true character.
1	It's helped me to know that people often have different moral frameworks that are (to a significant degree) tied back to personality traits. Whether you want to rely on MBTI or Big-5 or something else, you can assume that a significant fraction of people are probably not worth your effort. Not because they're unworthy people, but because you're not likely to interface with their moral framework well enough to persuade them. Instead of isolating yourself, you *could* identify a group and make an effort to learn how to communicate in terms that resonate with them. For instance, you mentioned JBP, and I know he has a few lectures about *orderliness* and *conscientiousness* (kinda opposite traits from the quintessential INTP's *openness*). So, let's say they're a "group" that you want to cater your arguments toward. Well, say you're talking politics with a highly ordered bow-tie-wearing professional accountant who loves his bible and thinks Donald Trump hung the moon. If you wanted to criticize Trump, you might get further pointing out something like "Trump is often late to meetings" than you would with a strictly logical argument. This is a contrived example--I doubt this would actually work--but it's just to illustrate how complicated and counter-intuitive this whole moral framework stuff can be. Social media (perhaps outside of Facebook) makes this approach pretty hard because you can't always immediately determine someone's operative framework(s). But, with some effort you might develop a few ways to shade an argument to maximize impact.\n\nIn mixed company I try to stick to topics I know a lot about and correct factual errors where I see them. If you need to go into the realm of speculation, it seems to help when that's *clearly* denoted (rather than making it seem like established fact). The goal is to establish rapport and credibility, but if facts don't matter, then it's not worth even pursuing. You can often ask tough questions while you size-up where someone is on a topic and if it's battle you want to choose. But, importantly, always be on the look-out for trolls and (once identified) use every weapon in your arsenal to undermine them--mockery, absurdity, wit, tit-for-tat, public shaming, ignoring. People who are operating in bad faith are vampires of good faith arguments and will suck you dry. Moreover, they prey on the weak and if done correctly you'll gain more respect from neutral bystanders by sussing out and marginalizing trolls.

0	Is Harvard Racist?	
3	In recent years some of western society has flipped more into being racist toward white people instead. Google, for example, rejects white applicants because they are over-represented among their employees, which "reflects badly" on them. I'm not sure if that is still the case right now but I read about it around 1-2 years ago.\n\nIt's funny how some people and companies end up being racist by going out of their way in massive attempts not to be racist.
2	Whatever it takes to keep the finger-wagging media dogs on leash. Hey, peoples' careers are at stake, guy. The path of least resistance it will be.

3	What is introverted thinking style humor?	Honestly it tends to just come out as emotionally flatlined sarcasm for me most of the time, which always just makes me feel like an asshole. When I'm not a sarcastic asshole...I'm kinda bland. It's like my humor is intrinsically mean sometimes. Alternative is like...dad jokes. Also trolling but people seem to think trolling is "bad behavior" and immature.

2	This is literally me. Why, I don't know. This one new guy I work with I'm pretty sure thinks I'm hilarious and kinda a jerk at the same time. lol
2	Speaking for myself, I grew up that way. My mind had an uncanny ability to come up with sharp, biting but "funny" responses to everything I heard. I learned what I was saying when I heard myself say it. No filter, no effort.  \n\nI realized that this behavior was founded in animosity. I was picked on physically and verbally a lot when I was a kid, and I learned to retaliate with words, often in a way that the victim would not know I was mocking them. \n\nI tried to stop, but just couldn't. I felt bad when I really hurt people, but I told myself that I was just joking and they misunderstood. Yeah, right. \n\nI discovered that while I could not stop what I was doing, I could redirect it. Instead of interjecting comments to tear people down, I could support them and build them up. It turned out that I also saw strengths and virtues in people that others and even the people themselves did not see.\n\nOddly, when I started doing this, the people around me changed. They became smarter and more talented. They were interesting and likable. No idea why that happened. \n\nI still falter on occasions, but in general, life is beautiful. \n\nThis is just my experience.

Hi, I'm a female INTJ and I'v been in love with an INTP almost for 4 years but it was so so weird so let me explain it first:\nWhen I first met him I was attracted to him because he was so unique and special and I didn't take these feelings serious but after 6 months I found out that have feelings for him but I saw him rejecting other girls (we were friends at this time) so I was scared of confessing my feelings to him and he even once called me "sis" so I decided to stop thinking about him like this and I quitted having contract with him for one year. \nIn this time I dated three other guys (ENFJ, ISFP and INTJ) but I still couldn't have any emotions towards them till I thought about my last boyfriend seriously. I was somehow sure about my feelings so I started calling him again like an old friend. We talked about 3 months and he suddenly confessed to me!\nI was really confused and I asked him to tell me directly but he didn't :/\nWhat should I do?! What does he plan to do? Is he trying to make fun of me?!
13	I don't think an INTP would be the one to initiate cruel jokes.
2	I tease my ENTJ all the time, but it's always in good fun. Even if the confession was weird, it's probably because he didn't know how else to spit it out cause we're bad at words. 🙃 I would take it seriously because he's probably thought about it a lot and wouldn't have said anything if he wasn't sure he liked you. 
2	First thing would be to find out and acknowledge that there's actual deep real feelings directed towards him.\nPersonally speaking, sometimes I can be clueless as a goddamn rock on advancements. Chances are, he may be too.\n\nAn honest direct explanation of "what's up", kindly yet succinctly stated ought to do I guess.\nStill waters run deep though. He may be good at masking and walling up feelings. Whether love is reciprocated, or not (?), I'd expect that you get a respectful and honest answer. \n\nHowever, he may have to "sleep on it" first and think "how to handle this" if he gets overwhelmed at reveal time, perhaps. Depends on how emotionally developed he may be.
2	Watcha waiting for, get the salami
1	We only make fun of people if they say something stupid. \n\nBut if we deeply love that person, we probably won't mean it and will apologize right after. \n\nBut if there is someone we hate, we are more then likely to ridicule them with sarcasm and fun. Same thing with ENTP as well. 
1	OK Ms. INTJ, first of all when you are talking to INTPs, you need to include all the relevant details.  He "confessed" to you? What did he confess, his undying love, that he is gay, or that he has bodies buried in his basement?\n\nSeriously, when I was younger, I knew so few women that you could be sure I was interested in the ones I spent time with. Well, at least as long as they were intellectually stimulating. \n\nI am 54 now, but let me share a true story from 1985. I was studying abroad in France, and I met another American exchange student. We became friends and spent a lot of time together. Over time, I became very infatuated with her. I used to give her back rubs, and it drove me nuts, but I never did anything suggestive because if I did she would never talk to me again.\n\nOne evening we were at dinner, and I really wanted to tell her how I felt. But every time she looked at me, I looked away. When we were back in her dorm room, she asked me why I was looking at her funny at the restaurant. I said that I did not know what she was talking about. She insisted that I did.  I shrugged it off, but she was relentless. Every time I dodged and weaved, she was right in my face again. \n\nSo I finally broke down and said, "I am have problems thinking of you as just a friend." Well, that did it. I waited for the universe to implode on me, but nothing happened. Well, I thought, at least I told her, and now she can say that she is not interested.\n\nBut did she do that?  If course not. She was having too much fun watching me twist in the wind, so she said, "I don't know what you mean." I felt like an animal trapped in a cage. She again was relentless, and no matter how much I insisted that she did know what I meant, she played innocent and coy. \n\nFinally, after what have been more than an hour of agony, I said, "I want to ask you out, but I don't know how to." Then I was positive that life as we knew it was over.\n\nHer expression changed immediately.  She smiled at me and said, "You just did silly." Then she added, "And I feel the same way." That made me feel terrified and wonderful at the same time. \n\nWe have been married for 31 years. She still claims that she did not know what I meant, and I still say she is lying. \n\nI learned a valuable lesson in that experience. Well, a lot of lessons and a lot of experiences. I had always thought that that I needed to put on a show of casual confidence to get the girl, but it turned out that I needed to lead with my weakness. Even if she had not been interested romantically, she still would have been kind because we were friends. \n\nThat all happened when I was 20. I see a lot of the same angst and doubts in other young INTPs here. We really want to express our feelings, but we know that when we do, horrible things will happen. Safer to remain friends and retain the possibility of romance than to declare interest and be rejected once again.\n\nI am sharing this to let you know how difficult it can be for an INTP to express romantic interest. We don't know how to, and we will predict the worst. If he has expressed an interest in you, and you return it, then his mind may be in uncharted territory. He may still be expecting disaster, and anything you can do to soothe him would do wonders. \n\nI will also say this. In my life, my romantic interest in women has never been casual. It took a lot for me to admit it to myself, and only a strong attachment could survive the intellectual resistance. If he expresses interest, I doubt that it is casual. I also tend to think that INTPs make very loyal and faithful mates. I have had many opportunities to stray, but have never had any interest. My wife is 55, and she is the only woman on the planet with whom I want to have sex.\n\nYour story sounds so wonderful and so full of potential. I hope it works out.
1	I nor any INTP I know would make fun of someone by faking feelings and confessing but I knew a guy who was an ENTP who faked a proposal to a girl in my class, I sided with the girl stating that it was a 'Dick Move' but that might be because of my core belief in not messing with people emotionally, a core belief my INTP friend does not have so you might have to look at this more closely (as I said it depends on what he considers morally right and wrong)
0	Short thing on why communism doesn’t work.	A society based completely around altruism, already starting off badly. Those who enforce communism realize there isn’t enough altruism. Those who enforce laws use actual force against people to make sure that altruism is used. Those who have had force used against them become angry. They call for an uprising, and even more violence ensues. 
4	You might want to do a bit of research into altruism and human beings. \n\n> Altruism is when we act to promote someone else’s welfare, even at a risk or cost to ourselves. Though some believe that humans are fundamentally self-interested, recent research suggests otherwise: Studies have found that people’s first impulse is [to cooperate](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_cooperative_instinct) rather than compete; that toddlers spontaneously help people in need out of a [genuine concern](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_motivates_kids_to_help_others) for their welfare; and that even [non-human primates](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/little_helpers/) display altruism.   \n>  \n> Evolutionary scientists speculate that altruism has such deep roots in human nature because helping and cooperation promote the survival of our species. Indeed, Darwin himself argued that altruism, which he called “sympathy” or “benevolence,” is “an essential part of the social instincts.” Darwin’s claim is supported by recent neuroscience studies, which have shown that when people behave altruistically, their brains activate in regions that signal [pleasure and reward](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_helpers_high), similar to when they eat chocolate (or have sex). \n\n[https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/altruism/definition](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/altruism/definition)\n\n> Humans are generally highly cooperative and often impressively altruistic, quicker than any other animal species to help out strangers in need. A new study suggests that our lineage got that way by adopting so-called cooperative breeding: the caring for infants not just by the mother, but also by other members of the family and sometimes even unrelated adults. In addition to helping us get along with others, the advance led to the development of language and complex civilizations, the authors say. \n\n[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/human-altruism-traces-back-origins-humanity](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/human-altruism-traces-back-origins-humanity)\n\nConsider that human newborns are completely helpless. You might explain the mother's willingness to care for it as survival of her genes, but the thing is, throughout human history, other people have also contributed to care of infants. No a damn reason to other than altruism. In fact, it is our altruistic nature that allowed us to develop into who we are.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Communism isn’t based around the principles of altruism. In fact, there’s an entire tendency within communism devoted to egoism. 
4	Unwittingly building an ideology on an inaccurate understanding of the human nature tends to result in a mess.
2	now I want to discuss with someone what the ideal utopia would be
1	well explained, granted I would say that pure capitalism doesn't work either and needs trace amounts of communism to ensure equal opportunities but yeah pure communism is unstable
1	In theory communism is about altruism. In practice it is about concentrating power in the hands of a small group of people - the party elite. People who will kill anyone who dares to oppose them. You as a citizen are essentially a slave of the state.

5	How do you stay motivated to workout when you absolutely abhor exercise?	I've always hated exercising, even when I was active (I swam competitively for 10 yrs in school). It's tiring, painful, boring, and I *never* get the endorphin "high" people always preach about. I've tried multiple times in my post-high school life to get back in the habit, but I stop after ~2 weeks every time when work/life gets busy and takes higher priority. \n\nNow I'm 30 yo and 30 lbs too heavy. I hate my reflection and know that my health will only get worse from here if I don't change. I just got a gym membership, but I'm so tired after work (I'm a teacher) that all I want to do at 3:00 is go tf home,  so I've only been going once a week for like, 30 min. I mean, it's better than being sedentary for the last decade, but I don't feel like it's enough and it's a mental battle every time. \n\nHave any of you struggled with this? Any successes and advice? \n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I know I could post this elsewhere, but I wanted to ask other INTPs hoping that our similar strengths/flaws could me more personalized advice. 
3	First off - Eat right. That's 65 to 70% of it right there. If you can get into a decent nutrition regime (and I don't mean some fad diet), you''ll start to feel better and will lost weight. Once you've mastered that, start to take those experiences into the gym. Being motivated comes in small, attainable packages. It's not an all or nothing approach. Small goal... reduce sugar. Check. Reduce junk food. Check. Reduce soda. Check. \n\nI work out 6 days a week; weight training, and cardio. \n\nYou have to find a time that works best for you. In my case, morning - the earlier the better - works for me. 4am every week day, before going to work. If I get up later, or have to postpone my workout until after work, I find I usually won't do it. \n\nYou have to have a situation where exercise is easy to accomplish. Living close to a gym, or having access to equipment is a must for motivation. Clearly, you won't want to exercise if you have to drive a long period just ot do it. I'm lucky because I have a full gym in my house; weights, bench, squat rack, treadmill, etc... So I really have no excuses.\n\nGet an app that will prod you to go to the gym. \n\nHave small attainable goals. \n\nStretch. Something I'm not all that good at myself...\n\nI mean, these are pretty basic.
3	If weight loss is your concern, then improving your diet should be your primary target.\n\nI suggest a routine/habit ; you do it just «because», not for the looks.
2	What keeps me from just laying around all day is finding a workout or sport that I actually ENJOY and want to do.\n\nLifting weight is what I mainly do, but it gets repetative and boring from time to time, so I always try to switch it up. I've fallen in love the sport of boxing the last year. I can go burn upwards of 1k calories during a boxing workout and I enjoy every second of it. If I were to burn the same amount of calories just by running on the treadmill I would quit halfway through.\n\nSo try to find a hobby or activity that you find enjoyment in. Climbing, boxing, swimming as you mentioned or something else. Mountain Biking is something I'm going to give a go when spring time arrives.\n\nAlso as a few others have mentioned, if weight loss is your main goal, that can be achieved by diet alone. Combined with a good workout plan, you can digest a few extra calories as well, so I would recommend that path. Anyways, try to find an activity you find enjoymet in EVEN if it didn't burn any calories and you shed of that weight in no time.\n\nEDIT: Right now, I dont even work out to keep my body in shape or improve my physique (Well, a tad bit). I work out or at least get my pulse going everyday for the mental benefits of it. If I go more than 48 hours without breaking a sweat I'll become annoyed, grumpy and unable to focus for any amount of time. Once you notice how much 'clearer' your mental-state becomes when you get into the groove of things, you'll become addicted lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck!
1	I'm also about thirty pounds over weight and was even more over weight. Firstly I just love the results.. I don't get winded doing easy thing anymore.\n\n\nSecondly I treat it like a job instead of something that I just "can" do. It's something I must do.\n\n\nI only do about twenty minutes of workout and eat well (vegan) and have lost about fifteen pounds thus far.\n
1	Personally I'm a bit below average on weight or have been. Started eating better and more for about 2 years now and have went from 120lbs to 140lbs, I'm ~5'9 in height and 20years old now.\n\nThe biggest motivation when it comes to hitting the gym is looking better and being capable of just doing things. Carrying an extra bag of groceries out of the car, jogging a few km without being tired, lifting up boxes occasionally, etc. However, like another user has said, I think the best way to stay motivated with exercising is having the equipment or gym nearby and easily accessible.\n\nINTPs sometimes have tons of motivations but are content with just thinking about them. Having the resources you need to work out nearby will lessen the excuses you have to not work out.\n\nYou could also try asking one of your co-teachers if they're down to by your gym buddy, perhaps a gym teacher lol. That way you'll have someone else who can hole you accountable for skipping out on work outs.

1	Hello, long time listener, first time caller here.\n\nI've been thinking about this myself lately. I'm a 50-ish INTP, not terribly out of shape but quickly approaching the "use it or lose it" phase of life. I'm also sitting in a waiting room right now where I was reminded by the nurse that I was recently prescribed a certain drug commonly found in the medicine cabinets of older, overweight and/or unhealthy people. Yikes.\n\nSo my plan is to go to my gyms' spin class. All of them. It's the most intense workout I know, and also the most time efficient. I have to go every day (or very nearly so) since my motivation switch only seems to have two settings: all, or nothing.\n\nIt also helps that I go on bicycling vacations every summer so I'm motivated not to need to get in the sag wagon. \n\nSo that's my useless and irrelevant advice: You Must Spin!!!!
1	Try going with a friend, that helps.
1	Adderall, mostly.
1	I just ride my bike to work. It doesn't feel forced like going to the gym because, well, I have to go to work. It's great both physically and mentally and I can choose how hard to push it based on how I'm feeling that day.  \n\n\nIn my spare time I often hike and camp. Also feels more natural since I absolutely love being in nature and you have to bust your ass to get to the good places with the best views and no people.

1	My parents got me a gym membership and I go because I do not want to waste their money, also for me exercise is not boring because I am actually doing something rather than lying down and relaxing (a strong dislike of being Idle is sort of the family trait)\n\nI am 15 and have weight problems
1	find exercise you like. \n\ni really enjoy audiobooks/podcasts when riding a bicycle. you might as well take a walk, if you hate pedalling. \n\n> I just got a gym membership, but I'm so tired after work (I'm a teacher) that all I want to do at 3:00 is go tf home\n\nit might be diet related - i used to be the same way,.
1	I think it's telling that you describe it as "I go to the gym for thirty minutes", and describe it solely as "exercise". What do you actually do when you're there?\n\nIt was always infuriating to me because I figured going to the gym makes you happier, healthier, look better, more disciplined, gives you something interesting to say about yourself, it only takes up like 3hrs a week, and yet I could not for the life of me maintain a commitment to it. It's a no brainer and yet I couldn't fucking stick to it and resented myself for it. In truth, I wanted the long term goal but dreaded every single session. People speak of discipline and self-control, but nobody who's really into fitness does it because of that, they do it because they fucking love it. \n\nI used to train for hypertrophy so I'd look more muscular, and every session was a random series of machine exercises, doing inconsistently long burning sets with light weights, and then when the next gym session came, and I was searching for reasons to go back again, I still felt no closer to my goal because I just looked the same -- what was the point?\n\nMy goal now is strength, with the musculature as a bonus. I follow a straight forward full body program that aims to tackle almost all muscle groups every session. I conquered my fear of the big lifts, and now I actually feel like a solidified gym goer. Every single session (as a beginner) I consistently do better than the last, more weight or more reps. I let myself get into the zone listening to a playlist I've made that hypes me the fuck up, and now I get pavlov'd every time it plays lol. I finish my workout and see my stonking great pump in the mirror, knowing that if I keep it up, that's what I'll look like at some point. It's all just so primal and overly masculine, and it's a side of me I've not really ever let out before until now, and I love it. These days I don't even have to think of reasons to go back, it's just a case of what time.\n\nMoral of the story: Find what you enjoy. I'd obviously recommend trying the full body strength route, but I'd suggest trying a variety of things and seeing which stuff you enjoy more and then specialising until you're doing exactly what you want. Yes you might want to lose weight, but find something active that you enjoy first and foremost. Brazilian jiu-jitsu is great (but without a good teaching method it can feel a bit pointless), rowing, running, cycling, rock climbing, boxing, calisthenics, football, gymnastics. There's a surprising number of things that require your body haha.
131	INTP mode	 INTP mode allows you to make insane connections between past and future, and come up with infinite theories and possibilities. In the same sense, it brings you out of the present moment, which results in you being more out of tune with your emotions, along with dulling your senses to an extent. If you lack the complete practical experience to connect your theories to the real world, you will still have great theories, but they may come off as reductionist and won’t be as practical to use in day-to-day life. Over-thinking about past and future can also lead to anxiousness and delusions (which is why INTPs are likely to be depressed, spend too much time getting lost in conspiracy theories, or venting emotions through online chat rooms or memes). \n\nA solution to turn off INTP mode would be to focus your thoughts directly in the present moment to ensure sensory and emotional balance (this would need to consciously become a habit), and then activate it mostly in productive scenarios (ex. writing a book, using your practical experience for theories, making music, drawing, math etc.). This could also solve the issue of projecting insecurities, and allow INTPs to detect negative thought patterns which are unnecessary in their day-to-day lives. \n\nThen again, if you’re an INTP, no one’s forcing you to change. Brief rushes of adrenaline and long periods of depression and denial also used to be a fun experience for me. Do you fam. 
22	I use "INTP mode" very early in the morning, sometimes even before I get to work, with no one else around to bother me, so I can focus and nail down high attention to detail tasks. \n\nThe rest of the day in the office is chill, emails, low attention stuff like meetings, brainstorming and killing hours on youtube or listening to music. \n\nSocialising with chit chat also is a part of it. Maybe a waste of time, but makes colleagues more comfortable to make them work with you, or for you.\n\nLong story short, I "work" before work so I can do "nothing" at work.
10	Every psychological type is essentially a weakness, in Jung's eyes, because the actual goal is individuation. All 4 functions and their introverted and extraverted flavors are simply archetypes that have been shown throughout history to be essential to a balanced individual.
7	I learned how to shut off "INTP mode", but cant help but to feel like im limiting my mind, and occasionally  want to just dive straight into the abyss of my mind and get lost in it but still come back sane. But i dont want those rushes of adrenaline and crashes of depression to come back. P.s, idk if you know but thats lowkey mania. The euphoria is to die for, but it aint worth the anxiety and depression that it comes with. 
6	> Brief rushes of adrenaline and long periods of depression and denial also used to be a fun experience for me. \n\nRIP
5	My mind often disconnects from my body, is that an INTP thing?
7	I can't believe how accurate this is.
3	Thanks for the tip 😊
1	I'm not sure what it means, but this 'INTP mode' does not jump out as something I experience
1	it sort of just activates when im taking a shit or actively working on something

1	Hmm, so you do not like "people who not only lack the proper concepts to form thought, but lack the mental plasticity to change their convictions and check their biases." I presume that is because you, quite unlike them, consistently manifest  the proper concepts to form thought, enjoy the mental plasticity to change your convictions and check your biases." You are right about them.\n\nFunny thing is, that is exactly what "those" people said about you. They are right about you.\n\nLacking proper concepts for our thoughts, mental plasticity to change our convictions, and the ability to check our biases are the essence of being human.  You are too. To go on with life, every person must convince him or herself that they have all those attributes. The alternative would leave us incapable of getting up in the morning or doing anything. \n\nI think that what you are really saying is that you do not like people who have created life narratives that contradict your own. Everyone does.  It is part of being right in the first place. \n\nThe good news is that with enough experience and trauma, we can learn that other people are not the broken heaps of goo that they appear to be, but are just as right about things.  The bad news is that learning this will never change the unalterable fact that you are right and they are wrong, at least as long as you are human. You are too. \n\nWe can, however, reach a point where we are not so quick to judge others and not so certain that we really have all the answers.  Of course, then we die.
1	Finishing other people's...	Hey guys, do you find it easy to finish other peoples sentences/thoughts? Often times you will complete what they wanted to say with exactly what they were thinking or sometimes even something better (descriptive, precise, w.e). Any similiar experiences?
5	I thought you were going to say orgasms. 
3	better than my own
2	[deleted]
1	I sometimes get into a horrible rut of completing others' sentences. I half cringe when I do it, but I keep doing it anyway. I told my wife to let me have it whenever I do that to her, and she complied with glee. That has helped to retrain me and reduce it by 70%. The other 30% is just necessary because people talk to slowly or finish their own sentences wrong.
1	I just think too slowly to do it ahead of time, but sometimes I do do that
1	No, at least not out loud. Sure, people are, for the most part, predictable. But even if I could predict correctly nine times out of ten, that means I would suffer the embarrassment of being wrong one time out of ten.\n\nInternally, however, I do it all the time. Sort of like how I developed a habit of not using people's names even though I probably know it, just in case I actually have it wrong.
1	Peanut butter and chocolate.
22	What makes you emotional?	Though INTPs typically aren’t very emotive, most of us aren’t completely devoid of emotion and I think it’s important to remain connected to our more emotional and passionate selves. That being said, what excites in you the strongest emotions, both positive and negative?\n\nApart from my family and closest friends, I typically don’t feel very strong emotions towards people, but I do feel a deep and emotional connection towards animals and nature. I feel a lot of joy and peace when I’m with animals and in nature. Horses have long been a very important part of my life, and when I accomplish something particularly difficult with my horse, I feel a strong sense of triumph but also deep admiration for the horse. When I watch videos about interesting and strange phenomenons  in nature, I feel a sense of amazement and curiosity. I have an intellectual interest in octopuses and cephalopods at large, but the intellectual part of this interest is very wound up in feelings of excitement, curiosity, and passion. My strongest negative emotions (anger, hatred, sadness)  are often associated with environmental degradation, poaching, habitat loss, animal abuse, ect. \n\nI’m also very interested in philosophy, especially existentialism. For me, existential issues are both intellectual and deeply personal in nature. When I contemplate certain philosophical problems, a part of me begins to feel and experience those problems as well.
20	Depression\n\nHardcore loyalty\n\nDecent books\n\nMusic
7	I have a strong emotional connection to humanity as a whole.  It kinda took me a while to get there though, partly b/c of my personality and partly b/c of my religious upbringing.  In college I only cared about animals, really.  After I got sick is when I developed empathy towards mankind itself and started caring about human rights.  All people, not just other Christians who met my standards for 'good' living.  God I was an elitist ass.
9	Driving. Definitely driving. Some people should not be on the road driving and it pisses me the fuck off.
9	fictional characters. I don't have many emotional connections with real people so I just live vicariously through fictional characters
6	Inequality/injustice\n\nHelplessness depicted in movies/shows \n\nFamily and friend’s success
3	Death, small petty crimes (that I commit), animals, nature, being alone in a car, being with close friends, art, friend's accomplishments, philosophy, and habits of people.\n\nI don't know exactly what I feel when I engage with these things but I do know that I'm feeling something.
2	Mostly my closest friends and episodes of opportunism 
2	Romantic tragedy in "do I really like you or do I want to yearn for our undying love as I sabotage this relationship".
2	Point about humanity. \n\nLike, I remember a video showing a rocket (dunno which) climbing higher and higher, then exploding, and showing the subsequent fall. There was music, and I was reflecting on our Icarus tendencies.\n\nEvery Civilization game trailer or opening make this to me too. [For example](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=e4kLw71D7lo), but Baba Yetu and the trailer for Civ6 work too.\n
2	Raw honesty, specially when sharing emotions and feelings. Incidentally, very hard to find.\n\nIn Music, listening to Queen. His voice gets into my "soul", if that as such even exists. He just feels true honest at his songs, giving it all he's got, no compromises.\n\nIn films, I'd say "Life is Beautiful" left a deep mark on me when I was a kid. Guido trying his utmost best to protect his son from the terrors of the Concentration Camp. Later in life, "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" with such dedication and utmost passion for perfection in the craft of sushi making. Recently, "Alita: Battle Angel". Rosa Salazar nailed hands down a truly believable character with vibrant and raw honest emotion. At least that's how I felt it. TBH, I'd drop it all if I were to meet someone with the emotional raw honesty as depicted by Alita. Alas though, I doubt someone like her could even exist. Most humans be selfish, judgemental, fickle, full of insecurities, ...\n\n 
2	When E3 shows new gameplay and new architecture gets revealed.\n\nWhen downgrades are obvious and performance improvements come only with year later driver releases.

1	when someone takes an action that is considered morally bad by my standards, (Manipulation of people's emotions and actions, breaking someone's trust, disrespecting a person worthy of respect, talks behind someone's back or abuses their power) also nostalgia
1	Have you ever been a the funeral home for your grandmother during the part where they call each person up to say their last respects? That’s akin to emotional torture. Being in a room full of people you love who are crying and having to just sit there crying too.
1	Some times I’ll put in some dramatic music and imagine different scenarios. Usually  victory in battle or sitting peaceful on an open land scape.\nThe song “the war ends” on the Hoi4 soundtrack is really good for that.\nA really good movie trailer also. I know it sounds odd, but some times they just get me.\n\n
0	Truth and Toleration	
1	tempting, but the thumbnail is good enough.
1	I’m probably one of the few people here that supports Ayn Rand. I will tell you this, these morons don’t know what they’re talking about. One should never, ever ever follow another’s ideas. One should formulate their own ideas and seek others for validation. Meaning, if you didn’t formulate the basic concept of objectivism and you are following Rand you are not following Objectivism. Follow your own reasoning and look to Rand to fill the gaps.  
0	Don't let the Megan Fox look-a-like in the thumbnail fool you into watching this.
1106	This is me all the way. Anyone else?	
67	I don't feel like answering this question right now. I'll let you know tomorrow.
39	Yup. Nothing like the adrenaline of imminent failure to push me through to the finish line. 
72	me = procrastinate + job not done = depression
23	If you get it done, how is it procrastination?
16	Not anymore, used to do it but felt stressed often
12	I used to be like that, but I'm an accountant now and that behavior has caused problems for me at work. I've changed my habits to develop a successful career. The good thing is that it's helpful in other areas of my life as well. I've just adapted to the situations in my life as they've come.
10	i wish i did not procrastinate. i would get so much done.
9	It builds skills. When the boss drops a big assignment on you, and needs it in 15 minutes or an hour, you've got mad skills to call on to get it done fast. That is what you are training for. The ability to wow with your magical ability to get things done at light speed. 
5	This is all of us
6	The sad answer is...\n\nIt works for me. 
5	Ouch
3	I feel like as a Persian i'm seeing the word Persian too much..
4	Yes but I also know it causes me to do the bare minimum and im not doing myself any favours by procrastinating. 
4	I think there's a common problem with us: the outcome of our efforts becomes detached from our input. I personally felt like the correlation between input and output just wasn't enough to justify investing more time. If you were to model it mathematically, it's as though the error margins were too large to be a useful model, so we just input minimal effort and get a random and useless grade.\n\nLots of effort -> No reward -> very sad\nLots of effort -> Big Reward -> sort of expected, but yay\nMinimal effort -> no reward -> Doesn't matter\nMinimal effort -> Big reward -> I'm so clever yay me\n\nReward/effort ratio is almost always higher for minimal effort, so why try harder.\n\nBut, contrary to what I think academia teaches, you shouldn't be valuing your grade. Your grade means next to nothing. I had a dyslexic friend who spent 4 hours of his free time after college studying every day, hired a tutor, constantly asked for help until he understood, did all of his work, and yet he still took 4 years to do what everyone else did in two. He might not be great at picking new things up, but holy fuck did he try, and he should be proud of that. Fuck the education system for insisting that he wasn't good enough. I did almost no work, fucking nothing. Then in the final two weeks I panicked and turned my grades into some of the best in the college. Honestly, fuck the education system for rewarding that behaviour.\n\nIn a world where you do what you want to do, would you rather be capable of long-term focused development in a particular skill, or just be hopping aimlessly from hobby to hobby like most INTPs do.\n\nI've got so much so say but I realise I'm losing focus so meh, share your counterarguments or what have you.
3	The world enables my procrastination and yes it’s a problem. 
3	It’s not procrastinating. It’s; “intense and abundantly thorough mental planning, for the swift and efficient completion of tasks”  ....gotta read between the lines. \n\nAlso some of us subconsciously know, by waiting til the last min,  and blasting through it gives less of a chance for the mind to wander, the time crunch forces focus. 
2	Like barely get the job done.\nI've almost forgotten the euphoria you get after doing an amazing job.\nIt feels like I've gone too far down the spiral of procrastination.\nI'm starting to question if I could even do an amazing job anymore.\nBefore anyone else mentions it, no, I'm not talking about a blowjob here.
2	Yeah, I don’t put more effort in because I never get punished for it 🤷🏾‍♂️
2	You know why , because there is a deadline...\n\nHere is the thing: your dreams has no deadline.\nYou could keep on procrastinating forever... and you will achieve nothing of your dreams...\n\nI know how hard it is as an INTP but this problem in us should be top priority.
2	I procrastinate, therefore I cram.
2	Spot on.
2	Waiting till the last minute gives me a rush. And then I use that rush to get the job done
2	As the spouse of an INTP, the procrastination tendency really affects my life and my plans. If it only affects you and your life, whatever, but when you have a spouse and family - the habit gets really lame.
2	Reminds me of the time I intentionally tried to fail my chemistry exam so I wouldn't procrastinate again. I panicked in the last hours, studied and passed by 1 mark. 
4	No
2	Crass actions yield results faster. The useless reflexes of an NPC trouble me not. Improvisation ftw!  \n\n\nToo many gaslighting echo chambers out there. Learn to ping and cold read that stank.
1	yES
1	The goal is to procrastinate effectively, by knowing when you are not working at peak efficiency. I'll totally elaborate on this later and not forget to finish. I swear.
1	I take it the next level by just not giving a fuck if the job gets done at all.
1	Yeah.
1	The best part is i should be doing an essay on Voldemort right now
1	Yeah, no lesson learned...
1	Yup
1	It’s a dumb statement but if I’m being honest it’s very much how I operate these days ...and maybe always 
1	Fair enough. Still, as a faculty member I shudder to think of what an educational system designed to make "better people" (as defined by?) would entail! 
2	Could you guys help me choose a topic for a public speaking competition?	I spoke on the Paradox of Choice last time and I don't what to speak on next. The more ideas I come up with, the more indecisive I become. So, I decided to ask a group of random strangers.
4	Optimistic Nihilism
2	Talk bout dem paradigm shifts.
1	Talk about how we can trick ourselves into having fun, even tho we know people may not be real.
1	Alien Hand Syndrome. 
1	My most successful speech was on the falsities of big brand images so you could try that
1	Procedural generation of art
1	 \n\nTry using the speech feature and practice against multiple topics at https://www.speakupapp.org! Hope it helps!
15	Anyone else don’t care about the outside world, or anything?	I don’t mean to sound bleak and all, but recently I’ve found out that I’ve essentially totally lost interest in the outside world. I don’t stay up to date with **anything**. I listen to roughly the same music for the past couple of months, I like certain topics like math and science; but I never keep up to date with it. I don’t follow anything math or science related and I just kinda exist on the border of that fact that I’m interested in it’s concept. I don’t keep up to date with the bands I like, and everytime I tell myself I’m enthusiastic about something and force myself to care, I simply stop caring; even if I like that thing. 
6	I'm not a nihilist but I believe in causality. I am mostly apathetic about the world. But i do care deeply about the environment.
5	The beginning of my depression was when i felt indifferent to everything. I never really felt happy, sad, mad, no emotion at all. I became a hermit withdrawn from the outside world. If you relate to this then you should get help from a professional or an actual friend not just an acquaintance. It took me 3 years to crawl my way out of that depression. \n\nDon't become withdrawn from society  because before you know it you will be living a nightmare in your own mental prison.  
1	I read a shit ton. Economics+philosophy+ history keeps me from imploding
1	it might have also been due to the winter time but i also feel you on this. i don't care about gossip in the world either. not even celebrity gossip. i dont' care lol
1	Sounds like you suffer from depression tbh  \nI know exactly what you're talking about  \n
1	My parents told me way too much about the starving kids in Africa when I was young so now I just don't give a Damn.
1	Yep.
1	as soon as I know something enough to keep up to date with it I get bored of it and learn something new, I do keep up with politics and memes though, I tried to keep up to date with rally but I just find reading about it's history more interesting.
1	Yep
10	Does anyone else hide things from other people?	So, I work as a bike mechanic.  Whenever I bring my own bikes in to maintain them I write my service tickets in Danish.\n\nMy coworker asked today why I do this, and my response was, "So no one else knows what I'm doing."\n\nI cant stop thinking about how crazy it sounds, but also how logical it is to keep someone else from ruining your shit.  Does anyone else find ways to divert others like this?!
9	all the time . i reallly hate when people gossip about my life . \n\ni remember one time something happened with a guy, and i told my friend briefly but i told her "you don't get to know who." it was a very cold and cruel way of not wanting to tell her but i'm so sick of people who don't know me knowing my business. let me just live my life in peace. worry about yourself.
5	I hide stuff from people all the time.  I do not write things down in other languages so people cannot read them, if I don't want something read, I don't write it down.\n\nI do sometimes try to hide the fact that I am hiding things, I have found not everyone likes it and some people when they get curious take things too far.  I realize sometimes that isn't possible, but I try to not draw attention to it.
4	A lot of people don't understand me or my line of thought. I've spent years trying to restructure the way I speak and communicate so that other's can "get it" but sometimes I analyze someone's capability to understand me and I just deem that they aren't worth communicating to. So maybe they think I'm an idiot or quiet or watever, but at least I don't need to explain myself to them. 
4	It's amazing how much you can get away with by playing dumb
5	I’m moving thousands of miles awry in a couple of months and have told virtually no one. I don’t like people knowing my business.
4	I'm very private, I don't like people reading thoughts that I did not offer up e. g. reading my notes especially personal ones. 
5	This is why whenever anyone asks me a personal question at work I respond with bullshit. A few weeks ago a coworker asked me what my "dream job" would be and I said "This. This job that I'm doing right now. I cannot imagine a greater bliss." I don't want your nosey ass poking around in the depths of my soul probing my greatest desires and fears. 
4	Depends. I don't really consider it hiding it as much as not telling them.\n\nLike, there's an interesting thing In definitions here. "Hiding" implies it somehow should be public information otherwise.
3	Yes, I hate being judged, I hate having to justify myself, I hate unsolicited opinions, and if someone wants me to do something different, I’m probably going to go along with it because I also hate conflict.
3	I do. I'm extremely protective of my computer and phone. My exes loved to accuse me of cheating because of it. It was the one constant, like if you're a female you need extreme paranoia if someone with a penis is private, as requisite as using a tampon if you have a period.
3	My entire life I’ve tried to hide everything that interests me or I’m good at. It started with graffiti (for obvious reasons) and then it became a habit with playing guitar, art, writing, tattooing; everything. Personally I think it stems from a fear of failure or rejection. I know what I think is good and if what I created is not to that standard, I’m going to reject it before someone else has the chance to. As far as interpersonal life goes; oh yeah I have to have known you and thought you were pretty rad for atleast 2 years before I let you give me a ride home (let alone inviting you inside.)
2	I find this interesting, because I am very much an INTP in most regards, but not here. At least not to the same degree. Because I will talk about like my personal life with whatever person I deem to be mildly open minded and intelligent, the whether co worker or a new friend/acquaintance.  I generally operate under a "be unapologetically me" mentality, but also I want to normalize things. My husband and I have and open/poly marriage, and if you talk about stuff like that like it's normal, you expose other people to it and it becomes more normalized.  At the same time though, I hate when people are reading something over my shoulder when I'm at a computer or on my phone.  Even my husband. It's not that I have anything to hide, I just don't like to someone looking at my stuff like that.
2	I’m very uncomfortable about the notion of people knowing about my thoughts, and by that I mean drawings, written work, etc.  Moreover, I’m super paranoid about people knowing what I read, I just feel vulnerable.  
2	Russian's the language I use
4	What area of computer science/software do you think is the ideal spot for INTP entrepreneur?	I am going into a computer science degree right now. It's slow and I'm not making that much money at my job. I just have extra time laying around at college.\n\nI want to work out more and continue to dive deeper into Jung, but I'd also like to be an entrepreneur in the future. And the money right now would be nice. The goal was to be a computer science/software consultant and make my own firm. Then leverage that to get enough experience to become a systems architect and become one for my business.\n\nThe question is...where to start in CS??? I don't like learning without a purpose, and especially a short term purpose because I often doubt long term goals will still exist in the same form by rhe time I get that far into the future.\n\nApp developement seems like a huge area for invention, but idk how well that transfers into software consultancy and systems architecture. Nor do I know if apps are particularly profitable\n\nIs there another area of computer science that would still be great to gear me for an entrepreneur route but would also line me up with my long term goals of systems architecture? System architect sort of seems in direct opposition to software consultancy since systems architects are in house. This also is a big opposition for my type. On the one hand I like the variety idea of consultancy(Ne), but it makes it hard to really get deep into any one system(Ti) and build it from the ground up. It sorta seems like INTP software entrepreneurship is about diving really deep into one topic and building a ground up structure that will last into the future for a long time.
2	What you should be asking is, what area of CS is the ideal spot for you? \n\nYou're not going to find the answer to that through typology. Nor will you from random people who don't know you \n\nThat is assuming that there is an answer to find, that there is an "ideal" spot
2	Maybe avoid game design due to the facts that the industry is awful and you constantly have to collaborate with other people. Other than that I couldn't really tell you. 
1	None, become a Sysadmin and participate in reddit's endless memes cycle.
1	Full stack if you want to start your own shit 
1	dunno i've always been shit at CS

5	This really escalates.

7	Advice needed.. long post ahead...	As an intp, when I make friends I go into my chameleon mode. Because i notice that it make things a lot easier and comfortable for them. An example would be this guy who got to invested in with another friend’s toxic relationship. \n\nThe only thing in common is that we like to play the same video game. So one day I could tell that he really wanted to know me more since he started to rant about his problem. And honestly I’m the last person you want to ask for advice. \n\nSo instead I tuned in or used my chameleon and changed my personality to help him release stress. Example would be acting extra childish when I know it takes up more energy. It’s a trick I use in school to have a normal life. He confessed to me last week... he described me as the chameleon I portrayed to him.. to a certain degree I feel completely bad for playing with his feelings and I don’t know what to do. He’s an INFP and that worries me..\n\nSorry for the long post.. I just wanted to see if I’m the only one with this problem or if anyone has any advice. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.
9	You weren't playing with his feelings. You were trying to help the best you knew how. He is playing with your feelings. Don't let him emotionally manipulate you. Call him out on his bullshit and tell him if he doesn't like it to go find someone else to vent to. 
3	I do it. It's so much easier. If you haven't tried it already, take the enneagram test. Most INTPs come out a 5, but there is a smaller amount of that are 9w1, and this really affects our motivations. I'm 9w1. Finding that out helped me a lot to understand myself better.
2	Sorry for not being able to give you any advices, but not being able to relate (as you are now) is a common INTP trait. 
1	> long post ahead.  \n> long\n\nLol, it's rather short. For your problem, just say no if you don't want to. As for guilt, well, just learn from it and don't do it again in the future\n\n\n
0	The MAGA doesn't stand firm hate...	
4	Our rights end where your feelings begin, right?
3	Can someone explain this to me?
2	But it does both. 
1	hey so can we just make this comment a circlejerk/echo chamber for either the right or the left I don't care
1	Wow.  I just got myself banned and muted on r/Conservative. I think I will drink to that.
-2	Title gore aside, its pretty obvious that the left stages fake hate crimes\n\nThey are immoral and have no shame.  All they want is power.\n\nAlmost all of the hatred in this world is left of center
5	Why don't you finish books?	Since 2008, I have probably accrued about 15 books I started reading and stopped. In some cases the subject matter may not be as captivating to me, so I stop and let it rest for a while. Sometimes it's actually so interesting, that I find it overwhelming, so I stop and let it rest for a while... Years later I pick them up only to realize I've forgotten what the book was about to begin with, re-read the beginning and lose interest somewhere along the way once again... Every year I make resolutions to finish what I had started only to end up with a couple of new additions to my sad list of unfinished books by the end of it.\n\nWhat's your story? 
7	I barely finish anyt
3	I used to finish books often when I was younger and before I had a phone and laptop. Now I really want to get back into reading but always have something to do (homework etc etc). I’d really love to get back into reading but I get so distracted by screens even when they aren’t in my face. 
3	Because the ideas in my head are far more interesting than the ideas in the book I'm reading, and I cant concentrate. 
2	i read books to the end, unless they bore me. premise too stupd, i disagree too much, written too trivially, etc.\n\nwhen they do, i move on.
1	Same. I'm chipping away on a library book, plus two I'm keeping around on the back burner, and many more in the DEEP DEEP fryer. Many probably burnt to ashes. Easy answer is the internet is so much more limitless and interactive.
1	I think reading books chronologically is for ninnies. Don't be afraid to skip. Most books have 1-2 interesting or informative chapters, with the rest being something you have no use for. You learn so much more by going to the library and skimming through 20 books than you'd learn by picking one book and reading it thoroughly.
1	Most books are very medium.  \n\nThere have been books I didn’t want to put down that I finished very quickly.
1	If I seriously can't understand it and that's usually a philosophy book. One example was a book called Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. Another reason is I have to be in the mood, which is usually an afternoon where I have actual energy. I ought to treat it more like a necessary thing because I want to be a poet.
1	Omg ???? I have this issue as well. Even if I’m absolutely enamored with a book I just can’t bring myself to finish it. I’m not sure if it’s a commitment issue or what. Sometimes a book is just too good that finishing it feels too final and like a waste. Sometimes I get bored halfway through and don’t want to waste time (my life) trying to finish it. 
1	I've been reading LoTR for 3 years now, also I have to return them to the library
1	I do finish books. So bam.
11	Are other personality types as into being them as I am? Are you guys?	I am super into the fact that I'm intp, and I feel like a vegan telling everybody about it. Are y'all doing the same or is it just me? Also y'all know if other personality types do that? Is it deeper character than one of the 16? Is this something I've fabricated? 
14	Once I ignore all my self depreciation, I am super grateful that Im an INTP.  I wouldnt want to be any other type.  Not because INTP is superior, but because it's what I am, and, get ready for it: I like that I like the things that I like.\n\nBut then all the self hatred comes back, and it's suffering as usual.  But it's normal, and somebody has to do it.
11	I think it's interesting that the S types have a very small Reddit group presence. I have a theory they just don't get into this as much as Ns. S types I know think the typing is useless and/or boring.
10	I was excited and relieved when I discovered the Meyers Briggs types. The opposite of how I felt to be labelled with the host of shit I was labelled with prior, and against my will by 'professionals' because, growing up, ‘the world’ were desperate to have a name for 'me' other than 'human' to explain why I couldn't just 'fit in' or 'be normal'.\n\nI hated 'their' labels as they reduced who and what I was to the product of certain experiences, glitchy DNA, my behaviours (which resulted from as much as if not more than were caused by what I was / am) or some anomalous organ abnormality. I get it; I’m not an ‘easy’ person (try being me; I get no escape), but having any and every reply, idea or behaviour I display that don’t fit the criteria for what is ‘normal’ written off by flippantly saying: *oh, she’s X,* weren’t, *for me*, positive or empowering. Quite the opposite.\n\nThen, and I realise the irony, being able to say: *I'm INTP* felt like an explanation rather than an excuse, even though I've never actually said it outloud; that's the point; I'm not looking for an excuse to provide others with. Being INTP, after all, is not a disorder, fault or failure; it is not something to apologise for. Nor does it reduce or excuse me, or my behaviour. Hence, the 'label' felt like it liberated rather than imprisoned me. Being INTP explains *a lot* without denying me autonomy – over my eff ups as well as my achievements.\n\nPerhaps I am some or even all of the things I was labelled by 'them', but being able to describe myself as INTP actually provides insight in to *how* and *why* I fit those other labels, or don't easily fit them whilst in fact still being them.\n\nThen, I'm not proud or happy to specifically discover I fit the INTP type, but I was certainly very fucking happy to discover there is such a ‘thing’ - it made making sense of everything else potentially possible, which nothing before had, and which is empowering - unlike being told: *There is no cure. You'll never be ‘normal’. But we can imprison / punish / medicate / manage / control / excuse / speak for you until you die so the rest of the society won’t have to suffer you. Hooray of us.*\n\nDiscovering – **I am an INTP**, was the first time I could think and feel – *hooray for me*.
4	I don't do it. I haven't said "INTP" in person for like, 2 years now.
3	Personally, I think the label is rather wrought with pretense, so I try to avoid it and let my words speak for themselves.\n\nI, too like that I like what I like, though.  I'm like the coolest person I've ever known.  It's not my fault no one else thinks so.
3	In general, if someone's opinion of themselves is healthy, those same people should also like being their personality type.\n\nI'll talk about being an INTP too, but I usually need a reason to bring it up. If someone's talking about personality types somewhere, I'll mention I'm an INTP. It's just not usually relevant.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm proud of specifically being an INTP, but I definitely love being myself, so that means I love being an INTP as well. It's just because I'm quite attached to being who I am. There are definitely downsides to having my personality type though.
2	I think INTJs are pretty proud of being INTJ. Myself, the MBTI helped me a lot to find focus and direction at a time when I really needed it. Also it's super helpful in understanding other people and what they need, etc. \n\nI like being INTP, and I hate being INTP. eEven if it was all BS, it's still helped me a lot in my life.  I sure would not want to be one of the other 15 types. 
2	Discovering why I'm the way I am brought me out of my depression.
2	I first started loving who I was as a person when I was really young and wouldn't wanna be anything else. Of course I still have stuff to work on but yeah.
1	Yeah when I first found out about my personality type it was fun for me to ask other people’s about theirs and read about MBTI! I think it’s just kind of a Thing for our type/most N’s to just be intrigued by that kind of thing. I also have the same experience of Sensors not really caring about it a lot, but hey. I’m having fun so who cares.
1	I am glad that I figured out my type so that I can be more accepting of myself and also to figure out how to better myself.  It is not enough for me to rest on the knowledge that I am an INTJ.  I need to know how to go about growing the parts of my personality that need attention.  Knowing my baseline type and its cognitive functional stack gives me the tools that I need.
1	Into it? I don’t know about that.. understanding your baseline parameters is helpful when starting to work with new people in that you can let let them know what to expect. Check out Dalio’s book ‘Principles’ and his take on team-forming.  Try to remember that you’re not special, just different. 
1	Stop reading 16 personalities my dude.
1	I think INTPs and INFJs are always super proud about their type
1	considering that every time the word INTP is mentioned a huge circlejerk forms no I think INTP is the most into being their personality type
-2	You're mistyped. Your average sentence length in your profile is 3 words. You show no signs of any thought, at all. So, yes I imagine you would like to go around telling everyone you're INTP. You'll gladly place yourself into a box to try and gain a facade of intelligence by proxy.\n\nEdit: Inb4 muh test results.
2	What do you guys do for a living? Do you enjoy it?	I’ll start:\nI have a mechanical engineering degree but work in manufacturing in the medical industry. \n\nI’m not very passionate about it and I’m honestly looking for other opportunities. I also don’t perform well when I only have myself to hold accountable. \n\nI want to get a feel for how passionate you guys are about your work, and how that affects your performance and outlook.\n\nThanks! :)
5	Bricklayer, hate it, i have a half year left. Then i AM still able to pick another education. Feels bad. 
2	Computer programmer.  Love it
1	Architect (soon to be). Best and worst ever :D
1	i fix teslas. I have an associates in auto repair and a bachelors in english lol...so with your degree i definitely think you should use it! apply for tesla!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway I like it except that there are way too many other people in the shop and we have to team up to work on a car. I liked it better at my old dealership (gas cars) where everyone was assigned to their own car and own stall and own tools and you could work next to people you got along with. I would like to become a mobile tech so I would only have to interact with customers and not my peers, CONSTANTLY ALL DAY (they're not all easy to get along with, and play terrible music, and being INTP, people aren't the funnest thing to have to endure all day long) and i would get to see the repair from initial diagnosis to final conclusion (happy customer!) would feel a lot more satisfying instead of feeling like a cog. 
1	Highschool Student, plan on going into med/med research.\n\nI enjoy learning but once we start to do revision my brain just turns off
0	What do you think?	u/thechessgoddess and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in all types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count moral obligations out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded. 
3	The idea of right and wrong is merely a societal construct; one invented by humanity, an artificial system of judgement. What constitutes right from wrong? Who decides it? We create laws which are guidelines of what is right and wrong but the law constantly shifts as we shift as humans. Murder can be both logically fine and logically wrong at the exact same time. It is us humans as a society that decides the right from wrong. If we were a society filled with murdering psychopaths then murder would be fine; would it not? I’m sorry I never answered your questions but the answer lied outside your frame. Hope this helps your research.
3	I’m not really sure how to consider whether murder is logically right/wrong if morals are taken out of the equation. Doesn’t saying an action is right/wrong mean that you’re making a moral claim? Unfortunately I’m not sure how to answer your question. 
3	Using “murder” as the term, indicates a moral choice, even when you state morals are not involved in the decision.   However, it could be answered like this:\n\n1:  Murder is logically fine when it benefits society as a whole.  \n\n2:  Murder is logically wrong when it doesn’t benefit society as a whole.  \n\nThe difference comes in when the people in charge decide what benefits they are interested in. \n\nSociety dictates the definition of murder, and defines all of our morals.  Are we ending a human life prior to the end of its life span?  Are we including self-defense, suicide, and abortion in the definition?  \n\nLogically, murder is permanently stopping a human.  It is likely cheaper than exiling them from the continent, jailing them, therapeutically treating them, and/or materially supporting them.  It ensures that their morally incorrect behavior does not continue, or that they are not a drain on society’s resources.  It also ensures they cannot return, escape, or potentially damage or eradicate others at a future time.  \n\nMurder is such a messy word though, and not clearly defined in your post.  \n\nPersonally, taking a life not included in the self-defense, suicide, or abortion category, could be a logical decision for me.  It would, in most cases, be a very lengthy process.  
1	this reminds me of the Heinz Dilemma 
1	In regards to humans, murder is never logically right, only wrong. I don't care how despicable a person is, they could be the next Adolf Hitler for all I care, snuffing out potential is the worst possible thing one can do to society because it slows forward progression. Hitler was a terrible, TERRIBLE human being. However, it is important that he caused the suffering he did, because despite the fact that it is a blight on the human race, it also is a resource we can look back upon to prevent ourselves from committing similar atrocities in the future.  \n\n\nIn regards to murdering animals, kinda depends. If you're murdering someone's pet, that is logically wrong. You are actively removing something that makes someone happy, AND breaking the law. Of course there's gray area with that, but we're just going to assume that the pet is living a happy, healthy life. However, butchering farm animals or hunting deer are both examples of logical "murder". You are taking the life of a animal whose body will go on to serve a greater purpose. Again, definitely some gray area, but trying to parse through all of those possibilities would be impossible and incredible boring
1	There is no right or wrong. Only actions and consequences. Besides, would you judge someone based on their intent, their actions or their consequence?
1	\nKilling someone is logically fine in instances like euthanasia - where the person is asking to be 'murdered' because of debilitating, incurable disease or pain (and if they are of sound mind).  Similarly self defense, or to protect an (innocent) loved one from being harmed by an assailant both count as justifiable in my books. In the first instance the person is exercising their choice, and is not harming anyone else. In the second instance, the person who first intended to cause harm to you or your loved one tried to remove all choice from you, and therefore their death is a consequence of their own bad choices. \n\nMurder is generally not acceptable, as beyond the typical moral problems, it is simply not a constructive act. Humans have only gotten as far as we have because of our ability to collaborate. If random murder was acceptable, society as we know it would we impossible. \n\n \n\n \n\n
1	As some others mentioned, the questions are rather weird, because you’re mostly asking to make a moral decision without including morals. But let’s try.\n\n1. In self defense when somebody is trying to murder you. Your life is all you have, and when somebody tries to take it, morals don’t really even come to play. Also, I think there are cases when logically it’s fine for a cop (or anyone) to shoot a dangerous criminal in act. It can save lives. \n\n2. Most of the time, this applies. Murder is like an unnecessary drama that you just shouldn’t deal with. There are usually negative consequences that are greater than whatever benefit you may reap from murdering.
1	I think it boils down to how you yourself would like to be treated. A lot of moral values stem from these. So to answer your questions. Murder is never fine. Murder is wrong, because it's not something you want to encounter yourself.
22	INTP: we're hyper critical of people's motivatios	Also INTP: we can't tell when someone is flirting with us\n\n
29	It's a matter of trust. I do pick up on the signals, but I don't act on them readily. The inner dialog doesn't allow me to act. Am I really reading you right? Are you really interested in little old me or am I letting my need for human closeness colour this interaction? Best to play it cool. I'm in no hurry to experience another put down.
9	Check the dilation of pupils, redness of the ears and liking for physical proximity.
7	[deleted]
7	Is being hyper critical of motivations a thing for INTP? Makes total sense to me. I always presume the absolute worst of people, but not because I'm pessimistic or hate people. It just makes me feel safer to build up from worst case. That way, you won't be disappointed or unprepared. 
3	unhealthy INTPs can have some serious trust issues. The slightest hint of the possibility that the other party might have the wrong intentions can set off this intense Sherlock holmes-like search for another fitting piece of that puzzle, even if the suspicion is completely ridiculous (but perceived as plausible due to unhealthy Si).
2	I can't tell if people are flirting with me. People can't tell when I'm flirting with them . . .
1	yes and yes
1	Yes and yes.
1	Isn't that second statement more of an ISxP trait? Due to 7th function Ne?
1	An artical states we are very "skeptical". Which is why we never take hints.
15	Playing games as a chore?	Have anyone else done this before: you start playing a game, fully enjoying it, and then you get addicted to it. Then, the addiction turns into a chore once you get bored of it, but you can't leave it because you need to fulfill a standard or goal you made for yourself. So in the end, you are playing it haphazardly (abusing mechanics what not) because you have to and not because you enjoy it.\n\nI play games at my high school whenever I can (like during classes where the teachers are chill). This happened to me a bunch of times, so I uninstalled all my games on my phone. Now I can't find one I actually enjoy, since I get my joy from the result and not the process. Plus, I can't decipher my emotions well and am unable determine whether I enjoy something after the first wave of excitement.
7	no, if a game gets boring i drop it. i might finish it off once i get in the mood again but i am not forcing myself to play it for completeness sake.\n\nsame for tv series.  if it gets a chore to keep watching, i give it up.
3	That's why I've grown to hate games with "daily events" like maple story. I still feel nostalgic about it but will not be touching that game for a long time.
3	I do this with a Stardew Valley. I fell into the same trap with it that I did with Harvest Moon, and that is trying to make the most of each day in the game being productive as possible. “I’m so close to unlocking this new item that might make me even more money or advancing the game!” I find it to be a better relaxation one rather than a game to play purely for entertainment on one’s free time. I sometimes like to play it when I get off work, otherwise it seems like a drag to get through, especially since you can’t save until you go to bed.
3	Yeeeeeeep. It is a chore for some of the games, and I don't particularly enjoy them anymore but the repetitive nature does help stop my brain from racing. Becomes almost like a compulsion. 
3	Animal crossing and World of Warcraft are the two games that have given me the strongest sense of this phenomenon, but honestly most games feel like this once the enjoyment wears off and the difficulty gets too high. It's why I hardly ever finish video games. Recently I have tried to push myself to focus on just one game till I finish it (at least the main story), then move on to the next.
2	i know what you mean \n\ni’ve created a method for playing games through larger gaps of time to prevent losing track of its mechanics, plot, side quests, etc.\n\nthat why i filter them so hard on reviews before i even begin, they must “deserve”
2	I had that going with league, the solution is to find a "worthy sucsessor". Find a hobby you actually enjoy, it can still be video games and roll with it, it brings the fun back.
2	Yes I do this a lot.  Say, a game of spider solitaire, i would keep on playing it over and over in class, even though im bored asf doing it its like i must beat my last record time of completing it lol
1	WoW is hell of a drug.
1	Welcome to human psychology and external reward drivenness. Once you get into a loop of doing something for a score, for in-game rewards, for a shiny, you can get stuck in it even if you no longer find the activity itself rewarding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you notice this do take a moment to consider if spending many more hours on said activity is actually something you want in your life, or if you'd rather quit cold turkey and free up that time for something else. Heck, if novelty is fun itself there's nothing wrong with getting and selling back some games every month just to keep havin' new stuff.
1	I did this with rocket league during a long bout of depression, boredom, and loneliness
7	How do you know for sure you're in love?	
10	Report back if you figure it out. I am very likely to idealize people when crushing on them. Try to stay vigilant and not believe any of those optimistic assumptions you make about them, and try not to get romantically involved too soon after meeting someone. Get to know them as long as you can first.
6	When you feel it, you’ll know, and it is fucking terrifying. 
6	Just remember love is just nature way of wanting to reproduce. We are animals. Don't worry about it. Be like water and just go with the flow. You'll die anyway. 
5	Beware!  It could be love, or it could be a dopamine/oxytocin fueled infatuation.\n\nA huge test for it: how much do you know this person?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(For explanation, I will use a female as an example.)  If you barely know her, and only love her for her looks and what little you know of her personality, it's most definitely infatuation. You only love the superficial elements of her.  You dont know, she could be a narcissist or sociopath.  You dont know her, so you can't love her.  The immense, overwhelming "love" is just hormones.  BUT, it is ok to feel that way.  And there is nothing wrong with taking interest in someone.  Just know that it isnt "true love".  I can tell you in all certainty: there is no such thing as love at first sight.  Unless "love" means hormone dump.\n\n *"Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain..." Proverbs 31:30*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if you actually have gotten to know this person, and know her good and bad side, and still love her, then you probably do love her.  And probably the greatest test of love is weathered storms.  Loving each other still, even though you've had an argument, or gone through tough times.  Staying together even when it's hard.  Also: love has to entail self sacrifice.  If you arent willing to give up your happiness for hers, how could you love her?  If you cannot serve her, then you cannot love her.  If you are so narcissistic, prideful, and inconsiderate that you cannot give yourself up for the one you love, then you can never love anybody.  And watch out for people like that, who will try to control you and bend you to their will.  That's an invitation to an abusive relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe that will help someone.  Though, ive never been in a relationship with anybody, and here I am around 20 years old.  Only a giver of un-reciprocated affection.  They say girls only like a\*\*hole men, and I cant help but wonder if that's true...
3	When time spent with another person counts as time alone, basically as an introvert you don't "waste" energy with this person as you do with other people
2	Love is what you make of it.\n\nHormones make it more fun though.

1	The answer is clearly window, duh.
14	What element (based on Avatar: The Last Airbender) is best suited for INTPs?	While rewatching ATLA, I became quite interested in this subject. As I searched, I mostly found that people consider INTPs to be airbenders. I personally think we're more suited for firebending. If you have your own opinions, I would love to hear them out. Also this is my first post so pls be gentle:\n\n1. Unlike other bending styles (specifically water and earth), fire is more abstract. It is also something that can go off and veer people away if not used correctly, similar in the case when INTPs get too truthful and scare other people off (and making other people move away from you isnt something that the hospitable-ish, peace loving air nomads would do)\n\n2. Firebenders are only as strong as their passion. When we find a field we are honestly passionate about, we easily become very very good at it. The same goes for firebenders. If you recall the time when Zuko first joined Team Avatar, he became super weak. This was because he lost his "drive". However, when he was able to find his new motivation, his firebending got way stronger (represented by a change in hue).\n\n3. Lightningbending - Termed as the cold-blooded fire, lightning bending requires sheer concentration and dettachment from our emotions. INTPs are very good at this, as we are able to turn off our emotions, not even letting it be a factor in a lot of cases, mostly because our Ti - Hero is probably the greatest compared to other personality types. So naturally, if you are an INTP firebender in the world of avatar, you probably have a knack for firebending.\n\n4. The nature of fire - Fire is hot. It can be dangerous but it can also be very warm. Oftentimes, it is very useful. Similarly, INTPs tend to be some of the greatest contributers to this world. We are also perceived to be very mean (and sometimes we are but that's mostly because we're right) and very hard to get super close to (If we arent given alone time and we are at the point of bursting out, we can hurt others). However, if people know what we need and how we like to be treated, then we can surprisingly give them comfort and warmth only we can provide. (INTPs are actually genuine when it comes to helping others, it's just that most people fail to realize how we do it)\n\n5. The nature of fire cont.2 - Fire also illuminates. When people need us in times where they need support, not only do we give them comfort, but we "enlighten" them. We are able to make them see all their options and that in turn gives them something to work with. As for being useful, fire is very versatile. This fits how INTPs can actually be very good at a lot of things, given that we actually get off our butts and do something for once (Just like how it can be hard to start a fire)\n\n6. The soldiers aren't really good lookouts - How many times did a bunch of kids slip past firebending soldiers? Maybe that's because their mind wanders off while guarding their posts.\n\n7. INTPs are hot\n\nThose are only some of the reasons off the top of my head, can't really voice out some other stuff because I can't properly turn my thoughts into words and also because I'm feeling a bit lazy. But again, would really appreciate your own thoughts on this.
9	Water - Because we go with the flow, and are calm and collected, containing a SEA of knowledge. But when we are angered, storms will brew, sweeping our enemies off the ship, sending them to a watery grave. \n\nAir, though much like flowing water, is far too free-spirited. Air goes wherever it pleases without worry while bodies of water will stay in the same spot (comfort zone). \n\nFire is the spark; the passion that burns brightly, illuminating and warming others - the exact opposite of INTPs.\n\nEarth, stubborn and rigid, and can mean unwillingness to explore new possibilities that exists beyond (INTPs are flexible). Its sturdy nature can be reliable in times of need, providing shelter and food. 
8	We are the Avatar personality. We want to know about everything and thus become the jack of all trades. \n\nAlso like the Avatar we can throw one hell of a rage fit.
4	In response to your idea that we're like Fire benders? I can't relate to it. It's very Se and forceful. A bunch of ENTJs, ESTJs, INTJs, ESTPs, etc. We're way too chill generally. Sure we have our fire moments once every few months or years where someone pushes us and we snap, but that's pretty rare and not really a defining trait I don't think. I explained why I think we're like Air benders in response to the other comment. 
3	Yeah, not really. We aren't passionate people at all, even if we wish we were. Our Fi is rather weak.\n\nIf we look into the philosophy of each of the 4 element, we can roughly associate each with an axis.\n\n* Air is pretty NeSi, in it's multifaceted approach, based on counter, etc. Evasive.\n* Earth is very direct and head strong. It's about direct confrontation. So kinda like SeNi.\n* Modern firebender base it on anger, but in that episode where Zuko and Aang learn it's a bit more complex. Anyway, FiTe.\n* Water is more calm, etc. It's adaptable/universal, so TiFe.\n\nSo either air or water for us.\n\n\n\n\n
2	Ok I haven't actually read your whole post yet, but upvote immediately because of my love for ATLA. 
2	I haven’t watched Avatar yet. Here’s just a fun little tidbit that CSJ said about the classical elements (not sure how much I accept this, just an interesting consideration):\n\nSi = Earth\n\nSe = Air\n\nNi = Fire\n\nNe = Water\n\nYeah, this would also imply a person can only either be Earth and Water, or Air and Fire. 
2	It is rather hard to fit INTP as fire imo. Since fire is normally associated to more expressive n energetic type of character. I would say we fit to water more.\n\n\n1. What u mentioned can be applied to all the other elements less earth. Water n air can be abstract too, hell they are more abstract than fire itself, considering the fact we know the "shape" of fire but never air or water. Veering ppl away is kinda our thing, we rather be air nomads or being in an isolationist water tribe than exploring the world physically like the fire nation does. \n\n\n2. Fire does represent passion for the most part, but you must know how we normally lose them easily and move on to other things. Our attention spend isn't that great. However, we normally keep that knowledge bottle up in our minds until we need it someday to interact with someone who shared out current/past interest. I would say we are more water on this part as we are quite deep like the ocean.\n\n\n3. Lighting bending example is kinda weak I guess? I mean if u want to represent INTP's cold hearted detachment from emotions would it be better to represent ice bending instead? Like the element that normally portrays how *cold* someone is? \n\n\n4. Your example of us being warm is kinda true to an extend. We can be warm to ppl we like but not most ppl. The nature of fire is to keep EVERYONE warm not just a select few like we do. Like an igloo, we only let a select few to our crib to stay warm but even then the ppl that like us knows that the nature of our personality is quite cold.\n\n\n5. Yes we do like to enlighten ppl on misconceptions n sharing our knowledge n that is our fullest extend on support we can give. Just not emotional ones, sure we can empathize but giving rational solutions isn't what most ppl are looking for. As for versatility, water n air fits better, fire consumes n brute forces their way to a solution unlike water n air that can change their formes while leaving as little damage as possible. What was that Bruce Lee quote? Be like water, be formless? Along those lines, u get what I mean. We are normally labeled as jack of all trades master of none, in other words we can tailor our behaviour (chameleon) n skills to fit the situation at hand but never truly master it if we dun deem them important. Like water, we can fit in to any conversation n situation given enough context.\n\n\n6. Wut?\n\n\n7. I agree\n\n
2	I've haven't seen the show/movie, so can't comment on that for fun, but just based on  correspondences with the classical elements (which I assume the show derives its inspiration from), I'd say *water*, and loosely under the phlegmatic humor/personality. The INTP "archetype" is predominately cold and wet, IMO. 
2	I dont know much about Avatar, besides what I learned from the M. Night movie.  But I just love this, because it's the most INTP ever. Putting so much abstract thought into something so seemingly mundane and random.  It's wonderful! 
2	Gyatso af
2	I don’t disagree with any of your points, especially agree with lightning. I’ve never considered this in relation to avatar (I’ve definitely thought what type of bending I’d be, but never in direct relation to intp). Though classically air and fire element are considered the “masculine”, in relation to types I would consider thinker to fit this classification. I think Te would be the more straight forwardly aggressive type “Fire”, whereas Ti users are more flexible and agile in how they come off aggressive “Air”. So TJs would be Fire and TPs would be air. \n\nHowever, personally it’s always been between fire and water bending for what I’d want to be.
1	Just speaking for myself - water
11	This short scene in True Detective made me think of a conversation between an INTP and an xSxP. Thought you guys might enjoy.	
9	This is exactly the reason why I don't talk to people. That's like me talking to my father or sister, or mother, or brother. Pretty much anyone in my family. Funniest thig is that my family members are all xSxP's. Pretty correct! 
7	I disagree with his worldview, but OH MY GOSH do I relate with this situation.  I think a little bit too deeply for most people.

I spend the majority of my time doing it.  And that's where my ideas that you hate, come from!  LOL

0	How to become an INTP	Okay. So, I'm a 17 yo ENTP, and I wanna become an INTP. Yeah, being entp is all cool stuff but I should be productive, should at least have my interest and attention focused at a point.\n\nI am an extrovert and can't stand something no longer than my attention span. It gets draining when I don't interact with people for a long time. This sucks, right?\n\nDon't tell me that INTPs arent productive either, because being an introvert comes with the ability to expert in areas of interest. (Or don't object to this, because I know what you're going to say and this would be a waste.)\n\nDon't tell me to become an INTJ either. They are annoying bastards. I dont wanna be an INTJ. -but I may change my mind later tho-\n\nOr, don't tell me that being INTP is a very high point and I can't reach it. Really. \n\nSo, what should I do to become an INTP? I think it's not that late considering I'm 17.\n\nHelp me pls
13	Maybe CRISPR on a few key genes, or a retrovirus, or some traumatic socially-related event (PTSD) , , , or just retake the MTBI and give different answers.   When you get it 'right' Poster the answers up on the wall and make those your 'goals'.   
10	I really don't think it works that way..\n\nBut maybe you should start with developing the abillity to be alone with yourself, to not get drained as much by the lack if social interaction
9	You can’t change your mbti.\n\nENTPs seem happeir than us anyway
4	Are you fucking retarded? The only time INTP and productive are in the same sentence is “INTPs are not productive”
4	I think the main goal you should have is to get all the letters. EINSTFPJ
4	Lmfao idk legend says if you eat your own ass you can be any MBTI type you want.
3	I’m an ISFP and I can’t focus on anything :(. Maybe try to be an XNTJ lol.
3	You really can't change your type. If you want to get more productive you have to improve your own functions. Also INTPs are the most lazy type. Please get your facts straight before telling us that INTPs are productive.
2	You don’t change your mbti. You work on improving your weaknesses to become well rounded. Don’t use the label as your limitations but simply as a way to figure out your weaknesses and strengths so you can become well rounded.
1	Not sure if this is a serious post but I'll bite anyway because I'm bored. Firstly, it really, really, doesn't work like that. But let's theorize. Even if you did manage to change your type, you'd just be swapping the inability to focus and short attention span with apathy and lack of motivation. You're viewing this through the lens of how you are wired right now, romanticizing the ideal way an INTP could turn out and not taking into account the completely new frame of mind and struggles that "becoming INTP" would also bring.\n\nTruth is, to be super productive and sustain the level of motivation to become an expert in a bunch of subjects would take just as much effort for an INTP, as you the way you are now learning to deal better without as much social interaction and work on your attention span. Why go to the effort of attempting to change your type, to end up with the same amount of trouble being productive, just for different reasons?\n\nSame as us, you have your own strengths and weaknesses and you're going to have to work to make the best of what you've got. You're also assuming here that you can only be productive in solitude? That's not true! You can use your extroversion to do so many cool projects with other people that a lot of INTPs your age wouldn't have the social balls to get started with.
1	You can't change your cognitive functions sorry.\nEmbrace the pros and cons of an ENTP and learn to make your weakness your bitch. 
1	Your reasoning for wanting to "Change your personality" is pretty weak. If anything, just be yourself and learn about who you are as a person more. Work around yourself knowledge and you'll be more content. You shouldn't change your personality just for the sake of it. 
1	more philosophy, more depth. test analyst is a profession of intp.

8	I'm moving to Seattle. I know 1 person, who lives in Spokane
7	I wish I could move every few years to explain why I don't have many  friends. I mean I don't care I don't have many friends but other people expect you to.

9	That's me. My gf laughed. She agrees.
3	Would love to hear stories from people who navigated this scenario(moving to a new city and making friends) successfully.
2	Consider this. When you move to a new city, you are dropped into a place where no one knows you. To them, you will be whoever you appear to be. If you make the effort to be more social and meet people, that is the you they will know. Then if you fall into your old ways, they will say "you are not acting like yourself." Keep it up for 6 weeks, and you will create a reinforcing social network.
2	me every day at school
2	You probably heard this before... but try talking genuinely or fake it, you will find people who will match your wavelength(relate to you) eventually. \nAs a INTP, we aren’t restricted to just Ti, Ne, Si, Fe... you can access the other functions but it might feel uncomfortable at first, like really self draining but to connect and get by you need to start talking to people 😁

1	Sorry to come across as condescending. My age sometimes leads people to think that I am saying I know it all. I do my best not to.\n\nI have a therapist and definitely am not one myself. And I appreciate all humor.\n\nMy point to the extent that I had one was that to me there is a disconnect between not caring about having friends while at the same time caring what others think about it.

1	For me, it's more like:\n\nSomeone: Hey\n\nMe: Hey\n\nMe: That's enough socialization for today.
1	Perhaps some of the confusion arises from presupposing the categories of sexual identity that prevail these days. Imo there is no such thing as a bisexual (or heterosexual, etc), but rather the phenomenon of homoeroticism. Seen from this angle, your friend didn't discover her bisexuality but the two of you manifested it. I.e. pretty much all relationships have an erotic aspect; and you can be Socrates, or Alcibiades.

2	Reminds me of my main form of entertainment: talking to people I know, in my head.\n\nI get to know people, and figure out their patterns.  Get to where I can predict them.  And all the freaking time, Im imagining conversations with them, and simulating the ways they would react and what they would say.  I could be teaching them about something I just learned, or just enjoying their company.  \n\nAnd ive rehearsed conversations with people, then had the real conversation, and it went just like how I simulated!  It's crazy!\n\nInstead of talking to real people, I just talk to imaginary ones.  Damn that's sad, now that I put it out there.  But I live a sad existence anyway, so it's just par for the course. 
2	Many people are predictable if you get to know them enough, especially if they are more truthful and open about their thinking, which not everyone is.\n\nAlthough I do not know if I have gotten word for word accurate with someone for more than a sentence or phrase they like to use here and there, there are many people where I know most of what they are going to say, but I don't always get the wording right, just the gist of what they are going to say.
2	You: Next you're going to say "stop procrastinating and do your work"\n\nYour Mum: stop procrastinating and do your work, NANI!
1	I know a woman who was married for a long time, and she claimed she knew everything her husband was going to say because after being married for so long she'd heard him say so much so often. \n\nI rather think this is what is happening to you. What type is your mom? Something very predictable perhaps?
1	Same, and it's stupid
1	i can predict some specific phrases other people often tend to say and their general opinion on the matter at hand.
1	What do you think about Qaddafi	Was he Good or Evil?\n\nWhy did the United States help get him overthrown?\n\nHow do you feel about him wanting to start a Gold Standard uniting African currency?
3	Was he good? I don't know. Was he all evil? I don't know either.\n\nLooking at the "consequences" of removing him from power though, might have been wiser to leave him rule his folk. Middle east is a cluster f**k.\n\nGeopolitical interests and something something trading oil not in US dollars got far away folk suddenly interested in Human Rights and so on.\n\nThe world is a dirty and selfish place.
1	I mean, he was an authoritarian, which I am completely opposed to, but his regime provided a lot of stability in the Maghreb which hasn't been replaced. \n\nIt's pretty much the same situation with Saddam. Was he a monster? Yes, absolutely. But did his rule promote stability? Yes (allowing, of course, that Saddam was also quite bellicose to Iraq's neighbours, so it was really more internal stability I'm referring to.)
1	He was absolutely evil.  That doesnt mean good things didnt come from his rule, though, since good things *can* come from evil governments.  \n\nKinda like Hitler's tuberculosis tests, that saved so many people's lives.  And his Beauty of Labour (Schönheit der Arbeit) program improved the safety and quality of perhaps millions of people's jobs.
1	* Good and evil doesn't mean shit \n* Well, France took the lead on his overthrowing, and I heard our dearvpreisdent Sarkozy did it in part because he received money from him (even inviting beforehand).\n* Not a very good idea. Africa is a whole continent, there's tons of differences. Each time i hear panafricannist ideas, I think it's seeing the World in black and White (like, literally, since the idea is being unified, and kinda aginst the ex white colonisers. China is welcome, tho), and that's basically defining yourself outwardly. That's kinda being racist against yourself.\n\nI doubt his dinnar idea had any chance of becoming a reality, though 
1	he was a good guy
1	My fellow countryman Spymonkey3D already answered most of it but I can sum it up for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) khaddafi was neither good or evil, he is a dictator. He obviously wanted the best for its country because Lybia was quite wealthy before the civil war but at the same time he would do everything he needs to stay in power. To rationalize the horrible things they do dictators say that the country they run would be in worse shape without them, and sadly they are quite often right : look at Lybia, Irak, Syria, Yougoslavia etc...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Obama was not really eager overthrowing him but he was convinced by Sarkozy that they were doing the "right thing". Nobody saw the Arab Spring comming and Western Powers wanted to show they would be on the right side of history, ignoring the possible outcome their intervention would bring. It is also important to note that Khaddafi opposed the US for years in global politics even if they stepped back from their anti-imperialist narrative on the international scene after 2000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3)Obviously we don't know the whole story here. Maybe he was serious, or maybe he just started this idea in order to get more influence in Africa and oppose the Western World who accused them of being one of the worse dictators on the planet. Quite often the anti-western stance can be resumed by "you are talking about human rights while we are talking about development" , same thing with Rwanda recently.
11	Best match for INTPs?	Curious as to what personality type pairs best with an INTP. INTP fits me perfectly.
10	Supposedly entjs. I haven’t had the best experience with entjs irl though
8	I took this part out because I realize I miss understood. \n\nThat being said my current GF is an ISFJ, and I would not trade her for anyone. I do think though that you might need a mature INTP and a mature ISFJ for this to work. They are our opposite twin or something. Maybe we are the dark twin? We have the same stack just in a different order.\n\nINTP: Ti Ne Si Fe \nISFJ:    Si Fe Ti Ne\n\nCommunicating is really rough. If you aren't bleeding, screaming, or crying, you are fine in an ISFJs eyes, so getting her attention is hard since I'm not the sort who screams and cries. I do occasionally bleed or break a bone. Sure is effective tho when the crying does start. Highly recommend it when dealing with an ISFJ. Also use one short sentence to state what you need. Always say you need it, otherwise it's optional and since they are very busy you won't get it. They get zero from INTP style communication, so you have to adapt. They can't hold up in an argument with us so I just drop things and move on if it's not a vital thing. Never embarrass them. Cover it over and move on. When they really want to know they will figure it out. I just let her be wrong. They crave validation and approval. We are still working through it all.\n\nAh, learning to communicate. :) \n\nWe have such a good time. She is such a good human. So smart too. Her recall is amazing. Such a snappy brain. We do puzzles together and kayak and hike, and she tries so hard to make sure I get what she knows I need. 😍 Like alone time, and no crowds.\n\nThey like us are both incredibly smart and incredibly dumb at the same time. They are good at facts. We are good at knowing how things work. They are dumb about knowing how things work, and we are dumb about emotions.\n\ntl;dr I think ISFJs are a good match for INTPs.
5	I always match with INFPs. Both my boyfriend of 3 years, and my best friend of 10 years are INFP.
5	intellectual bad asses like us, ENTJ.    \n\n\nWhy don't you guys have flairs here?
6	I have no idea. Apparently ENTJs are great for us, but I honestly don't see how can they tolerate my lazy, unproductive, and unorganized ass. I haven't really met an ENTJ in real life, so I don't really know if my impressions of them are actually accurate. I personally would prefer an INFJ though, but they are very rare, so I haven't met one either. Generally speaking, I find N types easier to communicate with; S types either find me boring or hard to understand. 
7	I have read several times that INTP + INFJ is called the "golden pair." My INFJ wife and I have been married 31 years, and I am still happy for it. 
3	The trouble is, in practical terms, I don't walk up to the girl and ask, "Hey girl! Have you taken MBTI? What's your personality?"\n\nIf I get close enough to ask her the question, then I'd already know her. Wouldn't need a quiz to tell me if she's the one.
2	ENTJ probably. I'm somewhat of an ambivert now, but me and my ENTJ brother has been really hitting it since the introvert days. 
2	Im terrible at identifying other people's types.  I am having a crazy hard time just trying to type my parents.  Though Im sure my mom is an IxTJ, pretty sure an INTJ.\n\nI havent known many people in my life, or their types, so I have no experience.  I hear that INFPs are beloved by INTPs.  Again, I can't know.\n\nBut I clash so bad with my mom.  Her controlling, heavy J-ness is way too much.  And while she can understand the higher thinking I love, she heavily criticizes it all, and belittles all my ideas.  Ughghhghhg.  And again, the super strict, organized, tidyness is too much for my P nature.  Idk, its not a very fun combination. 
2	Any type has the potential to get along with any other type. The supposed ideal match in theory is ESFJ, the exact opposite of us function wise but I personally have never met one or feel the need to meet one. I've heard that ENTJ's make great partners but good luck finding one cuz apparently super rare ofc. I personally get along with INTJ's, INFJ's, ENTP's, ENFP's, INTP's (healthy only), and maybe the odd INFP. \n\nRomantically, I've looked back and seen myself consistently chasing ENFP's although I personally think I'm done with that (been burned by them too many times to count). Dated what I thought was an ISTP at one point which was quite an interesting experience (communication problems but had amazing sex and intimacy). Friendship wise, get along really well with INTJ's and INFJ's but never had one as a partner.
1	ESFJ. Nuff said.
1	I've been trying to get data on this, actually.  I haven't found much, but I did find two sources.\n\nBasically the "intuitive" part is pretty important.  Sensing types seem to be generally less of a good match.\n\n- http://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/content/intps-love\n- https://www.man42.net/blog/2016/11/mbti-relationship-survey/relationships/intp/
0	Socionics says ESFJ.
1	Psychological Types -Jung	Im aware of the surface of personality psychology and was wondering if you guys thought diving into this book would be worth the time and money. I heard it talks about INTP more than the other types and am interested.
3	I spotted it at a bookstore this weekend and...it looks like an intense fucking read. But yeah, it’s the source material for like...all of this shit. \n\nSo I feel like I’m gonna have to jump in in order to have my own first person understanding of archetypes and not just having it filtered second hand through MBTI or enneagram, etc. 
1	I would recommend getting some newer books instead if you are interested in personality psychology. You know, ones that can back up most of their claims with actual statistics. Jung's material is mostly interesting if viewed from a spiritual point of view. At best it's proto-psychology, he did not believe in the scientific method and derived pretty much everything from intuition ([some of it is pretty schizotypal](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/ai37g7/toxic_effects_of_the_infamous_ni_rarity/eel3oxf/) which means he's good at spreading original ideas but not a reliable source of knowledge.).\n\nAlmost all chapters of Psychological Types are very detailed descriptions and examples of how he derided the existence of *extroversion and introversion* from material of older famous people, I believe he discusses material from Nietzsche and other philosophers in detail. \n\nThe existence of feeling/thinking, sensing/intuition and rational/irrational types is only discussed in one chapter, this is what Myers loosely adopted when she made her own typing system. Of note is that most of what Jung described are direct contradictions with the bullshit you can read on the internet about "functions". If you would type MBTI INTPs using Jung's original system, they'd likely end up as a NiTi type.\n\n> I heard it talks about INTP more than the other types\n\nNope. By the way, he also mentions that most people don't fit into any of his 8 types, only into the extroverted and introverted categories.
5	I hate texting...	Is it acceptable if I only text a girl once a week (not sure if she likes me though, but we're certainly friends at the least)? Is this normal in other INTP's also?
4	I'd rather call than text most of the time
1	I hate texting too. Being there for her must be enough, I believe so.
1	I'm not sure I understand. Are you wanting to date her? Do you often see her in person or speak to her on the phone?\n\nOnce a week is fine for a casual friend or acquaintance.\n\nIf you want to date her then it depends on the individual what is acceptable. You can substitute phone calls for texting. Seeing someone in person regularly best because then you don't need to call or text.\n\nIs it normal? Im sure it is. I like texting and phone calls with friends. You don't have too.
1	I think this's got more to do with the culture you're in, rather than personality. I still feel uncomfortable talking on phone with strangers. But about my friends, I embrace them! Both texting and calling.\n\nIn my culture, strangers usually text when there's something important. I had a distance friend who started texting me frequently. I thought that was weird and I kept asking him if anything was wrong. That continued for a while, and we're really good friends now :)\n\nAbout girls, it's often said, look confident, and let the confidence do the work, even if you're seeking just a friendship.
1	I HATE texting. But I figured out, not soon enough, that girls really dig it when you put some time and energy into interacting with them. Show interest. Show perseverance. It's a real fucking chore, but now I have a girl who I love very much (But still hate to text lmao). \nAs an intp, we need to adapt. These things come naturally to most types. Unfortunately, we suck. 
1	Women apparatuses are cumbersome but worthwhile most of the time. Don't let the relationship die
1	my closest/2nd closest friend keeps sends sets of 3-7 texts to say 1 thing and it infuriates me
0	Wish me good luck for tomorrow. I have to present my “art project” to the class and have extreme social anxiety. Waking up at 6 am to finish it. It’s a piece of shit hopefully the teacher goes easy on me	
36	What intp takes pictures of oneself? 
25	What is this meme 
6	Good luck Thomas
4	Good luck mate, you can do it!
5	Would’ve made more sense if you posted a picture of your art project. \nRegardless, all the best
3	Good luck my dude

6	Polarized social energy (INTP)(19m)	Hello everyone. Some days when Im with my friends Im extremely detached and nonverbal and I can tell that they notice, and other days I am my ideal social self (when i act out a funny, talkative self). Its so easy for me to make new friends and be charismatic when Im in the latter state, but I become extremely anxious around new people in the former state. My friends (none INTP) seem disappointed when I’m not being my more entertaining self, does anyone have similar experiences as this? I feel like I’m sort of socially bipolar. Half introvert-half extrovert. Is it just lack of focus? Lack of energy? Some sort of emotional effect that I cant decipher? \n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: Its like some days I dont feel the motivation to be myself- i just want to sit back and judge/read everyone in my head
7	That is what introverts do depending on their energy levels. At times it is just more economical to preserve energy than entertain a stranger.
4	I have this too! I kind of have been worrying I might have something wrong with me as well but no hard/ fast answer yet .
3	Yep. Das ist mich! Like all the fucking time :) For me, it's got to do with how close I am with them, how they respond to my extroverted behaviour, former events, things we have in common, and the periodic rush of hormones I guess?
2	I can relate to this entirely
2	I can relate so much to this. Ive been saying for years that I wish I could just have a handle on it. Like an "on" switch. I also feel this way about work as my job relies heavily on presentation skills. Sometimes I hit the charisma button, other times I hit the "personality of a stale French fry" button. I agree with some of the other posts though, I'm usually a bit drained when I can't be outgoing. Like I suck back into myself as my introverted nature searches inside for the quiet it can't find outside. 
2	I do this also.\n\nI’ve found over the years that it usually happens when I’m getting run down at work, or just tired. Sometimes it’s because I’ve over-socialized over the weekend and just don’t feel like talking to anyone for a couple days.\n\nHaven’t tried to change it, because if I’m in a surly mood isn’t it best for everyone if I just chill out for a while until I actually *want* to talk to people? As long as you’re not being a dick about it people figure out it’s just the way you are. It helps if you focus on your needs and why you are being a hermit when people ask. Most people will think they did something wrong, you just have to explain that it’s not them; you’re just a little weird sometimes and need time to yourself.
1	I experienced something similar a few time, but it's not a regular thing for me. I'm also rather consistent when I'm out with friends, at a "making snarky comments" with a smile, and laughing a bit, but it's not the full on charisma, nor the quiet thingy.\n\nIt's a weird flow state, where the difficulty is just right for your skills, a "fully actived" state. Like, it doesn't really come at the cost of TiNe, but it includes stuff we don't do usually. \n\nI don't know how to explain, which would be useful. If we understood it, then we could tap in at will \n\n\n\n\n
1	i have the opposite, I'm quiet and reserved giving out only the most essential information when i'm with strangers but once I know someone well I become really loud, rant about random shit and then swear a lot
0	Fool me one, ha, I just might give you a pass. Fool me twice , your fucked buddy

1	Whoa, Jewish pussy got me actin strange
1	Is this the same guy? I'm confused 😕
2	How to argue with people who tend to jump the conclusion without any evidence?	I'm having a hard time arguing with people who do the above.  \nThey without any verifiable evidence just jump on some conclusion, they don't even check whether forcing that conclusion is somehow hampering the already established scenario.  \nLike for their convenience they will assume anything but when asked about the reason, they never like to discuss how the apparent downside of their conclusions can be explained.
8	I don't do it. I learned not to argue with such people after doing it so much and failing to tell them why I don't like their protocol.
6	Comment based on if those are real "assumption", you know, guesses or hunches. Not just say, a bias like ""people of this group X did Y, you're part of X to, therefore you are likely to do Y". \n\nThat's bad logic and bad evidence. But not really an assumption.\n***\nThis corresponds a bit (but not only) to IxNJs behavior. It's Ni. (Assumptions means a perceiving functions so the judging functional are out. Both Ne and Se are extraverted gatherer, they try to get more info, while Si is about Internal sensation, so outside of that domain.).\n\nDepending on where that Ni is, the effect will be different : \n\n* INxJ : It's their bread and butter, so they trust it. they will try to cover it with a Te or Fe reasoning, but it doesn't fit. They don't use their Se as much as they should (just like we suck at Fe). **They will get offended if you criticize it too hard**, there's pride in it. (INFJs calls it their savior complex) It's strong, but also weak since they tend to ignore Se evidence (bad data = bad predictions/"reads"). In the case of INFJ, they also ignore Te too, so you're supposed to believe them. It often doesn't make sense, and if acted logically, they will cover it with Ti, but it will be weak logic (like, "You cannot prove I'm wrong"). INTJ will completely misread the Fe domain, which means they can't really grasp the Human factor in their plan or assumptions. Anyway, for both of them, it's not a guess, it's something they "just know". **Best counter is to be there to say "I told you so" after they are proven wrong** They don't listen at other times.\n* ENxJ : They just use it as an assistant. It's their auxiliary. So, they don't actually care about it that much, it's a tool they use to save time. They will assume stuff, but it's not too egregious, imho.\n* IS*P : Their Se is stronger, so their assumptions, or Ni guesses/hunches will be more factual, like a trend line on lots of data points. Their guesses/hunches are rather conventional, like, following a certain school of thought or something. If you can identify it, then you can counter that \n* ES*P : Even more data points, and the trend line aren't really used often. They kinda like that stuff, but they aren't confident in their ability here. The problem with them is that they can be gullible when you say you have such intimuitions/hunches, so they can take the opposite side of you easily. (Goes for the above too). DaveSuperPowers said he noticed that in them actually, saying they tend to believe in ghost stories. **Can be used against them if you're a dick, or if you want gently troll them** They like hard observable evidence more, tho, so if there's some, you can win easily with it\n\nBtw, Ni is also very present in the shadow of others types. **Us INxP, in particular, where it works in the background of our first function.** So when you think it's logic speaking, try to see if you don't have some Ni hunches thrown in there too. I can guarantee you can find some if you pay attention. (Being aware of them is important, btw, either allow you to "fix" it, or you can accept it and to some extent.) Not a problem for ENxP (when they assume something with Ni, it's more throwing it around and staying what sticks). IS*J don't really use it even if it's their role function, as for ES*J, they aren't really aware of Ni.\n\n\n\n\n\n
3	A related thing:  Ive been trying to break my habit of "debating" on the internet.  (Lets be real, there are no debates on the internet. Only arguments.)\n\nYou just can't convince people of anything over the internet.  It is virtually impossible.  And all it does is stress me out and infuriate me when they're being total logic-less morons.  Its actually bad for my health.\n\nBut we INTPs have Te Nemesis.  We can't stand seeing others believing things that are false.  We just have that urge to educate them to the truth.  I dont want others to be wrong, or spread falsities.  (On the other hand, one of my a\*\*hole co-worker loves to see others do things wrong, because he gets some pleasure out of correcting people.  Boosts his narcissism or something, freaking jerk.)\n\nFor example, I end up hyperfocusing on correcting people in the comments of something that Leon Trotsky was murdered with an ICE AXE, not an Ice Pick.

2	you can ask how did they arrive at it, or insert intermediate conclusion and jump to completely different outcome based on it.\n\nthis usually makes them think, because now they have to explain their line of thinking to prove you wrong. except for cases like "i am right so shut up".
2	You don’t.   \n\n\nYou can’t reason someone out of a position that they didn’t reason themselves into. You’ll need to practice saying “You might be right” with a non-annoyed tone and facial expression if you have any chance of saving your soul.
2	just don't
2	*I don't.*\n\nYou can't go in the minds of close-minded people.
1	vegan meme	
7	AMA INTP vegan, 14 years here.\n\nPeople with a strong addiction to flesh, eggs, and lactation = the beginning of a fucked up fairytale.\n\nJunk science? It helps people keep from getting fat. Are there any studies linking obesity to disease?\n\nThe weak vegan meme? You're confusing vegans with hippies. Hippies, I agree, are weak.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I'm not a complete vegan but I eat way less meat now, especially beef
1	A lot of vegans are like this (freelee) but many do account for science and advise b12 supplementation etc. (unnatural vegan) 
21	Does anyone else perceive as a pasttime?	Idk if this is an INTP thing but one of my favorite activities is what I would describe as sitting with existence. It feels like consciousness is a marble and I'm rolling it around and looking at it. Not thinking about anything in particular or directing my mind towards a goal/end, but wasting several hours immersing myself within the beauty of hereness. Staring into space essentially, but in a way that feels the opposite of absent-minded. I'll put on music and look at the sky from my window or walk around for several hours with no destination. If anyone asked me what I was thinking about during that time, I wouldn't be able to say, and yet I could affirm I was \~there\~ the whole time. Not actively thinking whatsoever, but passively recognizing. Watching, but not interpreting. Confronting the reality of being alive in a moment without forming judgments. I feel most myself in this mode. Something feels realer about it, like I'm only really myself when this happens. It's so pointless that it feels like the most important thing. Something also seems timeless about it...like a million different people in a million different eras stopped to do this before me, and we're all united by our willingness to gaze around the car instead of out the windshield at the horizon we're all headed towards. Does anyone know what I mean?
6	What you describe has aspects of mindfulness and even meditation. It means to bring one's awareness to the present moment and to just sense what is without judging things or yourself.\n\nYour description sounds wonderful, and the practice must be beneficial.\n\nFor fun, try doing that with people or a conversation. In some ways, it is harder, but it can be so rewarding.
1	I grew up in an old farmhouse and at night, during our infrequent snowstorms, I'd go to the mudroom, turn off the room light, turn on the porch light, gaze up, and lose myself in the darkness and the patterns of snowfall; no particular idea of where I was or wanted to be, no clear picture of anything, really, just... being.  Floating.  Yeah.  Celebrating consciousness.
1	happens to me sometimes, but i get bored with it quickly, as a lot more can be seen from the past or future (think perspectives)
1	I wake early enough to get in to the city an hour ahead of work just to watch the world rouse. \n\nIt's like my body is the sun but my mind is the city; the sun rises, but my thoughts take a while to begin to materialise and multiply and move about. And they do so in intricate and seperate fibres, weaving and knitting together to form the fabric of my mind like human traffic does over the concrete forming civilization, and order. And colour and noise and life.\n\nIt's not even a desire; if I didn’t get that hour and do that with it ahead of beginning the day there'd just be desolation, devastation, despair. And *dis*order. Just like if the sun rose, but the people never flooded in to the city, or they were made to all appear at the same exact moment; it’d be chaos.\n\nI d'know if it it’s an ‘INTP thing’, I just know that it's something I have to do, like eating or sleeping; I can manage a day or two without it if I'm forced to, but beyond that, I begin to feel like I'm dying, and going mad in the meantime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

6	How do I keep myself from fucking it up bc I’m scared?	So long story short I have the strongest feeling I’ve ever felt for another person and I am 10/10 overwhelmed and scared. We were together from end of December until Feb 2nd and I broke up with him bc I felt too much and that was the LONGEST and most emotionally GRUELING week and a half of my LIFE. I went through the five stages of grief at least three times. During that week I asked for him back, we had sex again, and I exploded and told him either we were together or we weren’t bc I wasn’t gonna just be his friend so then we talked again and he asked to try again for real. Trust me when I say this is the most drama I’ve ever had and yet?? If I lost him again I feel like I’d never recover. SO am I a fake INTP? Have any of you ever been in love? What happened? Is it normal to feel crazy and intense? 
7	You're not a fake INTP. It almost never happens to me, but when I get feelings for someone it's crazy intense. And that almost overwhelms me and I have no idea how to deal with it. I've been feeling like that about one of my best friends recently and I have no idea how to deal with the situation because it overwhelms me so much that I'm scared to overwhelm her and everything feels just so unlike me
2	its normal\n\njust tell him how you feel so he can better accommodate your emotional instability (if you trust him with that)\n\nonce you can trust him with your emotional state i imagine youll end up being loads more comfortable around him
1	It's very INTP. We are shit at handling our emotions. So when we get some big ones, it's overwhelming, frightening, and we are unequipped to deal. \n\nIt's that final piece of our stack, the Fe. It's brutal. We have the capacity of a toddler to handle our emotions.\n\nIt will get better hang in there. 
1	Yup this exact thing was what I just went through, never thought of it as an intp thing though. Things will be going amazingly with a guy and if it starts getting serious, I can’t help but run away leaving him super confused. :( 
1	We feel emotions, we just feel them strongly in times of distress or need. Fi lies as our 8th function in our shadow function stack. We have it and we experience it but we tend to experience large outbursts of emotion. You trying to reign in control of whether or not you are with him or not is you trying to re-control situation emotionally. It takes years to train our Fi to be better than it is and all I can suggest for now is that you open your mind to the possibility of seeing your relationship with this guy in more shades of grey rather than black and white. This part has nothing to do with MBTI but rather your maturity level. You broke up with this guy for reasons and you also got back with him for other reasons. Relationships aren't always black and white. You can be friends with benefits or in a casual fling. Things don't have to be so serious for you. Relax a bitt and realize that you have options and this might help you reign in your feelings a bitt more.
5	Did you ever have an existential crisis?	Did you ever have an existential crisis? If so then how did you deal with it?
6	I still have, occasionally. I push them away with my hobbies: playing music, reading, watching stuffs and sometimes doing the homework, LOL. Possibly because the reason of the crisis is the fear of being average. 
5	I have one every day, sometimes multiple times a day. They vary in severity. Most of the time its “what the fuck am I doing with my life. What did I get myself into?” On occasion its like “oh fuck, I’m an etheral being with no beginning or end trapped in a 3 dimensional flesh prison. What did I get myself into?”\n\nI have to take a minute, breathe deep, and then remove myself mentally from whatever is happening that’s overwhelming. Just clear my mind; metaphorically throwing everything off the table just to enjoy having a clean table for a moment. And then I go back to where I was comfortable last, and start there.
3	Sometimes I can't sleep at night because of this. 
2	Just one. It started in the third grade and ended a few months ago. I dealt with it using depression and planning to kill myself. Then I discovered dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and that was the first thing that helped me. Then I received a course of transcrainial magnetic stimulation therapy, and these days, an existential crisis is just not worth thinking about. Until age 45, I thought I could deal with it using my mind and got no help. Dumbest thought I ever had.
2	Once. I fell into nihilism and started a journey on the topic of religions. Nothing really made objective sense until I found Buddhism. Buddhism is a variant of ontic nihilism so there are many similarities. The main contributing factor to suffering is desire and learning to let go and live in the moment is the foundation Buddhism is based on. It takes a lot of research and understanding to get to grips with Buddhism as it's probably one of the most complicated religions. Best place to start off with would be watching some youtube vids on Alan Watts. In short worrying about your existence is a waste of time, just exist. Easier said than done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: This is actually a good question to go and ask on /r/Buddhism they can provide you with much better insight
2	Yes. Along the way I realized the universe doesn't have an answer. There is a counter-argument for EVERY argument. There is no evidence of god existing or not existing. No evidence of us being in a simulation or the real thing. No idea of what to define "real". So I just gave up and started to live my life :)
1	yes, but it always resolves to whatever you want to be next.
1	Yes. Currently, I'm dealing by learning about psychology, learning about myself, learning about nutrition, and trying to find the meaning of consciousness and if it is possible to define an objective morality. So just, you know, fine.
1	it hit me at 27, when i had a job with no career path. \n\nso i started learning new things and kept trying to learn new things. i'm in much better situation now, although i feel a bit complacent.
1	I had a lot and I found the solution in writing. It gave me a relief, relief of telling the problems without actually opening myself up. Sleeping if you can and having hobbies that can distract you is a long term solution.
1	Yup, and it took a very long time to deal with it, in which time I came almost full circle. I stopped believing in the Christian god aged 13, my mother was very religious and applied for the preisthood, so it was all very embarrassing for her that I questioned it so much. I was addicted to the religion category on yahoo answers for years from when I first had computer access at age 20. I would tell people the reasons why a god could not exist, but what I was really talking about was a Christian god, and the gods of any other man-made religion. I'm so ashamed now of  trying to take away peoples beliefs. There are just so many reasons why it cannot be real, and I approached the topic of god being fake from many different angles and thought of some good points.  \n\n\nBut what provoked my existential crisis, was getting into science. I wanted to know how everything fit together. Philosophy, physics and religion all interwarped in one big mass. I realised, for various good reasons that my cognitive bias towards nihilism was unfounded. I had some aha moments where I believed a creator could in fact exist, and that I had overlooked some aspects of what I was researching before. I had looked into the law of attraction a bit, and read a book again. Decided to ask the universe for something completely random, and it came the next morning, . For the longest time it was like I was simultaneously a nihilist and a spiritual person. I believed both and neither, and wrestled with the opposing ideas in my mind, looking for reasons to prove myself wrong about the law of attraction. This cognitive dissonance doesn't sound like much but all the time it was truly head fucking. So many threads and pieces tangled together and I just wanted the problem to be solved, neat and tidy, but that just wasn't going to happen, as the more questions I asked the less I knew. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the past couple of years I haven't questioned my spirituality much, and I feel a lot better without my low level inner torment. I still read a lot of philosophy. Maybe on some level I want to prove myself wrong.   \n\n\nAnyone who is interested in the reasons I think what I do, give me a shout, I didn't want to go on for too long.   \n\n\n&#x200B;
1	I had one where I questioned mortality, I dealt with it 2 ways, I became a bit more religious (still not regular a churchgoer) and the other way was because I realised that the older you get the less attached to life you are so I thought that maybe I won't care about it when I'm on my deathbed
11	How many fellow intp also smoke the devils lettuce	Just curious 
4	I've gotten high. I'm not against it though, and will probably try cannabis when its legalized. But I'd never smoke when you can use edibles which are stronger, don't harm your lungs, and don't smell. There's no reason to smoke. And people who treat getting high like an identity are annoying, and make me want to never do it tbh. 
3	never heard of her
3	Love a bit of Jazz Cabbage
2	Daily requirement.
1	I've done it in edible oil. Maybe it's because of constant anxiety or some shit, but when I do, it allows me to think in surprisingly creative ways I wouldn't be able to otherwise. Also, it absolutely trashes my short term memory while I'm high. That is fun, like having small memory swipes every 5 seconds, very freeing. Makes me wonder if ADHD in itself includes having those memory swipes in a more manageable manner. Haven't looked into it any further.
1	Smoke a couple times a week. Edibles when I can’t go out for a walk for whatever reason (normally the weather)
1	Try the edibles man. It's a pretty intense high with none of the after effects you'd expect from a drug.\n\nJust don't try your first few times alone. 
1	Never tried it. Doubt I would unless I had a good reason.
1	I did it regularly in college 10 years ago. Don’t do it now — but if given the opportunity in a social setting, I’d oblige 
1	I tend to smoke occasionally 
1	Uh huh. Sometimes (every night) it’s nice to turn the 8-core processor in my head into a single core so I can focus on one thing at a time and enjoy it.  \n\n\nAlso, sleeping is nice. I don’t sleep without weed due to crazy brain and some spinal/nerve damage.
1	I use a loose leaf vaporizer for recreational use. I prefer hybrids over indica's but sometimes I will just pound an indica to force myself to relax. I have a lot of problems over-thinking and constant mental stress so for me the devil's lettuce helps me dumb myself down and forces me to stop thinking if anything. Sounds stupid but it forces me to take a break so that my mental state is better overall and I can actually ramp up mental processing when I actually need it instead of having it on all the time.
1	I'm under the influence now and just remembered I have a Reddit account.
1	I was stoned for 10 years strait, sober for 9 months so far do to better employment opportunities and I don't really miss it as much as I thought I would. My memory hasn't recovered like I thought it would, I really feel I've done irreversible damage to my brain.
2	(P)SAT/ACT experiences	I'm currently 14 (freshman in high school), and I just scored 1430 on a practice SAT test that I took yesterday (770 in math)\n\nwould like some of you guys to share your test experiences so i know better what to watch out for (i.e. stupid/ambiguous questions and other biases and general bs)
2	Get the prep books and practice. For math, you obviously have it down, so focus on eliminating mistakes, and you should get a perfect score when it comes time to take it for real.
3	Typical INTP not having anyone to brag their sat score to lol. I was the exact same way. Practice tests are very beneficial- if you go over your mistakes and articulate the exact problem you had with that question. The more attention you give each missed problem, the sharper the learning curve.  
1	Not living in the US. What is it ? What's the average score ?
1	For the ACT, don't take the writing part unless you absolutely have to. There's no point; it's just a waste of 40 minutes and $15.  \nI did the ACT blind and acted as though it were a logic test and it worked very well for me. I ended up with a core score of 34 (holy shit that's a sick rhyme). If there was one thing I would recommend for you to personally study it would be the grammar questions. I'm not saying that your grammar is bad or anything, but unless you explicitly know some grammar rules about the different tenses and moods in English you won't get a perfect score on that part. The most effective way to learn these while also being incredibly productive is to learn a different language.
1	I got took the ACT early in 7th grade, I believe I made a 22.\n\nLater in high school when the time came I bought a practice book and skimmed over it. Made a 29 which I was satisfied with, although my family made me take it again and I made a 32; 35 on the reading portion IIRC.\n\nMany people in my high school made 16-22 and were satisfied with it, made me feel bad talking about my own score since the test just seemed easy to me
1	I got a 32 on acts. Practice. Check out the exam books and practice. The really look at the questions you got wrong and understand how the question was worded, did that contribute, if it was a vocabulary thing, if it was you not knowing a concept. If you don’t know the concept then go research it.
1	You don't even want to know my SAT score.\nMostly because I don't remember them.\nBut they were bad.\nReal bad.\n\nWe had a bathroom with 1 stall and 1 urninal and a shitton of people using it.\nThe entire time I couldn't take a piss.

18	The case for emotion	It sometimes comes up here is that emotion is something awful, something we need to overcome or something people of this personality type barely experience at all. The reality is, in my opinion:\n\n* Emotions are responsible for the best and worst parts of life. They are what makes us inherently human. What separates us from AI (at least for now) is our ability to empathize. I can enjoy films about people who are nothing like me is because at least some of the characters will express fear, anger, sadness, joy, that we can both experience is fundamentally the same.\n* All people (except sociopaths/psychopaths I suppose) experience and express emotions. You do too, whether you think you do or not. Psychology/communications research is especially supportive of this one. When experiencing an emotion, you have two options - feel the emotion or suppress it. Feelings that you acknowledge will pass, suppressed ones will be expressed later passive-aggressively or in a big blow-up.\n* Some people express suppressed emotions through other emotions that are easier to feel. Suppressed sadness is often expressed through anger or laughter.\n* If you want to have any impact on the world, you'll have to understand emotion because that it is fundamentally what drives and motivates people. No one in the workforce will care how smart your ideas are if you can't work with people in social settings, as that's how work gets done. You have to be extremely lucky maybe to find a high-paying job that doesn't require networking.\n* Circlejerking about logic > emotion obsessively is a sign of great emotional insecurity about yourself.\n\nThis is what I wish I could've told teenage me.
13	OK, let's get a few things straight. Emotions are the product of the limbic system, which consists of parts of the brain that we cannot control. It part of the autonomous or automatic brain. INTPs have the same limbic system as anyone else. The idea that we have fewer or different emotions than other people is mostly a juvenile fiction.\n\nThe difference is that particularly young INTPs develop their intellectual abilities early and in many cases before we develop emotional intelligence. As a result we tend when young to try to process emotions through our rational thinking. That is kind I'd like identifying colors by touch.\n\nAt the same time, our rational minds can be helpful in reacting to emotions. We can identify and label our emotions: "I am very angry." We can see emotions as something that is happening to us, but is not us. When we are angry, we can choose to hit or to refrain from hitting. As you said denying or suppressing your anger will only cause you to lose control of your actions.\n\nFor some reason, INTPs seem prone to insist on trying to control their emotions with thinking. We control so many things so well with thinking that it is a natural response. Rational thinking leads to right or wrong answers, but emotions cannot be right or wrong. They just are. That is why we see so many teenage INTPs making pronouncements about to role and value of emotions. We do not like things that cannot be mastered with thinking.\n\nI am 54 and when I was growing up, I knew none of this. I had no role models and felt like a one-off mistake. Young people today are so fortunate to have resources like this place to get some perspective and know they do in fact belong here.\n\nThat is not to say that older INTPs have the answers. We don't. But we do have our experiences, and we have compassion and empathy. We understand the pain that others express here because we lived it. We also can say from experience that things can get better, a lot better. But each person must find his or her own path.
2	I feel like emotions are cool but they become unnecessary when shit isn’t getting done. I’m still a teenager so I’m a dumb fuck but I want to live in a world completely inhabited by professionals where, no matter how they felt inside, they did what needed to be done. 
2	When a hyperlogical person unlocks their emotional side, they effectively supercharge their intellectual capabilities. Everything from creating and achieving goals to forcing your will on the world becomes easier. \n\nThis is if you use your emotions as a tool in tandem with your intuition as opposed to suppressing it or letting it control you.\n\nWether you want to enhance your personality, sell like the Wolf of Wallstreet, or become a machine like David Goggins, emotions are required.\n
2	emotions are either a big flaw or big blessing to human kind. (i leave it up to the reader to figure out why)\n\nlogic>emotions, but the trick i learned is how to recognize and solve problems that produce meaningless results when logically analyzed (thank goodness ive learned to appreciate emotions for what they are, im 14, and things could have gone/could be a lot rougher had i not)
1	Word. I'll add to that the psychological concept of reframing, which a way to resolve emotional issues, not suppressing them. So, basically, you first identify your emotions honestly, what hurts you, logical or not! Then, after understanding it you can use cognition to reframe the issue and reduce the emotional response. So, you see that a person treated you badly at work. Then you recognize how that makes you feel (otherwise you would be playing fucking fortnite) and, finally, you change the context of the issue with cognition. So, you think of a reason why your coworker would do that. Maybe you remember his wife was treating him badly, and before he was always nice, so maybe he hit a breaking point. Then you may recognize he was like that to other co-workers as well, not just you. Also, you might even go philosophical and think of determinism, and how he was probably as much a victim of the situation as you were.\n\nYou do have to be aware of your emotions first though, otherwise how do you know what to aim at? YMMV, but I wanted to add this bit to the mix.
1	I don’t hate my emotions or think I am lacking in them. I just wish I could get a better handle on them, especially my anger. I feel like my emotions don’t drive me but sometimes will just end me up in sticky situations or cause me to say something I don’t mean to. 
1	>Emotions are responsible for the best and worst parts of life. \n\nObviously, this is a subjective value judgment.\n\n>[Emotions] are what makes us inherently human. \n\nHow so? Would someone with a disorder that doesn't experience emotions not be human? Non-human animals have emotions. Doesn't that mean emotions are what makes us inherently animals? \n\n>What separates us from AI (at least for now) is our ability to empathize. \n\nAgain, other animals also have empathy. And many humans don't. And what happens when AI has empathy?\n\n>I can enjoy films about people who are nothing like me is because at least some of the characters will express fear, anger, sadness, joy, that we can both experience is fundamentally the same.\n\nThe same can be said of pain. You can empathize with people in films who are in pain because you have experienced it; does that make your pain inherently good?
0	As a psychopathic person, i met few INTPs and they don't differ emotionally from other types.  \n\n\nThe INTPs jerk each other off thinking they are very little emotions and they are all logical but the truth is that all of them are just like any other average nerd.
0	The purpose of emotions is motivation. Reward seeking and adversity avoidance. Rationality is a myth. Rationality is bullshit. Rationality is the lie and sickness at the heart of the self destructive western culture. Feel that inside of you when I say that? That's emotion. Rationality itself is irrational and merely mass prejudice. David Hume is the only fucking philosopher in the pathetic western tradition to have figured this out and be honest about it. The rest plough on as if humans are rational agents and produce useless philosophy. Eastern philosophy is more realistic. 
3	Actual description of people in this subreddit.	
2	If I say I upvoted this/laughed, does that make me self aware?\n\nThis is true though. There is a lot of insecurity on this sub masquerading as "iamverysmart" material. But there's some good stuff too (haven't been around in awhile to see it, but it has happened). A lot of the stuff around here caters to people trying to figure themselves out, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, so long as they're aiming for improvement/being aware that there are improvements to be made.\n\nI think there are also a lot of insecure mistypes who end up here.
198	I like you guys.	I don’t know why every month I end up here telling things like these to you, but as it is important, I have the need to tell you that you’re more important than what you think. I never had a close INTP friend, and even so, I can see how big is your potential if you just put a bit of effort on it. And I’m not talking about potential with science, maths, or phylosophy, no. I’m talking about your kindness, your personal life and your practical resolutions on problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou’re awesome. The kindness I saw in INTPs is something I didn’t feel in any other type. It is good to be with you because I don’t feel personally attacked or criticized. I had some of the most interesting conversations with INTPs throught Youtube, Reddit, and Facebook. It’s like you have the gift to say true, objetive and useful things in a cool and mild manner. You can be really meaningful people and very good to have conversations if you just loose your fear to screw the situation and allow yourselves to just be a bit irrational, dreamy and forget nihilism for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’d like to have that kind of useful, philosophycal and meaningful relationship with someone in real life, or creating music or something with an INTP friend but we are too much inside of our own homes to meet each other in real life, thought. I like the way you have to aproximate to music theory, drawing, programming, and everything. It could be frustrating to not have someone that understands you, but I know how it feels, and I already know that if you share more of your skills or ideas, even although there will be people that will laugh at you, gradually you will feel less alone, and you will feel a bit more correct in this world and inside yourselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I want to say that I’m not saying this in a subjetive, personal, or over emotional manner because I don’t know any close INTP in real life. Look at you as what you can be, what you’re meant to be. Try to see how necessary for this world is that you reach the goal of being the true yourselves and do what you like to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’m crying what’s going on I am never able to write as much.
98	y-you too

It could be frustrating to not have someone that understands you, but I know how it feels, and I already know that if you share more of your skills or ideas, even although there will be people that will laugh at you, gradually you will feel less alone, and you will feel a bit more correct in this world and inside yourselves.\n\nI would love to too, to be honest. I don't really care about what type is on the other end, and experimenting with new people is always something fun, although it can be a difficult enterprise. I've tried to think of ways to feel less lonely, to meet with new people, so if you want to send a message my way I'll be happy to reply, even if I have no idea what I'd expect in it \^\^.\n\nposts like this always warm my heart, and I hope it's not a selfish or narcissist thing to say, as I mean more in a general *people enjoying each other's company* way.\n\nhave a fun time doing whatever you're doing
12	My best friend is an INTP. You guys are aight. ;) (I'm an ENTP)
11	I love you too
8	You said exactly what my ISFJ friend told me yesterday. Thank you so much. It means a lot.
6	I have no idea how what I want to be, is anything necessary for the world. 
5	This is so cute 😁❤
6	> Try to see how necessary for this world is that you reach the goal of being the true yourselves and do what you like to do.\n\nThis is true for every person regardless of Type.  There's only one of you, and the rest of us are counting on you to be the best you you can.
4	Thank you! It means a lot. Peace!
5	I thought of several different reply’s, some were very clever. But I wrote this, instead. 
3	Most of this is what I think of an ISFP that I'm acquainted with - especially that part about having potential. 
3	Oh I would like to play music with you too :(\nBut we can chat instead, so drop a line if you want to \n\nAnd thank you for reminding us (well, at least me personally) of this; just today I was thinking about what I can provide to people. It’s sort of I know that I have to do that, but not just out of blind selflessness: it takes roots in some personal reasons as well. Making people happy makes me happy as well. I don’t want to sound as if I have a too high opinion on myself though. \n\nlt’s just if I’m in this world, why not make other people’s lives better?
2	couldn't read the whole thing but thanks i guess 
2	Awe, you're awesome too.
2	Interesting.  Our function stacks are ~~almost~~ perfect opposites.  I wonder if that makes some sort of counter-intuitive synergy?\n\nAre you sure you're not just looking at us as a group of misunderstood people who need taking care of?  Who need, but don't get, love?  Because we're not that.  At all.\n\nEdit: As usual after getting out of my though-project and reading the rest of your post, I see my second comment doesn't relate at all.
2	Uh?\n\nI’m going to completely disregard that you left me out of that entire speech of yours...\n\nI’m going to presume that you just couldn’t write about me because your fingers were fatigued and you knew you wouldn’t have time to write something that would be 10x as long as this post.\n\nI completely understand my dear friendo!\n🙌
2	You stay awesome my ISFP friend. You're the most genuine type in many ways, especially to those who you're closest to. I respect your fascinating mix of passions that you can refine and perfect over time. 
2	The internet is real life. You have thousands of us here to consult on demand! 
2	Dang, this is what I needed right now.  Thank you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt reminds me of this bit of wisdom: Never underestimate the power of a kind word.\n\nI was at work one day, having the worst day ever, wondering why I was even trying because nothing I do is good enough.  But out of nowhere, a co-worker told me "I think you're doing a good job, man", and walked off.  My gosh, it brought a tear to my eye.  \n\nIt's easy to not say something nice to people, because it seems so insignificant.  But it's very powerful, and I forget that way too much.

8	Socializing regularly and being good at it doesn't actually prevent loneliness?	I was talking to my therapist about loneliness and she said it results from not feeling connected. At the moment I'm focusing on work and fitness and eating, which is more things than I've ever been able to responsibly and sustainable juggle, hence I've demoted social interaction to a lower priority need. I do feel lonely and less connected with this current routine, though it's not the crippling sort of loneliness and I'm at least practicing to acknowledge and accept it rather than hide from it. Moreover, I've been getting better at socializing at work; slowly tuning in to how each person banters, finding the right time to weave personal discussions during work, and I even gathered everyone around and did a short and wholesome speech for Valentine's Day. I'm proud of the fact that I'm making progress and the fruits of my labor are that I'm starting to really enjoy the things that I used to struggle with; banter, small talk, smiling, listening, and a lot of other "small things".\n\nTo be clear, I don't socialize often enough (maybe twice every three weeks on average) and I'm very far from being socially adept (as well as having social anxiety and being awkward and other things). I have wanted to work on improving my social skills for while but for the time being I just feel that there are far more important breakthroughs I should aim for in improving my fitness from bad to average. But my point is, I'm starting to sense that even if I gained those social skills I want, the ability to be charming and talk to anyone, that might not help much in terms of loneliness. Over the years I've seen multiple INTPs here post that they became extremely adept at social skills and being charming but that their charming persona they had at work was never intended to show their true selves and they had no interest in forming true connections at work. While work/personal life separation makes sense, these INTPs also said that they basically did their own thing, weren't that interested in people, and rarely ever met anyone who they would let into their personal life even though many probably were interested. I don't quite relate to that because I do think I am interested in people, and I'm wondering why those charming INTPs seem perfectly content while not feeling connected if that's what leads to loneliness?\n\nGoing back to the main topic, I'm finding that my degree of enjoyment of social activities doesn't have much to do with whether I feel lonely or not. Having a week full of enjoyable interactions and a fair share of emotional bonding/connections doesn't mean I won't feel lonely in between either. I can't pinpoint why but part of me is urging me that creating art or music will make me feel less lonely and more connected, even if I don't end up sharing that stuff with anyone. I'm also aware that there are a ton of ideas and thoughts and stories and jokes I would really like to share but still haven't found the right channels for. I have close friends that I can share anything with, but I feel that I shouldn't overwhelm them in terms of volume (plus I know their responsiveness drops in that case so it's not satisfying). So I guess I feel a great lack in creative and intellectual outlets as though I only get to share a fraction of the things I want to. I suppose that either I want more attention and validation, or I want what I'm getting to be "enough" for me (and I often wonder why it isn't enough when from a logical/distant perspective it seems it could be).
3	Loneliness is indeed about the perceived (felt) quality of your social circle. "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769562/" You can be alone and feel better than if totally surrounded by "friends" that don't fullfill your needs. So it could be a deficiency in your ability to connect that you have yet to identify, I guess. But it might as well be that you don't have yet what you need from your social circle. If people are truly not in your "level" in some aspects, that sounds reasonable. I do think a lot of INTPS can identify with both possible explanations.\n\nAnyway, you say you have greatly improved your ability to socialize and that people like you. My bet, then, is that the second explanation may play a bigger part. I personally identify a lot with that. I might be wrong, though, but it is honestly intuitive that having interests, wants and maybe abilities that differ greatly from others you know could leave us stranded, even with lots of friends.
2	I often feel lonely, because I don't find people sharing my views, my personality, or when they're douchebags. Reading stuff here on INTP subreddit, I feel soooo much more connected :)
1	There's a Harvard grant experiment currently 80years ongoing. \n\nWhat they have gathered is that warm of the relationship among people is a better indicator of wealth and happiness. \n\nDon't really know if this helps. Just wanted to tell someone about trivia knowledge i learnt
1	So you're single? That's the trouble mate. I always feel lonely when I'm not in a relationship. Unfortunatly, I don't have a good record of staying in a relationship or keeping friendships either.
2	Being a dumb intp	Look i have been an intp all my life and man i'm dumb at everything. Everytime there is a math equations on the board i cant even solve it and man i'm sick of being dumb and i need help. I even cant solve a dispute amongst my friends and heck now i dont even have any friends because i'm too distant and private with everyone. Right now i need some help because i cant understand the world around me and i cant understand myself. I need help
4	Have you always had problems with school work?  Is it a concentration issue, a focus issue, a memory issue?  You may just learn differently, in which case you should get some help to figure out how you learn best.  Conditions such as ADHD can make school work harder - it is worth looking into.\n\nSolving disputes is another issue entirely.  I am not sure that it is up to you to solve people's problems for them, so do not beat yourself up about that.  Concentrate on getting help for the issues that are within your control.  Don't let it cause long term damage to your self esteem.
6	accept your fate, weak one
2	Well I mean math or school in general is more about memorization and spitting out info than actually learning. Unless you're good at memorizing crap on the fly you're not gonna do well in school, even if you're damn Elon Musk. 
2	[https://www.khanacademy.org/](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
2	Could be a number of reasons. I'm kinda like that and sometimes come off looking like the smart one in the room that can't solve simple problems lol. I have found that I don't do so well at math unless there's a reason to solve the problem (though I'm 6 college hours short of a bachelor's in math). I learn it better when its applied. I I've also learned through dealing with my son's learning issues that I may have had the following disability all along.\n\n[http://www.ldonline.org/article/Dyscalculia](http://www.ldonline.org/article/Dyscalculia)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIronically I excel at a field where this disability probably keeps one hand tied behind my back. But yea ask me even a simple addition or subtraction problem and I may struggle to answer it on the spot.\n\n&#x200B;
1	you'll be fine
1	So my absolute favourite quote of all time is this one:\n\n"If you judge a goldfish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid."\n\nYou're not stupid, you're just a fish out of water. I spent large wadges of my life lamenting what I couldn't do and focusing on my weaknesses. It was only when I found people that encouraged me to focus on my strengths that I really blossomed as a person.\n\nAnd FYI I SUCKED at math all through school and now I'm using formulas for research. Don't get discouraged. 
1	I've always thought of it this way.\n\n"For someone who's allegedly so smart, I sure am fucking stupid."
-1	Ignorance is bliss, embrace it :)
3	Do you have a method that helps bridge your detachment from everyone else?	I actually test as an infp, but I don’t feel as though my idealism hinders my appreciation for intellectual competence or truth.\n\nPersonally, when I found out about the Myers-Briggs personality types I didn’t buy into the one I tested as because the description of INFP’s makes them sound so naive.\n\nI did, however, notice that INTP’s share quite a few similar traits (as to be expected from introverts) including detachment. \n\nI just wondered how you guys keep up with the people around you (if you bother) because though my personal philosophy aligns with not giving a shit, I’ve never had a “best friend” and since I’m 18 years old I thinks it’s time to man up and at least try.
7	A few thoughts. Although I reliably test as very INTP, I consider the people here to be my people. I understand them, which is amazing, and many of them seem to understand me, which leaves me gobsmacked. I was 45 when I found this place, and I had long given up on having people, let alone finding them. \n\nAs for finding friends, the fact that your cognitive abilities developed faster than your emotional abilities may make social interaction at first. Things will balance out. Your brain will not even be fully developed until age 25.
4	You never stop feeling detached. I have some very good friends, but they'll never understand me. What matters is that we can have both intellectual and pointless discussions. We can waste time and make our conversations valuable. With another person, that's pretty much all you can ask for. Don't try to find someone who understands you, just find someone you like enough to see sometimes.
3	It's a willful detachment for me. I spent too many of my teenage years worrying about not having a best friend or being part of a clique because I thought there was something wrong with me if I didn't. Almost as soon as I got away from high school I realized that that's not something I need, or even want. I can't force or fake relationships even if I wanted to, anyway. So, I usually let people gravitate to me until one day I realize I have a new friend. Just people that happen to be where I happen to be oftentimes, and we genuinely get along. Class friends, gym friends, work friends, yoga friends, etc. That works for me because I have a fairly low socialization quota, so just seeing my friends as I see them really is enough for me. I don't feel the need to get into every aspect of someone's life to consider them a friend. I don't think that friendships necessarily need to be incredibly deep and personal to be authentic, either. Most of my mine are naturally more intellectual and less emotional because that's just how I am as a person. Plus I need to allocate all my emotional reserves for dating. \n\nDon't worry about "keeping up" with other people around you. I'm so sorry, but I'm going to have to give you the dreaded 'just be yourself' advice. Do you, do the things you like to do, and somewhere along the way you'll bump into likeminded people. That's the only way to form authentic relationships with anyone. 
3	I am terrible at making friends irl, but online friends can be found in chatrooms, and groups like this one especially if you have an interest in the subject. \n\nMy INFP daughter has made a lot of online friends over the years through gaming.
2	No.  No method here.  My walls have walls.  I'm currently trying to make a friend rn though, incidentally the first friend I've tried to make independently since junior high, I think.  I feel like she thinks I think she's a big thought project for me (and tbh, she kind of is, but I can't help it, I've not done this for years and this is all new and fascinating to me), so the road thus far has been wrought with misunderstandings, apologies, and miscommunications, and damned if I don't think this is a big risk that's likely to blow up in my face at some point, but she's an intj and I think her anxieties about the whole thing just might rival mine.  We've already had some pretty wild convos, which is rad for a month in.  \n\nI already feel myself withdrawing, though, like there's all this risk and work involved in making a friend and you just can't protect your heart enough sometimes, but the payoff might be worth it.  I'm trying to bank on that and persevere, and I think she is too, which means a lot.  \n\nBottom line, start now so you don't find yourself in your 30s with no idea how to actually F.

14	> If an INTP guy asks a girl out for coffee, he likes you.\n\nDo all INTP guys asking a girl out for coffee like *me*? Isn't it a pity, I'm not attracted to guys, but thanks anyways!
5	But not necessarily likes them in a romantic/sexual way. The INTP guy might find the girl interesting as a person and want a deeper understanding of how they function. 
3	If an INTP guy asks a girl out for coffee, he likes coffee 🤔

1	Too bad im realistic or pessimistic to try that out. Who knows if shes one of those raging feminist and will end up yelling at you because of the typical "im a strong independent woman, i dont need any man to buy me anything"
1	Advice on feelings for a friend	I need some advice from fellow INTPs who have been in a situation where they developed feelings for a female friend.\n\nI'm currently in my early twenties. So I have been very close with this girl ever since I met her maybe 5 months ago. I think she is ENFP. We just clicked instantaneously, saw each other almost every day and bar three weeks in which I was out of the country I think we have only not texted for a day or two since then. We still texted while I was out of the country but just less often. Which is absolutely ludicrous because I'm a horrid texter. I think I'm ignoring a few people right now because I'm lazy. I'm not even sure.\n\nAt some point I developed serious feelings for her, but I was always over-analyzing so I could never make up my mind whether she liked me or not. This continued through months of spending time with her, watching movies alone at my apartment, walking in the park with her, even visiting her family, drinking wine with her, sharing personal things etc. It still somehow always felt like I didn't have enough datapoints to draw any logical conclusion over whether she likes me or not even though literally everything in the world pointed to it. Ti can be a bitch.\n\nIn hindsight I overanalyzed the hell out of the situation and I should have just made my move. But the thing is since maybe a month ago things have been different. Everything seems the same on the surface, but her texts are shorter and less regular and if I want to make plans to hang out alone she has some excuse. She still sometimes tries to make plans with me but always just invites me in a group context.  It's as if she used to be into me and then decided to move on.  But the fact that she is different towards me now has finally led me to conclude that she surely had to be into me before so now I want to salvage the situation. But I'm panicking because I can't set up a situation where it would be appropriate to talk this over with her, I just see her in class everyday or in groups when we hang out.\n\nWhat should I do? I know I'm hopeless, I'm just really INTP-ing this situation out.\n\nWhen I'm panicking like this Fe just wants to take over and just declare my feelings for her when I see her next time on campus after class but I feel as if that would be super weird and overwhelm her at any point, especially now. It's as if I either can't get myself to make any move or I have to stop myself from being a desperate mess. Idk what to do. Pls help.
5	Well, if she's withdrawing from you anyway, do you really have anything to lose by just bluntly telling her that you caught feelings for her, and asking if it's reciprocated? The way I see it, in the worst case scenario, you lose nothing, and in the best case scenario, you gain something.\n\nJust text her that you want to meet her in person somewhere, maybe at a coffee shop, and proceed from there?
2	Confess your feelings, get rejected, and then lose your feelings more easily by realizing they're futile.
1	Text or call her and say "You know I USED to like you right?". She'll either say "Oh I'm sorry I didn't feel that way" or "what do you mean used to". If the latter occurs the ice will be broken and she may be interested in exploring the feelings that she may have thought weren't mutual. Kinda screwed that you have to go through this step just to end up in a long term relationship where the joy is in being the intimate friends you were in the first place.
1	You should call her on the phone or speak to her in person. Tell her that you are dumb and that you have had deep romantic feelings for her for a long time but we're afraid to express them, because you werent sure how she felt and now it seems she is distancing herself from you and apologize.  \n\nsomething like, "Hi, Im so dumb. I have a lot of romantic feelings for you, but ive been afraid to say anything because i couldn't tell if you felt the same way. It seems like you are distancing yourself from me now. I feel like you may have had feelings for me, and I'm so sorry if I hurt you."   \n\nAnother intro would be, "Hi, are you mad at me?"   then go into the 'I'm so dumb" depending on her answer.\n\nYou have nothing to lose at this point. If she goes for it arrange to meet in person and ask if you can kiss her and do it. 
1	Yeah man, I think you already know where you went wrong. \n\nHanging out with and talking to someone every day is an INSANELY high amount of contact to not make a move or be honest with your interest and intentions. \n\nDon’t beat yourself up over it. We mess up so that we learn. Next time, don’t wait so long!
2	ENFP Male Interviewing INTP Male Andreas Borgaard - Ti-Si - SB/P(C) MM	
2	How do you stay organized and get things done?	Or should I say, *get* organized? \n\nI tried Bullet journals but it's hard to stay consistent. I have no artistic sense and even simple binder paper planners end up becoming disorganized, messy and bloated.
1	I use google calendar a lot. Unfortunately I also ignore some of the less urgent reminders.
1	I have 4 ways that all do different things:\n\n\-List on my PC/laptop (which im on all the time)\n\n\-Calendar (can be physical or on a device)\n\n\-White board\n\n\-Phone reminders\n\nThe list on my PC is, well, a list. Things to do but not needed NOW. Also I keep a list of things I need to get. Ill just check it every once and awhile to make sure something didnt get skipped or whatever. If im bored ill check it and see what I feel like doing or need to do. Literally some things thats been on there for months but they're not urgent enough for me to prioritize them, but they need to get done sometime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I have the calendar. Dates and crap go on here. Appointments, places to be, work times, picking someone up at X this day, ext. Ill check it daily or every few.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I have the white board. I place it in the middle of the house where you cant miss it no matter where you go. I write things down that need done the current day. Give this person X dollars, go here today at X, appointment at X, do this today, ect.\n\nIll also put information to the sides that I need to remember or write down daily, such as how many times X has driven me somewhere so I can pay them. Every day ill walk by it and see that and remember if I need to add another tally to the count or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the phone reminders its anything of thy' above that I think about or remember while im on the go. Ill stick it in my phone and then later on in the day it'l ring the hell out of itself, ill see the reminder, and then move that task to its appropriate place to remember or do it in that moment if its that critical.
1	I don't know what area of life you need to get organized with, but my INTP finds daily list-making helpful. We also have a chalkboard in our kitchen for scribbling random notes. Having a partner to hold you accountable has also been helpful. (This goes both ways, he does this for me as much as I do for him.)
1	Have researched this a lot and am currently implementing it (go me!)\n\nI have a life coach, I realised how bad I am with doing anything with no deadline. People training to be life coaches offer free sessions, they need to do these as part of their course. I tried two who were no good but hit gold with my third one, who I've been using for about 6 weeks now. The main reason I wanted her was accountability and deadlines, which is working. A lot of the time I will do things on my list she's given me the day I speak to her. She helps me with my overwhelm, makes everything more simple and points things out that I would never have thought of.\n\nDo everything in one go. We are hyperfocused. If you need to sort your home out, do it all at once. Get rid of every single thing that isn't nessacary, because as you will know, stuff just gets messed up and we don't care, so the less stuff you have to get messed up, the less mess there will be. Then get a cleaner once a week, not because you are incapable of doing yourself, but as a tidying up deadline. You will probably find yourself tidying just before they come over.\n\nCreate a morning routine. I knew I can create a small routine, of cleaning the bath, having a bath, brushing my teeth and hair. That is normal and natural for me, so I told myself I can make other routines normal and natural for me. Every morning I write a gratitude list of 5 things (put me in a positive frame of mind as depression is a motivation killer and procrastination enhancer) and the reasons why I'm grateful, and I do a to-do list for the day. More importantly than 'to-do', I ask myself WHY TO? for every item on the list. Then I visualise myself doing it as your brain cannot tell the difference between visualising and doing, so if my brain already beleives I've done  it once, it will believe I can do it 'again' (read psycho-cybernetics). After doing crazy long to-do lists, I now limit myself to three items to avoid overwhelm. On days where I cannot be bothered, or am busy, the list is ridiculously small things, but the important part is that I build trust and faith in myself by actually doing them.\n\nTake dopamine supplements (L-Lysine) each morning, they really make so much of a difference in improving focus, and more importantly they give you the OOMPH that you need to get things done. This should be number one on the list, not all the way down here. It makes you move! [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130110094415.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130110094415.htm)\n\nOn Sundays I do all my washing, and put 7 outfits including underwear on hangers for the next week. I also write down everything on my phone calendar onto a weekly planner whiteboard .\n\nRead The Five Second rule by Mel Robbins, it's a lazy persons guide to motivation.\n\nGetting up in the morning is hard for me when I have no reason to be up, but I've made myself do it. I do over 10 different things to help me get up in the mornings, because getting up late can kill the positive effects of all the above, and make you have a crapper life in general. I have my kettle on timer in my bedroom and a cup with coffee sugar and milk in it next to it. I have three alarms on my phone which have diffent tone, each goes off three times, and by the end all the alarms are overlapping each other in a cachopany, then if I'm still not up I have an annoying alarm clock in the downstairs hallway. I take 6mg melatonin every evening, drink lots of fizzy drink at night so my bladder gets me up, plus my ex mother in law calls me on Mo Tu We and Fri mornings to make sure I'm up.\n\nOn top of ALL of this, I have created a new fb page with my very closest friends on it, where I post my gratitude diary and to-do list in the morning, plus take photos of my white board planner, put up screenshots of my online courses and notes from my class. My life hit a rock bottom last year, I want to prove to them I am doing all I can to be a better person.\n\nI am so much happier knowing I'm an INTP, I know my weaknesses, and I know how to overcome them, and the main way is deadlines and accountability, and routines as well. Soon it will be second nature, some things already are like my gratitude diary and supplements, I don't even think about doing them. Of course I'm worried I'll slip back into disorganisation, but I have so much accountability now, it would be very hard to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

If that's a good enough reason for me, I do what I can to stay the course even if I'm not having a good time or I feel like I wanna stop.
1	You need to break it down into manageable chunks. Set smaller goals that contribute to the bigger picture and achieve them one at a time. This is how I tackle problems at work, but keep in mind that I don't have a choice for completing larger development goals.
1	You're in the wrong subreddit my friend :(
0	Hiya wanna join a discord?	Hello, Im a depressed entp who is probably recovering from depresion but im becoming an introvert, and Im severly bored with life so who wants to join a discord!
3	Put the link...and I will
2	Just a bitt of perspective but you don't become introverted when you're depressed and magically become INTP cuz of it. You're literally just a depressed ENTP; classified as unhealthy. You could also be looping. ENTP's are also considered one of the most introverted extroverted types so draw from that what you will.
1	Been there. Done that. No thanks..

8	Assert yourself and stop being a beta cuck. Slap that alpha chad in the face with your salami and go git that stacey.
5	Talk to them like you talk to yourself
3	This is such a dumb question you weak fuck.  See what I did there?
1	Are you looking for pointers?
1	Just say what you think ? 
1	You have to possess self confidence, initially.
1	Always be honest with them.
1	Gain the confidence to be harsh with people. A lot of people tend to mess this up and get it all confused, when in reality, you already know how to be harsh with people, you just need the confidence to actually do it
1	What do you need to say?  Are you trying to define boundaries with them?

3	CHAOS BABY, IT’s ALL ABOUT THE CHAOOOOSSSSS..
1	Agreed

2	Are INTPs well wired for learning a foreign language	We tend not to be natural musicians. Of course, we can 'think' our way to some degree of competency, but it's generally a feeler's game. I get the feeling language acquisition is, in some ways, similar.\n\nIn my experience, natural language learners tend not to 'think', and will often neglect learning to read simply because they can. Furthermore, INTPs tend not to have the confidence to throw themselves into conversations or to immerse themselves in new environments. This is important when learning a language and the common gobshite is at an advantage here.\n\nI can speak and read Chinese to decent level. It took many years of hard work though. It never ever felt easy.\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts and experiences.\n\n&#x200B;
6	I would argue the opposite. INTPs are inherently good at both languages and music, not great, but good. Order from chaos is our forté, a thing that is essential for learning both music and languages. Sure our lackluster (Fe)eling *might* hinder us in the *expression,* but in creation and learning we're pretty decent. \n\nImmersing oneself in new environment doesn't necessarily mean packing your bag and going to Germany to socialize  in order to learn the language. Another kind of immersion is to go to Der Spiegels website and read the news, putting on german subtitles when you watch netflix, hanging out in a german speaking discord, playing german servers on an online game - stuff that I can see INTPs doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearning a new language is never easy, but INTPs are well endowed to do it. In fact INTPs are one of the types most likely to be bilingual.
2	Hard for me to see what INTP has to do with music or languages. I learned 5 languages, and although Russian was a challenge at first, I enjoyed it. Came naturally to me.\n\nNo idea why music would be different for us. Music is so deeply embedded in human history that it makes no sense to me for a group to dealt out.\n\nI think that you are making more of INTP than there is. We develop intellectual abilities earlier than some others, but ours are not better or different. Every type is equally capable of thinking and even genius.\n\nWe also tend to develop emotional abilities later than some others. But in the end, we can and usually do fully develop those abilities. \n\nYou seem to be defining INTP with reference to a specific age or phase. Young INTPs tend to think that they know who they are and have arrived. I have been thousands of people along the way and expect to be thousands more before I die. I do not know who I am, but instead am always discovering who I am becoming. So INTPs are this way or that way makes no sense to me.
2	INTP and natural musician here. Self taught vocalist and guitarist. I've always downplayed my gifts but I'm well aware of them.  I pick up new languages easier than most I know. Not sure if it's because "I'm wired" a certain way or if it's because I genuinely enjoy learning new ways of expression. \n\nMusic btw is how I first learned to express emotion.\n
1	Many software developers are INTPs. Computer languages are great for us because the languages are designed to fit the rules without the myriad of exceptions that find their way into spoken languages. 
1	Not answering your initial question here but thought this was a relevant input. At the start when you say we tend not to be natural musicians, I find this quite interesting, when you compare learning an instrument to learning a language I find that an instrument has a different learning curve to a language, I am an intp drummer and fell like the curve was steeper at the start, as in I was getting better and learning the basis of how the instrument works and how beats go etc. Than I am now, I still learn things now but not anything much new, just more complex stuff which relates to the basis that I already know, whereas I feel a language would have a more consistent curve, with the exception of grammar, which when you get the grip of can apply to most of the language.
1	I've learned French, am learning Russian, and would like to learn Turkish in the future, and maybe one more after that but I haven't decided which language it will be. I think out of all the types, the INTP is probably one of the best at learning languages. Si is very good at memory, and Ne is good for wanting to explore new environments, as you put it. Chinese is from what I hear a pretty hard language to read especially, so I would expect it to take a long time. If the common gobshite was better at it, why are pretty much no one from monolingual countries bilingual. It's going to take a lot of time no matter what. Having conversations really isn't as important as listening, and with all the material accessible through the internet, it's pretty easy to do without talking much, though eventually it needs to be done a bit. \n\nAnd as for programming languages, since someone brought them up, they aren't languages, just commands given to a machine, that's all. Not comparable in any way, shape or form, whatsoever.\n\nTl;dr: Learning a language is always hard but INTPs are good at it, ""if it's interesting to them"", because of Si, which is good for memory and sticking with something for a long time, and Ne, which is curious.   
1	I'm a proficient multi instrumentalist. I would be capable of learning other languages both I've never found one I cared enough about to hold my interest and get into. I don't have interest in anything I can't immediately play with.
1	Not sure if well wired. Probably not.. but very interesting in doing so, of that im sure! Want to learn russian and japanese
1	This is anecdotal, but I am pretty good with language learning. I really like the language learning process and am pretty consistently studying one facet of a language of some sort, or just linguistics in general. 
1	I want to learn another language.  My favorites are Russian and German.  Ive learned how to read Russian, and picked up some words, and German just comes naturally to me.  It's so beautiful, and easy to me.\n\nBut, being in the southern US, Spanish is far more useful.  And im going to have to be forced to learn Spanish in college.  But I don't really like Spanish, so it's harder for me to learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts another case of Want vs Must.  I WANT to learn German, but I first MUST learn Spanish.\n\nI WANT to read these certain books, but I cant because right now I MUST read my college books.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  But I am the most musically illiterate person I know.  Ive tried to learn how music works, learn to read it, learn to play instruments, and its about as difficult as Algebra for me (VERY DIFFICULT).
1	I don't think we are bad at music, I think it is raw talent that isn't related to that. This is kind of an arrogant example but I got the absolute ear thing, I can tune without mistakes easily and I don't think this is just me. I know another INTP friend who completely sucks at this but excels at drawing which I am really bad at which I think further implies to the talent part.\n\nFor language, I think you are right to a degree, because another INTP friend of mine knew 3 languages by 10th grade and I had English close to the level I have right now.
1	I learned to speak English fluently in 4 months so maybe we are good at learning languages or it could just be me or it could be because I was only like 7 so i learned fast, then again I have dyspraxia so the age doesn't really matter in my case\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso as a side note FF\_BC mentioned INTPS being good at music and I think it's really a mixed bag because I am shit at it it took me 6 months to learn the most basic song that could be taught, then again it could be dyspraxia as I have an INTP friend who is the most talented musician I know (he plays keyboard, flute and piano in the school rock band, jazz band, a musical duo, the school orchestra and a smaller independant orchestra)
1	Survey on Flirtation and personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
2	Your survey was too long and I gave up at 199 questions without submitting 🤷
1	Hey I tried to do this but I have been married 31 years. I still flirt, but for fun and to compliment people. So I don't have dates to report, and I have no interest in sex with anyone other than my wife.\n\nThe survey made half of me wistful for my younger days and the other half grateful that I found some who would keep me all these years.
1	Dang, do people really flirt, while having absolutely no interest in the person they're flirting with?  If so, that is extremely worrying to me.
1	Well sadly I wasnt able to finish it, because I couldnt give accurate answers.\n\nIve never flirted with anybody, being that Ive never been in a relationship with anybody.  So I can't give anything scientifically valid.\n\nLooks like a great survey though!
1	So it's a pity you limited your sample to Americans. I'd happily complete the survey but it asks for GPA and state. 
1	Christ, that was long as fuck. I see your redundant questions and checks and balances but also your question structure is dumb as fuck. Way too open to misleading questions. Source: Used to work in UI/UX and user observation and testing.
6	Is Dom Ti the most detached function from emotions and just in general ?	
5	More or less; Ti likes things to be as objective as possible
3	Ya mayB
3	INTP (and ISTP) are 1st function Ti Data Processing. By contrast, J types are Fi-Data, as are NF and SF types. When it comes to Data Processing, TP types are the only "objective" types not using Fi for Data Processing, and thus not skewing every Data point according to their Fi like Narcissists do. 
7	Question for emotionally mature INTP's	How do you sort through your emotions? I have a terrible Achilles heel when it comes to dealing with emotions, particularly negative ones like rejection and loneliness.\n\nHow do well adjusted INTP's manage to resolve stuff like this? The rest of us are pretty much groping in the dark when it comes to dealing with any type of feelings..
7	>How do you sort through your emotions\n\nI spend a lot of time trying to figure out my emotions because they can blend together sometimes. \n\nI try to find where they're coming from, know what's caused a certain feeling and knowledge from the get go it's fine to feel. \n\nEmotions are not the enemy nor something to neglect, but something which is natural. \n\nWhen coming to things like rejection, I think about why I was rejected. Spend a couple minutes figuring it out so that I get the initial shock out of my system. \n\nI find reasons why and put it into context for myself by aligning what I need to know to feel more settled.\n\nI deal with all the necessary understanding before I start with my feelings. That way I have the full picture to put my mind to rest. \n\nThere is simply accepting it's just emotion. That's one way of dealing with it for some people. \n\nFor me I dig into it like an aggressive researcher trying to figure out the psychology of said emotion. \n\n" I feel sad and rejected. It's giving me feelings I haven't felt in a long time and I keep dwelling on similar things that I associate with this one. \n\nSo I have an insecurity linked to rejection? \n\nWhere does it start? How did it build up?"\n\nFinding all this out I might hit a sore shot, cry and get back up. But it deals with a lot all whilst coming to an understanding of the current moment. \n\nIt puts it into context, and context idk... It helps me  lot. \n\nOf course however, there is also that raw expression which is priceless! When you spill your insides all over your friend in the hopes they can help you out. \n\nThen you go away, think... and come back to tell them how you've sorted it out and it only took you all yesterday lmao. \n\nOnly to explain how you came to your conclusion as your friend looks at you wondering why you came to them in the first place 😂\n\nThe emotions will linger, but by understanding them you don't fear it. \n\nThis is of course is my personal coping method. It's hard to explain so I understand if half of it does not make sense. 
5	I have taken great solace in Stoicism's understanding of emotions. First off, you have to realize that no one can make you sad. Or lonely, or for that matter happy or any other feeling. If you really look at what an emotion is at a core level, it is your reaction to a stimulus. Stoicism teaches that it is your perception and understanding of this stimulus that gives rise to the emotion you feel about it. So, a person can be the stimulus that provokes a response from you, but the response says far more about yourself than it does about the person that invoked it. \n\nLets take the easy example of a person insulting you at a party. If we look at three different reactions to this to show what I am talking about. The first person takes the insult and sees how other people are laughing at them and looks at themselves through that lens. They feel embarrassed and flee the room. The second takes it and sees it through a lens of a person has hurt them, so they want to hurt them back, gets angry and attacks the guy that insulted them. A third person might see it through the lens of humor and be amused by the joke and laugh along. The important thing to take away from this is that the only thing that changed in those examples was how the observer viewed the insult through their internal framework. Which means that emotions are internal to your own mind and not caused by something outside. \n\nSo, if these things are internal to us, how can we deal with them? This is the tricky part and the part that will take time to learn. Stoicism teaches that these internal emotions are either positive or negative. More importantly, your understanding of the situation that caused them is either correct, or incorrect. Correct understanding leads to positive emotions, incorrect understanding leads to negative emotions. If you are sad about being rejected, it is due to your expectations going into the situation being incorrectly matched to the outcome. If you are upset with your performance on a test, it is due to pretty much the same mismatch of expectations vs reality. Align your expectations with reality and you will remove a lot of unhappiness there. This is similar to a lot of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that is being used today. You have to slowly change what your expectations of the world are so that they more realistically align to what is going to be happy. \n\nThere is so much more to this than I can put here, and I have already constructed a decent wall of text, but I welcome questions or comments if this interests you.
2	Often emotions come off feeling like a sickly stew and to get rid of them we need to “feel” them. At least for me. I think a lot of it comes from the fact we can’t cognitively understand emotions. We try and seperate and strain them making sense of them like oh im sad this emotion is sadness; but what I find is that I often can’t come up with words to describe certain emotions. What I’ve learned over the years is to feel better emotionally is to accept what your emotions are telling you without using your mind. I’ll often now sit there simmering in my stew. Maybe I’ll cry or be in tears but afterwards, I feel a lot better. For me personally I don’t think I’m matured yet as I tend to have a lag time with my emotions-fest. I’m working on attempting to process emotions real time. For me that, is identifying which feeling means what and expressing it real time so I don’t crumble under a repression bubble and have to stew.
4	Drink 10 units of alcohol 1x per 2 weeks to let out pent up frustration.    \nKeeps the deeper time bomb dormant.
1	Rejection and loneliness are feelings, not emotions. It helps to understand the difference and relations between the two.\n\nSomeone once told me that emotions are the outward expression of feelings. So anger, happiness, and sorrow all come from feeling something else. The *feeling* of frustration often expresses as the *emotion* anger, for example, but and also come out as sorrow or apathy. \n\nThe key is to understand how your feelings express themselves, because everyone is different. You can't control how you feel, but you can control your emotions. Then, by understanding that you feel a certain way, you can accept that feeling as valid without it causing harm to yourself or others. Feelings go away over time. Don't hold on to them, just acknowledge them. All they want is to be acknowledged.
1	Honestly if they reject you then you’re better off without them and with loneliness being a particularly difficult feeling to deal with my go to is listen to some nostalgic music or something that really helps me remember times where loneliness was never even a thought on my mind.
2	How do you guys cope with your emotions?	I am an INTP, and I've always shut off my emotional side whenever I feel it's unnecessary. Envious because someone has better grades than me? Shoo. A small rejection? Bothered me a bit but oh well. My friends think I cry over the pettiest things but in reality, I see recurring problems, feel those recurring emotions, dump them in the pile and explode after I couldn't take anymore of it.\n\nAre you guys the same? How do you cope with that? Please let me know, I'm extremely curious.
6	By living emotions in the moment. It's the only way not to give then the power to disproportionately disrupt later on.
5	By suppressing and vehemently denying that they exist, until they slowly come out of the woodwork literal *years* later. \n\nYeah, trying to work on this one. 
3	I try to review things at the end of the day and write down any emotions that I am aware of that I need to process.  I also write down how I process them and what conclusion I come to.  If there is something that keeps bothering me, it is pretty easy to tell if I have several recurring notes.  Then it is time to take care of things in a calm manner with whomever or whatever is bothering me.  The main thing is to get it out of your head so that you can take a look at it rationally.  Keeping things in my head keeps it in an unprocessed loop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you aware of it when you are bothered by something?  This can be a major challenge too.  If you suppress quicker than you are aware, then it is harder to take action.  That is why getting into the habit of reviewing the day, even if you do not think you have to, is important.
2	I usually try not to let them be overwhelming when my emotions are big they make me unable to function. For example I can’t stand angry yelling so when a customer gets in my face I kinda have to leave immediately bc I can no longer talk or function with that person acting like that. 
58	Success Stories	I want to hear your success stories. Did you quit smoking recently? Did you get the courage to ask out your SO and now you're happy together? Finish a project? \n\nShare your positive stories here. 
76	One day in english class, my teacher made a small speech about judging people, stating that you shouldn't judge others. A little later that same class period, she eventually walked to my desk while I was writing something and she said out loud, "Your handwriting is bad."  \n\nI then immediately respond with, "I thought you- said not to judge others..." making everyone laugh. I don't think anyone remembers that day, but everytime I remember that, it boosts my confidence from a constant -200 to a temporary 1. 
41	This one time I threw a piece of paper into the bin   from like 2 whole feet away
39	I quit nicotine some months ago, no cravings. I've also quit smoking marijuana around the same time. I've been eating healthy, taking vitamins, supplements and protein shakes. I can feel my body absorbing the positive nutrients from the foods i'm cooking. I work out and exercise for 1 week now, everyday. I feel strong as fuck. I've turned the thermostat up 4 degrees higher and am still comfortable. My mind is clear. I'm motivated. Depression appears to be lifting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still drink soda which I will be cutting out next. One week clean of alcohol. 
18	So far, I haven't spent a single day in 2019 without at least one hour of productivity. It's tough for me to get things done because I'm in charge of my schedule and receive enough family support to survive without lifting a finger. I should be grateful but I'm pretty sure it's harming me more than it's helping.\n\nI'm still struggling to reach the 8 hours per day goal that I've set for myself, which would basically put me at equal effort to normal human beings with a full time job. But 3-5 hours per day is still a massive improvement over the \~150 days in 2018 when I did absolutely nothing at all.
14	I composed a soundtrack to go with a romantic comedy I wrote for my playwriting class, even though the assignment was just to write the script. I casted my crush to read the main character’s lines, and even gave her a special love poem/song to read with the music. Overall, people really liked it and the teacher was impressed, plus my crush asked me how I got all the timing down and what my music composition techniques/inspirations were. On top of giving her a pretty deep look into my technical and philosophical approach after class, I also hinted that I thought in advance about who would read the lines, signaling to her that I deliberately cast her as a main character or love interest in all the stuff I write, instead of choosing readers at random like my other classmates seem to do. At the end of it, my favorite reward was when she said I did a great job and called me by name when she was saying goodbye. Got nice feels and validation, but I will have to wait and see how things move from here. Overall a 7/10 experience. 
13	I taught a 7 year old how to emotionally handle the fact that her adoptive mother (her bio-grandmother) doesn't want her around.\n\nI got a 9 year old to spend 2 straight hours cleaning his room during school vacation.  At one point, he said "I didn't know cleaning my room could be so fun!"  When we started, 10% of his floor was visible.  After, 90% was visible.  (Missed a chance to opine about JBP).\n\nNow, I best get at cleaning my room.\n\nAnd teeth were brushed.  Me and my cats.
8	So I've been trying to read this book for a while now and it's not that I'm not interested in it (I wanted to read it for about a year before I was able to get my hands on it), it's just that other stuff keeps getting thrown in the way. Finally told myself to stop reading fanfiction instead of the book and read a few chapters earlier today. Feelsgood 
6	Here's a success story: it's yours.  You seem to have changed your toxic ways and did something actually wholesome.  I respect that, good sir!  Thank you so much! :D
5	My husband and I paid off almost $70K of debt in two years. Sent off the last student loan check in January. Feels so good. 
7	I pulled off a 4500 km road-trip (on my 350 cc bike) in 28 days. From Mumbai, I rode all the way to the mouth of the greater Himalayas. Check out Munsiyari (in Uttarakhand). 
6	Also I lost 15 pounds of fat by following a ketogenic diet. 
6	I got my drivers license today
4	I used to do things and have hobbies. Then I had my first child. She is now 7 and my youngest is 1. For 7 years, I have been struggling to find a place for my self after work, housework, and child rearing. Most of the time I am so tired once the kids are asleep, I hop on Reddit for a bit and fall asleep.\n\nI am working on asserting myself enough to make time for my interests rather than putting it off until all my responsibilities are taken care of, at which point I'm too tired. I've been reading again, listening to audiobooks in the car and while I clean, and for the past two weeks I've started working on my art.\n\nThis might not seem like a big deal, but I have essentially been functioning like an INTJ, and that just makes me miserable and angry. 
5	I helped my ESFP ex girlfriend quit banging ice, and then I no longer wanted to bang her.  She’s 1.5 years sober and has no idea how proud I am of her.
3	I got a really good internship for the summer, high paying, in a nice location.
4	I've kept a baby alive for nearly 8 months & she's super happy, she almost never cries. She's healthy & could stand unassisted by 6.5 months which is almost unheard of.
4	Today was the first day I didn't run a fever or feel like excruciating death after battling the flu for the past 6 days. *Very* thankful to be over it.
5	Took a normal looking shit for the first time in 2 months woohoo go me 
3	Finished og packman in one run. Greatest day ever
3	Got over anxiety with exercise routine.  Lost 20 lbs also :-)
3	I quit smoking two years ago this April. I'm such a routine oriented person that it took me having a week off of work in order to actually get over the three day hump, which was a very real thing for me. A normal weekend wasn't enough. Once I was able to eliminate it from my daily routine, when it came to my physical health I couldn't believe I'd ever started. The amount of energy you get back is irreplaceable, though I sometimes miss the buzz I'd get from the nicotine. The thought of picking up a vape still crosses my mind occasionally for that reason, but I always decide against it because it would be a step backwards in the end.
3	I got a new job at my college's makerspace last month. So I've been pretty hyped to be doing that
3	I told a co-worker about how much I loved parallel parking (calculated risk, precision, skill, doing it fast enough to prove the person behind me wrong for thinking I was going to waste their time) and they told me that that was the most "on brand" thing for me. It made me feel successful and INTP-esque.
3	I recently gave birth to my second child. At home (as planned), unmedicated. She’s perfect, and she’s going to be 1 month old tomorrow. 
2	I wonder why an ESFP has posted this question in INTPs' subreddit?🤔\n\nMight need help for one of her family member or friend who is INTP?\nBut...by her activity in the thread, it seems she is sharing her own experience & asking about others! So why in INTPs subreddit, could have posted to MBTI subreddit!?🤔🤔🤔\n
4	I used to want to kill myself. Like genuinely flunked-out-of-school-and-started-instilling-my-plan suicidal.\n\nI don't want to do that anymore. I get straight A's and want to be a good wife/mother one day.\n\nI consider that a success.
2	:( \n\nVery much smoking still...
2	My brain no shit translated the title of the post to “Suc Stories”
2	Today I drove down a crowded expressway full of idiots and didn't wreck. I had some close calls but ultimately I made it home in one piece. When are they going to come out with self driving cars??? i really want to get rid of people driving... it's like giving a monkey a machine gun. 
2	Preface: I can’t jinx myself, so I might sound cryptic here.\n\nI have experienced everything I set out to do of my own accord. I’ve had a very fulfilling life, even the low points had awesome highlights. \n\nI believe life is chopped up in to bits, little circles we go through and they’re 75% environmental, 25% free will. Think about how every scenario has less than eight possible causes, like the limit of folding paper, exponential equations are the breath of life.\n\nJust fucking go do what you love. Fucking get up and run right now ( unless it’s late, you’re stoned, need munchies, and kinda tired) to your new existence as an exiled procrastinator club member.\n\nTomorrow you’ll forget about being free from the clutches that bind you, so might as well dismiss life’s calling right?\n\nFuck no, just fucking go do whatever you feel is best and right for you and you alone, do not assign any emotions to anyones else as a responsibility to your well being, but you already know this.\n\n    
2	In April I started going to the gym. I still go almost everyday. I am the highest weight I've ever been, but it's mostly muscle. I am energetic and confident now, because of all the exercise. My belly is almost gone. 
2	Got an A in general chem 1. It was a shortened 6 week course (normally it's 16 I believe). Had 5hrs of class Monday through Friday and often studied till midnight. 
2	In 9th grade a new student moved into my school.  He loved talking about how he worshipped Satan and liked to flip his eyelids inside out to make every one squirm.  Clearly he had issues and was pulling some self isolation techniques. I was assigned to sit next to him in one of my classes, and found him to be adorably innocent and clearly overcompensating for something. I viewed him with INTP eyes as almost satirical and sitting next to this kid felt like watching an intelligent comedy.  I was an Abercrombie wearing Mormon girl at the time, to give an idea of the contrast between us.  I loved debating with him about what it would take for Satan's army to take over the world.\n\nAnyway, our midterm grades were publicly posted for all to see. I got my usual no effort B.  He got an F.  I laughed in his face loudly. "Wow, how did you actually get an F?! I know you're smart, but it takes so much flipping effort to fail, you have to TRY to get an F.  You can basically do nothing in this class and get a C." He was quite embarrassed that I caught him putting effort into something, and from that day forward started earning solid C's in that class.  \n\nThe twist?  My teacher clearly overheard me, and instead of being insulted, spread the word to all the 9th grade teachers.  Within a week, every class had a new seating assignment and I was suspiciously placed next to this devil worshiper in every class, and he started earning straight C's.\n\nSo yeah, I helped a troubled kid by rolling my eyes at his self mutilation and making fun of him for trying so hard to look stupid.  He disappeared after that year, no idea what happened to him.\n\n
2	I recently finished 6 weeks of training to volunteer as a crisis counselor and had my first shift this week. Not only is it a challenge and a commitment (two things I don't make a lot of room for in my life) but I had to push myself pretty far out of my comfort zone. I'm excited about it and hope I can help some people, and I've already learned a lot from it too. 
2	Finally went to get help for my mental health issues after 19381 years.  Making headway on digging myself out of my academic pit trap. Confessed to my current SO and I'm the happiest and most secure I've been probably since early childhood. Landed a couple jobs in the past year (making taxes hell).
2	I managed to get work experience from a graphic designer (I was 14) At the time I wanted to be a concept artist (I want to be an architect now) and he helped me find career that I like. On the second day he let me do official graphic design work for him. I felt, for the first time, professional.
1	Maybe we all could better understand unicorn farts...?
2	Anyone interested in this stuff?	
2	That's the kind of stuff I'd understand but rather than that well thought out explanation it would be incoherent stream of information 😂
1	So blankets and balls.\n\nI was thinking today of an intuitive explanation for time dilation. I saw that if time was defined by the amount of meaningful interactions within a system, and those are always facilitated by the speed of light (causality), then whatever would alter it's speed relative to another observer would also alter the subjective experience of time.\n\nIn a nearly light speed moving spaceship, the speed of light must be seen as "c" (from E=mc2) always when inside, but given that the ship already has an extreme speed relative to other objects, and the speed of any of it's pieces (a photon inside moving in the same direction as the ship, for example) can't exceed "c" when looked from outside, then, internally, the experiencing of these interactions must be slower. So a photon would take much longer, if it is moving in the same direction as the spaceship, to reach its cockpit if emitted from the back. After all, it can't go faster than "c", so it's relative speed is slower in a sense (it takes more "time") as whatever inch of the spaceship it covers must be at speed "c" minus whatever speed the spaceship has, so that when looked from the outside the spaceship it does not goes faster than "c".  In the opposite direction, a photon would be emitted at a speed that is just "c" from the point of view of the cockpit, it does not gain any extra speed from being in the ship. Like trowing a ball inside a moving airplane.\n\nSince "c" is the same when you measure it, wherever you do, then by result, although the rate of meaningful interactions is less that in a stationary ship (again, by necessity light moves "slower" inside the ship relative to how it would in less speedy spaceships since it takes more "time" for it to cover the same distance within the ship) you would feel normal inside the ship as long as you didn't see through the window. But if another spaceship managed to watch you through a telescope, you would appear as slowed in time, because whatever you do inside is capped by the absolute speed of light "c", not by how you experience time.\n\nIn the case of gravity dilating time, it gets more complex. I'll just say that, since gravity makes space expand to one who is inside its effects, then light would go "slower" within it's effects when viewed outside them. So when you pass the event horizon of a black hole, then space falls unto itself, forever expanding so that you don't reach the center, so to speak, but then time must also go to a standstill for someone who is viewing you from the outside, since light cannot go above "c", and the ground to cover is immense, or infinite. In other words, space is larger inside than outside the influence of a gravity well, and so light must be "slower" inside a black hole than what it is inside a similar "sized" chunk of empty space so that it never surpasses "c" if you were to look at it from outside. Rubber blankets and balls.\n\nI'm probably talking nonsense, but can somebody get something useful out of it?
1	The statement “gravity is a forcefield” implies a misunderstanding of what a gravitational field *is*. Fields are a purely artificial construct devised by physicists to illustrate and manipulate forces. \n\nThe response completely relied on terminology and did little to explain anything conceptually. Furthermore, relatavistic gravity still *does* use fields. \n\nPaging real physicist tho, I’m just a dum bizness guy. u/NoxiousQuadrumvirate, did my answer make you vomit? (No I don’t think we’ve spoken, I just had your profile saved bc you’re cool and I like physics)
3	No motivation	Hi fellow INTP's, hope you are well. Not sure if I post this in right subreddit, but here we go:\nI am a 20 years old second year Chemical Engineering student, who does not like his course. I am already halfway through the course, but I can't find the motivation to do it, although I have decided that the best thing would be to finish my Bachelors degree. I do not have any other things in mind, I am still due to discover my passion. However, I am unsure how to explore different things, while being a full time student with a part-time job. I have tried learning python, as I want to become a freelancer, but I cannot even find motivation to do that. I am asking you how to explore different things and find my passion(maybe there are exact steps that I could take? Different programmes?) Also, how do I find the motivation to finish my current degree. Thank you in advance for your answers!\n\nTL;DR\nStudent without motivation to finish the course trying to explore different things and find his passion, however, unsure how to do this. Also, trying to find motivation on how to finish the Bachelors degree.
4	I'm with you. I'm in an accounting degree and while I have motivation to be an accountant, I don't have to motivation to go to the prerequisite classes and do the homework for them. The only thing that motivates me to actually get up is the fact that one day I'll live comfortably on an accountant salary. 
2	Make it a challenge/game to see how quickly you can finish your degree. Take a massive credit load and pull your graduation date more towards the present. Having a 4 year degree is a common requirement for working overseas. You can always go back for your double major if you want, or go to grad school at some point.\n\nI finished my final two years of university in one year + a May session just because I was so eager to work abroad.\n\nWhat is an INTP without an obsession?
2	I'm also an INTP. 23 years old. I decided I hated accounting when I was halfway through my degree in college, but finished anyway.\n\nMy motivation for finishing was just to earn money, and to finally be done with school. In my mind, not having a degree was not an option. This is because it's much harder it is to prove yourself without having that piece of paper that says you put in the work and effort to learning your skill. INTPs are smart, but sometimes it's not enough to be smart. You have to prove that you have the follow through to get things done. Which is a huge obstacle for most of us. But when you're done, the feeling of achievement is amazing.\n\nAll college does is give you a credential in your field of study. It is also proof that you are willing to put in the work to finish something.\n\nAn accounting salary is comfortable. But, I have found I moved up the company latter too quickly in my current job and I hate it even more. I manage people. And it is so tiring. When I first entered my degree, I thought I'd be in a back cubicle somewhere crunching numbers alone. And I thought I could live with the monotony, so long as I had time to explore outside of work, and use work as a way to fuel searching for hobbies, and doing things that I want to do in life that isn't career oriented. That is totally not the case. My OCD in the company kicked in when it came to fixing mistakes and putting logical processes in place to ensure accuracy in financial reporting (because my work is full of chaos and doesn't have procedure). Unfortunately, work became my hobby. And now I'm in a manager position trying to enforce procedure on a company that refuses it. SO FRUSTRATING.\n\nWhat I'm starting to realize is that it doesn't matter what degree you choose. Work is work. Don't try to find passion in it. Especially in technical positions. INTPs enjoy building processes and creating efficiency through it, but you can easily get your soul sucked from businesses. Employers will only reward your hard work with more work.\n\nEarn your degree, earn a paycheck, do what you gotta do, and find passion in a place that will be rewarding to your life. I'm trying to find my passions again now before I look back and realized I worked my life away.
1	Hey! A fellow INTP Chemical engineer!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a bit younger than you and haven't gotten in too deep with advanced courses yet so I don't fully know which direction I'm going to head in.  I think alternative energy sounds good right now. I plan on getting by undergrad and immediately apply for Masters.  I want to go for the full PhD right now, but that could change.

1	Do you think reading books out loud while focusing on the meaning of each word would improve your verbal thinking, speech & articulation?	Often in conversations I have a hard time recalling the correct words and putting them together in a way that conveys the meaning I want to express, especially in my native language since I use it less in my daily life than I use English. Have you experience with improving your verbal skills in such manner? What other benefits have you gained from it?
4	Reading itself will do wonders for your verbal skills and I think reading out loud will do so even more. It sounds like you're simply a little rusty. If that's the area you struggle with, you should of course read books in your native language. \n\nSome anecdotal evidence: Every time I read a book, some of the authors syntax and vocabulary will bleed into my own. I've always been very susceptible to this and it might be the same for you. \n\nWhy not go and immerse yourself with authors who's wordings you find pleasing. On top of that, reading out loud and more regularly talking to others (;P) can only help. You'll see changes soon enough! (But don't let your vocabulary get too bloated. While a colourful language is beautiful to behold, being known as the verbose guy will just as often serve to alienate you as it may amuse. It's like salt and pepper - add to taste)
3	No. Try the million words drill instead:\n\nFor five minutes, talk nonstop. Literally speak out loud every single thought you have, as fast as you can. Don’t repeat dumb stuff over and over. Do this every day. \n\nThen step it up to ten minutes.

17	how to stop being so messy???	I'm terrible with keeping my living space clean/tidy. I'm super meticulous about keeping myself clean, but everything else... not so much. it seems like I'm stuck in this mindset of 'why would I clean that when it's just going to get dirty again anyway' and 'why would I spend my time cleaning when I can do something else more interesting'. I do a big clean every few months but within a week it's a mess again. can't tell if incredibly lazy or depression. probably both
14	INTPs are just kinda like that. It's simply not your strength. \n\n\nBe sure to have shelves to store things on - a lot of you just put shit on the floor or counter as if it *goes* there. Ugh.\n\n\nBe sure to have spots for your stuff. Then always just put stuff back in its spot. It's not super hard.\n\n\nHire a cleaner like once a month or so. This is what my grandma (an INTP) does. She only pays them like $60 and it helps her out a lot.
3	Nah, keeping your environment tidy just does not rise to a level that requires action. You can develop the habit, but it is not easy and takes time. My wife would tell you that this is only theoretically possible.
3	I've been struggling with this a lot. I'm finally starting to make some break throughs. Though I'll be honest it's tough because a lot of it goes against my nature. \n\nThe general advice (and it's good advice) is to declutter by getting rid of stuff you don't really need. Have a place for everything to go. Have a cleaning schedule. If you can, do those.\n\nBut here are the biggest things that have made a difference for me so far.\n\n1. The most disgusting thing is dirty dishes. I have a rule that all dishes must be done before I go to bed. This is easy for me because I have a specific bedtime due to work being super early so I just make sure to start doing any left over half an hour before that before I brush my teeth and stuff. I then put away the stuff that has dried when I get home in the afternoon the next day. I soak any pans right after cooking to make it easier to clean.\n\n2. I decided to spend money on a roomba. Fixes the time consuming issue of vacuuming. It also solves a second problem... it can't run if shit is on the floor. So the floors must be picked up. Sure, sometimes I just put random crap on a counter but it usually means I put clothes in the hamper and stuff not being on the floor makes a big difference. Obviously this isn't for everyone... living with roommates or in college or just can't afford it but it's made it a logical process why I should always check the floors are clean so it can run.\n\nI'm slowly trying to get rid of stuff and have a place for things... haven't done that great with it but at least the first two keeps my sink empty and my floors clear and mostly dust free.
3	I think (for me anyway) a big part of accepting messiness was learning the difference between “this is a mess that actively affects my mood and/or lifestyle” and “this is ordinary clutter that i am comfortable with”. So for you, and for most of us with a P in our type, clutter is probably a pretty standard type thing and not necessarily something to be shunned. Not everybody can comfortably live in an über organized way. Maybe next time you clean consider the following: How does cleaning make you feel? If it stresses you out a lot, maybe you’re cleaning a little too much and holding yourself to an unrealistic tidy standard. If it feels freeing, it could be that your current living situation is a byproduct of depression (as you theorized) and therefore you could motivate yourself by thinking about how you feel better with a bit less mess. Also, if you live with someone, be it a spouse, family, or roommates, try to compromise on tidying if you’re not super good about it. My rule for housemates is usually “Don’t leave food or food related garbage lying around, and keep your clutter to your designated area.” 
2	I do the same thing. I compulsively clean my room until it is absolutely spotless and then within a week its a disaster again. A month later, I rinse and repeat. It's a neverending cycle basically. \n\nI have no idea how to stop being messy though, but it probably has something to do with organization, which I have zero understanding in.
1	Sell off everything but the absolute essentials. Nothing left to make a mess
1	It's easy, you will forever ignore it without rules, so you should designate one day of the week every week, to consider what needs taking of and take care of it.\n\nMaking a calendar turned out to be a huge success for me. I still dislike doing it, but the trick is to see the full picture, you may not care for tidy much but disgusting and inefficient living area is also part of the deal. You will be hesitant to have people over, and you will probably going to waste time looking for things.\n\nDon't call yourself lazy and depressed, you are not using them objectively, you are reinforcing those negatives, you are training yourself. Your thoughts are the road signs of your destination. \n\nLazy is a stupid word anyway, meant to make you feel bad about things you don't like doing. Some need to be done, but most in my experience are a waste of time, and the fact you are "lazy" will help you a lot to find your real path, we can just rebrand lazy to not stupid.\n\nDepression is tricky and not inherently stupid, it's best countered by finding meaning in your life which is harder if you are intelligent, but if you are really depressed, your negative emotions are taking you straight to hell, and you are locked away in the dungeon feeling like an observer with faint hope of better things. You are your own prisoner, you are your own tyrant, so watch how you talk and watch what you think, and use logic to  lead you out. If you are spiraling with negative emotions you have to question them. Forgive yourself, you don't want to repeat the same mistakes, but simply realizing mistakes is pointless, you also have to have a plan, and you can't change the past, and what most people call mistakes are the steps to success. \n\nPeople are putting on a facade, under which they are fighting their own fights. The farther away is the person you are pretending to be from who you are, the slower you will grow as a person, so you have to be yourself, that's the only way people can like you, else they can only like who you are pretending to be. You are not a depressed person coming short in a perfect world. \n\nThis is an opportunity, be a fearless person in a scared world.
1	dunno never bothered me
0	If you are single.\n\nMarry any judging type and give her/him the main-responsibility for cleaning and organizing.\n\nOf course you as a perceiving type needs to contribute.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Still trying to get into the mechanisms of perceiving functions(Ne, Si, Ni for this post)	Ne: Follows the "feeling" of "there is more here" and therefore does the action that is required to unlock that "more here" element and perceives an objective possibility data point.\n\nAn analogy: imagine you are an ENTP and know almost nothing about people. You REALLY wanna learn more about people so you go to a concert. You're looking down at the crowd from on top of this small nearby hill and you see a ball on the ground. You suddenly get this overwhelming feeling that if you kick the ball something important will happen. So you kick the ball and it rails some old lady in the face(I mean...can it get much more meaningful than that?). Everyone around her comes to her assistance(the element of human nature that the ENTP wanted to perceive). Ne then simply observes the possibility data point that occurs after you kicked the ball. It is objective because...well...it literally happened. \n\nNe doesn't assume it knows what will happen, that is Ni. Essentially Ne-Si has an idea of what might happen based in past experiences and data collected, but it doesn't ACTUALLY know. That's why it actually carries out the action. Ne dominance is about this overwhelming feeling that results in a drive to influence the object(the ball in the earlier case) to bring about the meaningful event that is perceived to result from it. Ne truly thinks "anything could happen" i.e. the ball could fly up into the sky and never be seen again. It is unlikely, but they kick the ball to find out. Again...and again....and again. After enough kicks of the ball they begin to assume that for all intents and purposes the data point pattern will not change. It could, but it's not worth the time.\n\nAnother example from my own cognition(INTP) is that occasionally while observing I will get a very small gyst of something and get the feeling that if I analyze something with Ti, that it will yield information that would be very important to me.\n\nUnknown element of Ne for me: associations. Ne dominants and aux users(myself included) have a tendency to mentally bring to mind associations of a situation. Ne doms and aux are good at mental hypotheticals/analogies because they use Ti and Fi to get an internal structure of a situation and then make a functional analogue of that structure in terms of a made up situation(or simply an associated situation from their past).\n\n\nSi: Si dominants are primarily concerned with internal sensations. To relate this to Ne: Ne uses a specific type of internal sensation as an impetus to action(the sensation of "there is more behind this that is important"). While Ne simply uses the sensation as a motivation to action and possibility data observation, Si is primarily concerned with experiencing the sensation itself. It does not act on it, simply experience it as a means to understand it.\n\nNi: Ni dominants are also primarily concerned with these internal sensations, but rather than trying to understand the sensation they immediately move on to perceiving the internal image which produces the sensation itself. To use an analogy(next 3 paragraphs): \n\nOne sensation is the feeling of "there is more to this" which is used as a driving force behind Ne dominant action. I.e. "I feel like if I kick this ball something big is gonna happen." \n\nSi is concerned with the sensation which produces it i.e. "the feeling of kicking this ball is strong. How long will this sensation last? What brought this sensation about?" (How does Si perceive what brought it about?? Past comparison???)\n\nNi is not concerned with the sensation but rather what is behind and comprises the sensation. Ni does not desire to kick the ball, as it does not need to gather the possibility data point of what happens when the ball is kicked. Instead, it perceives the image which produces that sensation(perhaps they see a branding iron being pressed against a mans face and everyone watching it occur feels horrible for the man, an analogy for the ball railing the old lady in the face). If Ni is correct then the internal image associated with the sensation will also be represented by the possibility that happens and is perceived by Ne. If ni is not correct(subjective) then it will not perceive the true possibility that would have occured. This is because Ni assumes it is correct(as do all introverted functions) and therefore assumes it has no reason to collect data..."the data is already collected" says the Ni dominant. The data is represented by the internal image/movie that is mentally perceived. Ni has received the value of the Ne possibility(insight into the helpful nature of people) without actually seeing the possibility occur\n\nSe is also a sensational impetus to action like Ne but is oriented by something else. I'm not sure yet, I havn't read the Jung definition of the type in a while.
3	Jung's function can be initially deduced logically which will help you understand them better and why Myers and Briggs did \n\n\n\nHere's a start:\n\n\n-He postulated that people either have a preference to focus their energy inwards or outwards\n\n\n-you perceive things either through your senses or through your minds abstractions (S vs N)\n\n\nGiven these 2: if you prefer to sense and from the outside (Se) what can you conclude? You're gonna be in the here and now, aware of the current environment, grounded and practical, etc. These are all descriptions of Se doms.\n\n Same will apply for sending inside: memories ( How things were exactly and thus how they should be), bodily sensations, etc...
2	Living alone?	I (25M, no GF) have been considering going to live alone, without roommates. I will enjoy a lot doing what I want when I want with no explanations and having more time for me. \n\nI'm only worried because I can see myself going into a spiral of solitude and not seeing my friends for weeks (has happened before and I have to fight for it to not happen). This coul eventually lead to missing them and me being lonely and miserable.\n\nAnother worry is extreme procrastination. Without anyone near, I could just sit on the couch and reading Reddit the whole evening, and feeling really bad afterwards.\n\nI know I love being alone for short periods on vacation or work trips, but the longest have been 3 weeks and I don't know how I would handle a entire life alone.\n\nAs INTP, I hope some of you with similar personality have experience living alone and how it is/was for you before taking a decision.\n\nThanks for reading.
3	Living alone is awesome. Yes, you’re prone to isolating yourself, but you do that anyway even living with others. Rather, living alone, you become forced to recognize that you *have* to go outside to acquire human contact. \n\nI think living with others can actually be detrimental to an introvert, allowing them to use their coinhabitants as social crutches and actually becoming *more*, rather than less, isolated. 
2	I’m 25 too, been living alone for 4 years. In the beginning it was brutal because I would spend all my time behind the computer wasting time. If you want to ensure productivity, create a routine for yourself. Get up at the same time everyday, and have a set of tasks you wish to accomplish by the end of the day. For me personally, I start my day by doing the dishes, cleaning the place up, and studying for school. After that I like to take a walk in the park while I listen to podcasts. Just find things you need/like to do, and base your day around completing those tasks. INTPs are stubborn people as we dont like copying other peoples routines, so find one that suits you through trial and error.

2	Playing to Your Strength vs Improving Your Weakness	I'm curious as to how many of us, here, have focused their mental energy on what they're good at vs those who tried to make their weaknesses less of a burden. What's your rationale behind your decision? Let's see what we'll come up with.\n\n\nPersonally speaking, I opted to improve on my weaknesses. I know the risk of being mediocre, at best, since I forego to improve further on my strengths, just to mask my weaknesses.\n\n\nSince one of my weaknesses growing up was... surprise, surprise, socialization. Through the years, I made myself more accommodating, spent way more time analyzing whether or not I'll voice out what I think as not doing so has caused me great deal of rejection from almost everyone i get to interact with. And finally, there's no way going around beating the bush with this statement... we need others. ugh. As much as I wanted to live and die, alone, life will just find its way to screw me up so... instead of dying to a lose-lose situation, i literally forced myself to be more social.\n\n\nI want to be clear that what I mentioned above is not indicative of whatever this thread's flow would be. Everybody's welcome to share their own experience to back up their choices.
5	By default, we play to our strengths, for us, TiNe. The thing is, it's not actually playing to our strength, because our weakness get in the way...\n\nFor example it's good to know the answers about stuff/being right, but if you can't tell people/they don't listen to you beside a "I'm told you so" afterward, then it's useless.\n\nThus : **Improving your weaknesses is actually the way to play to your strengths.** It's not an either/or thing.\n\nSorry for the wall of text : \n\n***\nI will use socionics from here on :\n\nThere are basically four blocks in socionics, which are for our type :\n\n*  The Ego Block. TiNe. \n* The Super Id block. SiFe\n* The Id block : NiTe\n* The Super Ego Block : FiSe.\n\nWe are already strong at TiNe, that's the strengths of our type you see in every descriptions. The other three blocks needs work, though.\n\nYou would think I would say to work on the Super Id block, so SiFe like the description say ? After all, that's our weakness, Fe, we are and at reading the mood/socializing. \n\nWell, nope. SiFe, or the Super Id is actually part of the "vital ring" along the Id block. The vital ring is basically processes which are automatic, that we are not very conscious of, they also are "passive", as opposed to the "mental ring", which we are conscious of, and is "active". As such, **SiFe aren't really function you can "work on"**, they are more function that will develop themselves passively. \n\nSo, you can get it by putting yourself in situation that will need them, or pick it up passively by being with a type that's good at it. Say, xSFJ. You could pick good habits like those Si routine, cooking skills, and being Fe polite for example. What's the Feeling Consensus, etc ?\n\n***\n**Anyway, what you should really work on is your Super Ego block, so FiSe.**\n\n* Fi : Knowing what you like, what are your tastes, be it in food and drinks (What wine ? What beer do you like ? Sugary foods, salty ones ?), movies, people of the opposite sex (or not. I don't judge), all the emotional stuff too. What are your values ? What do you desire ? What are your dreams,  inspirations and aspirations ? Etc, etc.\n* Se : Being aware of your surroundings. Being "here and now". Reading body language, facial expressions, the way people occupy space. What is weak, what is strong ? All that sensory stuff, the 5 senses, but also the others (like, pain, or the sense of "speed"). It also includes understanding all the powergames and hierarchies going on. Say, how people judge you if you have a weak handshake and don't stare them in the eye ? Se. Two guys preparing to fight ? See how they enter each other's personal space, kinda acts like monkeys showing off muscles ? Se.\n\nThose are our weaknesses. Se more so than Fi.  \n\nFi is our "role function". We try to work at it sporadically, but it's still weak :\n\n* Sometimes, you've got to make a choice, but you don't know what ? Say, at the restaurant ? A quick solution is to say "I will take the same thing"/"Make it two", but that's a crutch. I have some music I like, but TBH, if someone ask me what I like in music, or gives me the role of choosing the playlist, I blank out. (Well, tons of people here say they can't live without music, and I'm definitely not part of that crowd) But anyway, the range of our knowledge is pretty limited, and we tend to do it with Ti, like saying you like something, but it's actually something you determined as the smart/best choice.\n\n**As for Se**, we suck at it. Plain and simple.\n\n* We don't pay attention to anything, that's why we have a reputation for running into walls or spilling people coffees. **It's also why we suck aocially**. All the clues in bodylanguage, facial expression, etc ? We miss them and this oblivious. We also don't "speak" in that domain, basically just standing here like dead fishes, staring at people. It weirds people out, or they think we are judging them. On a metal level, can't socialize if you aren't actually here (ie, playing Wow or browsing at home alone while everyone is partying). We tend to blame Fe for our bad socializing skills, but Se is actually the problem.\n* We also look like wimps for male, and unsensual for girls ? Say, how you get judged if your handshake and didn't stare someone in the eyes ? Se. Ever saw two guys getting into a fight ? Look at how they invade each other personal space, how they do that posturing just like animals. Se too. A girl trying to seduce ? Touching, posturing Se wise, movements, getting closer, etc, etc. Se. It's a whole layer of communication we are ignoring \n* Se is looking at reality (and the reality is that we're just power hungry techno-monkeys. Not nearly as civilized as we think) When they say that 80% of success is showing up, and they mean it. It's particularly true for us.\n\n**The good news is, as part of the "mental ring", it's something you can actually work on. You can switch off of that TiNe for a while, and "experience the world" or whatever.** Read up on body language, or facial expressions and their meaning for example, then trial and error will help improve here. It's also so weak than we can progress easily here. (So what u/LoganE23 said about diminishing returns applies.)\n\n**Improving here will then have positive implications on your SiFe :**  Paying attention will help your Fe to determine the mood, meaning you do better socially. Your Fi will help you develop Si habits/Routine that you are comfortable with/like. \n\nThat's the key right here.\n\n***\n**It will also help with your Id block. As it is, the Id Block, aka NiTe** (and not TeNi. I'm referring to the concept of dimensionality of function of you want more, look it up.) is ignored. But we are actually quite strong at it, we can do what the INTJ do if we want, but here's the thing : We don't...\n\nNi looks like jumping to conclusions to our Ne, while Te looks shallow to us. And thus, we ignore our Id block, and that's wasted potential right here.\n\nYou can make effective plans like the INTJs are said to be able to. \n\nI would actually argue that we can be better at it than them, because INTJs don't just like planning, they actually **need** it :\n\n* They can't really improvise, their Se is the equivalent of our Fe : Present, but not something we can do very well. You cannot leave Fe in charge and obtain good results. As for us, we can improvise. Just do it with Ne, or make a mental switch to Se.\n* If their plan goes wrong, or you prove them wrong, it's actually a hit to their ego (Their own words. I've seen that on their sub). It's Ni+Fi emotional investment/pride, and also an Se touch (Say, if they aren't smart/able to see the future INTJs feel worthless. Pretty funny, actually.) \n\nAnyway, those weaknesses won't matter on us, since we don't care about NiTe. We don't value it. We also can pour our TiNe skills into it, something the INTJs see as overthinking or a waste of time (Then, their plan fail and they get stressed and depressed)\n\n**So now, how does working on SeFi helps ?** Well, Se is data, so the more you have, the more precise the Ni prediction/vision get. Once you know what you want or like (Fi), choosing what to do (Te) becomes straightforward. And since that's under our control, we can regulate our NiTe a bit that way. On one side with TiNe, and FiSe on the other.\n\nBTW, for tapping in the Id block in general, since it's a strength of ours, it's a question of letting go of your TiNe. Unlike TiNe, tho, we can't use it all day, so I would recommend to time yourself, so you know how much time you can spend in it, and thus, use it strategically. \n\n***\n**Tl,Dr : Work on that FiSe. It will boost everything. You will have to take time off your TiNe, but you spend already too much time there, anyway.**\n\n\n\n
2	IMO it’s best to improve your weakness up to a certain acceptable point that you can keep up with others in that regard, but once you reach diminishing returns, start focusing more on maximizing your natural strengths. \n\nI started out with my social weaknesses. Overcame social anxiety with daily exposure, improved my social skills any way I could, forced myself to meet many people and be a social butterfly. And I worked on reaching an “above average” level of social acceptability, by learning to dress well, make better first impressions, getting into shape, etc. \n\nSoon I hit a plateau and found that no matter what, I was never going to be as outgoing or high energy as a lot of others (I certainly tried). I then got a lot of success by using my established confidence/clout/social skills to convey my weirder side in such a way that I could stand out and it would be more endearing rather than off-putting. And I started focusing more on learning in my own time, reading 1 - 2 books a week. 
1	Los dos
1	I could never separate and identify my strengths and weaknesses like that. Sort of like asking whether the band U2 or the color red are better.  \n\nLife is not something that you can plan and strategize. It is something that happens to and around you. No matter how well you plan, things will turn out very different. Instead of thinking so much about what to say or not say, just be. \n\nAnd if you really want to live and die alone, go to some remote mountain in Canada. Of course, food might be difficult, and your batteries would run out. The winters might be cold and harsh. Come to think of it, I think you would get to the dying alone part pretty quickly.\n\nYou need people, and other people need you. Quit fighting that and start celebrating it. Give it ten years, and you will be a very different person. Don't think that you have the answers now. If you did, the rest of life would be boring instead of an adventure.
124	I procrastinated on watching a video advising against procrastination and dropped it in my watch later list , now i procrastinate further from watching the video because i feel guilty for procrastinating from watching the video for 9 months now, watch later suggestions haunt me now and then.	
15	My watch later list is at over 100 now 😂
5	My watch later list have 250 videos 😂
4	Every few months I will wipe out a whole "watch later" playlist without even looking at it & it's quite liberating. I rationalize by thinking "Well if you ain't watched it already it obviously wasn't that interesting/important."
3	I love having like 30+ tabs in the chrome on "to read" list :3 same on the phone. Links to articles in the notes on the whole PC screen etc. :> I once was hunting for a rare old book. It took me 5 years to get it in reasonable price and well I didn't read it since then - 4 years.
2	you probably won't stop procrastinating for very long after watching it, so keep it for a rainy day, like right before a big project you know you might leave before finishing.  
2	To help stop this, I make an agenda of what I watch in my recommended, and will be super. Ocd if I don't watch it. 
2	You should use my tactic. I call it precrastination. When I’m deciding to put something off I check it to see if it will be easier to accomplish now or later. If it’s easier now I do it. If it’s equal do it as well.
1	Delete the video from the list.  An Youtube video is not going to help with you procrastination and it's not worth your guilt.
1	you know, you might as well watch it right now and get it over with.
1	Mine is over 9000.
1	you should procrastinate on not shuttin da fuck up
1	Penalty - over use of the word “now”
594	Interesting way to look at it. What do you think?	
190	I'm motivated about what I'm interested in... nothing else.
106	Well he isn't that wrong...\nBut there are many times, I am just f*cking unmotivated!
42	I’ve been sitting in my car for three hours knowing what I want. Have I worked towards that at all? No. Now I have anxiety. Partly because it seems so distant.
71	"A loose attachment to outcomes" is the exact lack of motivation itself. The outcome of a goal is the main source of motivation for most people who endure things they don't enjoy. They hate every moment of what they are doing...but they will be at the top of the world a few years later when they have achieved their goal, and that's enough to keep them going.\n\nFor me, those goals are far too distant to provide any motivation. It doesn't help that I have the "I don't even know if I will be alive tomorrow and you expect me to know where I'll be in 10 years?" attitude. If I'm not enjoying what I'm doing right now, then I don't give a shit how beneficial it may potentially be in the future.
23	Definitely true for me... I’m involved in too many activities and have too many projects I’m working on at once so sometimes I just shutdown and work on none of them cause I don’t know what to do first or how to start.
18	too many motivations... more like too many interests.  \nloose attachment to outcomes...more like pragmatic expectations that constantly reevaluate potential reward vs costs.\nWhy am I so unmotivated? Too many interests that are pragmatically reevaluated against cost of endeavor. Dopamine from easy sources ultimately more rewarding than the evaluation of cost that must occur before taking on any task. \n
10	I feel like it’s a mix for me.\n\nPart of what makes me seem unmotivated to do one thing definitely is that I have so many things that I want to do and it feels hard to pick a single one and not feel like I’m wasting time by not doing the others.\n\nBut at the same time, while I have a lot of things that I’m motivated to do in principle, I often lack the motivation to actually work to get them done. 
10	My main paralyzing weakness is the attitude that I have to "keep my options open." I am so afraid of the opportunity cost of any possible path that I end up doing nothing instead, ironically losing out on 100% of the options instead of the 90% I was afraid of missing out on.\n\nI have to remind myself that nobody can do everything all at once. It's better to go all in on something, find out it's shit, and move on than it is to do nothing at all.
9	Accurate.\n\nSometimes I'm surprised by how hardcore into some things I get. Then eventually I drop it because I have to do something else. Eventually everything gets that hard drop. The stuff I like I'll go back to eventually but staying with things constantly is just a drag. Even purely fun stuff. I don't get how some people can play the dame game for months or even years on end.
7	The motivation lies in conceptualization, not in realization. It relies on finding the answer, not acting on it.\n\nIt sucks
7	We are motivated.  We're just not motivated about the things other people care about or think are important.\n\nThe collective doesn't get to decide what matters to us.\n\nI'm motivated to understand things and be correct.  I want to learn and figure stuff out.  I don't have any need to do anything with that knowledge.  Once I do figure something out, that topic becomes boring and I move on; it's the puzzle that motivates me, not the utility.
6	I feel like INTPs have potential to be a polymath or a Renaissance man. It seems to me that that's my biggest self-actualization goal. To be an engineer, musician, painter, etc or artist in general. Too much I want to do but so hard to just commit.\n\nThen I queue up for ranked and go for diamond on league, smh.
4	Our accomplishments are theoretical, and we always have to make sure before we act. Not too surprising it seems like we are unmotivated, when projecting the average person's goals onto INTP.
4	Lets do some work boys
3	Great way to put it. It's really that loose attachment that gets me. Especially once you sprinkle in enough time to have fully comprehended most of the futility in everything. 
4	Yeah, I mean, that's pretty well known of INTP's. Personally, I have 3 tiers of interests. 3rd tier is something I wanna do but then I think about the end outcome and decide its not worth it for the effort. 2nd, I dabble. I have like 5 of these hobbies that I dabble in from time to time; I'm currently reading 4 books, over the span of 3 years, I have a mountain bike that I haven't used, and a recurve bow that i need to buy arrows for. 1st tier is one or two things that I actively practice but, even then it's a battle of "is it worth it?". 
7	Motivated = Wanting to do something. Unmotivated = Not wanting to do something. \n\nPeople talk of it like it's some kind of magical energy that applies everywhere, but it isn't. You're motivated for the stuff you like to do, or by potential reward for something you don't want to do as compensation. (The other motivator would be fear Ie, of losing stuff, missing something. Anything hurting your interests.)\n\nSo, we aren't motivated most of the time, because other people's plans or the stuff we "should/have to do" simply don't interest us, so we don't show motivation for it. There's no reason to. Simple as that.\n\nThat guy's answer may be right about our own project though.
3	I am motivated and focused until something more interesting presents itself
3	Less motivated by monetary return I'd say.
3	The very essence of my being has been examined.
2	Just to give an alternative perspective, I've never lacked motivation.  Yes, in school I always waited til the last night to do a project.  I've always procrastinated because there is a certain energy that I get at the last minute.  But, for the most part, I'm a hard worker.  Lacking motivation may be an age thing, not an INTP thing.
2	Pulling from ye ole box o' memories, I lost motivation towards any project or field of interest mainly due to the fact that no one, at that time, was interested nor remotely attuned to whatever I say. Adding to the fact that I was unaware of the crippling depression that has already crept upon me, it made things much, much worse. It's always, *"I want to do this, or that but... no one seems to bother... forget it."*\n\n\nSelf-fulfilling prophecy as others may have pointed it out to me. Having known of this life-long relationship with depression and a few more experiences under my skin, things get so much better.
2	The common thing about this type is “collecting data”, so there’s no concrete practical outcome. Maybe one could be interested in being an artist and will explore tons of other related subjects(because everything’s related for real), like different types of art...pottery, paint, sculpture, fashion,...that’s gonna take a while already, science and how it relates to art, music too, etc. It’s like many trails that aren’t very well paved yet. And they’re lazy, but people are lazy. \n\nIt’s just a trait and might change later when the time comes. 
2	I'm on the other side of quite a confusing part of my life, and I can honestly say I'm nowhere near as side-tracked by hobbies as I used to be.\n\nWhilst I was at university however, I played games every day, I picked up Spanish and completed the Duolingo course, I learned to solve a Rubik's cube in 20s, I got interesting in programming, I got interested in music, I got interested in psychology, I got interested in Brazilian jiu jitsu, I got interested in gliding, I got interested in calligraphy, i got interested in drawing, I got interested in mandarin, I got interested in running, I got interested in weightlifting, I got interested in nutrition, I got interested in stocks and shares, and probably many more, all whilst juggling an extremely toxic relationship and doing the minimal work for my actual degree in physics, which is why I got kicked out. Almost all of these interests came to a prompt end after a few weeks.\n\nNowadays, I've picked back up and consistently maintained an interest in music, psychology, fitness, nutrition, and travel, with an infrequent playing around with my speed-cube and some Spanish. At work, I'm normally a really hard worker, but I'm beginning to want a little more from life than working in fast food lol.\n\nI don't know whether this progress is testament to my own self-improvement, or just because I actually have free time to do things I want to do, rather than the *constant* pressure of the education system -- I suspect the latter. I'm interested to know if those of you who are out of all education are still as scatterbrained as you may have used to be. Personally, the new awareness of what life after education would be actually like, and actually having *free* time (rather than time I should be revising or catching up on things I've avoided), has given me a new perspective which I think I'm happier with, but I want to know your opinions.
2	I've started to address this issue. I long for the sensation of mastery. I want to look back on my life at the end and feel proud and certain of my accomplishments. It took me a long time to arrive at this realization naturally. Had to look closely at Peter Pan syndrome and commit unflinchingly to something I truly thought mattered.
2	Well if i lived in a universe where we i can enact my wills without the limitation of effort and time i think i would probably be amongst the busiest and most accomplished of all.
2	Every intuitive perceiver\n\nAlso, a lack of attachment to outcome is literally a lack of motivation. Only the intp would try to conceive of unmotivated motivation and think it's real lol.
1	a little accurate 
1	Our virtue vs vice is Attentiveness vs Apathy so take that with a grain of salt
1	Woah. 
1	Adhd stimulant medication often greatly helps with various dopamine and adrenalin dysregulation NTPs seem to have, especially analysis paralysis and dopamine seeking behaviors. 
1	I actually perform much worse when I do get attached to outcomes 
1	Basically, everything becomes boring and predictable and the expectation to find something new every-time lands up being not so fulfilled and then ultimately finding something interesting becomes the only aim. So, Yes we lack motivation until we find something which is interesting enough to keep going for...
1	It is a play of words, not an explanation. He twisted the meaning of "unmotivated". If you are capable to do something but in result doing nothing, you are unmotivated, regardless of reasons.
1	I am exactly at a point of my life that struggle most with this issue. The point is our previous generation had heaven and hell to motivate them, and now we are almost randomly searching through the phase space of the world to find a new heaven and hell. And we have it, but because we are the generation that already broke a sacred concept, we are extremely skeptic about the concept of having concept itself. You just need to look at a smart 15 years old born in a family who doesn’t give a shit about religion, and listen what they think about robots. That’s our struggle, and as I trapped so many times for the motivation books and planning workshops, I deeply know that that’s not the source of the problem, it is like your water pipe is broken and you try to plan to how clean the room and deplete the water, but you should buy a new pipe. I am unsuccessfully and deeply trying for years now to build a heaven and hell for myself. I reached to the anti-aging and AGI research, and I actually have a plan for it, but motivation is a whole different thing. It is not yet like religion with a lot priest every day and night preaching in my ears about heaven and hell and everybody around me believe in it, so I feel detached and hardly motivated to do anything about it, and actually our biological and job needs are too demanding to have any energy to deal with it. I am trying to psychoanalyse myself to the full believe. The world is not random, it has a trajectory.
1	I don't really agree. A lot of the time I'm only half-interested in something, so not interested enough to actually do anything and therefore, unmotivated. I do think the definition of motivation has been changed a bit here too. We might have a lot of thoughts/ideas, but that's not the same as motivation. I think you could also make a case for lack of motivation being due to apathy. I agree with the general disinterest in conclusions though. If I actually follow through with my ideas what will I have to think about? 
1	I keep changing my priorities and current interests in very short intervals (days or weeks) so I can never get anything major done even though I'm keeping myself busy all the time.\n\nI mean I'm happy that there are so many things that interest me but if I could somehow learn how to focus on one thing for a longer period of time then I'd be able to put up great results.
1	If the child abuse theory holds up, thats probably a reason too
1	This is a mere rationalization that needs to be overcome.
1	I don't believe it.
-1	You can't know any INTPS closely if you're asking that question. 
-2	no this is retarded i literally just won't get the fuck off the couch because im lazy don't justify me
11	Need help/advice -INTP	Hi there. Needing some advice for social situations and I will try not to ramble, no promises though. \n\nI'm 27 female INTP. Recently started a new job. I was at my last job for about 2 years and would eat lunch by myself in my car, avoiding all social contact. It was lonely, but comfortable. I wanted to make friends but then it became a habit and too difficult to change and interject myself in groups.\n\nNow my new job. This place is basically like a college campus but everyone is overly friendly and start conversations with strangers in the elevator. Weird, but nice? I started 3 weeks of training with one other person, an INFJ, this is prior to being placed on a team. We've become friendly and started having lunch together. It's sometimes been awkward but I'm getting used to it.\n\nSo we've recently been placed on our teams, different teams. Yesterday, one of my team members invited me to lunch with the team so I said yes. Felt bad because I have my other friend too but don't feel like inviting another person is my place because I'm new.. I know I need to become friendly with my team because they are going to be useful for being successful at my job. Anyway lunch was awkward, I talked some but not much because there was around 8 people (which is about 6 too many). I made a joke trying to correlate left-handedness with sociopathy and no one laughed. Cool.\n\nI stressed all night about what I'm going to do today for lunch. I was invited for group lunch again, I said I might go. And I should go, but it's so uncomfortable right now.. Then a few minutes later my friend asked me to lunch via skype, I told her I was invited with my team so she went by herself. I feel bad and told her at my old job I would eat by myself in my car to avoid these kind of decisions. She laughed and said at least people want to eat lunch with me. So it's time for lunch and I tell my team I have an errand to run. Which was not true..... \nSo now I've isolated myself today from both parties to avoid being uncomfortable with a group? to avoid making a decision? to avoid hurt feelings? Or all 3. I don't know. I don't want to get into this pattern again and would like to have "friends" again.. it's been so long since I have. Is there a bigger problem here? Social anxiety? Or is it just a product of being an INTP? I called my husband at lunch and told him him what happened. He asked if I have some sort of high functioning autism.. which I don't think I do...\n\nAnyway, I rambled. Thanks for reading if you did. Can anyone relate to this? Have any suggestions or advice? How do you all make social decisions? And what's the most INTP thing that you've done today?
11	I would just put it out on the table. Tell your new team that you've been having lunch with someone and maybe they could join in the lunch because you would feel bad for ditching them.\n\nI don't see how it can go wrong.\n\nEdit: just realized you're going to have to invite your outside friend. If they decline, then you must decide which side to join. This I cannot help with. 
10	To be quite frank, it seems like you're over thinking your social situations. It sounds like you were far too focussed on the "not making them uncomfortable" that it probably showed that *you* were uncomfortable, which can severely hinder several things, especially joke delivery.\n\nAnd quite simply the solution is to let go. Be weird, but not awkward. People will forget your faux pas (as long as it's not severe) or joke about it later, but the lasting impact (as I've noticed) tends to be your *energy*.\n\nTalk about what interests you, or add some sarcastic banter to what they're already talking about. It will seem weird and self centered, but I've been told this is one of the things people like about me. I tell bad jokes (a lot of them) but the good ones make it worth it. I go into a rabbit hole about certain things and discuss it with friends. I have a lot of encyclopedic knowledge that they seem to be interested in hearing. And they like that. Probably not a one-size-fits-all solution, but it seems to work for me.
5	Yes! I’m in similar circumstances. 35 F intp who used to eat lunch in my car! Lol at my current job I don’t allow myself to do that because I’m becoming aware of the repercussions of having no social awareness, and have adapted to assimilate enough to strengthen future prospects of advancement here.\n\n1) make yourself accept 80-90% of social invitations from colleagues. While there, make eye contact and smile more than is comfortable. \n\n2) don’t let anyone see you eat lunch in your car! If you need that space, drive to a nearby park or quiet area and eat lunch in your car there. 
5	That sounds very familiar. I would point out, however, that your statement that " It was lonely, but comfortable" makes no sense to me. In my own experience, loneliness is not comfortable.  Just a thought.\n\nIt sounds this group from work has lunch together every day. As someone else suggested, I think that you could choose days to dine with them and other days to dine with your friend.  Maybe the group gets MWF and your friend gets TuTh, or the other way around.\n\nI totally get your comment that 8 people is 6 too many. I have learned to be in and participate with groups, but it is a different me. In normal social situations, I have learned to look at the people in the group and to notice the ones who are kind of on the edge. Usually they are standing next to me. And then I wait and watch until they say something. It usually is a comment that really does not further the group conversation, and if it is acknowledged, it is not where the group does.  I look for that because for so long, I found myself doing just that. I would say something like your joke about left handed sociopaths (I am a left handed altruistic psychopath myself), and people would look at me before moving on. \n\nWhen I see that happen, I approach the person and say something like "Your comment about left handed sociopaths was so true. How did you come up with that?" The look I usually get in response is priceless. They seem dumbfounded that someone listened to what they said and even more baffled that someone cared enough to ask a question. And then I have a conversation with that person. My focus is on learning who they are and what they have to teach me.  Everyone has something to teach me. Sometimes it is just us and sometimes others join the conversation. Sometimes it develops into a friendship and other times it ends there. But I always enjoy it, and it feels a lot better to me than loneliness.\n\nCouldn't you do something like that at the office lunches? Look at the others and see if anyone else seems to in the same mental place you are. Sit next to them and strike up a conversation with just them. Not hard to do at a lunch with 8 people. Who knows, maybe there is more than one of them in the group.\n\nI have discovered that this process changes my interaction with the group. Once I have a relationship with another group member, I feel like part of the group. I get drawn into the other person's interactions with others in the group, and as I get to know the others, I relax and enjoy myself.\n\nIf you are like me, there is no way that you can just join a group of 8 people.  I think that is what happens in hell. But if you remember that a group is 8 people, and that you do not have to interact with all of them at once, I suspect that you will find them welcoming. At this point in my life, I have a much abbreviated version of my process. If it much easier for me to comfortably fit in with new groups.  I gave nothing up, just learned to relax and quit predicting catastrophes. 
3	**Bad advice:** take a flask to work. You'll at least be more social.\n\n**Good advice:** I don't think this is *just being an INTP*, but it's probably not helping. I have this same inclination after social gatherings--that irksome feeling that no one could possibly enjoy my company. But it's not true for me, and it's not true for you either. They have asked you to go to lunch, so obviously they like you! If it makes conversation easier, look them up on social media, figure out a common interest, and talk about that. TV, movies, podcasts - all pretty safe bets.\n\nAs for this weird scheduling thing, why don't you split your time? Lunch with you INFJ friend two days a week, lunch with the group two days a week, and just chill in the break room and read a book the other day. Or mix it up however you like. That way you have some alone time, but you're not eating in your car like a hermit.\n\nSocial decisions for me are easy. Am I too tired to go? Will someone I hate be there? Are we doing something that sounds truly awful? Do I just not feel like going? No. Then, I guess I'll go. The most INTP thing I did today was write our office's daily "Would You Rather?" You'd be surprised how much some people will appreciate how goddamn weird INTPs are. Maybe reading it will help you feel better: **Would you rather . . .**\n\nBe filthy rich, but famous for something that everyone universally hates? While everyone will be nice and try to befriend you because of your wealth, you’ll know they’re all laughing at you behind your back. The exception is your one true friend, Rebecca Black, who always lets you sit in the front seat and goes to parties with you. Unfortunately, she’s developed such a thick British accent that she’s almost impossible to understand.\n\n*OR*\n\nLive in a parallel universe where work week is comprised as follows: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Friday? You only work on Fridays, but your income remains the same as if you worked 40+ hours a week. Every Friday evening from 8pm-12am, you attend an Old West themed costume party with Rebecca Black, where everyone is wearing 10 gallon hats and the only song that plays is a country remix of “Friday.”\n\n&#x200B;
2	Pretend you are a social butterfly. Their moto is always "the more the merrier". Thus you should always invite everyone to lunch together. No one can possibly object without being seen as antisocial. You always win.
2	I would've laughed at that left-handed joke.\n\nStrangely, anytime my husband and I find something to be dumb we say it's left-handed.
2	LOL, this might be the most INTP post I’ve ever read here. Amirite u/Cryochrome?!?!\n\nOP, here’s a good habit to help you when you need to decline invitations: when you say no, always suggest a counteroffer. “I can’t, my team invited me, but which day can you do next week?”\n\n(Source: just passing it forward from another INTP on this forum when I once asked a similar question.)\n\nIn this situation, it’s basically professional suicide to decline lunch invitations from your team. However, I think most reasonable people would be understanding if you told them every once in a while (especially in advance) that you’ll be having lunch with a different friend instead to catch up. 
1	> I made a joke trying to correlate left-handedness with sociopathy and no one laughed. Cool.\n\nLegit chuckled. Keeping quiet is fine. People just need to not feel judged, so don't try to force yourself. Beside, being at 0 is better than being at -100\n\n> I stressed all night about what I'm going to do today for lunch. I was invited for group lunch again, I said I might go. And I should go, but it's so uncomfortable right now..\n\nActual overthinking, which makes you awkward, which makes you lonely. Repeat. \n\n> Is there a bigger problem here? Social anxiety?\n\nCould be. I can't tell from such a post where you probably exaggerated it. It seems anxiety kinda is a spectrum to me. \n\nI can't really relate, even if I'm not very social, I'm confident in myself enough to talk to people. Like, my problem was (and still is) that I cared too little for what people thought of me, not too much. So I wouldn't say it's an INTP thing, even though there are post here often about people with anxiety of sort. (Mistypes, or a subset of INTPs who suffer from it ? Both, probably.)\n\n> Have any suggestions or advice? How do you all make social decisions? \n\nWhen you're out, don't focus on being witty or whatever. Just try to pay attention to your surroundings, people, etc.  Read facial expressions, body language, but also how people occupy space, are they close or not, what groups form, etc. All of this is Se, whichbis our blindspots function. Basically, we don't pay attention to our surroundings (thus our reputation for running into poles or spilling everyone's coffees). That has an impact on our ability to read the mood. It's not just Fe, it's SeFe. \n\nThat's the INTP type weakness, maybe not a solution to your problem, but would help eitheir way. \n\n> And what's the most INTP thing that you've done today?\n\nIt's morning, so not much yet. Due to my fucked up sleep schedule, I waked up at 2AM (now it's 7:30) and I just lazed around. I can tell what I did yesterday, though : I stayed at home, browsed the internet and forgot to eat.
1	If it’s just “people on the same team going to lunch” vs. “lets have lunch together as a team”, you should invite your friend along.\n\nFriend: “Lunch?”\n\nTeam: “Lunch?”\n\nYou: “@Team, mind if I invite my friend from \norientation along?”\n\nTeam: “sure thing!”\n\nYou: “@Friend, OK! some people on my team are going right now, want to join us?”\n\nFriend: “Sure, see you there”\n\nThis is a win:win:win. Congratulations, you just completed some social coordination :)
-3	I want to talk to people but I don't want to talk to people? Should I talk to people? \n\nEveryone: Yes, talk to people!\n\nOP: Oh, Great Idea! Why didn't I think of that?
3	drunken INTPs, what is your poison?	also, what is your chosen drunken activity? if any
6	None. When I am drunk, I sit and think or just consciously feel the experience of being drunk. No desire to go do anything.  Well, sex, but that doesn't really count.\n\nOh and my poison? To be drunk, Tequila. If I want to enjoy the process, Chartreuse.
5	Literally no preference whatsoever. Booze is just booze. I don’t care what kind it is, no matter how fine or cheap. 
4	cyanide is a pretty effective poison with a 97% kill rate
4	Mixed drinks of something sweet + vodka, dark beer, or wine. \n\nFavorite is pineapple juice, grenadine, and vodka( white rum works too) \n\nDancing or watching shitty movies/ tv shows \n
3	Weed. Every day.
1	I like fireball best, and my activities are my own business.
1	Am I the only one who’d get drunk and spend hours browsing PubMed.  Or looking at old maps and census records?
1	My go-to is vodka soda with a splash of coconut water and lime (low calorie, I can convince myself I'm not slowly drinking myself to death). Also, tequila shots. I love tequila. \nFavorite activity? I love playing cards or Super Smash Bros with my husband when we drink. Amazing amount of fun. 
1	Brewskies, and scotch. 
1	I handle alcohol insanely well. Under the influence I just act normal but more open to talk and that's it 
1	I avidly enjoy craft beers. When I'm drunk, I like to play guitar, play card/board games with my bf, have conversations about literally anything with said bf and of course do the sex.\n\nA few times a year (maybe 5 at most) I got to EDM raves that involve alcohol, in those cases gin and tonics with a sugared lemon are my drink of choice, with a jager bomb thrown in there somewhere.
1	Usually bourbon, or at least some form of whiskey. My activity is usually playing elite dangerous and shit talking my friends while I try not to die.
1	Sober ATM\nBeer usually.
0	Depends on the situation. For boring days of doing nothing, an 18 pack of cheap beer usually lasts all day and night. Sometimes I had to go to the store for a 2nd pack. \n\nA cheap 1.75 liter of Vodka with Tonic water was another of my favorites (quinine is reallllly underrated)\n\nOccasionally i'd mix it up with a 1.75 bottle of a dry Merlot. The buzz from wine is really fun but always made me feel worse the next day than beer or liquor. \n\nSometimes i'd buy between 1-3 of the 99 cherries for a dollar each for an extra punch. \n\nIf i'm driving somewhere on the highway i'd get a 4 pack of 16oz Icehouse and pour it into an empty styrafoam cup from the store. \n\nFavorite drunken activity? None required, it made me feel happy. \n\nTrying to put all that behind me now. It's only been a week but I have a feeling i'll make good progress this time around. 
2	Any of you guys successfully achieved astro projection?	I've tried it a couple of times and my body forgot how to fall asleep (I physically couldn't sleep even if I was really tired). Plus I became hyper aware of my body (not very pleasant), I can feel my heart palpitations and bloodflow from and to my limbs. Took me a about 3 weeks to return to normal last time.\n\nI don't believe in spiritual bullshit. However, retaining consciousness while in my dreams sounds really exciting. \n\nJust wondering if anyone had an experience with it in this sub. 
5	Astral projection.
4	I've done it once. Was a pretty intense experience, and years later when I smoked DMT it was a very similar feeling, but not as intense (the DMT was not as strong as the projection). \nI'm not big on spiritual stuff either, but that is one thing that my logic brain struggles to explain.
4	Actually, this who existence sort of feels like astral projection. 
2	I had a very strange experience while being awake with sleep paralysis. I explained it to someone and they said it was an astral projection... but i'm not sure. I was seeing other dimensions while being awake and unable to move though. It was terrifying. 
1	yeah
1	I wish I could try astral projection but I can't get my mind to settle down and do it convincingly. I tried it once and I enjoyed it, but that was back then when I wasn't the nutcase I am now.
1	INTP, recently typed as ISFP?	Around a week ago I posted [a type me request](https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/aqmxny/type_me_im_never_100_sure_of_my_type/) on r/MbtiTypeMe. I did this because I'm never confident in my typing, and like to be typed again occasionally to help assure me I'm in the right place. However, the result of this typing surprised me. Even though only two users replied, they both gave answers other than INTP. One gave a brief typing of ISTP with ISFP as possibility, while the other gave an in-depth typing of ISFP with INFP as a possibility. What do you think?
4	I would take what you got from that server with a grain of salt. I did some quick browsing and its pretty yikes over there. There could be some truth to their initial type analysis but really the only people that can really type you are people that are close to you or yourself. You need to read up on the cognitive functions of the types that you think you are; and decide for yourself if you fit into that type category.
3	I think you should hang out in the ISTP, ISFP, and INFP subreddits for a bit and see how it feels.  I first typed myself as INTP because that is what every test I took said, but once I found this place, I just knew that I had found my people, and that matters to me more than any test.  The ISTP, ISFP, and INFP subreddits mostly make my skin crawl. They are from another place and time. Likewise, if you are ISTP, ISFP, or INFP, it is hard to see how this place would make for a pleasant visit.\n\nFind your people, and you have found yourself.
2	I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to type someone based off some random stuff they post about themselves. \n\nI’m very confident that I could get myself typed as every single last one of the 16 types in such a community while keeping all the information I share about myself 100% factually correct. 
1	I dunno if that sub is any good, same for that questionnaire. To,Dr ish to me, so I bet people will judge on limited info 
1	Ayyy
1	Different tests seem to give me different results but always the same result on each one. For example i ALWAYS get Intp on 15personalities but ISTP on johns mbti test.\nWho knows
1	same thing here, I dunno why.
1	Do INTPs tend to be more frequent procrastinators than other types?	
5	"I wait until the very last day to complete my work,\nwhen I will have more wisdom than today"\n- a quote from somewhere, idk too lazy to look up
2	i sure do it a lot. my enfp boyfriend tends toward procrastination too. i think it may be an NP thing
2	Yeah I’ve been procrastinating my whole life.
0	Anyone else worried about fluoride damage?	There is no reason for this shit to be in the drinking water. The more I read about it the more angry i'm getting. I rarely drink tap water (can't remember if I did often as a kid or not). But I was filling ice cube trays with tap water. I rarely use ice though. Now i'm paranoid to even use fluoride toothpaste or rinse food with water from the tap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPicture of calcified gland\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9rLfn0qZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9rLfn0qZo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst Study\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5620462/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5620462/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary from 1st study posted above:\n\nCone-beam computer tomography\n\nSubjects from North Eastern United States\n\n58% of Subjects had calcified glands\n\nNo (statistically meaningful) correlation between sex or age\n\nAlso, no information on possible causes.

4	Yep. Makes no sense why it’s added to water when fluoridated toothpaste exists and is more effective. Once you go down the rabbit hole though, it just gets weirder and weirder. Like why are we dumping a chemical byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry (hydrofluorosilicic acid) into everyone’s water... without their consent ... for the sake of “lower cavity rates.” News flash, kids still have a shit ton of cavities all the while Coporate america is 75% fluoridated. Everyone knows sugar consumption is directly correlated with cavities and tooth decay... but no it would be awful to prevent cavities by looking at the root cause. Instead, we should obviously pay big industries loads of taxpayer money to dump into the water of everyone... all without their consent. That’s what a western country that boasts freedom and individual rights would do... All the most up to date science has proven 1) that consuming fluoridated water does not reduce cavities by any significant number. 2) If fluoride works at all in preventing tooth decay, it is by topical means. It is absolutely not necessary and even potentially harmful to expose every organ in your body to industrial waste chemicals. 3) There are various links between certain diseases and consumption of fluoride. Namely, hypothyroidism, osteosarcoma, lower IQ in children. 4) The avg fluoride concentration of fresh surface waters is about 0.10ppm. Now compare that with the “optimal concentration” (this optimal concentration has been revised several times) of 0.7ppm. Who in their right mind would think that getting 7 times the dose than we would get in nature is smart? And to be clear, before it was suggested the optimal dose was 1ppm. Well why was it lowered? Because turns out consuming fluoridated water at 1ppm can actually cause dental fluorosis which is a pitting and or staining of the teeth which ultimately WEAKENS teeth. It is estimated now that roughly half the teenage population in america has some degree of dental fluorisis. This is what it looks like: http://www.fluoridealert.org/wp-content/uploads/fluorosis-comp.gif\n\nThe bizarre thing is this unscientific practice continues because of health organizations piggybacking off other health organizations. (The ADA supports so we support it. And so so supports it so we support it and on and on.) Read the NRC review from 2006 and it becomes obvious the trial for fluoridation is still happening. Our knowledge on its effects are limited, yet we seem to be certain it’s harmless for every single person to bathe in everyday, to consume everyday in food and beverages, regardless of health, or age etc. \n\nDon’t even get me started on how the concentration fluoridated water is simply too high for babies! By using tap water to make infant formula, a baby will receive a much higher dose of fluoride than it would receive from mother’s milk. But fluoride’s perfectly safe for everyone, regardless of health or age... 🙄\n\nWhat’s even sad is how brainwashed people are that they truly believe fluoridated water is good and “scientific.” I guess that is what good propaganda does. 
4	Just wait till you find out about the shape of the earth 
2	Nope... not worried in the slightest.
2	I have no idea how to weigh the legitimacy of the studies you link, but I do sometimes worry that I'm fucking up my shit with fluoride.
1	Dude, Indiana has the worst water quality of all the states.\nWe have bigger concerns than fluoride. \nThe water from my bathroom turns shit orange, and I have no idea why. None of the other sinks do that.
1	u/treebeard____ is a deep state shill, or an unpaid moron. Either way, best to permanently block this idiot. 
3	So you guys like mental stimulation? Like through conversations and stuff like that.	So I started becoming interested in MBTI when I took the test and wanted to know more about myself when it said I was an ENTP. And then I learned about INFJs based on a friend who took the test and discussed this stuff with me. And then I learned about the ENTJ and INTJ based on two other friends who took it. Then the ENFP, ESTP, ISTP, and ESFJ.  I don’t get too interested in the other types till I know someone who takes the test and I have a lot of insight on them, I use this tool, MBTI, to understand them even more. And now with my little brother being an ISFJ, I’m going to learn about that one too. And this whole time I was interested mainly in the NTs, but I don’t know any INTPs, so I never looked into it. And the person that I want to understand more now by understanding INTPs, is someone that I see myself being in a relationship with. So I really want to understand INTP really well. \n\nI know I have a lot of reading to do and all of that, but I just wanted some human insight from y’alls 
8	So, a few thoughts that I hope can help you get closer to this INTP you want to date:\n\nWe need lots of alone time. Then... we need an extravert to yank us out of that alone time and force us to be social for a little bit. After being social for a little bit (a little bit to you, a lot to one of us) we need to be alone again.\n\nWe love to make weird puns. You may think they are dumb and you may not get the reference. You don't have to fake a laugh, but being honest and telling us "I don't understand the pun, tell me about it" and we'll be happy to explain.\n\nYou need to make the first move for just about anything. Always. That will never change. Get used to it, and don't ever get angry about it. We don't like a final decision almost ever. However, we usually have no issue with some extrovert coming along and deciding what to do that night. Why? Because either we aren't going to do it so it doesn't matter, or we feel like being sociable and the context or activity within which we are sociable doesn't matter so much. Also, because we don't usually socialize very much we don't really know what to go and do, so we're more than happy to defer to an "expert".\n\nIf we're quiet, it's because we're thinking. It means we don't want to talk.\n\nWatching physics videos on youtube while sitting on the couch and eating sushi is probably the best thing in the entire world, whether someone else is there or not.\n\nI could go on but I have to get home and literally try to come up with an excuse as to why I can't go play billiards with my two friends tonight.
7	Don’t worry, we don’t know any INTPs either.
5	We actually hate mental stimulation. What we really like is to watch Julia Roberts movies.\n\nTruthfully, most INTPs are so stuck in their heads that they would take mental stimulation over sexual stimulation - that or check their phones for updates during the act. INTPs also can be selfish and demanding about their ways, rejecting any interest in your ways and demanding time alone to think. \n\nThat was me for a long time. I am 54 now and transformed into something totally different many times. I have come to see my thoughts as things instead of as me. I have learned to accept and even welcome my feelings and emotions. I no longer need to be right about everything or show the world that I am right. \n\nMy wife is INFJ, and we have been married 31 years. I have had to make more changes and accommodations over the years because she was willing to change for and accommodate me from the beginning. It really was not equal or equitable. Instead of feeling like I lost or gave things up, I feel like I have discovered things that my younger self refused to see. \n\nINTPs are like French bread. They are hard and crusty on the outside but soft and yummy on the inside.
1	As an ENTP, if you're relatively compatible in your default states. If you want to improve that, here are a few tips from an INTP:  \n\n\n1) Remain reasonable. This shouldn't be hard for you.  \n2) Remain genuinely engaged; this will actually be easier for you than the INTP, and it's important the INTP does it too, so help them if you can.  \n3) If your INTP pal seems to be getting upset, take the initiative and ask if anything is wrong. Sometimes we don't realize we're feeling a certain way until someone points out external signs to us.  \n4) Take the initiative with scheduling dates/hang-out time/collaboration/whatever. We want to hang with you; we just aren't sure how to go about setting that up and would rather you work the logistics out.  \n5) Give your INTP pal plenty of time alone to work on their projects, think, and regenerate.  \n

2	I've been told that I accidentally flirt. It seems I lead people on by accident but if I actually try, I'm god awful. Probably because if I talk to someone, I'm intrigued in the conversation and my excitement makes me seem flirtatious. I never realize they like me until too late though. Soml

5	Comfort and Thinking	To cut it to the chase, I went through a very traumatic episode alone, *completely.* But during this episode, I was the pure definition of INTP. I was able to think in abstractions at very good speed and my intuition was tuned (But I was lowkey devoid of emotions and I was always stressed/ insomniac). Now I have good friends around me(I never had any) but I can't think and I'm apathetic, very much so. I never re-opened the wound, never talked about it and I don't plan to. Is it possible that listening to feelings and admitting I need people have damaged my ability to think rationally? How do I return back to being myself again? 
9	\> Is it possible that listening to feelings and admitting I need people have damaged my ability to think rationally? \n\n\> How do I return back to being myself again? \n\nThat gave me a good laugh - good hearted, not critical or cynical. You have feelings. You always have and you always will. Not listening to them is denying a part of yourself and denying life itself. You need other people, but so does everyone else, so some people need you. A lot of INTPs try to to shut down and deny both their emotions and their need for other people. But we cannot control emotions, and they will escape the containment every time. \n\nThis is a very good thing.  Meaning and purpose to life cannot be found without emotions, or without help from other people. \n\nAs for whether you should return back to being your old self again, I regret to inform you that doing so is not possible. Your former self was as transient and plastic as your current self. The only direction is forward, and even if you pretend that you are going back, you will still be moving forward to some unknown destination. \n\nI do not know the nature of your trauma, but I had one of my own. I went hiking in the forest alone and off trail. I fell 30 feet into a ravine. I was badly hurt and could barely walk by dragging one foot behind me, and I could barely breathe. I could not call for help because I had no cell signal. No one had any idea where I was, and my car was at the end of a rarely used forest service road. \n\nI could not walk down the mountain because I landed at the top of a waterfall in the ravine. So the only way out was up. I spent the entire day trying to come up with a way to climb the sides of the ravine.  As you describe, I was calm and reflective. It was an interesting problem to be solved, and I was never upset. I fell at 10:00 am, and at 8:30 it started to become dusk. I realized that I was not getting out. I was so tired that I could barely stand. Because of a health condition, I also knew that if I went to sleep, I would never wake up. But I found a comfortable spot and closed my eyes knowing that I was dead.\n\nA while later, I realized that I was still awake, and I opened my eyes to discover that I was standing up at the top of the ravine looking down to where I had fallen. It is not physically possible that I got myself out of the ravine. I slid and fell my way to the bottom of the mountain, crawled to my car and drove to where I had a cell signal, and called 911. I spent two weeks in Harborview with a broken pelvis, shattered elbow, collapsed lung and other injuries.  All the doctors said that there was no way that I self rescued. \n\nIt took a while for me to tell others about it. I hated the fact that I could not explain my escape. It took me even longer to see how it changed me. Having faced death and escaped, some part of me felt like I had been given a second chance. I resisted those changes, but they still came. \n\nI am sharing this because I wonder if you might find sharing your experience therapeutic. Experiencing a trauma by yourself is a very difficult thing. I did not make any sense of it until I started talking to my wife and boys (and then others), and when I did, I realized that the experience had changed me in ways I did not see. Others expressed empathy for my experience, which made me realize how much I needed that. \n\nIt certainly sounds like you have recovered because you have good friends, although it is hard to see you could also be apathetic. Sharing me experience and hearing the reactions of others let me see my experience as something that happened to me instead of something that was me. I then realized how much of my thinking had been tied up in trying to make sense of it all. \n\nSurviving a trauma is considered by many psychologists to be the biggest opportunity for growth that exists.  See [https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/11/growth-trauma](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/11/growth-trauma)\n\nI say run with it.
3	Thinking and feeling can co exist. I'm an INFP that has greatly developed my Ti, which is naturally my least used function but I use it almost as much as Fi. It gives me more perspectives and angles to look at different situations from. You said you can't think, just wondering if it is lack of thinking or rather your mind is filled too full w other things to use it rationally like you usually do?\n\nI tend to deal w my feelings internally as well though and almost never share them with others, but once in a while it feels good and is helpful to open up to someone about it. I never want to do it but it sometimes helps.

1	* Humans are a social species. A good possible explanation for our intelligence is purely due to our ability to communicate and cooperate (more intelligence = more cooperation = better good, etc = more intelligence. Repeat). You wouldn't survive if you were actually alone, you rely on society for everything.\n* Feelings are part of your brain, like it or not.\n\nIgnoring thoses things isn't very rational.
7	Can I hear some of your experiences on psychedelics?	I’m an INTP and for the last few years I’ve been into psychs. Never got too crazy, had an ego death my first trip and called the cops on myself but other than that all have been very pleasant mind opening experiences. Just wondering how other people like me respond to psychedelics!

7	I snorted a Smartie \n\n\nIt hurt 
5	I've been a dabbler for two years now; I've not really pushed the dosage too much, however. I've taken around 45 - 50 trips (37 with mushrooms or LSD), the rest with DMT. I think introverted thinking is particularly pre-disposed to the high water weirdness of some of these states. So just pay attention, would be my advice to any potential travelers!
2	Dude try DMT, it's mind blowing and also a substance excreted by your body when death occurs. Awesome experience.
2	My only experience was with LSD and it was honest really intense. It was a fun experience but to don't think I'll ever do that again just because of the intensity of all the feeling and senses. But while I was on it I felt like my brain was finally allowing itself to not constantly think about different scenarios and the different solutions to those scenarios and I could just chill. I was finally able to just sit down and meditate without my own head going insane with different ideas and all of that stuff. But over all I would suggest the experience to INTPs and just anyone in general.
2	Salvia once in bad set and setting. Couldn't move and a friend jumped on the couch I sat on. The couch flipped backwards into a deep tunnel which led to hell. 15 minutes.  0/10.\n\nBut shrooms are cool stuff  : )
2	You can check my post history as i’ve written about my experiences a few times. But for me I love the mushrooms, they give me a nice pleasant body buzz and attunement to nature. When i trip on 2g, I feel like my Fi and Se come out and actually get to enjoy soaking in my shadow functions. I feel like a different person and generally happier as well. Usually after a trip im deep in thought about what I want to bring back out and in general a very positive experience.
1	I've never taken any psychedelics strictly speaking, but high doses of weed give some psychedelic effects. I see kaleidoscopes and fast spinning patterns across my vision (like a car wheel which spins really fast, making it look like it's spinning backwards). I took 1g of edibles once, but that was way to intense to be pleasurable, even if it was a hell of an experience. Hoping to try dmt sometime in the future
1	They were good. I learned a new way to laugh, and figured that language was created while some humans were tripping balls.
1	I've always wanted to try them but steered away in my opportunities. I feel like my mind is too crazy for all that. Or I'd go down a dark path. After all my past couple times smoking weed with friends I went down the bad path of  despair. So I'll try them when I'm in happier times. 
1	I would definitely like to do psychedelics again with the right people. I don't think at the time when I did them they was good people to be tripping with. All they wanted to do is be suffocated in a room, I wanted to be outside man exploring shit! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	25i-NBOME. Half tab.\nFelt like I was dying. Just laying on a bed, immobile, in a pool of sweat. The seretonin high was nice though. Post-trip feeling was like being on an SSRI.
1	I used Salvia divinorum a few times when my wife and sons were away, so it was just me. Salvia divinorum is a species of sage native to the Sierra Mazateca in Oaxaca, Mexico. It cannot be ingested because the digestive system destroys it. Traditionally a wad of leaves is held in the mouth so that the active agent can be sublingually extracted.  It also is smoked, but with a very different experience.\n\nI found the website [sagewisdom.org](https://sagewisdom.org) to be informative and authoritative, and I ordered a tincture from its owner  Daniel Siebert.  It can be ordered from his online store for legal psychoactive herbal medicines. [http://sagewisdombotanicals.com/](http://sagewisdombotanicals.com/). I highly endorse him and both of his websites.\n\nThe tincture is concentrated and in an alcohol base.  You swish it around in your mouth as long as you can. I spit it out into a glass so I could reuse it. \n\nThe first time I used it, very little happened.  The second time I was more methodical, and I had an amazing experience, although it was not all that I had hoped.  I expected and wanted clear hallucinations, but did not experience them. So I laid in my bed and tried to experience what I could. I had a journey that led me to a barrier that I understood to be the boundary between this existence and a greater existence. It was viscous, and I was able to push my head through it and then  my whole body. I could sense the presence of others but not see them. They seemed not to be human, more like souls. \n\nAnd then I sensed the presence of God. Again, I did not see him, but I cannot visualize things and that may explain it. It felt like God was a little irked that I was there and might go off on me. But instead he said, "You a child of God. You are all children of God." I am a smart ass wherever I am, and I responded, "If I am a child of God, then I must be the same as you." There was pause where I could feel the wheels spinning and was not sure if he was going to yell at me or what.  Instead, he replied, "Same, but different." And then he was gone. I do not remember the end of the trip.\n\nI am not religious. I believe in a greater existence, but not in any God and certainly not in any God that could speak to me. But I noticed when I left the house that every time I saw someone, my mind said, "There goes a child of God." And when that happened, I felt nothing but benevolence and kindness. That lasted for about a month, and even afterwards if someone cut me off or did something that would make me angry, I heard "There goes a child of God," and I just could not get mad at them. \n\nThis was about 12 years ago, and it largely seems to have worn off, although my general reaction to people may have changed. However, there are plenty of times when someone does something I do not like that I still heard that voice saying that we are all children of God, and when I do, I cannot make myself hate them or even be angry at them.\n\nThat voice tells me that Osama bin Laden is a child of God. I cannot hate him.\n\nNow I recently got hold of some psilocybin mushrooms from a reputable source (he is a criminal defense attorney and friend). He gave me what he called five doses with instructions.  I took the first dose, and absolutely nothing happened.  I waited all day and got so bored, I ended up working. The second time, I took 2 doses and when nothing had happened after an hour, I took the rest of it.  And again, absolutely nothing happened. I think I will try again, but maybe my mind naturally hallucinates all the time.
1	I've smoked weed since I was 15. Did mushrooms probably about 10 times, and acid I think twice during my late teens and early twenties. Always had a good time, mostly just laughing a lot with my buddies, one thing that always stuck with me about them positively was how I would feel for up to weeks after a trip. There's something of a post psychedelics glow, no matter what's going on in your life, when you trip you're in the moment for better or worse. It's really a rollercoaster of emotions, and I always feel like I'm more clear headed and able to find positive perspectives on things for a while after a trip. I recently had a really bad experience with mushrooms and decided it's time for me to hang it up, I'd never had a bad trip up until that point, but I'm getting older and am at a point where I don't need the kind of stress those drugs can create.
0	hows ur take on freespeech victimhood and facts?	
1	Fuck lefties. Thats all i have to say
1	Sorry we seem to be speaking past each other. Not worth arguing about.
0	I watched as long as I could stand it. She is a person with all the answers and no curiosity. I have met many such people. \n\nI think it would hard to dispute that many people feel like victims without complete good cause, but as a middle aged white man, that is remarkably easy for me to say. I can factually say that the vast majority of people in the country are being economically abused. This is easy to demonstrate. \n\nIn 1974, the median personal income in the U.S. was $23,426 in 2017 CPI-U-RS dollars. The GDP was $5.656 Trillion in 2012 chained dollars (sorry to mix and match, but it was what I found quickly). The relevant population was 209,572,000.  GDP per person was $26,988.  \n\nIn 1994, the median personal income was $25,552 in the same 2017 CPI-U-RS adjusted dollars. 2012 chained GDP was $10,352 trillion Population was 262,150,000. GDP per person was $39,488 per person. \n\nIn 2016, median personal income was $31,099 in 2017 dollars. 2012 Chained GDP was $17.659 trillion. Population was 320,372,000.  GDP per person was $55,120 per person. \n\nLargely because of productivity gains, worker are producing far more output than they did in the past. In 42 years, true personal income increased from $23,426 to $31,099, while average worker output increased from $26,988 to $55,120. Incomes increased by 32.75 percent while the GDP and output increased by 104.23%.  Sound fair?\n\nI am saying that there is a basis for the general sentiment that the vast majority of us are being screwed. It is not in our imaginations. \n\nSo this woman's response is to attack the people who consider themselves to be victims. She makes no attempt to understand them, and she has no compassion or empathy for them. That is a great way to feel high and mighty and a lousy way to address the problem. But she does not want to address the problem, she just wants to say that she is right and they are wrong. \n\nThere was a time when I became angry with people like her.  Well, enraged is more like it. But I have realized that is only duplicating her mistake. Today, I try to understand her, and I have compassion for her. If we talked, I would listen to what she said to understand it, not to savage her arguments. I would not try to convince her that she is wrong.  I probably would ask a few questions that I hoped might make her think, but I would do so gently. \n\nGetting in anyone's face and telling them that they are wrong has never been helpful over the entire history of humanity, and only a fool would expect it to now.
4	Eternal fires of hell	Do you think the fires of hell are slowly burning evil souls as a source of fuel? Eventually all the evil souls will be cast into hell and evil will burn itself out. Then Satan will be reborn as a metaphysical white dwarf and return his evil onto a Good universe. 
6	You remind me of the story about a professor who asked whether hell was endothermic or exothermic in an exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n>The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid-term:  \n>  \n>"Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof."  \n>  \n>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.  One student, however, wrote the following:  \n>  \n>*First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives two possibilities.*  \n*1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.*  \n*2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.*  \n*So which is it ?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that "It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,"  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic.*  \n>  \n>The student got the only A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhether this is true seems to be anyone's guess.  But if makes for a nice story and a few nice points. In some versions of the story, the student claims to have had sex with the woman the night before, proving the hell is exothermic.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I'm still here
1	That's basically what the Bible argues. All that is evil will be burned in hell until it is refined so much that only that which is good remains. Then even death itself shall be burnt away, and the whole creation is merged to God. \n\n
1	Nope. I don't think that.
184	This belongs here	
13	This is so real it hurts
6	(INFP) - Something we have in common! 
2	My F and T scores tie, so I’m like a weird INFP/INTP hybrid. Can I be included?
1	them s types\n\ncant stand anything out of norm \n\n"strange things" yourself
1	go to bad word fs\n\nthis meme was made by the t gang
34	I think I'm Infp but Intp reddit is 10 times better.	
92	Glad you *feel* that way. 
27	The infp reddit just sucks.  The mods are babies and people throw a hissy fit if you point out all the contradictions they make.\n\nSeriously, the threads there are like “I love my husband, should I tell him I’m cheating?”  And everybody pats her on the back
13	This is only because Reddit's INTP community is its largest MBTI group. This might be due to INTPs naturally being drawn to Reddit, or to INTP being the type people are most commonly mistyped as, or both.
15	xnfp reddit is the only N reddit i do not touch. there is NO STRUCTURE, NO LOGIC, just drivel   \nits the worst possible form of expression. i dont even have a comparisson term for it.  \ncant use children, cant use rational people, cant use trolls, cant use leftists.. cant use poets (as theres no aeshtetics value ... \nits just .. shit  
6	theyre both shit but yea prob
2	r/infj is so manicured and professional looking. That is all.
1	Apparently I need to find out what’s happening in the infp reddit
1	Ooooh.  Now I want to see that train wreck...
1	Welcome to the dark side....\n\nHere we have.....cookies... lol
1	Yeah, r/infp is full of irrational people.
1	Always objective ?	Are there any ideas, concepts, beliefs etc. you react so viscerally to that you can't think through them objectively or critically? It frustrates me further because thinking through things objectively is something I rely on.
3	I don't think there's a human alive that dosen't have some trigger.
2	example?
2	LGBTQ and race issues at almost any level are hard for me to discuss calmly
1	Wait, I know I responded, but while I looked up viscerally meant, are you asking what topics are difficult to have an opinion on?   \n\n\nOr topics that you find so outrageous, that you hate the people who have that opposite opinion on?
1	Like what ? I react visceral my sometimes, but I can still take a step back \n\nEspecially when I'm getting trashed in a debate.
1	Trump has done a lot of things well.  Overall I think he's a good president.
1	Depends on the mood I am in and how the subject matter is presented. \n\n\nFor me, talking  about sexual assault/ children being sexually assaulted. If it’s in a class room like setting and we are learning about it from a more detached place or just talking about theoretical instances I am okay. If it’s something like a tv or movie depicting sexual assault or even just talking emotionally about a specific instance of sexual assault, I cannot be objective or “ handle it” in a logical way. Sadly can’t watch game of thrones in its entirety because of this. 
1	Animal abuse or hunting. I suppose I can rationalize hunting when overpopulation becomes an issue. But I do not want to discuss any details or see any media about either. On the flip side, I eat meat. I just disassociate myself from how it got to my plate. 
1	I think an obvious one is slavery over a SAPIENT species. I'm including aliens here people!
0	culture war	
3	I just heard about this today from a coworker ( don’t watch the news or look into celebrity news of my own accord) and honestly I’m appalled at him. I am bisexual and I really hate when other lgbt/ queer people act like everyone is out to get them. \n\nNot only does it make it harder for people to believe when someone actually has something bad happen to them but it does, really and truly perpetuate the idea of victimhood. Very annoying and a step backwards in our progress of being accepted by mainstream media/ culture. 
2	What the fuck has this got to do with INTP/mbti?
0	Get this stupid divide-and-conquer tabloid bullshit off the subreddit. Cant imagine someone who isnt 14 years old giving a fuck about it 
0	Death is coming for Jussie and all his Twitter supporters. 
0	IF SELF-DISCIPLINE FEELS DIFFICULT, THEN YOU’RE DOING IT WRONG	
2	He’s cool, thanks for sharing. 
2	Personally, I am highly unlikely to read anything with a title that says I am wrong. Just try to go up some someone and start a conversation with "Let me tell you why you are wrong."\n\nFirst he says that willpower is not the answer, and then he says, "To have a chance of success, your willpower must be trained steadily over a long period of time." Does that mean that my willpower just sucks? \n\nHe says that you will change only if you want to, which I think is generally correct, but then his solution to stop eating ice cream to write a check to friend and tell them to cash it if he eats ice cream. He claims that "Eating ice cream will now cause a much greater emotional problem than the one it solves. And, as if by magic, refraining from eating ice cream will begin to feel *really fucking good*." No it won't. Things do not feel really fucking good because nothing bad happened. He is still in a punishment paradigm.\n\nThe same is true with his call for social accountability. Get in a group and yield to peer pressure and meditate? Love to see that happen. I am so tranquil and at peace because these people made me meditate?\n\nThe best explanation I have seen for what is really going on was in Jonathan Haidt's book, The Happiness Hypothesis. He posits that we are more like a committee than a single person, and he likens the rational brain to a rider, and the limbic system/emotions/autonomous nervous system as an elephant that we are riding. When you are riding an elephant, you cannot just whip it and expect obedience. The elephant will do whatever it damn well pleases no matter how hard you yell. \n\nWe have two mental systems, one automatic, and one controlled. Automatic is the elephant, and the rider is controlled. Humans can consciously think about one thing at a time. We do not multiprocess. However, our automatic thinking runs in parallel without any known limit. We cannot control the automatic brain, but we can affect it and even train it. \n\nI have come to believe that the key to happiness and fulfillment is to develop the ability for my automatic and conscious brains to work together. That is a real challenge, but it starts with recognizing the elephant and rider for what they are. It means learning to control our reactions to the elephant instead of trying to control the elephant itself.  I am doing of a horrible job of explaining Haidt's analogy, but Manson's article seems pointless to me.\n\n&#x200B;
1	The dude's writing style isn't bad, so it's easy to read. He also make some good point, but a 20min read ? Really ? He could have cut it (for examples, the half-truth about society and morality)\n\nI expected a better ending advice, not just "feel good about it". Well, the long time read means I'm more invested, so more likely to consider it, and thus more likely to accept it ? Maybe it's on purpose.
399	Oof	
35	lobsters have different colours? thought they were all red
16	I don't agree with the attitude that you have to be sad at a funeral or at least pretend to look sad to not offend people.
13	I feel like this sub has turned into an autism/depression sub since it blew up.
6	Just don't do it. Some people might be open to a conversation about lobsters in a funeral, but I don't think it is worth the risk. 
6	Nothing to do with the meme  but I love saying "*oof*" recently.
6	For those who haven't seen it The Lobster is a great movie and it's on Netflix basically you go to a resort to find a mate if you don't you get turned into an animal. This one dudes wife died so now he has to find another. It's really good imo 
4	Y E S
1	... So, you like to bore people.
1	Why not?
6	Difference between INTP and INFP	I can never settle between the two for myself. I *feel* that I *think* more effectively, but I *think* that I *feel* more fully. So, I’m curious what this sub’s take is on the INT/FP dichotomy. 
6	I’m an INTJ who was just thinking about whether I was really an INFJ. Turns out, you can be turbulent within your type; I desperately want to appear confident, but a bitch has got anxiety and physically cannot be confident. I feel very strongly and often let them control my thoughts, but I end up exhausted and don’t feel like myself. I think that’s the key - when do you feel your most genuine self surface? Recognize that pattern and see where it takes you. m
5	Dominant Function.\n\n\nIntroverted Thinking, which is INTP's dominant function, seeks truth, and does not consider anything outside of it. Since this is introverted, it simply means that INTPs rather have a very subjective belief of the truth. In a sense, INTPs are truth-seekers.\n\n\nIntroverted Feeling, which is the INFP's dominant function, seeks for what is right or wrong, willing to bend the truth if it means they're on the right. Since it's introverted, INFP's have subjective sense of what is right and wrong.
3	Pretty much non-existent in practice.
1	Second what someone said about turbulent vs. assertive. Can make a huge difference. Also read about dominant, auxiliary, etc. functions. It's more than just being this letter or that. From a quick google search . . . \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INTP functions:** extroverted thinking, external intuition, introverted sensing, extroverted feeling\n\n**INFP functions:**  extroverted  feeling, external intuition, introverted sensing, extroverted thinking
1	I don't think that thinking more effectively is really something that you can feel.  I think of feelings as emotions, and I cannot identify any emotion that would fit. For the same reason, it is kind of hard see how one could think that he feels more fully. I guess you could observe that.\n\nMy own take that particularly when we are younger, we INTPs tend to overstate our thinking and understate our feeling. Everyone thinks and everyone feels. Both are essential to a fulfilling life. 
1	Infp’s stack is Fi Ne Si Te whereas the INTP’s stack is Ti Ne Si Fe. Our main decision making process is through the use of Ti (introverted thinking) versus Fi (introverted feeling) for the INFP. There are commonalities but they are both very different types.
1	> I *feel* that I *think* more effectively, but I *think* that I *feel* more fully.     \n\nINFP.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Generally stable INTPs, what have you gotten out of seeing a therapist?	I ask because a therapist pretty much said I was made to benefit from therapy. I’m not depressed and there’s no trauma I’m dealing with. I think she thought my wandering mind needed specific direction. She’s an xSFx. And she had no self interest. She lives in another state.\nHave any of you benefited from just talking things out with a therapist?
5	In theory, psychologists should exist to help their clients  become a better version of themselves. In practice, now, people only go after psychologists when they are fucked up, but many psychologists (I've spoken to many) reinforce that people who are generally fine in life (should) \*also\* benefit from therapy. It becomes optional, but 'strongly suggested'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to see a psychologist when I was nine\~ten. She wouldn't take me seriously, only ask questions and let me elaborate on the answers (you know, the usual behavior adults have when thinking a child is 'aaw so cute. go sit there with a lollipop, alright?').   \nAfter three months, she told her conclusions to my mother and instructed her on what should be done, her final analysis written on a card, which was something like a certificate affirming I didn't have any mental illnesses (I got in there by a teacher's 'recommendation'). \n\nI read the card later (though I 'shouldn't '), the listed problems ranged from solitude to depressed behavior, also attachment issues. There was a lot that she had missed, and tricking her (one of the things I tried) wasn't hard at all, which I thought was funny. I can't take therapists seriously ever since then.
4	I had very turbulent teenage years, riddled with depression and self esteem issues/anxiety. First therapist was a religious nut job my mother picked. The second therapist actually tried to level with me and talked to me, not down at me. I felt like I could open up and did. \n\nUltimately got diagnosed with Schizoid Personality Disorder, which sort of overlaps with being INTP. I don’t think it helped my quality of life per se, but I gained a better understanding of how I function and how to best tackle bad habits. 
3	I learned about [mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness) and [acceptance commitment therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy). The main thrust was to separate myself from my thoughts and feelings, and see them as three different things. It is normal to let ourselves automatically be driven by our thoughts and feelings, but I learned to dissociate myself from them. I think this is a very natural fit for the detached analytical nature of INTPs.\n\nPart of the exercise bordered on meditation: Sit quietly, with eyes closed if you want (or not). Just notice things. Notice your body. Notice what you're feeling physically. Notice things you're hearing. Etc. Notice thoughts you're having. Notice feelings you're having. Acknowledge them by saying/thinking that you are noticing XYZ, then return to just being present in the moment. If you find your mind wandering into your usual lala land, just bring yourself back -- you'll get better at resisting wandering with practice.\n\nYou can do this anytime/anywhere, not just alone in a quiet room. The idea is that it is a tool to use when things are bothering you. Instead of just being bothered, just notice that thought/feeling and see it as a thought/feeling, and not an innate part of yourself. You are in control of your reaction (if any) to it. My main strategy for unpleasant things is to avoid them, but sometimes that causes larger problems (hence why I was at a therapist). So instead, I can just notice that a situation is unpleasant, and choose to keep going anyway. If it aligns with my larger goals, then I can decide that going forward is a better choice than my natural tendency to avoid.\n\nIt's all quite interesting, and I only developed these skills a little bit. In another life I would love to pursue this stuff further and maybe take up meditation, but I have too many other things I want to do. Hah.
3	I don’t have a therapist persay but I have a friend really into mbti that is like my therapist. She’s very knowledgeable and helps listen to my problems and provides me with practical mbti based advice to help me grow. I wouldn’t be where I am today without her help. So yes therapy can be good imo but also key to who is your therapist. Key things you should be looking for / to do: being able to express yourself, receiving relatable advice to help you, having a positive and open environment, being comfortable, and having someone that will listen to you. 
3	A few thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI first saw a therapist not for depression but because I wanted to connect with people. My experience with him was extraordinarily beneficial. But I went into it with a clear goal, and he happened to be exactly what I needed. That seems like the luck of the draw, and although I was very lucky, it would be hard to recommend as a general approach. If you get referred to a specific person for his or her abilities, then I would give it a try.\n\nMy current therapy is Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is based in mindfulness along the lines of what u/Machstan said. Although DBT is very effective for depression, it was designed for emotional dysregulation, which seems to be an issue with a lot of INTPs and can appear as depression. If you feel like you have strong emotions that take you over, or if you get bogged down with a negative emotion for a long time, then DBT might help you.\n\n&#x200B;
0	Nothing, because I was not sure what my problems were or whether I had any at all. If you are not depressed and you have no trauma to deal with, WHAT exactly do you think you would benefit? Sounds more like YOU were made to benefit the therapist.\n\n If you want someone to help you become great, get a mentor instead.
0	Stable people don't really need to see a therapist,tho.\n\n> therapist pretty much said I was made to benefit from therapy.\n\nWell, they are medical professional supposed to help, but still. Who's benefiting here ? You or your therapist getting paid ?\n\n> I think she thought my wandering mind needed specific direction. She’s an xSFx.\n\nWell, if she didn't mention anything specific, this kind of bias could show up. What kind of "therapist" is she anyway ?\n\n> Have any of you benefited from just talking things out with a therapist?\n\nNope. Never seen one\n

6	Are you familiar with the concept of a circlejerk?
3	You become cynical only if you think that BS is all we can aspire to.\n\nTop comment is better than the post.
2	Virtue signaler = rapist, or covering for a rapist/pedophile. John Ladorla confirmed. 
1	I see it as simplistic, but then a lot of things that seem simple to me are difficult to others. Then again, some things that are simple to others baffle me. Everyone is at the point where they are.  People get so irritated with others who do not know things that they themselves just learned. \n\nIf this makes you sick, you might want to consider why. How would you feel if you said something that makes common sense and others belittled you for saying it? A post on the hot page cannot harm you. You don't have to look at it. 
1	Reddit is totally fake anyways. You're looking at a post that was upvoted by bots and then NPCs, and if it was a post on T_D it would just be censored, no matter how many votes it received. 
1	The fuck if I know
6	Please help me. I am unemployed for more than 3 years now.	I dropped the day job for persuing my online dream career as a freelance writer. Long story short staying at home and doing schedule work idea failed miserably. \nI gave it my last shot 2 months back and said if it clicks then ok if not find a fucking job( getting hired by a company as a writer).\n Now i failed it again by not following a proper schedule. \n\nOne part of me\n\n Still suggesting to give it one last shot, becoming my own boss, having the facility to work from home. Knowing that i can do it ! I know the inns and the outs !\n\nOther part of me\n\nNo way. Update your CV and get a job. You have wasted 3 years!\n\nI am just stuck......need bucks for my expenses but dont want to drop a dream for which i have already suffered a lot.\n\n\nIts a fucking shitty situation. Help me out !\n\nP.S. I am in my early 30's
11	I suggest getting a job if only because it'll bring some structure to your life.\n\nINTPs work best under pressure and time restraints, you need outside obligations. The moment you lack obligations, you think you're going to spend all this free time being productive, when in reality you'll just end up doing nothing. Whatever goal you have of becoming a writer, you need to work on it within the structure of some generic job.
4	Agree with Comrade\_Jacob. Find a relevant job that will at least partially help you improve your professional skills. For example, a copywriter, content manager, editor... This will help you balance life, become more productive and stop worrying. And you can spend your free time on achieving your dreams.\n\nAnd do not suffer for the sake of dreams. Suffering will not help you, they only corrode you from the inside. Aim for the dream, getting pleasure from it.
1	One of my favorite authors had a sort of similar issue - he would write a chapter then edit it ad infinitum until he wasn't even sure what he wanted it to be.\n\nHis solution was to begin publishing his work online in a web serial format. He puts out new chapters every Tuesday and Saturday. \n\nHe now makes a living off of his writing through patreon, and has been doing so for several years.\n\nHis blog has some good advice as well: https://wildbow.wordpress.com\n\nOthers have mentioned outside pressure, well, I think that qualifies. Would you consider something like this?
1	Freelancing sucks. I hated it.
1	Find a job. Once you figure out the job a bit it will be much easier to then switch to freelance. You can even start doing a little freelance on the side with a lot less pressure, while you do your job - not right away but in a year when you're more comfortable. \n\nMost people I know that got into freelance did it the way I'm describing. Some even got paid shit to work at a company to build up a resume/get contacts/get people to refer them/learn a professional process. You seem like you also need it to motivate yourself. A job can help you live while also motivating you to get your own thing off the ground (after some time) while you work somewhere.
1	You haven’t been unemployed, you’ve been freelancing — that is working.  You might have sucked at it, but that is besides the point (I went independent for a while too, it wasn’t good for me either).\n\nHopefully you have a few happy customers you can use as references and some work you can show in a portfolio.
1	Get a job where you can get money and then just do writing on the side and look for opportunities
1	I love the idea of following a schedule, but when I make the attempt, I see all sorts of logic gaps I hadn't considered before, and before you know it, I'm gloriously wasting half of my day.\n\nMy goal for the past fifteen years has been to become self employed, or at least work from home somehow. I have failed so far. However, last year I found that I have an edge in trading stocks. The stock market provides structure, it's open 8:30am till 3pm CST on trading days. The only problem is, to have an unrestricted account, you need at least a balance of 25k. So for the past six months, I've been working two jobs, 55-70 hours/wk to reach that goal. I've been extremely productive, I'm 15k into my goal, 4k of that made from trading.\n\nOnce I am self-sufficient, then I feel I'll be able to focus on my writing.\n\nAre you good with numbers, trends, mass psychology?\n\nP.S. I am in my late-ish 30's.
2	How to be rude?	Nice isnt working 😊
20	Go to an art museum. Disregard do not touch warnings. Touch.\n\nThere, instant douchebag.
9	Just speak the truth
8	You can start by not posting a stupid emoji after making a statement. It's passive aggressive, which i'm assuming your behavior is as well. That's why people are walking over you, you're to limp too stand up.
6	Just let Ti talk in public. Many people will interpret it as rude.
5	Try assertive. People don’t even like “nice” and never really have. 
4	Fuck off.
3	What gender are you?
3	Just give em the silent treatment and then stare deeply into their eyes without saying a word.
2	What's the context? Nice/rude is a false dichotomy, there are more options.
2	Just say what you actually think of people.\n\nIf you want to win a roasting match, tho, you need to attack them on their physical appearance/what everyone can see. That includes behavior, but say, our TiNe focus on ideas/philosophy won't work here because no one cares. Or at least, like we do. And it's not like we're good at communicating our ideas. \n\nSo, you kinda need to get good at noticing that stuff on people. 
2	Look mad and use a sasy tone of voice
2	Gain the confidence to actually be rude and it’ll come naturally
1	Be aggressively selfish.
1	Point out others obvious faults.
1	If nice isn't working, then maybe you need to work on how you are nice. Being rude will never improve your situation or make life fulfilling. 
383	Hate deciding on the spot	
47	Haha, you newbies !\n\nI just say "I will have the same thing" or its variations like "Make it two"
10	I love it. No effort. Likely the same outcome. Way quicker.  Back to mental black hole physics.
8	I do wish restaurants would carry fewer options, and just focus on the big winners.\n\nI pine for Taco Bell and McDonald's menus as they were in the 70s. Taco. Burrito. Soft taco. Cinnamon Crispas. Drink.\n\nThe paradox: more choice == less satisfaction.
7	I remember when I was young, I was at a water park and wanted french fries but wouldn't go order any because I couldn't think of whether I should say "I would like a fry" or "I would like fries". I couldn't get the wording right in my head so I just didn't get any
6	I do this in my head 44 times while standing in queue and I still end up screwing myself over and ordering a big mac from burger king
4	“What would you recommend?” - Buy me a few more minutes to decide.
4	I order the same thing every time so it's far easier for me to order things. Granted, sometimes I wish the menu was better, but if it was, the indecision would be an issue.
3	do all intps love memes?\n\n&#x200B;
3	I just shoot from the hip, praying my words will make sense. The only downside is you can't be a picky eater with that attitude. 
3	“Eh… What would you recommend? Yes, one of those, please.”
3	Always rehearse.  And always have a second option ready in case they've run out of the first thing.
2	This is some autistic shit
1	There's a line in a shabazz palaces song that I've kinda found success with.. it's like I'm not planning the future or dwelling on it too much "don't try to plan it, but yeah just when it comes handle it" (are you... can you... were you?)
1	Just order based on what type of restaurant you are at. In a steakhouse? Get what you liked last time you went to a steakhouse. I don’t see how this could possibly be difficult.
12	For the INTP who isn't sure what to major in	
2	Finance for the win
1	Hope i still got time lol
10	Some things I've learned	it's the nature of the beast- he who looks hardest sees the least \n\nso starve your expectations and allow impartiality to feast\n\nwhether you wither or you sprout\n\nlies in the mound of your self doubt \n\nwhat you project is what you become \n\nit's where you're going and where you're from \n\ndouble helix thrust past millions of years \n\nto propel you into existence, right now, right here \n\nwhenever you feel trapped, music will set you free \n\ntend to your own garden, and only then you will see \n\nyou're already in Eden, you've been given the gift of being \n\nso savor the pleasure because it will later soothe the pain \n\nand smile as you walk through that door, drenched from the rain \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply sharing what I believe are universal truths in hopes of reminding anyone who may have forgotten. Nothing original, nothing mind-blowing. I hope you're all having a relaxing Thursday night. Let's all agree to kick ass at work tomorrow, yeah?
2	Bueno bueno amigo, much is said in so little, I think I might need to read it again, but still, thank you for this
31	Sometimes its hard to be the smartest of the MBTI personalities...	To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand INTP’s. Our humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of philosophy and psychology most of our jokes will go over a typical redditor's head. There's also the INTP’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into our type- our personal philosophy’s draws heavily from Carl Jung’s literature, for instance. Darwin fans understand this stuff; we have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these posts, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike INTP’s truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in the INTP’s dominant cognitive function "Introverted Thinking," which itself is a cryptic reference to the work of Jung. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons and ESFJ’s scratching their heads in confusion as our genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have an Albert Einstein tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
18	Nice touch with spelling personal as personnel hahaha. A truly high IQ INTP
16	Nice trolling/baiting. 
11	As an INTP, it's no lie that I and others of my type are in my opinion at the top of the food chain. From our excellent wit, creativity and high IQ's from our Ti-Ne magic we truly are spectacular. I don't mean to boast in a condescending way but it seems that others enjoy claiming to be us while actually being mistyped. I, however, am genuine and real. Between my SAT scores, 4.0 GPA and knack of always seeking to learn more, (not to mention my expertise PhD level knowledge in physics, computer science, biology, chemistry and many more) I have decided to permanently mark such a miraculous title on my body for life. I was thinking of getting this on my hand but instead chose my ribs to symbolize the introvert within me but also the courage of getting the tattoo regardless
13	Damn you sound like an asshole.....\nNothin personnel kid 😎
7	Get in the car morty we're going to bendigo
6	I think it doesn't matter if he's trolling or not. There are going to be people who agree with this post and truly feel like they are an enlightend being which makes me sad. Those people are in my opinion not really INTP or at least have some major Ego issues. I feel like most INTPs who are "balanced" question their own intelligents on a regular basis and can't really dicide wether they are smart or just think they are. Because there is no way to know or compare your mind (intellect) to the mind of other people directly (all done through "3rd party" tests).\nI dunno where I was going with this...
5	Were just a result of anxiety and overthinking, that is what formed the entirety of our personality.
4	Regarding what I read here in this sub I am not even sure if this is a troll or if OP is being real 
3	Although I agree 100% with what you said, lets not pretend this isnt just going to be a circlejerk.

6	I know this is a troll, but r/iamverysmart
2	how the fuck have half of you never seen this copypasta.
2	Wow, I actually audibly laughed at this.  What a brilliant use of this copypasta!  LOL
2	Jesus fuck
1	I was with ya til you said you pity tha fool. But then again, I'm still with ya, since afterwards you got all wacky and silly and I like that kind of sense of humor.
0	Is this a joke or are you serious with this post? What are your sources when claiming intps base their personal philosophy on the work of Carl Jung?\n\nI'm so sorry I don't mean to offend you but based on what you have written here I'm inclined to assume that you are either a frustrated teenager or not very intelligent.
2	How do the dynamics in your family work	so I'm a bit curious about this subject the inner workings of the families of other INTPS\n\nso my dad is an ISTJ and works as a software developer, at any given moment we are either in agreement or are in quiet yet fierce arguements that don't get anywhere, the primary cause that I have found is that when dad says something should be done he does not expect  that a person needs a reason to do it as long as it is a clearly defined sequence of events ending up where he wants them to be, while i on the other hand will always try and give instructions with no definitive end point and good reasoning backing up the steps that should be taken\n\nMy mom on the other hand is an ISTP and while with my dad I could at least tell why it happens all the time, my mom is very unpredictable, there are many petty arguements like\n\n"could you stop throwing the junk mail underneath the front seats and making me pick it up and then complaining about how it's always messy"\n\nto which she replies with\n\n "why did you put my clothes in with yours when washing and ruin them"\n\nand then I say\n\n"When did I do that?"\n\n"five days ago"\n\nThese sorts of arguments also tend to spring up between her and her father (also an INTP) but overall we can agree on many things and talk about like history, politics and many other subjects, although she sometimes just out of the blue makes claims like "I am detecting Jim on my gaydar, it's like a radar for gay people" despite him just being autistic and really liking a comb-over hairstyle
3	Don't confuse emotional immaturity with type, though. I don't wanna sound harsh, but there are evidently problems with communication within your family.\n\nLike, your mom answers in that way because she is unable to just take criticism, or maybe is still resentful at your lack of care but for some reason chose to not speak up. Could very well be a selfsteem issue or something of that order. But then, maybe you were also aggressive or dismissive, I dunno, and that can turn an otherwise inane comment into an emotional affront for anybody but a fucking sage. You feel me?\n\nMy point is, don't ever assume this is just "who you all are". People can grow and become better no matter their type. Likelihood is you're in a better position to learn and guide, if you're truly an INTP. And to know yourself better first. But try not to take their failures too personally, or even their likely reticence to change. You must have your own glaring blindspots as well.\n\nFor my part, my parents are an ESTJ and an ESFJ. It suuuuuuuuuuuucked. But I have tried to improve my own communication, and to try and put things in terms they can understand. They have done their part too, sometimes more than me, and things are way better now, but it wasn't easy. Not one bit.
2	My mom was a petulant child who demanded everyone placate her immaturity or else she would make their life hell.  She constantly threatened my dad with divorce so he was afraid to do any parenting and instead just recoiled into his job, hobbies, and alcohol.
1	I don't know how seriously I can take mbti in terms of family dynamics, but anyway.\n\nMy mom is INTJ. We generally have a good understanding. She's not very talkative and I really am but generally, we agree on most issues and we can have civil discussions. It's helpfull that she's extremely well organized and I've picked up quite a few skills from her over the years. She has a dark sense of humor that just randomly comes out in situations. We talk a lot about work stuff and general topics. Usually the stuff that she says is true. Emotional topics are not among her strengths. She was very invested in my education when I was growing up. And she's a workoholic herself. It can be a little hard to live up to expectations sometimes.\n\nMy dad is either INTP or ENTP. I can't say for sure. He's had a deep interest in politics and society throughout his life, and we can have some interesting discussions. He has good judgement about political issues. Sometimes he can be impossible to talk to because of degressions from the main topic and this iritating habit of his to "define precisely" what we are talking about, when it's obvious what we are talking about we don't need to define every word. When two people are discussing a topic some things are implied and there is a mutual understanding that what is implied is understood equally. Like for example say we're discussing some new law that was passed and I say "I don't think it would be beneficial for the quality of life of the general public" and he's like "OK, we need to specify what you mean exactly when you say "quality of life" " or "when you say "general public" ... " It's frustrating. It's impossible to have any kind of civil discussion with that man. I enjoy discussing these issues but talking to him makes my blood pressure go up. And sometimes he'll do it just to irritate you... \n\nMy dad is even worse when it comes to emotional issues than my mom...\n\nOr I don't know I can't decide who is worse. It's hard to say...\n\nMy dad also says a lot of inappropriate stuff to people in conversations.\n\nOvrall, they are very flexible, open-minded people. They created an intellectually stimulating environment for me when I was growing up. But they were not helpful at all in my emotional development. Possibly even damaging...\n\nThey're smart people but they're also very naive. Sometimes they'll loose money or someone scams them. Like for example whenever a handyman has to come over and fix something, you can be sure that he'll scam them somehow. My mom is much better with money than my dad. But they are both naive about practical stuff. Especially my dad.
1	My mom is an ESFP, and my dad is an INTJ. \n\nAt their worst, It leads to some really shallow disagreements, with me usually mediating between them. I'm usually trying to translate my dad's precise, specific language into something my mum can agree with. Usually they both want the same thing, but just have very different ways of expressing it so they think they are disagreeing.\n\nIt's really funny seeing my dad trying to lay out a really detailed plan for an activity, with my mum nodding along, seemingly grasping it. And then only a few minutes she demonstrates that she really didn't understand what he was talking about at all. She is also very conflict averse, she would rather have the entire dinner table simmering with rage over an unspoken disagreement, than spend a few moments passionately discussing the elephant in the room.\n\nAt their best though, they go really well together, I introduced them to MBTI a few years ago, and it helped them see just how different they are. I don't think they thought about that too much before they took the test.\n\n
7	Are INTP more ''radically emotional'' than even types who have feeling functions higher in the cognitive stack? I'll explain the theory more below.	First of all, INTP's have Fe last in their function stack. From what I've observed of INTP they are either all or nothing when it comes to emotions. In this sense they are unbalanced and erratic. When emotions come up they don't really know how to navigate that world like an INFP or other F types would. It's scary for them and overwhelms them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo counter this they tend to cut them off and try to get into a routine or throw themselves into something that allows them to ignore the feelings. They just stay there though. This seems frustrating as they can't get rid of the feelings. It isn't so much that they feel really bad but the annoyance of having them weighs the INTP down. Since INTP overthink anyway it's a nightmare situation when they have to contend with these feelings. They try to think their way through them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut  I've observed that if it doesn't work, the INTP can be quite radical. Emotional outbursts, lashing out, or even just doing things they wouldn't normally do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't just in bad times either, this isn't just negative emotions. Positive emotions, too, such as when they really like somebody else romantically, there's no balance, again. They're assaulted with these feelings.  They can be quite enthusiastic and overwhelm themselves with positive emotions too and it leads to a weird anxiety and neuroses. Neurotic tendencies such as questioning themselves if they're worthy of the person of their interest, making sure they are doing everything ''the right way'' whatever that means and being just overly obessed with Fe things. Unhealthily. Not like a person with high Fe would. There's little grace. It's a jarring thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah just things I've observed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?
6	Yes.  INTP social interactions hinge on Fe.  You either A.) don’t use it and don’t give a fuck about people - usually immature/young people.  Or B.) use it to filter your words because you’re worried about being misunderstood and afraid of how other people feel.  \n\nGreat example was Elon Musk’s interview with, I think, Joe Rogan.\n\nFe inferior also means Fi is last.  INTPs and ISTPs don’t care about what they themselves feel. What makes sense, is effective or efficient matters far more.
3	Your post is actually describing the “shadow functions” and the 8th function often referred to as the “demon function”. We tend to repress our fi because we don’t utilize/ and or understand it. It doesn’t mean we don’t feel though and in times of major repression or where we think we are cornered we can release this function in an outburst of emotion; what you refer to as lashing out. Since we don’t really have a daily outlet or form or expression for fi in general, it tends to build up in us and then come out all at once. 
2	Pretty standard description of Fe as the lowest function in the stack. 
2	I have no idea about Fe. The function stuff seems like nonsense to me. \n\nI do think that INTPs develop their intellectual abilities very early and are prone to try to use them to understand and deal with emotions, which is sort of like using a gun in a debate. Because emotions are not subject to rational thought or solutions, our brains keep churning them over and over again looking for the answer. And each time we do, we re-experience the emotion with the same intensity as the first time. To me, that explains the attempts at frustration and the explosions when emotions refuse to be contained. \n\nIn my own life, I have come to accept and even welcome emotions for what they are. The mean something and they happen for a reason. I also have learned to observe them as things happening to me instead of as part of me or who I am. That allows me to experience even very strong emotions without losing control. \n\nIn my experience, what you are describing is typical of younger INTPs. An unfortunate tendency we have is to think that we have things figured out and will not change. In truth, no matter your age, you will be a very different person in 10 years. We all will wince or laugh looking back at the truths we hold to be self evident today.
1	Sad, but true.
1	Dunno, maybe it's the same intensity, they just know how to handle it/ Built an immunity to it. \n\n...\n\nYour username makes me want to say that you're wrong and have piss poor judgement, tho 
1	Yup! Why I am better at helping other people navigate their social situations then my own. \n\nOr maybe my friends are idiots for asking my advice. 
1	We aren’t unbalanced.  We use wild emotional explosions to balance the months or years of stoicism.  Its neutral.\n\nFeelers are the unbalanced ones.  You can’t go up from feeling to thinking.  The cognative gap is too high.
1	It's not a theory, this is the consequence of having Fi lowest in our stack.\n\nPlease remember--Fe is NOT actually YOUR feelings. Fe is group and social harmony.\n\nFi is internal feelings and it's our dead last function, which is why it takes active work to understand.
22	How to deal with limerence/intense crush? Whenever I "fall for someone", it becomes extremely detrimental to my mental health and self esteem.	I'm male in my early twenties, and I have had several experiences with intense crushes . After reading about it online, I have realized the correct term for my "condition" is called 'limerence', and I fit all its descriptions. I understand it isn't something that should affect me, because I can rationalize it, and understand it always has been about fantasies and idealizations in my mind. The people I have crushed on are incompatible with me due to many reasons, and I can't really see how a hypothetical relationship would have worked with any of them because of our differences in interests and lifestyles; more importantly, none of the people I end up crushing on end up finding me attractive. I also understand 'limerence' isn't love, because it is merely a self induced feedback loop that creates a sense of affection that doesn't come from a genuine and mutually maintained relationship. I often have this idealistic and unrealistic conjecture about what I want my relationships to be like on my mind, and when I have a crush on someone, I put her into my imaginary scenarios to fit a fantasy instead of actually knowing and connecting with her. \n\nIt has always been difficult for me to deal with 'limerence' because I can always understand what it truly is, but I can't think my feelings away, nor can I rationalize myself out of the negative feedback loop of daydreaming -overanalyzing-  dissapointment - denial- sadness - daydreaming and repeat . I understand the "correct" ways to deal with it; for example, letting go, distract myself, or simply let my feelings be known, and embrace the aftermath regardless of her anwer; however, all these practical ways become impractical to me because all of it are easier said than done. \n\nI tend to psychoanalyze myself, and try to minimize my feelings' roles in the matter by denying my affection's potency, and I try to be "intelligent" about it. I understand limerence reflects my own insecurities and desires because I have always chased after an idealized version of a person while feeling inadequate about myself. I tend to have a lot of self control over my actions despite the obsessions of my mind; I minimize my time around the person by not trying too hard to start a conversation;  I steer away from the creepy factor by not checking her social media; I don't make any explicit moves such as asking for phone numbers; and I'm most definitely not a flirty or touchy person. Sometimes I do try to grow some balls and end up talking to the person, but it tends to end up badly because my insecurity and vulnerability often leak and become apparent. I end up being self deprecating, awkward, and visibly uncomfortable around the person of my interest, only to cringe and regret about it later because I know women do not find any of that non sense attractive. \n\nNot having a relationship doesn't bother me as much as a sense of shattered self esteem and heightened self loathe and negativity toward myself. I have never had a very strong set of identities and personal values, so I have nothing to actually ground myself when my idealized version of someone is occupying my mind. I end up being moody, sensitive, and detrimentally self doubting because I don't fit the the idealized version of myself to be "worthy". I understand all of it are my own faults, and no one owes me anything. I don't pity myself, nor do I blame anyone; I simply feel trapped by my own reactions without being able to break through. \n\nI understand this is a long post, and if you do somehow read enough of it, and have some insights for me, please do share.
11	Die\n\n\nSource: I have limerence for someone I met 2 sem ago. Saw him recently with his gf. Fun stuff.\n\nCurrently a ball of tears and self loathing.
9	Stop falling in love
6	Funny note for me when I learned a crush had bad dating taste, I got over it immediately.  Nothing like that dismissiveness when we dislike perspectives. \n\nBut if the crush got someone possibly *better* than me? Then *oof,* I stepped my game up furiously. I've made permanently great lifestyle changes that way. Not the best way to change but still a positive.\n\nPlay with the facts, practice a little bravery, and negative information is better than no information. 🤖
4	I used to be this way, to the point that it's embarrassing looking back at it . . . Anyway, if you can't control it, don't expose yourself to that person. If you don't follow that person on social media, have their number, etc. you'll forget about them pretty quickly (unless you work together or go to the same school) Another alternative? Distraction. Start a new book, download a Pokemon hack on your phone, do something you enjoy that takes time and thought. Hope that helps! If you're still having trouble, I second someone else, and recommend a therapist. 
6	Fuck. Is this me?
3	This probably isn’t what you want to hear, but my suggestion is to face your fears and go head on instead of analyzing it and yourself as nauseum.  Take it on as a personal project.  Go and learn to be attractive (the way you dress, groom, present yourself). Then go and just talk to attractive women.  Get comfortable with the opposite set.  It’s going to be extremely uncomfortable at first (the first steps are the hardest) but it tapers off pretty quickly.  You’re never going to “think” your way out of this.  Don’t waste anymore time analyzing or waste money on a therapist.  Spend that on better looking clothes.  It doesn’t have to cost a lot to look good.  \n\nI’ve been there.  You have to trust me on this.

Jung said, something I'm trying to paraphrase, that Thinking dominant types often have difficulty understanding the feeling values of love, and are right to not fall in love because they can control thought if they are thinking dominant but not feeling.\n\nI've gone through the limerance. You seem like a decently adjusted person so I think you probably just have to take confidence where you can. I think you also need to start approaching them but not that seriously just to test if you really like them! good luck.
2	This sounds more like BP (Borderline Personality Disorder), I would go see a therapist if you are really concerned.
2	In the least I got the opportunity to talk about it. That by itself is pretty relieving. 
1	suffering with same for about years.
1	Man, I cringed hard while reading the conversation with the crush part. It reminded me of a time where I told a girl that I didn't want to exist and that nonexistence was objectively better than existence,  like that wasn't enough immediately after that I spilled tea on myself. She was just standing there nodding in pity. Teenage years are hard. Anyways, I got over her by eliminating all contact. I never had a crush on someone that intensely since then. My advice is once you get over her, don't hesitate asking other girls you find attractive out and just build up experience. Experiencing real relationships will get you out of this loop.
1	Just recognize that this behavior is bred into you by tens of thousands of years of Evolution (even more actually). Why not embrace it? We all have a lot of animal in our brain and your "Hunter instincts" might have helped your ancestors to get that qt girl in their tribe.\n\nI read in the pua community that it's better to be a fisher, than a hunter. Spread your attenion on multiple women and see who bites, rather than pursuing a single one, but why not try, if your natural instincts can succed too?\nJust try it and really get the girl you are crushing on and be dedicated, untill it is very obvious that she doesn't want you.
1	I often get the same way, but typically hanging out with friends or doing something I enjoy that's unrelated to that person helps. \n\nEither that or they reject me/I find out they're not single. Then I eventually get over it.
1	You could accept it. Allow yourself to be energized by this person (or rather the idea of the person and the traits you are finding so attractive), while recognizing this is a projection. Find out what your subconscious is trying to bring to your attention, by being attracted to them. Maybe there is something special about them--like for example, they appear very confident, or some other trait they have that you don't. Or maybe they represent to you some version of your ideal partner. I think as long as you are realizing this is not real love, and that it is happening for a reason,  it will resolve. 
1	I don't think there is much you can do, but you will eventually outgrow it, or at least most people do.
1	Talk to them and see your idealized version of them disappear.
1	I was like that for about 6 months then confessed, got silence as the answer, took it as a no and continued as if a mountain was lifted from my shoulders
1	"I understand it isn't something that should affect me, because I can rationalize it"\n\n"I can't think my feelings away, nor can I rationalize myself out of the negative feedback loop of daydreaming"\n\nIf you're trying to understand your emotions, perhaps you should take a less rational approach? If your axiom is that you or the people around you can be reduced to a set of logical instructions or algorithms, then you sound a lot like me a year ago. Me a year ago was not a happy man. My parents taught me that emotions are bad and should be suppressed (that may have just been my interpretation of their advice, or lack thereof). I started feeling empty and like a robot. I found myself to be hyperaware of everything that everyone did, yet I could never understand what people actually meant or what they were doing.\n\nSo I started psychiatry a year ago, it's helped me a lot. I went in for social anxiety originally and I'm now switching to schema therapy for emotional deprivation. If you want my advice, just look at this sentence you wrote: "I can't think my feelings away"\n\nIf you can't think your feelings away, then stop trying to solve your problems by thinking. I felt very lonely as a kid (still do sometimes) and I spend many sleepless nights trying to figure out why I didn't have more friends. I understand now that I didn't have friends because I wasn't making any friends. It really was that simple, I just couldn't see the forest for the trees in between all of my thoughts. Think of it like hunger, feeling hunger is your body telling that it needs to eat. Feeling lonely is your body telling you that it needs to socialize. Not because socializing is a rational thing to do, but because we're essentially smart apes and apes are pack animals. \n\nIf you don't meditate, try it. All it takes is literally watching your breath for 10 minutes while listening to calming music. Once you're in a meditative state though, you can watch your body and thoughts so much better. Spend some time there and try and figure out why you're jumping on girls. Don't think it out or rationalize it, you won't find it. The answer is somewhere in your subconsciousness and the only way you're gonna get it out of him is by asking and acting accordingly. Not by thinking or rationalizing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you'd like a book that explains how and why the above is true, I'd recommend Righteous Minds by Jonathan Haidt.
1	As INTP, connecting with and understanding our own feelings can be very hard for us. You must learn the trick of alternating between analyzing your own feelings, which isn't too hard for us, and actually feeling them in the moment, which can be harder. Sometimes, because we typically think so much more than we feel, a strong emotion like love/adoration/infatuation can overwhelm our sense of scope, and take us out of our reason-based paradigms. This is something you can get used to; once you do, you'll have a better perspective on it, and will be less inclined mythologize those rare persons who make you feel strong, positive emotions, but developing that level of self-awareness takes a long time and consistent mindfulness.  \n\n\nYou can learn to appreciate the people you feel adoration towards in a healthy way, but it is a skill, and not one that comes to us naturally.
1	\`\`\` I end up being moody, sensitive, and detrimentally self doubting because  I don't fit the the idealized version of myself to be "worthy". I  understand all of it are my own faults, and no one owes me anything. I  don't pity myself, nor do I blame anyone; I simply feel trapped by my  own reactions without being able to break through. \`\`\`  \n\n\nIf no one owes you anything, it would stand to reason you owe no one anything in turn, yes? So, by that logic, the idealized version of yourself, owing nothing to anyone, would be someone who simply does what he personally feels or understands to be the right thing to do with the resources available at any given time, and doesn't worry about failing to live up to standards beyond those he is able to, given a good-faith effort.  \n\n\nDoes that make sense? If so, be that person.

1	To which cognitive functions does this behavior correspond?	So basically my friend said these and acts like this, and in order for me to better understand cognitive functions, I wonder what cognitive functions could cause this behavior. Thanks\n\n"When I write something, I let my mind off, just quickly writing every thought that comes to my mind, in a really short period of time. After that I read it all, and completely reorganise my text, for it to make sense"\n\nand\n\n"I like speaking about my own emotions with my close friends, discussing them and discussing relationships with anybody in general. I'm pretty open. But I completely suck, when dealing with other people emotions and I don't know how to comfort somebody"\n\nand\n\n"Firstly I make my opinion based on my gut or how I feel about it. Than I'll logically back it up. If someone disagrees with me, I am willing to change it. Actually, I change it a lot, I'm very indecisive"
3	The function are about how you process info, not behaviors.\n\nStill :\n\n1 / Ne.  \n2 / Fi.  \n3 /  Fi. Then Ne. \n\nI'm pretty sure of those, but remember it's just guesses on limited info.\n
2	Nothing's purely one function or the other, they all work together. And like the other guy said, outward behaviour isn't always the best indicator to base this kind of thing on. But yeah, roughly,\n\n1 - Ne\n\n2 - Don't know, this is quite general and could be caused by a few things so wouldn't like to guess\n\n3 - The deciding the right answer before gathering the evidence seems like the epitome of Te to me, maybe a touch of Ne for the seeing other possibilities and being open to change. Alternatively, maybe the "gut" thing is some logical intuitive flash of reasoning and they don't commit to it until they've thought it through logically properly, in which case Ti, with possible Ni. Who knows.\n\nAlthough. the putting so much stock into emotions and relationships, plus the way they analyse themself seems NF-y to me, so I'd hazard a guess at xNFP overall. Which would mean Ne/Si/Fi/Te
1	Sounds like an INFP
11	Dissonance between self and representations of self	I struggle a lot with recognizing if the actions that I take and the things I say are a genuine representation of myself (whatever "myself" means) or if I am trying to fit some ideal mold of how I want to present myself. This feeling is exacerbated during "lows," which I would characterize as episodes in my life where I feel like I don't really understand who I am (which I believe is usually accompanied/caused by lacking frequent meaningful social contact) \n\nI think the reason this bothers me is because fundamentally, I believe that my truest 'self' is a thoughtful person who carries redeeming qualities, but I also worry that I am not actually thoughtful or redeeming, and thus my mind tries to force me into saying or doing things that it believes someone of the former stature would do. \n\nI guess an example would be: I try to say a thought provoking thing to a friend, but I'm not sure whether this thing is actually thought provoking or whether I whipped it up out of a desperate attempt at being thought provoking, if that makes sense. It's gotten so bad at this point that I feel like many thoughts don't really "come naturally" to me anymore, I'm always hyper-aware of my thoughts as entities in themselves and am examining why I may have thought something. I'm also pretty heavily concerned with authenticity and sometimes it feels like my thoughts are not coming from my truest self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any similar experiences or insights, I'd love to hear them. Also the word, "thought" sounds weird to me now.
3	If I interpreted your post correctly, it might help to improve your self esteem. When I started to understand myself and more importantly, how much I/we differ from the rest of the population. This was the "aha" moment for me, and from then on things got much better. Reading more about my type helped me organize myself and understand my social shortcomings with others. Which then helped me be more of myself with my friends. And I would assume the best way for people around you to get used to you is to be you.... uurrr that sounds too cliche for me... I have great roommates that tolerate my INTP quirks that I'm sure we can all list easily. \n\nI think I'm trying to assume that what you're going thru is the confusion of you socializing with others and the general population a certain way that "everyone else does" up until now to realize this shit hasn't been working for you and that going with the flow and not asking why it flows this way finally doesn't cut it for you. 
2	It sounds like you’re describing meta-cognizance as a result of social anxiety. I’ve been through it and I’ve reduced it by trying to remind myself that no one can tell if I’m being genuine or not and by giving myself the benefit of the doubt. 
1	you sound like you use more words than you need to. but anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you have a well defined sense of self, not only one self (the current self) but a future and past one, and perhaps options A B and C as to what your self truly is, you shouldn't have a hard time noticing whether you act accordingly to your views.  It's important to remember that one's self isn't static and blah blah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you fear that you want to fit into a mold... why would you want to? do you want to be accepted? that's usually why people try to fit into molds. You've admitted to having self esteem issues. Obviously you should start with that.  
1	I completely understand. I get like that sometimes too. What's seems to happen is I get stuck in a negative thought loop that is incapable of resolving itself without some external input. \n\nYou need to recognize that humans are social beings and you cannot always resolve your issues alone. The fix that always works for me is talking to  more people. If you're overthinking your conversations with one person , take note of your failings, take a  step back from them and try talking to someone else, doesn't matter if it's a total stranger and it's just small talk. Try not to stumble over the same mistakes you made with the first person, and when you fuck up there too, coz you will, repeat.\n\n Soon enough it will start to feel easier  and you'll get of your head. Overthinking things like that clogs up your mind and doesn't  let it resolve simple things easily like it should be doing. Much of what you're describing is the thought process that occurs between replies in a typical conversation. It shouldn't take more than a split second. Practice makes perfect. Don't lean so much on visualizing things in your head. Get out of your thought loop and go try shit out. 
7	what are some of your hobbies that you never get to talk about?	or never talk about outside of the internet 
10	I’m really into film analysis but most of my friends and family tend to take movies at face value and its surface plot. I’m satisfied by watching movie analysis videos but I can really only discuss movies on a deeper level with my Entp dad. \n\nEdit: it’s to its because I was bothered
8	I have nothing
7	I have so much knowledge on drag queen culture.\n-I have way too much knowledge about human sexuality \n-really into sewing and crafts \n-linguistics \n
5	not exactly a hobby, but I observe people a lot, and I've got tons of patterns noted down. that's how I expend my time. I aim to start observing buildings and such other things, and try to understand them as well. anything I can find that is more interesting. Apply my knowledge on how things should work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nobsessing over human behavior can get boring.
3	* Typology \n* Stuff I read on geopolitics, economics, psychology, etc. An example is Geert Hofstede culture model. I just like to see it in everyday life...\n* Culture s + History. I'm a bit the Warring Kingdom period of Chinese history right now\n* Hard science topics. Physics, chemistry, whatever. I watch vids like PBS Spacetime, SixtySymbols or PBS Eons on YouTube, so I know a bit. Cannot talk of it with anyone IRL. Like, my understanding is too casual, general and undetailled for the ones who actually study it, but too advanced for the rest. \n* Manga. I read some somewhat obscure stuff, and all everyone knows his Dragon Ball. They probably watched the anime too.\n
2	20th century Russian history, existentialism, cephalopods. I'm really enthusiastic about octopuses in particular. 
2	Clothing and fashion. My knowledge on this topic is really limited but I do enjoy it a lot. I don't have many friends who I can try to talk in-depth about fashion with.
1	 Economics, American history, 20th century Russian history
1	Lots of mangas and Chinese light novels and how they develop plot and characters
1	Used to watch anime and manga, the really obscure ones, too, that nobody has seen. Now I've moved on to watching obscure TV shows or movies that no one has seen\n\nWrite fanfics\n\nOutline original stories or characters. Mostly high fantasy or detective mysteries with a dash of romance\n\n
1	translation, multi-language puns, demoscene, programming, analyzing people and general problem solving; technical or not.\n\ni don't generally know a lot of people in real life with similar hobbies.
1	Vynil and other analog sound formats.
274	I feel as if most of this subreddit belongs in r/iamverysmart	Opinions?
41	The INTP stereotype overall is so starkly negative and disregarding of individual differences that after I had learned that I am an INTP and actively tried working on my usage Fe to perform better as a human, I was seen as an INFJ by many people interested in the theory (not in this subreddit, for the record).\n\nThe idea of me actually being mistyped is possible and worth entertaining, but I'd like to underline just how low the bar is set for INTPs as far as emotional intelligence goes - among other things. We need to stop *defining* ourselves by our flaws, as if they are inescapable and it is what *makes* us INTPs. It's reasonable to state the flaws as tendencies, but it is also a very bad approach to consider them the defining traits.\n\nI'd argue that this misery mixed badly with a taste of arrogance given by praise for being highly logical and good thinkers leads to a form of defiant, self-entitled stagnation. Most posts complain about being unable to do x and y and then also seek validation for their incapabilities, instead of trying to fix the cause.
152	Definitely a lot of it does. But that’s kinda what happens when you toss a bunch of introverts together who think they’re super logical lol.
43	Only because there is no sub called r/iamagenius :)
21	The true INTPS upvote or downvote instead of commenting \n\n(Jk mostly)
37	You're very smart to have figured that out
30	On average people correctly typed intp or similar are not only at the higher end of intelligence capacity but also like to reaserch and analyse information a lot more than average. What you are seeing are younger INTPs who are not secure in themselves yet and looking for validation and confirmation. 
9	I think I’ve said it before, if karma mattered to me I have an endless farm on loop through crosspost from here to /iamverysmart. 
6	Ok, so you _feel_?
5	That’s because we are very smart 
5	What is this? An INPT civil war? 
4	All I know is that this is the only subreddit where my actual opinions dont get downvoted to hell
12	When dominant Ti users ask for advice or reach out to people, it can be quite awkward because of their independent nature, so labeling them as you’ve done is shallow in my eyes.\n\nImagine Einstein asking for dating help:\n\n“I have a date with a beautiful blonde model named Marilyn, what should I do to prepare for such an event?” \n\nSee?
12	Maybe. Maybe not.
3	I feel like those kinds of posts have become more numerous within the past month or so. I definitely see more of of them nowadays..
3	We know we're a rather small minority, but I don't think the arrogance that can be seen from many r/iamverysmart posts is well fitting for any person independent of their intelligence, logical thinking or whatever. Also wallowing in victimhood because nobody gets us and we're misunderstood geniuses, is something that can be seen from these kind of posts but whenever you see yourself as the victim, you gotta be careful not to make it part of your identity and comfort zone. Being the victim can be very comforting, but honestly, we're too clever to fall into such an easy trap, no?\n\nSo yes, I agree with that assessment, but I don't think it has to be. Feeling superior and then not doing anything about a disadvantaged situation is pathetic, which is exactly why r/iamverysmart exists.
3	Fine line between confident and conceded. Being and INTP/INFP comes with a lot of shy tendencies and that means humility as well. Like some people have said though, this is a concentration of people who feel comfortable with each other and sometimes we're too comfortable. I do have to agree with you OP.
3	In some ways INTPs are very stupid as well. \n\nI'm talking about stuff having to do with human interactions and sometimes the NP combo makes for no common sense in some areas of life. 
6	Half this subreddit are memes and people asking for advice idk what ur talking about. 
5	Saying something belongs in /r/iamverysmart is often very /r/iamverysmart itself.
5	I like this sub, but I don't think it helps anyone. It's an echo chamber, perpetuating the INTP stereotype with little to no focus on helping fellow INTPs improve themselves.
2	Me too
2	Well, INTP is one of the classical “scientist” types... so...
2	Tbf, most of us are kinda smart though.
2	Unlike a typical iamverysmart person, we of the INTP function tend to lack self esteem and positive self image. 
3	This subreddit in a nutshell: \n\nSomeone of average intelligence: I like science. Here is a basic, surface-level fact about a topic that sounds impressive.  I am very smart...Physics. \*Moonwalks out of the room\*
2	Honestly... it's the main reason I don't come here much. \n\nPeople seem to use INTP as they do OCD, "I organized my books I'm so OCD" but they read a small article and think they're some kind of new super genius and feel the need to share it with us, it's the saddest thing. \n\nI remember this guy only just found out dinosaurs were real lmao, and he was talking about it like it's some huge new discovery that he's spent hours reading about... yeah well done buddy. 
2	I feel like the great thing about this sub is how *rarely* people bring up this distractingly pointless criticism.
3	Nah bruh have you checked out INTJ?
1	I feel like non mature INTPs are some of the most socially maladjusted out of the other typologies. 
1	That was my nickname in a group chat for a bit, so yeah can see that
1	I think half of this subreddit has been directly lifted from r/iamverysmart.
1	This sub also belongs to /r/depression and /r/socialanxiety \n\nWhich is sad because I don't think that these elements are a big part of my life.
1	Examples?
1	idk, most post are about how inept we are
1	I'd just like to say that this sub needs more discussion similar to what i'm seeing in the comments because of this post. 
1	you should spend some time on r/intj.
1	Ever notice how those that accuse others of being cocky are the most cocky? In this case, there is no basis, but it is a general pattern that I find.   \n\n\nDo you have a point besides to piss off all INTPs? Just saying, you could have put in a little effort.   \n\n\nYou say "feel." Meaning, subjectively. Subjectively, you can think what you please, but objectively, I disagree. However, you lead you argument with subjectivity, so I highly doubt I would be able to change your mind. 
1	Meh. We tend to not give a fuck about how we come off as long as we get the message across. \n\nAlong with not caring how we come off, we also don't give a fuck what others think of us, so if you were trying to low-key insult us, all you're doing is sparking discussion. 
0	Very original observation there
2	Yes. r/shittymbti masterrace
1	Me
1	It's called immaturity. All types have some form of immaturity. Ti types immaturity comes from the fact that they think they are smart and everyone else is dumb. That's why we need to develop our egos lest we turn into argumentative dicks. Learn to value Fe more and more people will listen to our opinions.
1	When I was younger, being perceived as smart and logically consistent was important to me, just because I thought about things that no one else around me seemed to and it became part of my personal identity.\n\nI think that's normal for younger people, but eventually it's probably worth recognising that it's actually better to work on being nice, rather than being smart.\n\nIf you do lean into logic, differing context in situations will always disrupt your logical consistency, so re focusing on logic; this way madness lies.\n\nI don't even know if I regard myself as intelligent anymore, I don't worry about it now.

6	Caring too much about what other people think of you	I've always cared a lot about other people's thoughts about me, to the point where i go out of my way to try and better the image they could have of me. In most cases it goes unnoticed anyways, but i often get into this obsessive mindset, which gets tiring very quickly and makes me enjoy being alone a lot more than it should. \n\n\nI'm trying my best to change my mentality but nothing seems to work. I admire people which do as they please without caring about their own image. I know it's a normal thing to care about other's opinions of yourself but in my case i believe it's unhealthy. Any thoughts ? 
6	I definitely have the same problem. Caring about your appearance is a good thing, until you reach the point where you avoid doing something you want to, just because it might make you look bad. I've even been at the point of not using the bathroom when I need to, which is absolutely ridiculous but I still irrationally avoid public bathrooms to this day.\n\nI've also refused several things that seem interesting and fun, because I might not succeed at them on my first attempt which would make me look like an idiot, right? I should really visit a therapist...\n\nAnyway, I'd say it has had one positive effect on my life—it's one of my main motivators for staying fit. Meanwhile, people who feel secure with themselves often end up fat. Although a little bit of extra weight is probably still healthier than all the anxiety from caring about what others think.
3	Confidence. You can either have a good reason to be sure of yourself, or a weak one that fades and changes easily, like other's superficial affirmations. External input should be data to rely on and make your own conclusions, not your assurance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDecide what is it that you want, decide who you agree with regarding yourself and who you disagree with. Figure out why you need affirmation, or just take this behavior out of you. Whatever. It is unhealthy but not hard to get rid of.
2	i care way way way too much too. i don't know why. it also got so bad to the point where i go out of my way to avoid everyone X\_X
1	i usually don't care, unless it's someone i've known for a few years and they hit some topic i am frequently ridiculed for.\n\nhaving a girl half your age remark that you're pretty childish, and not very serious - well, that feels bad, man. i have a hard time believing it was supposed to be a joke.

3	Am i a normal intp for caring for a gameboy more than my (now ex) friend?	Even though I'm a freshman and have to interact with people for school, I only talk to true friends in real life(who are all introverts) every few weeks/months, as we get together and play vintage video games and Monopoly. One of these friends started to act extraverted at a one of our most recent meetings (in last August). We dismissed it, but we just had our last meeting. She called me and the only other person at the meet (there are three of us) anti social freaks and we need to get a life. The only bad part is she took the Gameboy and Tetris with her. The other person (who I believe is Istj) cried at the site of the og Gameboy being taken away. 
3	> One of these friends started to act extraverted \n\nExtraverted isn't about being social, shallow or bitchy. In typology, it's not even a way to act, but how you process info. Every type has 2 extraverted function in it's (valued) stack. (And since we use all 8, we use all 4 Extraverted functions)\n\n*** \nI chuckled at the ending paragraph.
2	The person that took the gameboy sounds like an awful "friend". In this case, I would lament more about the console than the person. 
2	well, it honestly just sounds like a shit person
2	I still have my legendary 15 yro Gameboy SP lol. And it even still works!, i take much care of it <3
1	Everything in this post sounds so stupid lol
1	humans do not have inherent value.  \nnor are you apt at perceiving it.  \nso subjectively speaking, ur gameboy probably has a lot more to offer  
3	What the fuck is my problem?	I want to make a video game. I know this because I am often struck by this desire to create my own when reading books and playing games. I realised that's called inspiration... Kind of. \nBut I'm not doing it and I'm trying to figure out why. \n\nI see specific problems and then think about them, like NPCs in games or NPC companions and how they should work in games.\nBut then I do nothing with it? I mean my thinking on the subject is far from complete, but then I just stop. Why? \n\nLike I have tons of ideas (like everyone) but I don't know what to do with them. How to expand on them. I just make more notes on new ideas. But continue to just sit on them. It's kind of pointless. Lots of them are tiny specific things that I have no idea what to do with. Or things that I've barely thought about. Ugh. I feel so lost.\n\nThis feels like I have poorly explained myself... But I'm hoping for some insights. I'll re-post if I can figure out a better way to explain myself. \n\nEdit: design a game. Not make. Not at the moment at least.
3	You are more enamored with the idea of the finished project than you are with the work it takes to get there. Start setting staged goals within the work process. Wouldn't it be cool to know how to use the program you need to know for animating the video game. Wouldn't it be cool to know how to make sound effects for a game. Keep the lofty goal, just add a bunch of smaller achievable ones on the path.
1	What stage are you on? Which engine are you using? Why not just open Unity and force yourself to do 10 minutes. You can do 10 minutes right now, can't you?
1	Just design a game, lay it all out. Think on it a bit. Maybe in the future you will get the motivation and interest to actually make it, or better yet find someone else who would love to build it for you or collaborate. Maybe show you some things along the way. \n\nI mean there's all types of games. It doesnt need to be overly complex. 2D, 3D, real time strategy layout like Age of Empires or Earth 2150. 2D game thats made retro-like or developed right on the older software. Basic (or maybe more complex) games with a basic layout like Race The Sun. Race The Sun is actually a great example of a basic game thats not too hard to make, but a great concept and lots of fun. \n\n&#x200B;
1	because you are a rational smart human being that evaluates your context is improbable to produce value.  \nso.. instead of getting lost in an end result, start looking at the steps to reach that point.  \nbut probably you should first validate your ideas with gamedesigner forums .. as they might be shit and your energy better used  
1	I have the same with a tabletop game, although i do have this thing where after a couple months I just say fuck it and start working on a project, I also have a good friend who is the exact opposite of me and is bad at starting projects but good at finishing them so as a pair we work very quickly, we were delaying building a hwacha after finishing a trebuchet but we are starting the project tommorow, also it might be because of my dyspraxia but do you other guys find programming hard because of all the shit you have to remember and the incredible attention to detail you have to have in order to make sure that you do not have any syntax errors
111	Not to be a bummer, but do any of you ever get really deeply bummed knowing you've never done anything (nor likely ever will) of lasting impact on the world?	I don't mean that in some lame motivational speaker sorta way trying to guilt you into giving to charity. It just hit me today when showing my son a picture of his great grandpa and he looked at it for a moment and shrugged and went back to eating. Aside from creating my mom (and thus me), he never did anythings that is worth writing in a history book. \n\nHe never lead an army and conquered something. Never made some astounding scientific discovery or found a new land. Never invented something that people will use for generations. He wasn't the first man on Mars and never saved the galaxy with a lightsaber or stopped an alien invasion by blasting them with heat vision.\n\nIt really hit me that so far, there's nothing preventing me from ending up the same way. Does that ever just hit you in a really deep way? I've never struggled with this sorta thing before and it's really almost depressing knowing that unless a meteor lands in my back yard and gives me super powers tomorrow, it's unlikely that anything I've done will truly be worth remembering. :/
22	 As long as I don’t majorly make the world worse, I don’t care if my life led to nothing amazingly significant with lasting impact. 
48	I once lamented this very thing to my husband. And he looked at me and said "But you've changed MY world. And every single one of our kids." And I hate to admit that I cried. Because he was right. You are already in someone's history book. 
7	There's value in knowing you're a long shot, but also value in knowing you really meant a lot to someone. Even if you make a lasting impact on the world I'm sure it won't impact the universe (yes I went there)
6	You just caused half the people here an existential crisis. \nThanks Jack
5	On the contrary, I take great solace in the knowledge that one day there will be no trace of my existence left.
5	Most of the responses here seem to disagree with you, but I absolutely know what you mean. Sometimes these thoughts can lead me into a spiral of existential crises. I've struggled to pick a career for exactly this reason. I want to do something worth doing, something that has a long lasting impact. Otherwise you just live, die, and the third generation after you (if you have children) will probably forget you. That's a depressing end to your one and only existence on this planet, to be honest. I hope when I get older these thoughts will change and I'll be able to find purpose in the small things though.
4	For me there was a line in Hermann Hesse's "SteppenWolf" that kind of changed my desire to make a difference in history for the sake of my legacy... I don't want to spoil it but it's like... not all people who are enlightened are of genius.. Enlightenment seems to be it's own reward
3	No, it’s incredibly freeing. 
8	I dont know, but I'll put his out there:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day I'll be dead, and my ancestors will dig up a picture of me and marvel at it.  "This is your great-great-great grandpa \[Patrick\]!" "I wonder what he was like!"  That is a beautiful thing to me.\n\nAnd eventually, I will be forgotten.  Nobody will know my name, who I was, what I did.  Just a random tombstone in an obscure graveyard will remain, slowly weathering away.  It will be as though I never existed.  That's comforting to me.  I can't explain it, but it is.  It's beautiful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say your children are the things that will make an impact.  Think: I dont know who my random 10th-great-grandpa was, but I know he existed.  I exist because he existed.  I am his legacy.
3	Edwin Howard Armstrong\n\nThe man who invented FM radio jumped to his death. He left an impact on the world in more ways then one. So to answer your question, nope, I am content respecting those who have changed the world for the better. But I wouldn't say I envy them.
2	No, not really. In the grand scheme of things we're like specs of dust in the wind, inconsequential. I'm personally not that bothered about making an impact on the world, I just want to know I'm making memories with the people I care about.  \n\n\nAlso, bummer and bummed have totally different meanings in the UK, made me laugh at 8:30 in the morning :)
2	I stopped worrying about things I can't change and focus on things I can . Someone once said "tend your own garden" so that's what I do.
2	Says who? I started a business that made an impact on a whole country. 
2	Not a lick 
4	This is why I combined my love for photography and my love for hiking and animals ... particularly birds ... and frequently take photohikes I've made some nice images, they're not the best ever but it continues to motivate me to go out and get away from home and into the urban wilderness to relax and recharge - And hopefully one day in the next five years or so I'll do a little public gallery showing of my prints. Maybe some of my images will be my legacy, maybe something else I do will, who's to know.\n\nYou can find some of them [**here**](https://imgur.com/a/g3P8aq8).and you can join me on **Chat Here:**  [INTP](https://s.reddit.com/channel/234819_b801be46e50b71c8f933ce4f082b3450a394f57f)\n\nIn chat there are many types we're not exclusively INTP , all MBTI variants are most welcome.

2	I don't really care. I mean, we're that insignificant. The surface/atmosphere of Earth is a thin thing, much like one apple Skin, and that's where we all live, and we're a tiny part of the biosphere and occupy not so much space. Then Earth is a tiny rock in the solar system, which itself is a tiny thing in the Galaxy, etc, etc...\n\n"Significance" or "meaning" is just a lack of perspective, imho. So I don't care if my life doesn't have any.
2	No, it’s just motivation to work hard and try to do something meaningful with my life. I’m going into medicine and disease research. I probably won’t eradicate malaria or cure alzheimers, but most people wouldn’t even try and at least I’m doing that. Don’t look at these feelings as depressing, but as a push to make yourself a better person. Without the motivation of thoughts like this, I’d probably just be on a couch somewhere doing drugs and lacking any goals in life.
1	I don’t know, I’ve never really cared too much about being remembered after my death because I most likely won’t be around to see or appreciate it. I care about what happens to others and I’m not at all the type of person that’s fine screwing the future world over because I won’t be around to deal with it, but being remembered wouldn’t really affect anyone much but myself, so it doesn’t matter much to me if I don’t experience it. 
1	Eh, there's a couple of things I might be able to do which might rate as a footnote to the footnote of a footnote in a "History of very specific thing X" article of the future.
1	Only if you let it bum you out. It's a matter of mindset.\n\nLeaving a lasting impression on the world means leaving behind a good story, not always of great feats or amazing discoveries. Sometimes it's tragic, other times it's simply a tale of success.\nInstead of aiming too high, failing and ending up doing nothing. Do what you can greatly, and you'll make a lasting impact on the people around you.\n\nYour son's reaction isn't just a result of your grandfathers apparent insignificance, it was also a result of the way today's society and more so youth, just doesn't get very impressed by things unless it is literally happening to them or within earshot. My great grandfather was a writer, and somewhat famous both nationally and internationally. Most people who learns this usually goes "ah, neat".
1	No, I've accepted that I won't. There is a quote from somewhere "now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good." I think it may be Steinbeck. Anyway, I find that kind of thinking comforting.
1	I did, now I do music.. A goal is to print on vinyl one day just to be safe if the internet goes blank..\nAlso this is 2019, when was the last time you picked up a history book instead of Google? =) 
1	I think you might be committing a fallacy by conflating greatness with egotism. \n\nNot one of the so-called "great" figures in history became great on their own. They were lifted up by a swell of other great people doing significant things, and then somehow managed to steal all the glory and name recognition for themselves.\n\nEvery person can make a significant impact in the world if they make up their mind to do so, but it's very unlikely they'll be famous for it. \n\nAt the end of the day, you have to ask yourself what is more important to you: being impactful, or being well known? One is accessible through determination and hard work, but the other is a matter of chance.
1	I struggle with this daily. Reading through everyone's notes, I think it might be worth considering that perhaps you (and I) could be predisposed to deal with this by nature of how our brains are wired; in which case, the problem might be the thought itself, instead of what we're doing with our lives, at least to a point.\n\nBut as for doing something important with your life, the best I can give is that you should be willing to put your best into whatever you find in front of you. A good deal of life is outside your control, and it's impossible to predict the success of your effort in any area, but unexpected successes are secretly built on all the other times you tried beforehand.\n\nThat, and check in with your friends and family once in a while. Especially as you get older, you'll find those thoughts can't find room when you're grilling burgers with your roommate, or teaching your nephew about dragonflies, or finding out you and your dad both love the same band while driving halfway across the country.
1	I can appreciate your sentiment. I’ve been there before many times.\n\nMight I suggest some perspective from [Alan Watts](https://youtu.be/rBpaUICxEhk?t=9)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd highly recommend a longer exploration of meaning here. https://youtu.be/c2HAgdLbum8
1	Nah, because I'm okay with being ordinary. I measure success based on my own checklist, and discovering  or inventing something groundbreaking isn't one of them.
1	I literally don't want to be remembered. History shows only that we choose what we want to believe in, truth often doesn't really matter. Since in my opinion we are just another kind of animals, without any bigger sense of existence. I don't believe in god or any good place after death. I just want to live my live as happy as possible and that's all. I don't care if someone will talk about me, or remember me. I don't even want a grave. What for? Just be happy about my current existence and trying to be best human I can. 
1	My goal is not to be forgotten in my lifetime. After that it hardly matters to me.\n\nBut here is a little less nihilism: let's say you teach just one person just one thing, and that in turn makes the world that tiny little bit better. To me knowing that I left the world a better place than I found it is plenty good. I don't need to be remembered.
1	I feel that acutely. \n\nI am working on a robotics startup that can have global reach and significantly improve people's lives and the environment. 
1	Nope I really don't care tbh. There's this quote that life is a small spark/dot between two infinities, that keeps me grounded. I'd like to write sometime in the future just to lay down my thoughts, opinions and philosophies about life and some other creative ideas I have now and then. Another quote I can't remember verbatim, about seeking posterity in literature. To write something someone years after I'm dead would read and find some comfort or company or ease some pressure that sort of thing. But I can't let this modern life pressure me into doing things. Furthermore, I have always had this burning desire to live my life how I want to. My life is my life and that is what I'm most proud of. Whether it's shit or not its mine in the end.
1	If it makes you feel better, a lot of people that really made their mark on history were A) miserable, or B) complete shit bags. Sometimes both. I mean, we remember real bastards like Genghis Khan, Hitler, etc, but even "respectable" figures were the worst. Winston Churchill was a huge racist/drunk. Thomas Jefferson was awful in more ways than I can even go into. *Christopher Columbus has a HOLIDAY named after him.* Mother Theresa, Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Walt Disney . . . the list goes on. \n\nA lot of great artists, writers, and inventors died poor and alone. I'd rather do nothing noteworthy and spend the rest of my life with the people I care about + finish my reading list. \n\nSide note: the human race as a whole has fundamentally fucked the planet, so we can all take credit for making that impact on the world, haha.
1	All day every day when I'm not hanging metaphysical wreaths to promote my own inevitable self imposed and self guided doom.
1	I think it's important not to discount the micro-impact you can have on people. The small charity that can change people's lives in ways you dont know. For example, one time, this guy saw some friends and I standing on the side of the road trying to figure out how to jump her car. He stopped and helped. It was probably a total of 10 minutes from him, but it was huge for us. We had not seen each other in almost a year and, although we didn't know it, it would be another 2 years until we saw each other again. Him detouring 10 minutes, is probably not something he'll remember 20 years down the road. But I definitely still remember that day with my friends. I had a heart to heart with one of those girls, helped her process her feelings, and she finally broke up with a guy who she thought she would get married to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've had other examples of people helping out when working at a non-profit. Whether it was just going above and beyond for their jobs, like getting rushed orders in or if it was actually donating/time money, it really helped our organization as we were all volunteers and operating on pretty thin margins. This freed up resources for us to do more outreach out to others. Who knows how working with our non-profit impacted these kids?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think sometimes the opposite happens. Sometimes, all of our actions are can be so impact on people and we don't even know it. I think if we all take a look at our lives, we can say that we didn't get to where we were alone. I know for me, there have been family members to help me out, bosses who gave me more responsibility and wrote recommendation letters for me, teachers that prepared me well and pushed me, friends who let me lean on them when I needed to. None of these people are really "change makers" on their own, but by empowering and supporting each other, I think the collective sum of what we are doing is pretty incredible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think the era of the super genius individual is kind of over. Now, we are far more collaborative in our efforts. For example, one of the greatest, most innovative features to come out today is CRISPR. There isn't really one person who is a household name for that. It was a team effort. The world is just too complicated anymore for anyone person to make that huge significant contributions. \n\n&#x200B;
1	I remember getting so depressed by this that it made me want to do something bigger. My dumb idea was joining the US Marines. Bc I thought of Ronald Reagans quote, about how most people done nothing with their lives and Marines dont have that problem. I came to my senses. I respect those guys but I dont get the same motivation fuel as them. They yelled at each other to hype each other up but when I was yelled at I would be like "screw you, I'm going home." \n\nThat was my realization that I'm kinda ok with doing nothing extraordinary. Or at least not get as depressed by it. 
1	Be the best person you can be to others while you live. In my opinion, you should feel guilty about not giving to charity. You have an opportunity to be a positive force for many people, take it and they will be impacted. 
1	When I was younger. Now I am only concerned with living for myself and trying to impact the lives of those close to me. Most people who have lived haven been forgotten. That's normal.
1	Just a thought... \n\nIf you involve your son in the memory of your father, things that are interesting or funny. Things that are relatable. You will help teach him the value of relationships and the impact they have. \n\nI put my Nan's photo on a shelf above my kitchen table. my kids talk about my nana like they know her because they *feel* like they do. She made a lasting impact on the world even if no one will learn of her in a textbook. She left a legacy within our family.  \n\nHonor those you love, in life and in death. 💕
1	Please everyone, read the INTP Quest
1	I prefer the optimistic Nihilism view on existential meaning, summed up beautifully in a [Kurgezat video](https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14)\n\nTo sum up, our lives are no more meaningful in the grand scheme of things than a molecule of a grain of sand on a beach. That sounds negative, but the positive you can take away from this is that no matter how much you screw your life up it does not matter and ultimately, your life's purpose is whatever you want it to be.\n\nAnd in thinking about what is important to me, I'm also reminded by a quote from my favorite tv show [Person of Interest in the end of this clip](https://youtu.be/av6x8PD0nXA) that sums up how to deal with the inevitability of death and how to be remembered.
2	Ni vs Ne in decision makeing	I read another post/meme here that you guys (and girls) were indecisive. I was really intrigued by the explanation i got and wanted to see if any of you had additional points.  So here goes\n\nWhat is your thought process when making decisions?\n\n Why would you say its hard to find one option and stick with it? \n\nDoes ne vs ni have anything to do with it?\n\nFor me I always see through the possible outcomes of every option and can tell which option will end with the best result. Its not difficult for me to create a criteria to evaluate the options with. Once i make a decision i dont revisit it unless there is a significant change to the criteria i used. I can also tell when i get lost in the options and keep view of the scenario as a whole. When im evaluating options i also evaluate the energy i am spending in relation to the importance of the decision.
3	Hmm, it's a combination of things. 1) not having a strong emotional attachment/motivation for a specific choice, if they are all more or less suitable (seeing how multiple paths are all plausible). 2) worrying about what interesting information I'll miss out on in the path I don't choose. 3) an obsession with the big picture--how all the puzzle pieces fit together as a whole. 4) fear of the 2% chance it's a mistake and I missed something important. 5) fear of commitment (wanting to preserve freedom from abritary rules, dogmas,  etc). 6) thinking about the future (knowing things will change, and what appears to be a tentative  good choice now will not necessarily be a suitable choice later when variables change, as they inevitably do). \n\nI don't know if this is strictly Ne related. But the fact its an extroverted function, together with Fe, I'm often not even thinking about myself in the scenario/outcome, but often about other people or things.  For example, when someone asks me to pick a restaurant to go out to eat, and I really don't care, I will come up with many  suggestions that I think will appeal to the other person. But I will struggle to choose one for myself. 
1	It's hard to say it really depends on the situation and the particular decision in question. In general I'm pretty slow with drastic moves, but it's difficult to explain why that is.\n\nI can't make a decision unless I'm really pressed for most things. Especially mundane everyday stuff. It's like, whatever, I don't really care... like for example what to order at a new restaurant. It's irrelevant, someone else can make that decision for me. I also can't make a strong decive move in a situation unless I feel I really have to and there's no getting out of it. And in general, I'm pretty flexible with most decision-making situations. I think there is an element of open-mindedness and an element of anxiety to it.\n\nBut for things that are important to me I usually know what I want. Or I'll spend the time researching so that I know I've made the right decision.\n\nI can't comment on cognitive functions I don't take the cognitive functions thing seriously...
1	Considering all options and picking the best.\n\nWhich of course means trouble, because considering everything means researching it, and "best" isn't always easily definable. This, I either take lots of time or don't decide at all.\n\nYes, our decision style is basically due to TiNe. It's the same for all types, imho. \n
1	contextual  \nstimulus > awareness depending on existing data > analysis through vision attribute > filtered through value system > conclusion  \n\nps i ignored the part of the flow where you get an emotional reaction, as that part is mostly irrelevant to intps in a pure conceptual problem/  \nbut you should look into it more when it gets personal or intense. as the unconscious has important information to communicate  
1	I felt t one point that I was in fact to indecisive, so as a way to correct it I tried to rely more on my gut feelings, everything's better now
1	In terms of cognitive fx, it’s because of tool ne and polr se. This means we use ideation/improvisation as a tool almost anything we do, and we don’t really get how or when to follow through on decisions. As far as I can tell, infps are like this as well.
1	I don't really care what the outcome is... usually because I've thought it all through and know my personal limits.\n\nI ask google to flip a coin or roll a dice and whatever answer I get, I'm ok with since I created and thought through the options.\n\nI know it's weird, but it works for me.
4	How do you deal with someone saying you're wrong when you know you are right?	I have found that I tend to let this bother me way more than I should. How do you guys deal with someone who won't listen to you when trying to explain why something is wrong? Specifically this is aimed at discussions with someone who has seniority over you in work or personal life.\n\n
4	It used to bother me more when I was younger, but I just try to let it go more often than not. People have their own "truth" and their own "facts", and I can just accept there is no way we are going to see eye to eye on the topic. Especially if I know I arrived at an idea in a very roundabout or obscure way, that I can't easily explain or expect others to follow. Plus. There is always a possibility I'm wrong or missing something, or they might know more than me...if they are being respectful I will listen and think about their perspective. But if they are just being rigid and full of themselves, I will try to change the topic or move on. If they show they aren't really interested in what I think, I'm not gonna expend the energy trying to convince them. 
2	Fuck em, they have more experience at being a cretin and they will beat you
2	You nod and agree passive aggressively and go about with your life because they refuse to listen to reason.
2	I say "Okay" and stop arguing or giving input at all.
2	If you spent the day arguing with every dumbass you came across you would have no time to do anything. Short of personal mortal danger I pretty much ignore every dumb thing other people do. \n\nIt's like the opposite of road rage. I expect it. 
2	Personal life: never talk to them again (don't recommend this for everyone, but it works great for me!)\n\nProfessional life: I'll go along with it. If their method isn't working, eventually they'll shoot themselves in the foot. If it's impacting MY work, I'll actually try to do something about it. Somethings that's worked for me: I bring up my better idea during a meeting so that it's not me vs. the other person. That way, it's not a confrontation. But if your idea, method, etc. is truly right or better, getting it out in front of multiple people instead of just the one should help, and they're not going to tell EVERYONE they're wrong (hopefully). 
2	While arguing, you'll get to a point where you realize there is no use because they are unwilling to budge their point of view. At that point, let them finish expelling whatever vomit is coming out of their face sphincter and then, very plainly and without emotion, say "okay". Immediately pretend as if the conversation never happened. In some cases you will have the opportunity to walk away or return to whatever you were working on. You'll be presented with one of three outcomes - \nA: they allow the discussion to end, in which case they unconsciously convey that they know they are wrong and you will therefore know that they were lying to you / trolling you.\nB: they continue to try to argue their point with you, to which you simply continue to unemotionally repeat "okay". (Important: don't say "okay" in a frustrated out you "go away" tone, because that signals that you have given up and they "win") in this case, it has become more important to the other individual that they "win" the argument, your goal is to rob them of that "victory" whilst putting in the least cognitive effort possible. This will leave them very frustrated and less likely to try to"win arguments" with you in the future.\nC: your emotionless "okay" will be frustrating to them, but in more of a "smack in the face" way. And they'll immediately recognize that they have been creating a problem. They might not recognize what that problem is, but it will, at least for a brief moment, force them into introspection. That presents you with an opportunity to make your case. By itself, you only have a very brief moment to make your case; but not nearly enough time for an INTP. The best use of this moment is to interrupt their introspection and ask them if they are willing to listen to an argument, without interruption, and to view that argument with an open mind before making judgements or counter arguments. You'll either get a yes or a no, (you probably won't get a no). When they interrupt you to make a counter point, go back to the emotionless "okay", and if they allow you to finish, only because they were waiting for their turn to speak so they can start making their counter argument, you simply state "you promised to look at my argument with an open mind. I'm sorry, but I'm no longer willing to have this conversation with you" and then you get to walk away while refusing to continue because the other person is simply wasting your time at this point.\n\nThe emotionless "okay" works miracles.
1	"That's not a valid counter-argument."  \n\n\nEither they huff off realizing that I refuse to respond emotionally, or they give a (somewhat) better defense of their view, which I will likely proceed to dismantle.
1	Why do you care what they think?
1	Just let it go. 
1	I could always take criticism, even insults. But to be told I was wrong when I knew I wasn't undermind my understanding of the world, and that threatened and frightened me as a kid. Worse, if it didn't make me doubt what I knew and relied on, it made me doubt and even mistrust those charged with caring for, instructing and having authority over me.  \n\nAs an adult, I shrug; somebody else being wrong makes no difference to me, my life or the truth. The world is still spherical even if Barbara from HR says it's flat, y'know?
1	Honestly, being right can suck.  
1	Find someone with Te to lead and mediate a discussion.\n\nYou can’t tell someone with Ti they’re wrong.  Like INTPs of all types should know this.\n\nShort answer is engage your Fe to temper your arguments.  Ti-Fe together can with effort effectively emulate Te.\n\nCould also adapt by leveraging your perception via Ne-Si.  Knowing a person’s position and thoughts before they say them is far more useful than willfully bringing about direct confrontation.  The trick is not to let your perceptions presume the actual intent of the other person.

4	p in intp stands for procrastination
3	I'm procrastinating right now Rip.
3	you even procrastinated on cropping that image
3	tbh I think this is less a sub for people with a certain personality type and more a sub for people with self-regulation issues.\n\nThere's definitely an extent to which this is a physiological/chemical problem, and there are actions you can take on that front that will help you, but at some point you're going to have to deal with the emotional triggers that cause you to want to do something else. Maybe the task seems intimidatingly large, or maybe you're not totally sure how to continue. In those cases, breaking it up into doable steps will help. Creating a cue or trigger to get started as a matter of habit is also helpful.\n\nKeep in mind that social media sites are designed to prey on the maladaptive defense mechanism that is your desire to distract yourself.
9	I hate that this is screenshotted from an crappy samsung 
2	Now we are working with Ducts, quack!
2	I'm an ENTP memelord and I rate this meme okhand/10
1	stop attacking me
1	Just give me free karma already!\n\n&#x200B;
1	It's funny because I also am procrastinating atm
1	Be productive in ways that won’t benefit you for a long time, thus being productive with no way to prove it 😐
1	I’ve seen like 4 memes about procrastination and I feel called out. I’ve got a Model UN tomorrow and am very loosely prepared
1	Is it bad if I read this as pro-castrate?
1	oh I love when people play with affixes  
1	took me about a minute of staring before the loudest nose laugh ive had in a week
3	Anyone was able to deal with his zero-motivation and procrastination?	Its destroying me as a student
6	Find pursuits that genuinely motivate you. Sounds like school isn't one of them. That's okay. You can still find them alongside or after school. I was a bad student too, but adulthood after that got much better.
10	Grow up and just do it
3	I have this problems too. But I have to do what I suppose to do anyway because deadline is my motivation. 
3	I think that one has to find motivation through things that they love and fear losing. For me I have to stay motivated to stay out of the hospital by working out everyday..\n\nThe trick is to know what you want it for and then motor through like a machine or a beast. That's my opinion.
2	I’ve come to view these periods as phases...my brain is internally working out some things, and then one day, I wake up with solutions and motivation.
2	find a friend that covers your weaknesses and you cover theirs and work as a duo, also i just have this thing where in the middle of nowhere i just say fuck it and do the task
2	Yes - I dropped out and started taking low-paying jobs around the world in order to travel and explore. Very enlightening! Education is overrated anyway.
1	The solution comes from a combination of self-reflection and personal experience. You will eventually find a reason to be the best person you can be, or at least move toward being the person you think you want to be. You lose sight of motivation / lack thereof, and you just start doing the things you need to do because all you want is to reach the goal you have set for yourself. Is there somewhere you want to go in the world? Somewhere else you want to move to? Some career you want to have? Whatever it may be, it will manifest itself. 
1	study with someone, to hold yourself accountable. it's also very motivating.
1	What do you think the purpose of school is? \nJust to get a paper....? \nOr friends...? \nOr grades....? \nOr knowledge...? \n\nLooking back....when I was student. Indeed I am not using most of the things I learned when I was in school. Those math theories/physics/chem...etc. But there are a whole lot to gain. The soft-skill which is even more important to live life well. I gained...\n\n- The wisdom to know that best effort will give best grades;\n- The wisdom to know that even best effort can result in failure;\n- The wisdom to know failure is ok, and it's not effecting my value as a human being;\n- The courage to start all over again in a better way;\n- How to do self-reflection objectively;\n- The habit to give my best effort in anything so I don't regret it in the future;\n- How to challenge my limit and raise my own bar everytime;\n- How to efficiently manage my time;\n- How to efficiently manage my money;\n- How to internally motivate myself;\n\nJust like Steve Jobs said...\n“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.”\n\nIt's only now that I am looking back that I understand how the dots of my past are connected to each other.\n\nThere are so many things you can use to motivate yourself. Mine is quite silly. Whenever it's new term or exam time, I always imagine myself as Xena the Warrior Princess, bravely charging forward and destroying her enemies. And annually I watched Prince of Tennis anime. Why? Because that anime shows that the highest growth, you can find it in struggle and facing challenges head on. And I have playlist of encouraging songs, like Pink - Just like fire, or Kelly Clarkson Second Wind. \n\nEven the classic like Edith Piaf - Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien. Which is one of my favorites. No matter what happens in your past.....do not regret it for those past days bring you to this moment. You can simply start anew. \n\nAnd I love reading quotes also...and saved them to notes on my phone and read them. Like these...\n\nI do it because I can. I can because I want to. I want to because you said I couldn't. Unknown.\n\nOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. - Marianne Williamson\n\nThe most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than our suffering. - Ben Okri\n\nI can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying. - Michael Jordan\n\nBut this is my favorite of all:\nSometimes I feel like giving up, then I remember I have a lot of motherf*ckers to prove wrong!\n\nHave you ever in your life challenge yourself? That you are losing sleep over it or losing health because you really really want it.\n\nI did it once when I was in high school junior year. My grade was dropped to #17, it was never happened to me before. Really...I was always top 3 since elementary school until that term. So I challenged myself for the rest of the year. I managed to move to rank #2 by the next term and rank #1 by the next term. But my health was dropped and I was in a hospital for a week. Did I do it for my grades or praises from people...? No. But I learned my lesson of how obsessive I can be and how unhealthy it can be. That is why after working now, I can catch myself whenever I am starting to get so caught up in project. I work in IT so the pressure can be so tremendous sometimes.\n\nSchool is the best time really...for you to learn everything you want, read every books you want without the pressure of financial because you still supported by your parents. Use your time well because you will not get it back. \n\nNon, Je Ne Regrette Rien! No regrets!
1	Simplemind App	I just saw this app...\n\n[https://simplemind.eu/download/free-edition/](https://simplemind.eu/download/free-edition/)\n\nI can't resist giving this a try. Has anyone used this before? It looks like a playground. :D
4	Is everything, in the end, ironic?	It seems that the deeper we get into post-modernism, the more complex and multidimensional becomes the entanglement between irony and sincerity. Everything that is sincere is simultaneously ironic in multiple other ways, and everything that is ironic is sincere (which in turn is both ironically sincere and sincerely ironic).\n\nHaving a good sense of fashion means ironically dressing unfashionably. Being smart is about ironically being a failure. The dead are just ironically lifeless. The fish breathe water ironically. I am unironically stupid, so am I intelligent or not?\n\nI have caught myself justifying something embarrassing to myself by pretending that I knew that other people knew I was only kidding around. When does it end? No doubt soon I will feign embarrassment (as an ironically non-embarrassed person) in order to signal to other people that I'm only acting as if I thought they knew I'm only joking, just to avoid looking like I'm really hiding my embarrassment.\n\n\n
3	so, there are some adjectives that can fit about anything. almost anything can be pointless. funny. lovely. beautiful. ugly. The pattern here is that this is about viewpoints. \n\nObjectively, one characteristic should stand out. If three characteristics are prominent, then your vision isn't broad enough.  Everything can be ironic, as well as how anything can be sad or sexy. But, objectively, what is the best way to describe it.
2	It ends with you. You're just trying to control the narrative that others have about you. Just be sincere. 
2	Oh the irony.
1	what the flip
1	Oh it's you.  How do I block you? 
1	But now we’re back at the beginning.
1	Applying dichotomous relationships to the objective just so you can parse meaning is, I suppose, it’s (your) own irony.\n\nThere is no meaning like your meaning.\n\nRealize what is self inflicted.  Suddenly nothing is ironic.
22	Factorio will kill you.

5	thats Ark or RS2, AOE3 for me
4	Was straight addicted to this for a while. Try the darkstar modpack too!
4	also try rimworld, kenshi, and cities: skylines for a similar effect. especially rimworld
2	I recognized that and forced myself to actually finish the game. After 60 hours or so I launched the rocket and was able to put the game away, satisfied. I've been clean now for over six months!

13	Favorite weather?	What's everyone's favorite type of weather and do you think it's a type based thing or just a personal thing? \n\nPersonally I really life rain, fog, and mist, as well as sometimes a cloudy day, but overly dry weather or overly cold weather sucks.
7	~55-60 degrees F, cloudy. \n\nI doubt personality/type really has much baring on this, but it's interesting to think about i suppose. 
6	Chilly-cool (7-14 C), humid, with a heavy fog or mist falling. The smell of damp earth filling the air. What I imagine a cloud forest to be like. That is my favorite weather.
6	Those cold, dark, silent winter evenings where you can hardly bear to be outside because your presence, your very breath, is breaking the spell.  So you go back inside, wistful that you can't be as cold and still as the night, but satisfied that it exists around you.  \n\nThunderstorms that wake you in the middle of the night. \n\nRain that lasts longer than an afternoon.
6	Snow and rain
3	60's, rain.\n\nFuck the sun, fuck the heat, but I'll take heat over just flat cold.
4	Rain, fog, or heavy snowfall.\n\nSo basically anything that keeps everyone inside, so the outside is peaceful
3	Overcast and rain that lasts all day 
3	Fog, rain and mist here also, grey skies and colorful fallen leaves.\n\nNot that I don't like sun or anything.
3	Sunny to get that vitamin D action ,, only excuse to walk outside 
2	I'm in a Northern Climate so I love the fresh sun of spring... It reminds me of new prospects and stuff.
2	Overcast, misty, damp but not sticky-humid. Sunny clear sky is ok if it's cool out, but hot weather and thick humidity (or severe cold and dryness) are yuck.  \n\n\nI feel cocooned and safe to let my mind wander in rest when there's cloud cover. Open skies make me feel anxious like I'm supposed to be doing something.
2	Cyclones. 
2	I absolutely love snow, too bad we only get it a few days a year where I live (if at all) thanks to global warming.\n\nI typically prefer a sunny day (less if it means plenty of people outside) to a rainy day, or though I love rain/storms at night... Helps me sleep for some reason).
2	75-80° and partly cloudy 
2	Same.  Rainy, misty, foggy, cloudy, dark, cold.  Fall/Winter\n\nI greatly appreciate video games with that sort of atmosphere. Like S.T.A.L.K.E.R, and even Spintires: Mudrunner. But especially, the Chernobyl missions from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.\n\nThis pretty much sums it up:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/HFxUdIQ](https://imgur.com/a/HFxUdIQ)
1	In the past: whatever weather I wasn't currently experiencing, unless it's 60F sunny with a slight breeze \n\nThese days: whatever weather I'm currently experiencing, unless it's blistering heat and sun (>95F)
1	I do enjoy snowy days indoors and the sound of rain but the weather has been so miserable here lately I am really craving some sunshine and warmer weather. \n\nIn general I really like between 55-65 with full sun and very light wind or between 65-75 with a few clouds and a bit more wind to keep it temperate.

3	Falling for an ESFJ?? Is this love or?	\* changed her name because um yea lol\n\nSo.. I met this girl,Apple\* through a school programme, she didn't really stand out to me initially(she was quiet in the group) and it took me a while(1-2 days thereabout) to notice her(only because she said my name). Fast forward a few months from the programme, one day we met by chance and studied together. This is when I actually started to get to know her which will eventually pave the way for my fascination in human psychology.\n\nSO .. Back to the story, Apple was going to attend an event where a friend of her's was performing so she had to get some flowers. And yes, I mean it, she HAD to get them. So out of school we went and as luck would have it there was no easily accessible flower shop so we had to navigate our way through this ridiculous maze of poorly arranged shops in the district before we had any chance of finding *fresh cut flowers*(the supermarket was selling plastic and dried ones but uhuhuh that was a nono). So in the midst of this whole mess I was trying to reassure her(failed miserably) that the most important thing for her friend would be her presence, but damn was I wrong about that. After an absurd amount of time in confusion over her fixation of the *fresh cut flowers,* we finally found DA WAE and praise the lord that tense, worried expression of hers disappeared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat in the world? I was still incredibly confused by the situation that had passed so I decided to ask her if she knew about the MBTI thing and found out she was ESFJ. And, not so wisely I said "Oh, looks like we're opposites." Definitely top ten instant regret moments for me because her face changed instantly and I had the vibes I did something wrong(positive confirmation arised about 2 hours later after that through my reflection). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSOO.. Went to start digging the internet for all information about the ESFJ and typology stuff, found out about the extraverted feeling function which finally gave me some depth of understanding to the whole mystery that day. I started to grow fond of her as I better understood the way she did stuff and why she has some quirks, and for some unexplained reason her voice sounds sweeter than ever before in recent times(wtf is wrong with me?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANYWAY, this dude who's like some cool Artisan(SP) kid be noticing that she's really nice to me(although we dk what to say to each other ggrekt) and pretty sure he's been saying bad stuff bout me cause it feels different when I interact with her since the day he noticed. But I tried to ignore it and be positive because I don't want my negativity to affect her and things continued out pretty okay(to my surprise). Fast forward again -->  SOOOOOOO, totally shouldn't have done this but one night as my thoughts lingered on for too long I decided to send her this mega long text telling her that I really admire her + a lot of stuff that I think is great about her. I think I messed up because (I think)now Apple feels as though she needs to be that idealistic image I spoke of her being, then again it might be because I don't know how to handle her energy. The way she smiles and calls out to me(catches me off guard 100%) and I'm this clown who struggles to wear a smile and instead gives a pathetic wave ... like damn thinking about it the energy disparity is insane. I wish I didn't hurt her like that but I know I did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sucks because I don't know what we are. Friends? A little more distant? I definitely feel like I'm going that way but it's hard for me to accept even though I don't know how to maintain the little we have... \n\nShe is always warm even though I'm cold. I love her lively animated expressions even though I my expressions are as monotonous as death. The way she hunches a little when she's with me because the other guys poke fun at me for her being taller, I really look up(admire)to her. \n\nIt really breaks me to know that I struggle so hard at doing something simple like saying the right things or wearing a suitable expression because I might hurt her or disappoint her. I know being close friends will be very taxing for both of us but I'm just wondering, what it might be worth to keep things going as just friends and how do I go about it?  I've told myself she's a great person to model to become a better person but am I just deluding myself of the way I feel about her? I know what infatuation is and I've never felt drawn to her superficially very much, it was always the resounding kindness that would echo in my head that would bring about my thoughts of her. What now my friends?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	This is interesting, you're drawn to her, but as a friend or more? I noticed that you have good awareness of her feelings with the thought that you had idealized her causing an unrealistic thing to live up to.\n\nI'm slowly learning there is a difference between being nice and being someone she desires. If she's extraverted and not shy I think it will be clear she likes you if you read the hints properly. \n\nAlso you have to flirt, which for me, personally, is hard. Quick wits and so on. Or maybe you guys don't need that... best of luck!
3	As an INTP, I can confirm a relationship with an ESFJ can be awesome.  I met an ESFJ once.  She became my best friend.  We talked about anything and everything.  Then, she became my wife and we had a happy 34 years until she passed away.  She was the best person I have ever met.  Together, we made the complete MBTI package.  ;)\n\nSo, if you're interested in her, skip the games and just talk.  Take your time.  Get to know the real her and let her get to know the real you.  If the two of you are compatible and interested in each other, the relationship will grow on its own.  Don't try to force it.  Enjoy the journey and learn along the way.
2	You’re like a lost puppy rn; wait a week and see how you feel about her then.  
2	I used to like an ESFJ. After a long and painful journey, she's a pretty good friend now. Good luck.
1	It's not worth it man
1	>for some unexplained reason her voice sounds sweeter than ever before\n\nI can relate to this weird experience. I think it also occurs when you grow fond of someone.
1	Ehhhhh, I do actually think ESFJs can pair well with INTPs but it's gonna be a lot of misunderstanding until you're in your 30s or so, when our energy levels are more equal and we have some boundaries. \n\nMessing with an ESFJ now is gonna be painful but potentially fun. Go fir it.
1	Sounds like you're way too self conscious.  Get over yourself,  forget about other people's emotions affecting yours and practice expressing your emotions when you feel them.
1	somewhat related, but useless:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://youtu.be/raNGeq3\_DtM?t=95](https://youtu.be/raNGeq3_DtM?t=95)
1	ESFJs are our "Dual" in socionics, we share the same valued function, while our strength is our weakness, and vice versa, meaning we value the other PoV \n\nIt's actually smooth riding IRL \n\nBut on the internet, everyone bitches about ESFJs for being dumb, or having an ESFJ mom being close minded/overbearing. There's not much problem when you're on equal ground, tho.\n\n***\n>  to send her this mega long text telling her that I really admire her + a lot of stuff that I think is great about her. I think I messed up\n\nRule of thumb. If it's a long text, don't send it.\n
0	Ignore posts trying to steer you clear of this sub	Lately it seems there's been outsiders (shills) here, who have caught on to the fact that this is a relatively safe place to discuss anything and everything. We tend to look into things a little deeper, and not much if any bullshit rarely gets through. \n\nThis terrifies a small group of people who only want to see 1 dimensional conversations about the weather and what was on the tv last night. They're aware that we won't ever want to have these conversations and are always going to be thirsty for truth. \n\nThey are coming into this sub to try and make you think you are nothing and that you don't matter and your ideas are dumb. \n\nThis is the opposite of the truth. We are the elite when it comes to knowledge and logic. A beacon of truth and trust in a dark dark world of lies a deceit. \n\nThis is a sub you can trust, and (they) are trying to make it the opposite. This won't work because not only do we have the ability to type out and discuss the issues (they) don't want us talking about; we also have the ability to spot these people pushing agendas and all their efforts are essentially, worthless. Combine these two, and we engage the shill and reveal their true nature in a couple replies to their emotionally charged, hatred filled comments. \n\nBe proud of the gift you have, and understand that it's up to us to get the people thinking again. \n\nI can already see this (group of people) infiltrating this thread and downplaying it. I fully expect to be called the same things (you people) call Trump supporters (mostly because I visit there from time to time). But that in itself shows their hand, and reveals they have an ulterior motive. Not a single INTP here truly cares if someone here visits T_D so long as they can explain themselves logically, and I can! So just try me (fake INTPs). \n\nAnyways, this post didn't need to even be made because I know (they'll) never be successful. It's mostly a neener neener post targeted at them that we INTPs can circle jerk to. \n\nEdit: Like clockwork, the shills show up to set the record strait and tell you what to think of my post. DOn't let them infiltrate your thoughts. Trust yourself fellow INTPs!
10	Why would they care about this sub enough to arrange a sabotage? It's not like we are secret researchers working on cancer research or smth. I feel like you're taking it too seriously.
8	He’s on to us peeps. Quick, kill all your emotions and think logically! =p
7	This honestly comes off as a little paranoid. Is this a troll post or are you actually being serious?
6	I have for a while suspected that this sub is becoming something unique and special. /r/INTP is almost at 60k users, which is a size at which it is common for the sub-cultural hivemind to begin to emerge. Since this is a non-moderated group bound together only by one vague label, this community has an amount of dormant momentum already that only a few hubs on the internet are in possession of. To put it more eloquently, this sub is becoming a fertile breeding ground for *ideas*.\n
3	Hilarious that the actual intps reading this thread immediately perceive that this is a troll post.\n\nIs this subreddit able to ban trolls?
3	You wanna show us some examples or proof there bud?
2	Are you saying there is a small, rootless, clique, that doesn’t belong here and are coming to try and subvert us? Do you have any solutions for this problem?
2	[deleted]
3	what
1	I'm not even sure what to think about this on the one hand you do have a point on the other you are being very pretentious and elitist about it
1	While you appear to be slightly paranoid, you are on to something.  I do see more trolls popping up, especially the "yOuRe r\\imverysmart" 'tards.\n\nAnd our liberty-loving un-moderated system is very vulnerable to trolls.  If we arent careful, this could end up being like an unholy cross between 4chan /b/, and reddit.  \*Wretches\*
35	Anyone else unable to watch intimate, intensely emotional movie scenes without cringing?	I keep hitting pause, and giving myself short breaks when such a scene occurs. I've been literally postponing finishing a TV show episode for 2 days because I simply can't get through this one sentimental, emotion-charged scene. I have to tell myself "don't stop it, don't stop it", but I usually fail, keep cringing. I need to watch a youtube video or read something before getting back to the episode. I don't have the same problem in a cinema, or when watching with friends when I can't hit pause every two seconds. I'm not sure why. It may have to do something with the fact that I keep thinking that the actors are probably very uncomfortable doing these scenes. Or maybe I just don't know how to process intense feelings. Is there anyone who can relate?
14	Depends. If the scene feels authentic, I don't mind it. But if there is something about that seems fake (which there often is) I absolutely hate it.\nLike, Titanic is great, even in the most intimate scenes. Terrific acting.\nBut most romantic Hollywood movies are cringy and awkward. 
3	I suppose this is only a very human and very normal reaction to emotional scenes in movies. It means you have a strong empathy, it's a good thing.
3	I'm the same, epitome of internally screaming!\nEven adverts advertising sex toys,tampons,condoms. \nI get goosebumps on my face, level of cringe if someone on telly on a competition reality is on cause I don't do that in my home! On the occasions that I am visiting a family do I will sit with family and they might be all watching this material as they all gaze in silence I accidentally confidentially hurl my own abusive commentary , rather like the person with Tourette syndrome in a classroom setting ear to ear smile and a cackle at my self expecting the room full to laugh and agree! I'm then ignored like a kid showing off and acting out so the mature adults just ignore what you said.. The news was on at my mothers and heard her gasping at the telly, "thats tragic those poor loves" I looked in discust! Headline was "COUPLE TAKING SELFIE ON A CLIFF BOTH FELL TO THEIR DEATH TAKING SELFIE" I blurted out "ha 2 stupid birds one stone thats two less idiots in the world " you can imagine the response I got ?  \nHaha \nFunny though I watch the odd disney animated films with my toddler , I have genuinly had tears in my eyes water trying not leak because Mufasa father got thrown to his death and Dumbo got bullied ?! Tragical  I guess this is my 3 year old  trait ? 
3	Definitely if it is authentic, like the other guy said.  Simple emotion just doesnt do it for me; it's gotta be deep.\n\nI like The Office, how they did it with Jim and Pam.  It felt real.\n\nAlmost everything else gets me cringing.  Especially a drawn out kissing scene.  It's not cute, it's just uncomfortable.\n\nIm trying to remember what it was, I was watching something that actually hit me.  I had tears streaming down my face, which NEVER happens, ever. 
4	I never feel anything for family type emotions.\n\nStrangely though, teamwork or community based emotional movies hit me pretty strong
2	If its really cringe I'll just walk away and come back when the scene ends. Or fast-forward. 
2	Pause it, walk away for a while, minimize it, lower the volume. need to do something to make it more bearable. 
2	I sometimes, forward the "hard parts" of an episode or a movie. Meaning, the when someone is going to get rejected, and you know the signs, or you know that person is going to die and he knows it and being emotional to his people (especially war scenes), sometimes I wish didn't forward those scenes.  It just feels really cringy.  My body and mind just doesn't want to see those scenes. I start squirming on my chair/ couch. \nWierd. 
2	I relate to this so much imfao
182	Yeah....	
15	Trying to pretend that we are not awkward is just entertainment for everyone else.  Way the hell back in 1985, I seriously dug a young woman who was a close friend. One day, she asked me why I was looking at her funny. No matter how hard I dodged and weaved, she would not let go. Finally, in a fit of desperation, I said, "I want to ask you out, but I don't know how. Then I waited for the universe to implode. Instead, she said, "You just did, silly. And I feel the same way." We have been married 31 years.
16	Fact: if she's having fun or likes you or finds you interesting, she won't give a shit about that. She'd probably find it funny. Your awkwardness is more in your mind than in hers.
2	Actually, you should let her know that you're awkward if you want a genuine connection. If she's worth it, she wouldn't run away and would find it amusing or interesting.
1	Laughed so hard. Thank you.
-2	Simple solution: stop relating to social-manipulation of any and all forms. If a bitch shit-tests you, GTFO and leave her hanging. Block her #, and give her the cold shoulder if she confronts you about it. In fact, scare the shit out of her if she confronts you about it, and make her feel 10x's more uncomfortable than she was trying to do to you with "shit testing". 
11	What is the scientific method of overcoming depression?	This isn't a post asking for miracle advice that will instantly cure me of depression. I know it will take maximum effort of my own and will not happen by accident. I won't pretend I am trying to overcome it. I have currently given up, and am waiting for an opportunity (when high school ends) to start trying again. I know that is not the way to go about it but that's what I'm doing. I have found that not trying, as long as you are also not caring, is an easy way to coast through life, so that is how I am coping with my situation right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo anyways, I have been dealing with depression for years now, and am interested in learning how to "scientifically" overcome it. It'd be great if someone who has overcome depression themselves or is formally educated on it could give advice on this. (Although it is a way to deal with depression, I am not looking to be referred certain medications). 
11	There is plenty of scientific evidence that having a hygienic lifestyle leads to a better overall well being. Things like routine, healthy diet, good sleep, exercise, etc. Also, have a realistic expectation on yourself and on your surrounding. Remember that some people just suck at being a decent human, like when your ADC died once and decided to go AFK, really sucks but it is what it is, acknowledge your feelings, report that noob then move on
5	Neurons that fire together, wire together.  Be intentional about everything you expose your mind to.  Watch uplifting and inspiring movies, read biographies about inspiring people who overcame difficulties, hang out with people who are good natured and enthusiastic about meaningful things.\n\nUse self awareness to realize when you are obsessing or in apathy and have a go to strategy to get you out of it.\n\nMeasure your progress and iterate with what worked.  Guard your mind like your body.  Garbage in, garbage out works for both.
6	The hypothesis right now is that depression is caused by adverse environment/ life events and stress, which rearranges neuronal networks so that they reflect the environment. Antidepressives have been proven to increase the amount of neurotrophic factors which are known to increase neurogenesis. There's a lot of research about antidepressives and how they activate plasticity in the brain, and the hypothesis is that antidepressive treatment allows the plasticity to happen, but you also need active environment. They say that the best treatment is medication combined with psychotherapy and just being active in general, like exercising and socializing. \nI can link some research articles later if you're/somebody is interested, since my explanation wasn't the best. 
5	Psychotherapy
3	you'll need to determine the underlying reasons for your depression.
3	So your life right now is a baseline depression. The scientific method would say change one variable at a time, rinse, repeat. Variables could be your diet, perspective, adding or changing activities, removing/replacing habits...\n\nPhysical activity is very important, and you’d be amazed at how interrellated physical and emotional health are. Have you ever seen a depressed body builder?\n\nPersonally, I try and do all the things for myself that I would do for someone else. Make myself breakfast, take me somewhere I like going, say nice things to myself (very important,) slap my own ass. If you feel held back in school, try going at your own pace anyway. Over do everything, or spend the time you’re bored studying something else thats interesting (clinical psychology since you’re interested in the science of depression?)\n\nAs an intp, something else you might like to do is break routine a bit. Go on a fuckin adventure by yourself; just walk for awhile and take some pictures of the interesting things you discover. Intp’s are observers, thinkers, and explorers. If you haven’t tried photography before, give it a go. Its pretty sick
4	> I have currently given up \n\nNo, according the scientific method you've realized your current hypothesis is false. Learn, reassess, create a new hypothesis and continue testing/experimenting.\n\nI've been taking care of my body for about a week and feel fucking great. Was pretty depressed for a couple years. Need longer term results to say i'm cured though.  \n\n&#x200B;
2	Get a schedule, eat right, don't do things that make you miserable, consider antidepressants if you absolutely have to. It takes a month to tell if an antidepressant works, and if it doesn't that month will be hell. Figure out what you find meaningful.
2	Vitamin D supplements and zinc supplements. The research is there to back it up. Anecdotal, but I’m doing it and it works.\n\nAlso hormonal imbalances, I had very low free testosterone. Started taking clomid via my endocrinologist. Once levels rose to normal I felt like a new man. \n\nDepression free for about 1.5 years. 
2	This is very complicated because there is not one cause of depression, all I can suggest is use your power to research and analyse and test different things out including medication. Of everything I tried for chronic procrastination, adhd medication was by far the most effective and instantly noticeable, it's clear that I have some abnormal ways of processing dopamine. 
1	You wish for a scientific method, but then say you're not looking for the most scientific method there is? Are you fucking trolling. I guess you can pray and hope that God will fix you. 
1	Gravity.
1	Exercise
1	I've dealt with depression for over 10 years. As someone in this condition, I could never get so cocky as to say I'm cured. But there are days I forget I have it. Thats the best measurement for my condition. \n\n\nFirst step is physical needs. You have to get real, meaningful sleep. It has to be consistent. Predictable. Reasonable times. I was aiming at 8pm to 4am. But at the latest 1030pm to 630am. Get your sleep pattern together. Drugs and food, drastically affect this. \n\n\nSecond. Diet. Simplify your diet to very basic foods. Basically, water only. No alcohol. Little sugar. No soda. No caffeine. Water. Simplify your foods to fit your bodily needs but eliminate excess sugar and toxic ingredients. \n\n\nThird. Try to find some time to walk briskly twice a day for 20 minutes straight. \n\n\nFourth. Try to find still time. Meditation time. Try to start at 5 min and work your way up. Eat lunch with nothing on around no one. Just you and your thoughts. Or maybe on occasions in the car. Opportunities with just you and your thoughts. Try to get them to slow down. \n\n\nFifth. Seek counseling. There are so many behaviors we acquire at 3 and 4 that we dont notice. There are defensive habits that become detrimental as adults. Sometimes you need someone to talk to, to help think through your own life habits and themes. \n\n\nSixth. Drugs are a guessing game. Its general guesses and when a positive response is reported, they drill down and see if they can find the active ingredient working and why. For me, this has worked. I understood the risks. I keep up dialogue with my psych. I had time to stick with it. It doesnt work for everyone. But it can work and some do need it. \n
1	You’re in high school, your counselor has the resources to point you in the right direction and is in a better position than any of us to do so. 
1	Just give in to the void
4	Any alcoholics here?	If so, you people successful? 
3	I don't have a problem, I swear. I can stop any time! I didn't want those kids anyway, take 'em!
2	Life is my alcohol so I guess no, not yet.
1	Define alcoholic.\n\nAnd uh...\n\nDefine successful.
1	Yes but I gave it up about a week ago (hopefully)
0	Alcohol makes me feel like I don't have control and I don't like that, so no. 
0	I get the spins so bad I think it's physically impossible for me to be an alcoholic. Or at least it would be an expensive habit after constantly puking up half of it.
6	how to comfort my intp	hey guys!! i’m an INFP female and my INTP male seems closed off. yesterday he asked me about my past intimate experiences with men before him, and he seemed fine then. it was like nothing. but i talked today with him and he actually brought it up again out of nowhere. he said “just so you know, please don’t ever talk about the other people you’ve had sex with again. it was like the worse thing to hear” and i can’t even explain how badly i felt. i had NO IDEA he cared that much and i know you guys hide your feelings so much so i should’ve just assumed instead of just cold reading what i thought he was feeling. please help, how do i get through to him that none of the other guys mean anything to me because i’ve never loved anyone before him? how do i make sure that fully resonates with him? thank you guys!!! 
11	Ask if you can have a sit down talk about it. He's done half of the solution by actually being frank about his feelings, be frank about your feelings in return
3	He's not "your" INTP. I he told you he is, that's because he saw it in a movie :P  \n\n\nThat aside, I think you could be frank with him and have a talk about how you are hurt by his reaction. Make sure to point out the sequence of events: he asks you to open up, you do what he asks, he respons in a hurtful way. **It is very likely that he has no idea he hurt you.** He may even be annoyed when you point that out to him but, frankly, he's going to have to suck that one up.
3	There's no need for comfort, especially since it would be just bringing the topic again. \n\nAlso, I think he's a bit naive to get hurt by that...
2	Eesh. He shouldn't ask about something if he doesn't want to hear the answer. It sounds like your past relationships weren't something you talked about until he explicitly asked, so I'd address that with him. Insecurity is understandable sometimes, but in this case, he brought it upon himself. 
3	Might as well dump him. He asked you a question and couldn't handle the answer. No sexual confidence. 
3	Uh... I got nothing. Um. Hm. Okay. Well, first thing, I think you need to tell yourself that his upset doesn't have anything to do with you. It's not your fault. He asked you a question, and you told him the truth. His reaction to this truth is his responsibility, if that makes any sense. His reaction may have consequences for you and your relationship. But you are not morally responsible for his reaction.\n\nI don't know what you could do to "comfort" him. I don't think this is an INTP problem so much as toxic masculinity problem. I don't think there is anything you could say that would make him feel better. He has told you to drop the subject, so bringing it up would just make him more upset. Maybe having another guy who understands the difference between love and sex would be better able to get him to understand, but I have absolutely no idea how to go about setting that conversation.\n\nI'm afraid this is something he's going to have to work through himself. Hopefully, he'll come out of it having learned some lessons, and your relationship will be the better for it. (Though if he says something like "I forgive you for your slutty ways," I'd take it as a personal favor if you'd kick his ass for me, k?) Beyond that, I don't think you can do anything to help the situation. It's up to him to figure things out, and it's up to you to figure out what you're going to do if he doesn't. \n\nGood news, it sounds like you're young, and there's always more fish in the sea, yadayada, other things you don't want to hear right now.
1	It's pretty normal for an INTP to have a strong but delayed emotional reaction to something.\n\ncrazyeddie has good input; if this is toxic masculinity, rather than insecurity, you are better off dumping him. You don't owe any partner, past, present, or future, anything, and certainly not some ridiculous and misguided ideal of purity or something.\n\nIf he's just insecure, and the thought of you with someone else (even thoughts in his head from the past) troubles him, then reassuring him should do a lot to alleviate his concerns. If insecurity is a recurring problem in your relationships (or even if it's not), I'd highly recommend reading about attachment styles and the ways they impact relationships. I think attachment styles are a lot more important than personality type in the ways we interact with our partners.
1	He sounds like a confused individual.\n\nI wouldn’t lie and tell him none of the previous sexual partners meant anything to you, becausse they probably did (and if they didn’t that makes you come off as pretty whorey)\n\nThis guy sounds pretty cucky and clueless tbh.  It sounds like you’re not that into him either.  I doubt this will last long
10	How to stop feeling like this?	Long story short very little has happened in my life this past year, and I’ve been feeling shitty more often and can’t stop. I don’t know if I can make it through this year feeling like this.\n\nI did a foreign exchange work program thing, came back to the US and couldn’t find a job, basically have lost all my friends since they’re abroad and have their own lives, never hear back when I apply for anything, plus I’m gay and can’t talk to my parents about it because they’re super taboo about sex and my mom would be too ashamed by it to tell the rest of the family. On top of that I had a medical episode that led to me taking a medication that made me even more depressed.\n\nI just really hate life and can’t see any way out of this. Have any of you been in a situation that makes you feel like this? How did you get out?
3	What kinds of hobbies do you have? Might be time to start investing in a creative outlet. Seriously, I almost had a mental break down a few days before Christmas (all the extra socialization and pressure to perform, etc). Locked myself in my home office for a day and put some music on and just started writing. Writing is my outlet. It marries the logic and whimsy of the busy brain. 
3	The hobby idea has validity. You said you have no friends at the moment, and that is something a hobby can help with.\n\nFor exemple, I play Magic: The Gathering. I love the game, and adore playing with weird decks with complicated mechanics that work about once every four or five games, just for the lol of it.\nThe community is fairly big, and there are official Local game stores everywhere, where one might meet other people who enjoy the game, eventually making friends.\n\nIf you prefer sports, maybe find the local group that plays a game you enjoy and try to participate. Trying to meet people, while tiring, helps some.\n\nAbout jobs. Sometimes, what you want will take time. I'm a Computer Sciences major, and yet I work as an English Teacher at a local Languages School (English isn't my country's native language). I won't tell you I love my job, but it certainly occupies some of the time I would spend having unhealthy thoughts and helps me get better at socializing, something that, as an Introvert, can be quite daunting.\n\nAnd finally, about sexuality. I'm a firm believer that our sexual orientations is a fundamental characteristic of ourselves, but it is NOT more important than the rest. I'm gay as well, from a Lutheran and fairly conservative family. I discovered I was gay when I was about 15 years old, but my family only learned of it at 19, the age at which I entered my first relationship, and it certainly wasn't me who told them. My mother started following me around and asking people about what I was doing until she discovered. I wasn't necessarily afraid of telling her, I just didn't feel the need to. My point with this is, I was alive for 15 years before it became a thing. 19 before my first actual, serious relationship. I had a personality, likes and dislikes before discovering my sexuality. My personality is MORE than my sexuality, and the same way I won't feel the need to tell everyone that sometimes I am bullheaded, I don't feel the need to tell everyone I'm gay. My friends know, the people I live with know, and my family does NOT talk about it, and that's enough for now. People like to make speeches about how you should tell everyone and people should just deal with it, but in the end, not everyone is ready for that kind of disclosure (my ex pressured me a lot, and it was definitely NOT healthy for me at the time). Be yourself first, understand yourself first. And when you actually feel comfortable with who you are and what you are doing, think about how you want to include other people in your life.\n\nIt might be presumptuous of my part, but if you want to talk, send me a PM or something. Maybe a "pen pal" from another country helps.
2	Find yourself a nice heifer and take care of her.
2	Why not go back to the country you did your exchange at?  Lots of countries have English teaching jobs that can get you started in that country.\n\nI have no idea how to handle being gay, but I imagine holding that back from your family may be weighing on you a lot.  Tell your family, rip the bandaid. \n\nDepression sucks.  Keep working on yourself and your career.  Take a break when you need it, but keep moving forward.  Don’t let depression win
1	Yeah I have felt this way before... Almost like I have to wear a mask my whole life. In terms of the taboo things you're referring to...\n\nThe hopelessness... well I've been thinking about a quote I can't find but it went "the cruelest thing any person can do to another is convince him/her that they are in a situation they can't get themselves out of...\n\nSo I've been working on making a step towards where I want to be everyday. Another quote from Tom Robbins "a ship driven poorly may end up in a place where the captain does not want it" ... Anyways... feel better. Remember that things can change.
1	All I can tell you is that life has many ups and downs, sometimes they last years, you're kind of just have to push through it and doing your best. Managing your emotions and negative thought loops are essential considering most of them are false information, INTPs tend to improve a lot with age, life is often rough when we are younger, especially for work and schooling. 
1	In terms of depressive episodes/ feeling sad there are a few things I can say. \nFor a short term fix, watching stand up comedy or listening to it during car rides. Avoiding negative media as much as possible ( especially local news channels that seem to just show accidents and murders). Try setting up some sort of routine that you can look forward to, it can be once a week or once a day, just one positive thing to look forward to. Could be something simple like getting a latte once a week. \nFor a slightly longer term fix. Now I’m going to say all of these will be much easier said then done. It sounds like lack of support system seems to be your biggest issue ( honestly same and that’s the reason I get sad too) I would recommend putting yourself out there. Download dating apps, download BFF bumble ( friendship app), try volunteering, apply to different jobs using indeed/ monster. Try even just getting out of the house more and go to the library or a book store or a coffee shop, make a habit of actually talking to one or two people when you go out. It’s hard but I believe in you. I have made one irl friend doing this and a few people who I have added on social media but don’t really see outside of that. \nHopefully in a few months we both will have a support system of friends around us. \n\nI’m not sure of your age but for the gay bit, I am bisexual and when I was under 18 I used the website Trevor space . .Org it’s a social networking site for LGBT teens and you can find a lot of support, friends, and I even found a few girlfriend on there. I’m not sure how popular it is now but like 6 years ago it was pretty poppin’. \n\nI didn’t come out to my parents as bi until this last year at 23, if you aren’t ready or think they won’t be supportive you can always wait until you are more financially independent from them. I waited until I was done college and no longer living with them, luckily that was some over precaution on my part because they turned out to be accepting. 
1	That's called depression. First thing to do is to reach out to all of your family and let them know you are going through a bout of severe depression, and that it would be helpful to you if they invited you to do things with them. Exciting things are nice, but even boring things like going to the grocery store with someone you know will help. Do the same thing with friends, and not just the two people who you consider to be friends, but the other 100 people who you've had a positive conversation with over the last 2 years, because although you may not consider them to be your friend (because you're intp), they consider themselves to be your friend. Then post a message to any of your social media accounts telling everyone that you are going through "a bout of pretty severe depression", and asking for help "getting out of the house".\n\nNext, and this is going to sound even more difficult to a fellow INTP, go to a website like meetup.com, find a posted (not athletic/non introvert) activity in the next 3-5 days that sounds the least terrible with 10-20 or so participants, and attend that activity. What you'll find is that you are the newcomer to a group of people that enjoy being social, and everyone else will be good conversationalists who can run a 1-on-1 conversation with you while you merely act as a participant.  They'll be the easiest interpersonal encounters of your life.\n\nThe most important and valuable thing that you can do is to personally own the fact that you are in depression. Tell people about it (but don't dwell) and act like you are interested in not being depressed anymore (because you are). \n\nLastly, find something to do when you are alone, not something in the "general hobbies" category (because that will only reinforce your depression) but rather you need to do something in the "self improvement" category of solo activities. A workout/fitness routine is the easy sell, but the "payments" aren't frequent enough to do only that. Add something like learning about your city by visiting places, practice a marketable job skill (learn Spanish, welding, etc.) Or clean and fix up your house. Do not binge watch a TV series.\n\nThat's all I got.\n\nSource: a bout of miserable and seemingly unmanageable depression starting 4 weeks after 12 month military deployment aggravated by being dumped by a girlfriend 2 weeks after getting home.\n\nEdit: One thing to add. Don't put excessive amount of effort into finding a romantic partner. Without digging yourself out of depression first, you will only drive away those you wish to attract, and anyone who attaches to you because you are depressed is only going to make your life more miserable in the long run
1	Hey there. Sorry that this is happening. Of course, I recommend therapy for pretty much everyone, and it sounds like you might have medical depression. \n\nIf therapy is not feasible for you, nothing will make you feel good about yourself like learning a new skill. Get on codeacademy and learn to build your own website, download DuoLingo and start learning another language, start exercising, or, as someone else said, start writing. I just read about this book called "Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother's Will to Survive." Not my typical reading fare, but this woman basically wrote herself out of poverty.

1	"In total, hackers have stolen nearly $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency since the beginning of 2017, **mostly from exchanges**".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry to be picky, but I'm concerned that this kind of article will spread misinformation. All of the events referred to *don't involve blockchains being hacked*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's mostly either exchange hacks, ransomware, or smart contract bugs. Aside from the 51% attack on ETH Classic, none of them were vulnerabilities in blockchains themselves - and even so, the 51% is a known attack vector and not a hack.
14	Conversation Blocks	So I like many of you spend a ton of my time thinking and improving my one philosophical theories and random ideas on life and religion. I could spend a week going through each one in my head. \n\nSo when I get asked what I do for a hobby. I just talk about how I spend a lot of time thinking about this stuff. The idea of this post comes up now when they ask to hear some. All of the sudden I cant put any of my ideas into words. Theres a whole mental block that I cant get past. \n\nI feel like this makes me look like a liar. The only way i can get my ideas out is if it comes up naturally in conversation, but then the person doesn't care or gets confused quickly because I jump right into all the thoughts. \n\nIt just is annoying when people ask for examples and I cant give any specific off the top of my head.\n\nI tend to think that i have a funnel for my conversation thoughts, and if I try to remove that and let my normal ones out, I either over heat and shut down or let too much out. Idk just my thoughts.
6	We INTP’s have a hard time articulating ourselves sometimes.  Personally, I ALWAYS have a hard time articuting myself. I probably come off as boring, but it’s only because I’m stuck in my head all day just like you. I’d like to tell people about all that stuff, but it’s just not the same. Talking about it with words doesn’t match the connections going on in my mind. Sound familiar? I wish you the best \n\nEdit: try writing, or keeping a journal like the person above suggested. It’s easier for me to maintain a flow and articulate myself if I know those words are for my eyes only. Maybe you could do the same, and afterwards it might be a little easier to finally put stuff into words. Just don’t let your writing get TOO dark. FhTs from experience 
3	I avoid the mental block. I always keep the pace of the conversation, but usually allow them to lead with topics since my favorite ones are so obscure. If the conversation dies, so be it. If they start asking questions because it seems like I’m shy or secretive, I go in to Te mode since most people are OK with it verses Ti. Most people will find Ti too quirky, weirdly specific, and out there.
3	Try keeping a blog/journal?  It can help organize more abstract thoughts into more concrete terms, and in processing how to talk about something to another person, can be good "training wheels".\n\nI still suck at expressing my more intricate thoughts to others on demand, but it's better than it used to be.  \n\nAlso, in this day and age, it's easy to share articles or stories that are related to your thoughts, to give a sort of jumping off point of what topics you're thinking about.
1	I’m with ya. Let me know when you figure it out.
1	Yeah. It's a counter you've got to prepare. The easiest way is probably to just make a list of what you've been doing g lately and improvise from here. \n\nWhat I'm doing is mostly reading manga, stuff on YouTube and this typology stuff, none are very good subjects, tho. Premade answers are probably the key, also works for what you "like" (music, shows, food, etc), concerning Fi.\n\nEdit : You also might want to structure it NiSe wise. We have Ne, so basically jump from ideas to ideas, and that's why this type of question is difficult, we're far too scatter brained, there's no structure. 
1	I send everything in an email because I sound better on paper than in person. Maybe try writing it down. Then, you'll be able to put everything into words and when someone asks you about it in person, there'll be less pressure. If you still can't talk about it in conversation, at least you'll be able to refer them to your writing. 
1	I think actually saying "I think a lot" might come off a little arrogant. But I understand your point, as we understand things so intuitively it can be hard to actually put them in to words. Personally, I've never really had this problem, probably because I have very good verbal intelligence and I always talk alone; ever since I was 14-15, I've had this habit of explaining concepts I recently understood aloud, as if I was talking to an audience. It's just something I do, not something I ever forced myself to do, but maybe doing it could help you.
3	Advice for improving motivation/productivity	I'm an INTP and I am pretty horrible when it comes to being on time, productivity, speed, and motivation. I take a long time to do anything from eating to working to working out and it has really been affecting me lately. I get distracted really easily in general, specifically at my job (programmer) and my company said I was too slow for their speed standards, but meet their quality standards. \n\nI am pretty bored at my job because I am isolated from my team, I don't know who uses the software I am creating, and I am just given more tasks from the lead after I finish the previous tasking. I am frustrated because during my performance review, the manager told me he wants more suggestions from me even though I used to suggest new projects to him all the time and he'd barely look up from his computer, which discouraged me from suggesting anything anymore. Ironically, over a year ago, I had verbally outlined a major project that I thought was groundbreaking and my manager said "think bigger." That same project was asked for by the customer a few weeks ago (the whole team is now working on it) and it kind of validated my thinking that it is normal to feel what I am feeling (it's my first job.)\n\nI find it really difficult to get off the internet googling random shit and I waste my weekends in bed watching youtube when I really want to change the world. I have bursts of productivity that waver for any given reason and then I start to get down on myself that I won't be able to keep up the productivity and so I don't. I can't fall asleep on time for as long as I can remember and I often fall asleep without brushing my teeth, which really bothers me because I care so much about my health.\n\nI feel like I have a discipline problem and it's keeping me from being productive, which would make me smarter and happier. I can't figure out how to stop being lazy and just get things done, because at the core of everything, I am very interested in it. \n\nHas anyone ever gone through what I am feeling? If so, please let me know your experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'm not depressed or anything like that. I am actually a really happy person the vast majority of the time; my thoughts and actions just don't line up and that's a problem.
2	**For Motivation :**  Unmotivated to do something means you just don't want to do that stuff. simple as that. It's pretty binary, You want to do it or you don't want to... It isn't something you can "improve"... What you can do is find what you're actually motivated to do, and you can trick yourself into applying that motivation for others things. ("I want to do X, but for that, I need to do Y that I don't want to do") ... So applied to your job, well, you just don't like it. Am I wrong ?\n**For productivity.** Just get started and make a plan ? It's really only about that, and I don't there's a trick beside forcing yourself.  I read that measuring/timing yourself is useful. "What is measured progress", but I don't know what it is worth.\n\nOverall, there's three options :\n\n* Doing what you like. Good luck with finding that.\n* Forcing yourself. Basically, like everyone else out here. The question is then what objective do you have (just staying alive ? Working to find your hobbies?) Also, are you paid enough, etc ?\n* Doing something you're good at and don't mind doing. It's kinda similar to the above, but easier. Probably the best compromise between the two. 
1	You sound like you're overwhelmed by choices...right? There are so many things you can do to be productive / make an impact that you just end up not doing them? Or am I off base?
1	Work out an end goal that you would like to accomplish.  Work back from what you need to get there.  Make a plan.  Take action. 
1	Oh..hi there fellow INTP and programmer.\n\nHow are you today...?\n\nHmmm.. it's a bit tricky isn't it?\n\nJust out of curiousity, do you know how long can you focus on something like programming before your mind flying around...?\n\nYou're not alone, btw. Sometimes I am also guilty googling unimportant stuff in office, youtube is really "helpful" as tool of "distraction". The key is to caught yourself doing that and do reroute. Close your browser and take a walk to refill your bottle or just walking around for 10 mins and go back to your seat.\n\nI have "rituals" which is like signaling my brain to get ready and be focus, usually before doing coding. My rituals are:\n\n- refill my bottle water or prepare hot tea;\n- have a pen and paper nearby;\n- close my mail/office chat;\n- prepare music playlist/preaching/jordan peterson lecture as background noise;\n\nAnd I just need to be "aware/present" that I am trying to focus for 5 mins, after that flow comes and without even knowing 3 or 5 hours has passed. (Read Flow by Mihaly C)\n\nHave you analysed why you slow doing something?\n\nFor me...usually it's because I really really DO NOT LIKE changing my code. That's why I waited..and waited...and waited until I get complete requirements which is closer to datelines, which is s*cks....because I have certain standards for my work, i.e: completing drafts of req.doc, design doc, test plan doc first, naming my variables nicely, writing my code in modular way, designing the error message, etc. And doing those things take time.\n\nThat is why I am trying to cut down time by having drafts of documents that I can easily copy-pasted. I collect the standard of error message (usually per data type) that I can copy paste. I also have 1 doc where I keep all my username / password / servers / ftp / important folder path / important contact to certain teams / etc. And I have post its of important notes around my desk which can help me improve my efficiency. Or like standard sql / command lines that I frequently use so I don't tempted to click my browser and doing some googling. I like all my important stuff to be accessible in the shortest time.\n\nPreviously I also don't know this kind of thing. Until one evening I talked with my mom. And somehow we're talking about office life. And my mom taught me how she organized her work. Thus, I learned from her. It's only take 5 secs or less to copy paste info from email to text files organized in your workspace in Notepad++. But in a long term, it saves you minutes or hours looking for certain information so your train of thought not get cut off suddenly.\n\nWe INTP are blessed with ability to see higher level view of something. Whenever I am starting a project I always start with paper, then write them in doc draft. Then I have discussion with my boss to ensure that we have same perspective and goals.\n\nWhen you suggested something, did you leave a trail of it? At least the high level design in ppt file to be shown to your boss/your team. You can send it through email to your boss. This is one way to leave a trail of your work. Because if it is only verbal communication, people usually will forget the next day. This is also to help you organize your thoughts and usually I will give the business justification or pros/cons of certain solutions. This is really INTP strongest point, we consider all points before we make decision.\n\nAnd the thing about "changing the world"...? It is a good noble intention, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\nGandhi said: If you want to change the world- start with yourself.\n\nThe Bible said: "If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won't be honest with greater responsibilities." \n\nAnd Admiral William McRaven said: "If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed."\n\nDo you realize...it takes less than 5 mins to brush your teeth? It takes less than 5 mins to make your bed? Try to link small things that you need to do with bigger things. For example: brush your teeth after you have dinner. Do it for 30 days....and it will be your new habit (Read The Power of Habit). You afraid you forget...then set up an alarm with notification "dinner and brush teeth". \n\nThat is part of being an adult, isn't it? Doing trial and error to manage your life and doing something that you don't want to do but it's necessary to do it. Some people like my sister loves list. She admits she lives to check lists. Perhaps that works for you. Unfortunately it's not for me.\n\nAnd regarding motivation, I keep list of movies that is inspiring or ted talk or songs or books. Sometimes we really need external source for motivation and that is OK. That is where the list comes in handy. I keep a playlist of inspiring and energizing songs. And I have certain movies/animes that I always watch annually. \n\nSongs like:\nN-Dubz We Dance On\nKelly Clarkson - Second Wind\nKelly Clarkson - Invincible\nPink - Just Like Fire\nSia - The Greatest\nMariah Carey - 100%\nJordin Sparks - One Step at a Time\nGloria Estefan - Reach\nRachel Platten - Fight Song\nOwl City - To the Sky\nNatasha Bedingfield - Unwritten\nMariah Carey - Heavenly\nCeline Dion - The Power of the Dream\nJane Zhang - Dream it Possible\nJane Zhang - Dust My Shoulders Off\nFive - Keep on Moving\nAlffy Ref - Greet Tomorrow\nAngela Zhang - I am not afraid\nMacklemore ft Skylar Grey - Glorious\nOne Republic - Good Life\nSara Bareilles - Brave\nThe Script - Superheroes\nKelly Clarkson - Breakaway\nMiley Cyrus - The Climb\nIdina Menzel - Defying Gravity\nAnnie OST - Tomorrow\nMichael Bolton - Go the Distance\nWhitney Houston n Mariah Carey - When You Believe\nOwl City - Winners Never Quit\nOwl City - Dreams don't turn to dust\nMasaki Osami - Dream Believer\nRadwimps - Order-made\nRadwimps - Hitoboshi (Human-shaped stars constellation)\nJFlow ft Dira Sugandhi - Unbeatable\nOne OK Rock - Change\nTaylor Swift - Change\nOne OK Rock - Stand out fit in\nBrave OST Julia Fowlis - Touch the sky\nStacie Orrico - There's gotta be more to life\nSavage Garden - The Animal Song\nMichael Jackson - Man in the Mirror\nKaty Perry - Roar\nKaty Perry - Firework\nOST The Greatest Showman - This is me\nIce Princess OST Diana Degarmo - Reachin for Heaven\nIce Princess OST Superchick - Get up\nEdith Piaf - Non, je ne regrette rien\n\nMy annual movie/anime list\n- The Admiral: Roaring Currents\n- Facing the Giants\n- Big Hero 6\n- Legend of the Guardians\n- Prince of Tennis\n\nStart to compile your own list of all things that motivates yourself. Some people get it from pictures of their family. Some other people write a journal about things they are thankful for everyday. Create your own way/method.
5	Are whales afraid of heights?	
5	Just like the animals who have not had predators in recent history and are not afraid of humans, whales have never had a reason to fear heights and a fear of heights would not have led to their survival. So probably not.
3	... idk, but this calls for an experiment...
3	Please refrain from such language in this forum. The correct term is "plus-size women".
2	No, because they are so low.
2	[I don't think so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THlcQOQHOGA)
1	Based on hitch hikers guide to the galaxy...\n\nNo.
1	No, they don't comprehend hights the same way we do they are constantly higher than the sea-bed meanwhile, we are constantly on the floor. They have no reason to fear hights. 
1	this is actually fucking interesting\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwould deep-water aquatic animals understand the concept of heights as we do? well of course not, but would they even be aware of it? I know crustaceans and such can't even \*see\* depth that well. But a whale...

15	How do you read and store information?	I am a slow reader, I read things very carefully, and sometimes have to re-read the sentences, in order to get all the information stored correctly. I often find myself struggling in tests, where I need to read and process information quickly.\n\nMy theory is that I may have slow processing speed and poor working memory.\n\nBut, when things get very complicated, I often do really well. It still takes me a long time to gather and organize all information, but I am able to comprehend much more complex things, than many of my peers. I can navigate all the information, see things from different perspectives and come up with new ideas. \n\nSo in advanced problem solving I do really well, but in standardized test I struggle. Not because I can't do it, but because a can't do it fast enough.\n\nIs this in anyway intp? Or is it just me? And what are your thoughts on people having different ways of gathering and processing information?\n\nI once read that intps (and entps I think) use a different part of the brain when listening. I don't remember where, but maybe it has something to to with that?\n
5	No real info to add on your theory, but simply adding my info as data points. I read rather quickly and process written information very efficiently. I do very well on standardized testing and rarely have issues with time on tests. 
2	Read novels for fun. You need to practice reading to get good at it.
2	My INTP husband is a slower reader than me. I definitely skim read. But when we're done reading something, he'll usually have a much better understanding and memory of the reading than me.
1	Have you ever thought that you might be dyslexic? Are you slow to understand things that you learn orally or by experimentation?\n\nNever heard anything about any of the types using a different part of the brain for anything. That would seem to be rather remarkable.
1	Try the method in the video. Sometimes we tend to overlook our (own) learning abilities by learning a method from the teacher's (perspective).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10auVRva1Jk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10auVRva1Jk)\n\n&#x200B;
1	I don't relate. I usually get thing quickly, maybe too quickly. So I give concise answers with the key core idea, instead of elaborating like I'm expected to... I simplify it as much as possible.\n\nI also tend to look at new information as trivial. I don't have mind = blown moments for factual stuff. \n\nFor learning, I like to rephrase stuff, and then link it what I know already. Basically, making it mine and part of my system. Really integrating it. I don't just copy paste it inside my memory with the structure of the writer...  \n\nIt take some digesting for some topic, so like what are you talking about, but then, it's just a matter of simply cutting the superfluous : All the time where the author repeats himself, or the "obvious" thing that you can deduce from it too. 
18	Oh thank god

I just don’t want to make an ass of myself in front of this grieving family or disrespect my childhood friend’s spirit in any way. If anyone has gone through this process I’d be glad to hear any tips/experiences and hopefully you’d help me not sperg out in the worst of ways. Thank you
4	I think the most important thing is that you are present. Don't try to be anything other then supportive and I think you will be fine. Dress in something nice, but not too dapper
1	Do you want to be there or not? That's pretty much all that matters.\n\nIt's not a case where you have to follow social protocol, it's more one where you follow your own feels, etc, isn't it ? Fi, not Fe. \n\nYou don't have to wear anything in particular (unless you planned to go wearing jeans, sandals and an Hawaiian shirt ?), you don't have to say anything at all beside a basic hello and goodbye, or do anything in particular. I mean, as long as you care.\n\nPay your respect, and get out if you want. (Well, I don't know what "receiving the body" implies but you can keep it at minimum).

1	How do your job interviews go? (I had my first one)	[Note: I have a few years military experience/training, and am a Junior in college]. \n\nI just had one for an internship today (I'm 21), and it was essentially my first one. I wasn't too nervous in the moment, but I felt very serious and like I probably didn't come off as relaxed though I was mostly.\n\nIt's not exactly easy to be charismatic. I didn't say anything too personal, just answered questions and referred to my past experience a lot. I remained as professional as possible. I got a little technical to try and show that I have prior knowledge. \n\nThey claimed I was the first that they interviewed. I have no idea how it went honestly, there's not much of a way to know. \n\nI'm just not sure if I should have tried to be more laid back and really talk about myself, to include personal things. Or if remaining serious and professional shows that I care more? 
2	Depends on the kind of interview. Based on my experience, I do bad when it's a panel interview but do well if its one-on-one. I am able to relate better to a person if it's just us. Having to deal with more than one fills me with too much anxiety on top of the normal anxiety of wanting to land the job.\n\nI always just try to be myself, be truthful. It helps if you research the employer before the interview so you'll know their company goals and values and you can tailor your answers to that. 
1	Depends what kind of job you have but in general people operate in cliques and to make it into your work environment is to be part of that clique. If everyone around you is not being highly professional and back stabby then lax up a bitt more. Small talk with ppl; office Water cooler concersations; going out to lunch with coworkers. Build relationships with those people will be more important than doing your job at an exceptional level. My advice is do enough to get by; guage your potential for promotion and modify your investment based on your analysis. Making connections with ppl is often more important as you may find another job or just social acceptance within your job environment which will make your life easier in general. Unless you are actually incompetent, you have very low risk of ever being fired.
166	The Realization That Changed My Life.	I am 54, and I spent the first 42 years of life with a fundamental belief that turned out not to be true.\n\nI was recognized early in life for my mind. Everyone said that I was smart, which was a good thing because they also said that I was a weirdo and emotionally unstable. It also helped that I liked my mind. I was able to do many things faster and better than others, and in a lot of ways that made me feel better than them. No one says "you are great with feelings" the way they say "you are smart." \n\nSo I spent most of my time in my head.  My brain went so fast and thought about so many things that it was hard to keep up. I never knew where it was going next. I learned the hard way that you cannot control your emotions, and my brain worked the same way. I could focus it on a task, but most of the time it thought about what it wanted to and took me for the ride.\n\nI was still a kid when I realized that I was my mind. It was more than just my identity.  It defined who and what I was, and I had the privilege of hearing its thoughts as they happened. For this reason, I rejected my emotions. I was not sure what they were, but I was sure that they did not come from my mind.  They made no sense, and they interfered with thinking.  Thinking was me, and I was thinking.\n\nThrough happenstance, I met a 96 year old self-described Yogi. He was a fighter pilot for England in World War II, and he met a travelling Yogi during the war. He learned from this master, and when the war ended, his Yogi told him that his life's mission was to teach people to live harmoniously. He also earned a PhD in psychology and offered his unique kind of counseling.\n\nEarly in our relationship, he told me, "You have a body, but you are not your body." I responded, "Yeah, I know." Then he said, "You have a mind, but you are not your mind." I practically screamed in response, pointing fingers at both temples and declaring "Me!" He just smiled and said, "Nope." Over the two years that saw him, we had that argument every week. He was as unyielding as I was, but much calmer. Then he died.\n\nSeveral years later, I discovered mindfulness. I was a student of eastern philosophy in college, and parts of it were like Zen meditation, but it was stripped down to living fully in the present. I started with breathing exercises and was surprised to notice that they drastically changed my mental state. It felt oddly better.\n\nThrough other happenstances, I learned about dialectical behavior therapy. I was depressed, and nothing I had tried was working, so I gave it a shot. Amazingly, it began with mindfulness, which was welcome. A particular aspect of DBT mindfulness is to be mindful of one's thinking. That struck me as an absurd idea because my mind was me, and it made no sense to be mindful of my mind. My mind already was mindful. \n\nIf you are still with me, congrats on your attention span.  Let me try a little experiment.  I am going to list 5 things separated by space and a line. Scroll down to each one and react to it, either by visualizing it or whatever else comes to your mind. Linger on any of them if you wish.\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nA purple unicorn circling a palm tree.\n\n\- \n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nTrue love.\n\n \-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nEbola pandemic.\n\n \-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nPuppies\n\n \-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nAn atom\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\n\-\n\nNow let me ask you a few questions:\n\n1. Did you think about each of these things when you read them? I am assuming that the answer is yes.\n2. When you started thinking about the next item in the list, did you stop thinking about the one before?\n3. Did any of the items evoke an emotional response in you? Any kind of emotion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let me explain. When I did this, I sort of visualized something for each item. The purple unicorn was a bit funny. True love was a mixture of happiness and longing. Ebola pandemic mad me feel bad. Puppies made me feel warm and fuzzy. And an atom cleared the emotions and left me feeling analytical. When I started to think about each new item, the former item was gone from my mind.\n\nThe point of this exercise is that my thoughts are not me. Therefore, my thinking is not me. And therefore, my mind is not me. I actually am not my mind.\n\nThoughts are things.  They are things that we do. They do not just happen; we cause them. With mindfulness, I can observe my thoughts as things. I can realize that I am thinking about what to say at the meeting tomorrow, I am thinking about having sex, or I am thinking I want that car. \n\nOnce we identify out thoughts as things, we realize that they are not who we are. We also can identify thoughts that helpful and welcome and thoughts that are unhelpful or harmful. But they all are still just thoughts. We can observe them and realize that they are happening without letting them move in and make themselves comfortable. We do not have to let our thoughts run wild.\n\nThe list above shows that we can decide to think about specific things.  We also can decide not to think things if we wish. This is more involved than "Don't think about a gorilla." It requires a gentler and less direct approach that starts with recognizing that I am thinking about a gorilla and then choosing to think about something else. Just as each item in the list replaced the one before, my new thoughts can replace thinking about the gorilla.\n\nIf I can choose what to think about, then it logically follows that I can choose what to think. I can gently focus my attention and thinking on things that I want to think about. When my mind strays back to other things, I can gently and nonjudgmentally bring my attention back. \n\nAlong these lines, I realized that emotions are different. Emotions are not something that I do, but instead something that happens to me.  They arise within me, but not in a way that I can directly control. However, I can identify them as emotions that I am feeling, and I can think about them as I wish. Emotions by nature are transitory, but my emotions always lasted forever as I ruminated about them. I can think, "I feel sad. I feel sad because my wife said that hurt her feelings." And then I can let the emotion pass. I can evoke and bolster emotions by thinking about things that cause them. When I am angry, I can shift my emotions by thinking about happy things.\n\nSo when I thought I was my mind all those years, I was dead wrong. I am not my mind any more than I am my emotions. That leaves the question of who or what I am.  My Yogi said that I am Atman, which he described as my greater self or something like a soul. I can't go that far. I do believe that once I strip all the thinking and emotions away, there remains the essential me. \n\nThe essential me is kind and likes to help people. It seeks companionship and connections, and it feels a connection to humanity and reality in general. I suspect that most of us have somewhat similar essential selves. but they are different enough to be us and not someone else.\n\nSo ask yourself: "Am I my mind?" If your answer is yes, then you might find some value in the path I took.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
20	Thank you. I've never been a fan of mindfulness because every time I tried it, it made me feel more anxious, not less, because it was too hard to stay calm and not attach myself to my thoughts. But this was a nice description and I felt pleasant thinking about the unicorn and how much I appreciate the love my mother has for me. So I might try mindfulness again, God knows I need it.
24	Truly intriguing post, OP. I love that we live in a time where a person like you, with your eclectic wealth of experience, can condense the most meaningful lessons you've learned from it all and instantly share it with all of us. Your post evoked a great deal of thought and emotion in me, but ultimately all I could think after completing it was just how much I take this medium for granted. Just wanted to let you know that you stirred up a (likely) unanticipated appreciation in me for the age of information. That's just how poignant your story was. \n\nAlso, I love that I could piece together thoughts of my own that correspond with what I was reading. In doing so, I was able to follow your path to certain conclusions that would have otherwise had to work themselves out in my mind. I also suspect that you've helped me to understand mindfulness better, which will undoubtedly help me to glean more from my practice of it. I greatly appreciate you taking the time to write this out and share it with us. I wish you peace in this life!
5	You've proven the point that thoughts are just something we can observe, but so what? Why should I care about mindfulness? What's so wrong with identifying with my body, my thoughts, and feelings like many people do?
6	I recently started to meditate every day.  I am loving the way it shuts up my mind and allows me to observe things as they happen rather than jumping into reactions.  I've learned that my emotions are a kind of GPS to be used to find what works and what doesn't for me. I had always written off emotions as silly and inconvenient before.  I no longer jump to labeling myself as this or that because I feel more fluid and know my thoughts create what I experience moment to moment. I see a lot of need for this kind of thing especially in this sub. There's a lot of overthinking and worrying to be soothed.

7	I'm sure this helps you, and you have good intentions, but I find the statement "you are not your mind" rather meaningless. The concept of one's self and one's mind are just made up things with no basis. I like the part where you state you don't really control emotions and they just happen though. But I don't like how one has to come to these realizations through "mindfulness" and "eastern philosophy". We're things, like anything else, we don't have free will, though we have the illusion of it, emotions are not something we control, their programmed into us by 4 billion years of evolution, they are not beholden to logic. If you look at anything hard enough, and go to the deepest level, everything is meaningless, not in the depressing way, but in the nothing way, if that makes sense. That's my philosophy. And like that guy above, mindfulness makes me uncomfortable, I don't like being aware of my body, it feels gross and kind of claustrophobic I find, I cannot relax that way.
3	Great read, thank you! Definitely gave me something to think about. ;)

I think I had a weird response to the exact realisation you're describing.\n\nI'm 25 now. When I was 18 I starting practicing CBT, mindfulness and meditative exercises. The realisation that my self or essence (the "me") was really just a spark of awareness was simultaneously enlightening and horrifying.\n\nThe more acutely I began to comprehend that I was experiencing my existence rather than *being* my existence, the more it started to disturb things.\n\nI developed a pretty extreme case of a dissociative disorder called depersonalization/derealization disorder. It grew over time and I started to feel more and more like a passenger or witness to my own existence rather than the agent responsible for conducting it. It continued to get worse to the point where I eventually felt zero connection between my physical/mental being and my conscious awareness. I'd describe it as feeling like you're possessing a person without taking control of that person. Jumping inside them and witnessing their life without actually being them. My physical reflections looked foreign and unfamiliar. I was aware of every thought and action from a seemingly outside perspective, rather than being those thoughts and experiences. It's a pretty disturbing place to be (witnessing everything you are/do without feeling connected to those things).\n\nI had a really crazy ride for about 5 years until I eventually had clinical intervention to save my life.\n\nI think mindfulness and awareness of self can be very useful tools to some people, but way too much for others. I have some friends who've had similar experiences. A housemate of mine got very deep into yogic practices and mindfulness, then ended up triggering a psychotic episode when she was in the peak of her studies/meditation.
4	Thanks for this, I really appreciate stimulating posts like this that challenge the way I’ve been doing things.  
2	Thank you for sharing this; I know that I need to start practicing mindfulness myself, because lately I've been in a not very good relationship with my thoughts: I understand that they are just things that float in mind, but for some reason I pay too much attention to those that don't correspond with my, as I would say using the word you've mentioned here, Atman. And that really disturbs me. The thing is I also think that the thoughts might be true, even though I react to them differently then to those I know for sure are true? When I think too much about this, things get even more blurred and I become more distressed. And after all, what is "true" anyway, do we decide it, or it decides us?\n\n&#x200B;

1	Yep
1	I am really glad that this helps you, but if I'm being honest, this is just too esoteric for me. It's hard to find the right words, but it simply doesn't seem.. "real" enough and too vague a concept for me  \nBut I don't want to offend you, and if it does help you, then everything's peachy  \n
1	Thoughts are reflexes
1	The power of now by eckhart tolle also really helped me.
1	God. I read this whole thing thinking it was r/psychonaut & it still could've been
1	Thank you for this excellent post. I'm Indian and I have been listening to this stuff ever since I was really young. However, I didn't pay any attention to it. Till a while ago, I essentially believed that 'Im my mind' subconsciously. This was until a friend of mine asked me this same question during a random conversation. It shook me as it was something I didn't and couldn't have an opinion on. I had no answer. Then I forgot about it eventually but this post clears some of my confusion.
1	Why does my mind produce this thought and not another. Why that emotion and not another. Why do "I" like x and not y. I don't know what I am exactly, but I don't wanna skip the part where I get to know what led me where I am, or what lies behind my wants. Does that mindful approach leads to become a more whole self? What's the difference between fulfilling your needs and just learning to look attentively elsewhere? Do you just listen and let go, or you observe, accept and grow?\n\nI'm kinda still confused by this mindfullness thing, TBH. Something doesn't click. Attachments are a feature of life for a reason, and something strikes as foolish about just training you attention to look elsewhere instead of solving whatever the root cause is for them. Am I just naive?? Maybe, after all you describe it only makes you a better person. Something doesn't quite click in me though. Help.
1	INTP are Fe Principles. The Feelings that INTP have regard Objective Principles. Unlike other types, our Feelings aren't geared towards self-gratification, but towards universal, objective, and entirely non-debatable and scientific Principles that short-circuit any naysayer's political posturing. 
1	As someone who occasionally has very terrible intrusive thoughts, I have always known or more so hoped that I wasn’t my thoughts. 
1	I should buy a Spitfire.
1	Much thanks! I've tried to understand meditation before, and could never manage to quite comprehend. I think your post distilled it for me in a way that made it exceedingly clear.\n\nI'm excited to put it into practice. Though I find myself, even now, deferring it to "at some point, when I have time" status. Anybody have any tips for dealing with that noise?
1	I tried meditation a few times but always thought it was not for me as I always considerd myself to be a very relaxed person already.   \nBut with your post you totally convinced me to give it another try!   \nHow would you recommend to get started?   \nI found a lot of material online but it seems that most of sites mixes mindfulness with religious or parascientific stuff.
1	Thank you very much for writing this. I'm in my early twenties, and I can detect my mind is starting to mature and my thoughts are becoming deeper; right now I actually have nothing to worry about because I'm financially stable, independent and still have a family that is supportive and there for me. My biggest enemies are my own thoughts; they are the source of my insecurity and fears. They make me question myself, and they pull me into this loop of endless self doubts and anxiety about myself that are harmful for my own mental well-being. My thoughts have not helped me reach clarity; they are uncontrollable and made me latch onto a false perception of myself in which I can't reach. My thoughts make me uncomfortable with who I am, because I'm always analyzing my own flaws; my thoughts have also isolated me from others because I often think about how different I am instead of actively finding common ground with people. \n\nFrom reading your post, I have realized I do not have to be the prisoner of my own thoughts. I used to think my thoughts are my own worst enemies because I can't escape them, but now I have learned they are simply objects I can manipulate and control. I am the master of my thoughts, not the slave of them. \n\nAs far as emotions are considered, just like you said, they are not like thoughts; they come and goes as they desire. Emotions are not something to be afraid of, nor are they something to be revered. They simply are. I have always had a love-hate relationship with my emotions, because they are all or nothing. When I don't feel, I'm like a robot; when I do feel, I feel so deeply that it affects my mood, my view of myself, and how I view others. Emotions are more powerful than thoughts, because they happen to me without my control, and they can end up overwhelming me even if I do try to deny them. With emotions, I think all I can do is to accept them, and to utilize them. When I'm sad, I have to face it, and like you said, evoke the happiness in me to help me find peace. \n\nFrom reading you post, I have realized I'm not my thoughts, nor am I my emotions. I am me, bounded by nothing, limited by nothing. Although my perceived self is a merely reflection of the ideas and objects that I allow to define me, my actual self is that of someone who simply wants to connect to the rest of the universe, and to be malleable and compassionate to all things.

1	Thanks for your insightful post... I love to read things like this from older INTPs... soon, I'm afraid, I'll be the old INTP (turning 37 this year).\n\nI was also praised for my mind as a child... and may have managed to squeeze 15% of the potential out of it. lol\n\nI also have a difficult time with emotions because...they don't compute.  I don't know what to do with them, so I sort of just mute them.  Sometimes this is useful, because in certain situations I do not feel "panic" when everyone else does... I never feel lonely or jealous... and I'm rarely "sad".  I also realize that love, joy, and happiness are feelings/emotions and I'm afraid those are just as muted as any others... Not sure how to unmute just the good without also having to deal with the bad... so I just let it roll as it is.\n\nFascinating read tho, love to hear any of your other deep thoughts or untrue fundamental beliefs! \n\n

1	How are emotions not also just something in your mind? As in the example exercise in your post, I see words or images, I have an idea whether they're good or bad, then I can call that an emotion if it fits one of the situations where English has an emotion word. That can be called a "feeling" too, because a "feeling" can mean a person's subjective impression of a situation. I do think you're talking about something else besides ideas, but what is it? How would I find it? How would I know whether I found it?\n\nI've seen a lot of instructions for mindfulness, and they don't help with this at all. They don't give instructions on what "feel" means and how to do it. I can feel physical things using my body. Then the people giving mindfulness instructions simply ask you to feel what emotion you're having, or ask how you're feeling or what you're feeling in a context that sounds emotional. How would I do that? Where would the feeling be? How would I know it's an emotion and not just some physical thing? Is there any quality or other thing about it that would distinguish an emotional feeling from a physical feeling? It always turns out to be just a physical thing when I sense my body, sensations that would be there anyway or sensations of what I'm doing with my body.\n\n(There's maybe a compromise position between emotions being just in the mind, and what other people seem to say about them, so I have these further questions about that, although I think maybe it's a wrong opinion, and I don't expect anyone to understand: Do you think there's such a thing as a feeling that a person gets that a person then expresses with a facial expression or laughter or tears? Isn't it instead just the case that things go on in a person's mind, evaluating the situation, (obviously in person's mind because it can involve reading, seeing and noticing something about a situation, or hearing and understanding words,) then a person gets an idea that something is funny or sad or whatever emotion, then maybe before they express that in words, they express it using their body, and if a person feels something that's actually related to emotions, that's what a person feels: their expression? That is, there's nothing to express that's a feeling, there's no "feeling good" or "feeling bad" there's just making a facial expression, maybe breathing in a certain pattern, maybe making a posture, maybe scrunching up the eyes a way that causes tears, and it's a person's interpretation of what any of that means if a person thinks any of it is an emotional feeling.)
1	Excellent post. Thanks sharing your experience. 
5	I respect my fellow INTPs	With all the INTPs I know in real life, I have this feeling of deep respect for them. They usually have a lifestyle and demeanor I look up to. I never get really close to them though and that's because they also radiate this sense of judgement. And I guess, in order to get closer to them, I'd have to impersonate a different type that we usually drift towards. It might be the same for them. But I don't know, what's your experience?
5	I knew one INTP... He was extremely advanced and quick witted but he intimidated just by his intellect and perceived social power. He could relate to all types....My respect later turned to a dislike because of the way he ruthlessly protected his own value to the detriment of others. Still. he commands my respect in some ways...\n\nAh the memories. I'm also INTP but I'm more awkward, less confident and more of what some call "the individual" than the society.
2	So I may command respect and give a sense of judgement. Cool to know, bro.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've personally never found another INTP, I think, but it seems like an interesting prospect. Given that we share the same proclivities, there might be a chance of annoyance if we are on different levels of knowledge and understanding, specially since we can be so emotionally inmature. Or it might be just plain amazing. I dunno. But I'm really curious as to why you felt how you felt.
3	Interesting that you would attribute judgment as a characteristic of INTPs. That said, I think I know what you mean. When we think that we are right, we brook no disagreement. I am not sure that it is a form of judgment, but it is part of a lot of what makes us socially awkward. I think that losing my certainty was a big part of growing up, at least for me.
2	I also trust INTPs by default.
2	Honestly? Given the situation I'd probably be really interested in stress testing some thoughts with a more intelligent INTP. But then I believe it's pointless to fear appearing ignorant...
2	Its weird that some people think we give a judging vibe because honestly I never judge, ever at all.
364	Relatable ™️	
39	It depends on the situation.
22	The correct answer for me is “Don’t know.”
26	Is this kind of a paradox? Neutral actually indicates more indecisiveness than strongly agree even though the answers are supposed to be on increasing levels
12	Consider everything...decide nothing 
11	I’m pretty sure my INTP SO answered ‘partly’ to most of the questions on the Enneagram test he recently took. He was also pretty frustrated throughout most of the process. He’s a 9. 
6	My mom thinks I have problems because I respond with "I don't know" habitually to a lot of things
6	Where Principles are the basis of Observation or Action, decisiveness is based in Principles, and INTP are 4th function Fe "Principles". An INTP is decisive if and when their Fe feels like being decisive. INTP Actions are also Si, which typically requires some time to build an internal Si "model" upon which the Action is based. Often, the INTP's Si model for Action just simply doesn't care about the other Actions people think are important in an Se way.\n\nAn emotionally charged scenario such as an emergency could "trigger" the INTP into their alter-ego shadow function, the ENTJ, which is the epitome of decisiveness, but otherwise the INTP could be viewed as indecisive. 
3	What makes decisions hard for you
3	Uh, it depends. Lol me af.
2	I'm either super decisive/hate wasting time deciding or super wishy washy. So I usually put Neutral.
2	Took me a while to get that joke
2	lmao
1	I'm decisive according to my list of determinants.\n(52 pages of A4 at pt 9)
1	I honestly don't know what to think of this...
1	How do you get out and get involved in your community?	There's the classic coffee shop visit or the bar, but what do you do for clubs and hobbies? Personally I'm looking for ways to go out and meet people...\n\nMy interests are music and poetry but I'm not that skilled in either and not keen on bars.  Curious to hear about you all fellow INTP's
1	I got married. Don't have to do any of that shit anymore.
1	One word. Internet.
1	I have been volunteering at a community bike shop for several months. Its a diverse crowd of smart and interesting people. It’s been very enjoyable .
1137	That's how INTP works.	
182	I can share things most would be embarrassed about but I cannot tell another person how I feel about them .
84	Being super secretive because you suddenly have a feeling you've shared too much.
53	You don't deserve to know anything private about me! Wait, listen, I need to process this somehow or I'll go crazy.
51	I hate this about myself as it leads to so many hours of self reflective dread ;_; 
20	I didn't know that other INTPs are like this too. I thought I was just weird that I'm not even comfortable with people seeing what I'm cooking. It's not like it's a secret that I have to eat and what I eat is also not a secret. My family already knows this shit.\n\nI'm extremely secretive yet in other ways I probably overshare.
17	Often I do both at once. We INTPs are good at sharing our feelings (sometimes) but we don't like sharing much else.
6	Saw this same thing on the ENFP subreddit the other day too. \n\n
5	Not for me, I usually bottle up everything and trust very few 
2	yeah I only get the overshare side on stimulants... damn euphoria and chemically-induced chattiness betray the INTP in me everytime.\n\nI suppose benzos do the same thing... wiping out my inhibitions and thwarting my god-given social anxiety.\n\nbut sober me is full-on secretive AF.
3	Everytime I come on this sub I seeing that literally describe me perfectly it is so weird.
1	I’ve noticed this seems to be how INFP works as well as INTP.  Is this some kind of NeSi thing?
1	Too real
1	Why is it that I just yelled at my friend, who I share everything with, that he has no idea what goes on in my daily life?\nOh yeah because this is me...
1	Omfg this is the literal definition of my life
1	Omg, I feel right at home here! This is the best place ever! 
1	Is this 8 tigrams palm rotation?
1	...are entps also like this? 
1	Relatable BUT being secretive makes me relaxed and strong. We just need a worthy friend we can share the optimum amount but since we usually extremely isolated, a random person can learn anything about us.
1	shouting inside jokes at all your classmates\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhispering quietly to strangers
1	I'm glad i can find complacency in a community who tend to discuss their cringeworthy mistakes and hide totally innocent information at the same time
1	Wow! This is too real.
0	No, I just stopped the damn thing in the middle.
2	Question for INTP software engineers:	Is there a software equivalent of a car repairman? I do like the idea of software consultancy because you would get lots of variety and would get to create logical systems which take input and then perform a purpose with it. But I also feel like I really enjoy troubleshooting with a known system. Are there any software systems which frequently "break down" like a car does, and you have to use Ti to sort of re-mold/replace the part that is no longer working? What areas of computer science are lucrative that do this soft of work?
3	It's pretty standard for software jobs to be maintaining and fixing bugs of existing systems. 
2	All software is filled with bugs. The only time I haven't been fixing lots of bugs is on a very new project, and that is temporary.\n\nI worked in a consultancy for a while and even then, lots of the work was fixing existing code. That job was good for getting more confident about coming up to speed on new projects, because I'd get assigned to another project every 6-18 months or so. But it was a little unsatisfying because any investment in learning the code or improving code quality was lost (to me) when I got reassigned.\n\nFor the last 3 years I've been working at a product-based company and it's been much more rewarding. The depth of my knowledge about the project never seems to stop growing, making solving problems easier, and unlocking higher-level problems that are harder to solve, but more important and impactful. I'm constantly chewing on puzzles that we uncover. Bugs, performance constraints, architectural principles, and manpower constraints must all be considered to find the best solutions, and then I must rationally convince everyone else why those solutions are the best choice. And yeah, sometimes you just get to dig and do battle with some gnarly technical mystery and produce a fix that makes everyone happy. I love my job.
2	All software engineer positions are similar to "car repairman" positions. Unlike other types of engineers, the bulk of work for software engineers is bug fixing, refactoring (updating pre-existing code to become compliant) and troubleshooting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not until you get into roles like Software Architect or Principal Software Engineer and their equivalents that you are only designing new systems or only implementing new features and even then, it is in your best interest to keep up to date with at least part of the system you engineered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can use Ti and Ne in private, however if more than 1 individual is going to be working with your system, you will  eventually need to convert your implementation to Te so that it can be easily understood. It makes software engineering interviews a nightmare for INTPs because most of the coding questions are, "Regurgitate these NP-Hard problem solutions" or "Implement my shittly worded, poorly explained question that will have absolutely nothing to do with any work you will do for this company, but I hate interviewing so i outsourced interviewing questions to a book by a person with their minds stuck in the 1990s."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to this, it is well documented that the average Software Engineer in the largest markets will have to go through about 20 interviews before they are able to find a position. The best candidates capable of putting forth the best work are filtered out by this system in favor of crammers who are mostly useless when it comes to day to day tasks but companies like Google are so big that it takes about a year for them to find out that someone is underperforming and by then the damage is done because since they have "Google" on their resume, they get fast track treatment for interviews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S: You will never be as good at a specific area of Software Engineering as an ISTP so don't beat yourself up over the fact that some people can ace technical interviews without breaking a sweat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\- INTP Software Engineer
6	INTP - various forms of intellect?	Hi all,\n\nI’m a 20 year old INTP - I’ve taken the test each year for about 3 years now. \n\nI want to open a conversation up about how not all INTPs are math wizards or grammar Nazis (don’t @ me). For me, I tend to know random information on subjects that usually lean towards self improvement (nutrition, understanding technology, listening to the news, gaming, etc). I also love understanding systems and finding the weakest chunk of it for the sake of potential power - never used maliciously lol. \n\nBut basically what I want to say is that not a lot of people my age understand that I’m not some goofy, self deprecating airhead. Because I’m not blatantly “smart” to most, I feel a little misunderstood. People that tend to be much older  or other analysts ( I presume) will engage in conversation that I enjoy but it’s rare. \n\nAbstract: (hehe)\n\nHow do you guys feel understood in person w/ people that are around your age? \n\nHow do you define intelligence?\n\nHope I didn’t waste any of your precious learning time lol - hearts out to the cynical yet silly intps out there
4	I was never any good at math and fared better in grammar, but would never be a nazi about anything. I used to test as INFP, I believe, because intuition is what I score highest in. \n\n\nAs a 29 year old INTP male I had to distance myself from friends who were reading me improperly as a less "deep" person than I am and that cost me greatly.\n\n\n\nI define intelligence as using the mind's power to improve humanity and make a more beautiful humane world. So in my opinion evil is incompatible with intelligence.\n\n\nI'm a little isolated right now just speaking with family but hoping to get out there and make new friends again more suitable to the more authentic me that I have found i.e. not air headed and goofy, though I am quite goofy I guess.\n\n
3	Hope you're ready for me to blather on for a while. 28f INTP here. I'm not a traditional nerdy INTP/math wizard either. For some reason, people ASSUME that I'm good at match/trivia because I'm bookish/quiet, but . . . nope. I'm a content manager in the finance sector. I'm a creative at heart, but my talent for research helps me write whatever I need to (mostly blog posts about money, yawn). My main interests are politics, pop culture (defining this as movies, shows, games, etc. NOT celebrity gossip), literature, and cooking.\n\nI find that I get along with people on a shallow level very well. I get along great with almost all my coworkers, but I have to say: that's a recent development and an acquired skill. Up until I was about 24, I always got the whole "I thought you were a huge bitch when I met you," spiel from people. This is useful for life, but has really started to get under my skin lately because it's resulted in multiple friendships that, while convenient at the time, are really vapid. To answer your first question, I don't feel very well understood by people around my age, or people in general. My best friend is another INTP that I've known since 4th grade and I use her as a measuring stick for everyone else (they never measure up).\n\nFor me, intelligence is very closely linked to both curiosity and thoughtfulness. Like, I don't care if you don't know something, but are you telling me you don't WANT to know?!!! And if you don't want to know, please GTFO. I'm constantly reading, trying to learn new skills, always read the news . . . As I'm getting older, I'm finding that it's not worth it to try to be friends with people that don't see value in knowledge. I almost ruined a party, because I got into a conversation with this girl, found out she voted for Trump, and then (drunkenly) berated her when she couldn't justify any of her opinions. And I don't mean that she couldn't justify them to my liking. She legitimately just said, "I don't know. It doesn't matter."\n\nAnyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is: try to engage with people. If you don't click with the majority of them, it's not a big deal. If you click with absolutely zero people, then start worrying, because you might be a sociopath.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I don't get along with many people in general let alone my age; I have a kind of "I hate people" mentality in general and part of the reason is that a lot of people just don't get me. I'm very uhh hesistant to reveal details about my personal life or what I think in general. I'm not one to start fights or push my opinion onto others so I tend to be more observational and distant. It's not to say that I don't have close people in my life but in general I just find making connections is too hard / too much investment and I'm already happy with those that I currently have in my life. The way new people get in is that they kind of creep in and eventually over time I tend to trust them more.\n\nFor me intelligence can be a combination of things. You have your booksmarts - knowledge based intelligence; your emotional based intelligence; and then your wisdom. It's not about how smart you are in each particular aspect but rather how you use them. I have great respect for one of my friends in my life who say doesn't have raw intelligence but great emotional intelligence. I may be "smarter" than her but she can navigate through social situations 1000x better than I can. So my question is, "Who is really "smarter"?" Wisdom for me lies outside in a weird place. Sometimes its not about how smart you are knowledge or emotionally. Sometimes you just need to stop and say to yourself, "What is the point?" or knowing when enough is enough. Sometimes the simplest of solutions can solve the greatest of problems and for us to recognize that we need "wisdom".\n\nYou're never wasting time unless you've closed your mind.
2	Intelligence = time x effort x efficiency
2	Well I’m glad you’re able to consistently enjoy conversation with anyone. The best way for me to try to want to continue speaking to a person is to try to be open-minded and see their side. Some 20 year old’s sides are somewhat ridiculous in my opinion. Obviously others may feel the same about me - however, I wish others would be interested in discussing shit that I like too. Some reciprocity! Doesn’t seem very attainable at the moment. I appreciate your perspective though! 
1	> People that tend to be much older or other analysts ( I presume) will engage in conversation that I enjoy but it’s rare. \n\nIf you do not enjoy and participate in meaningful conversations with people, how are they supposed to understand you?
4	When do you up or downvote stuff?	Passing idea:\n\nWhen do you use up or downvotes?  I often upvote buried comments worth a read in threads.  Or, crappy comments meant for upvotes, I might downvote. \n\nOther times, just a passing upvote if it appears funny but I don't want to save it lol. Thoughts?
13	Up - agreement with statement.\n\nDown - trolling, rude behavior.
3	I upvote comments that make me chuckle... or that someone put a lot of work into and I agree with.\n\nI think I've only used the downvote button like 3 times... it's just reserved for assholes.
2	Upvote If it's right, made me laugh or doesn't deserve to ne downvoted. Downvote if it's wrong, or cases when the person is dishonest and petty downvote. \n\nI tend to downvote shitty meme. Also, that fucker spamming astrologion links. 
3	Only when something moves me. If something strikes me as clever or insightful, I will upvote it.  When people say malicious things or try to hurt others here, I will downvote it.
1	I only upvote.
1	Up - good quality shitpost\n\ndown - repost
1	I downvote bigotry, right wing extremism, and redpill garbage

2	Can u please provide some explanation? I'm sure you hid very deep meaning here.

1	Excuse me what? 
7	Thoughts on INFPs?	It'll be nice if you guys could give feedback on us INFPs,maybe focusing on the good/ bad qualities of them in depth(if possible) ,also maybe first impressions when meeting them,your experiences with them as well. On a side note,you guys are lovely ❤
11	No, you're lovely.  Let's hang out
6	I've had two INFP friends so far. \n\nThe first one was the unhealthy INFP. I liked her original taste and her take on life, but her constant emotional outbursts and inability to listen to others was very draining. When INFPs spiral into extreme individualism and "I'm so misunderstood, no one will ever know this misery" mindset, they're really difficult to talk to.\n\nThe second one is a healthy INFP and probably my favourite person ever. She's very caring and sweet. The thing I love about her the most is that just being with her makes me happy. It's a rare gift and something to be proud of. I don't usually care about what others think of me, but disappointing her would make me feel so guilty. \n\nOverall, 10/10 type with great potential, but very difficult personality when immature. 
4	I believe INFP and INTPs' shared attributes (as IN*X*Ps) can combine to create pretty powerful friendships.\n\nMy (INFP) best mate didn't react well to me when we first met, she later said because of my 'emotionlessness'; she just couldn't see any 'human' in me to reach out to.\n\nThen, she watched me be invited (as the new kid at the school where we met) to join in bullying a kid for being gay, only to then get *my* arse kicked for calling the 'bullies' fucking braindead.  She said I were the last person she thought would and the first person in ages who had made her smile.\n\nEqually, I didn't 'get' her initially. Always picking at her feelings like scabs so they never healed, I just saw someone who proceeded to hit herself for no reason other than life threw a hammer at her. If she, least initially, saw no feeling in me. I, initially,  saw no *sense* in her.\n\nBut then, I bopped everyone and every emotion that came within arm's reach with the same hammer, and she were the first to point that out to me, or have the balls to. And, then, I too realised she were the first person in a long time to make me smile too, and the last person I expected to manage that.\n\nReality is, or was, both of us were equally destructive and needed to put the damn hammer down. But it took meeting each other for both of us to realise and begin doing that, and to learn how to put being INXP to some potentially positive use and 'good'.\n\nTo this day, she's my heart and conscience, and I'm her brain and ratiocination.\n\nMy oldest mate (also an INTP), he met her via us meeting. Ten years later, I was *her* maid of honour and *his* best (wo)man at *their* wedding. They both (half) joke: my task is to find an INFP guy to level the playing field and complete 'us'. Nice thought...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	Don't really like them. Way too needy and tend to play victim, in my experience. 
4	It's one of my favourite types. You people are one of the types (together with *INTJ* and *ISTP*) that are «*us*» but in the way society considers likable. You people are witty, open-minded and original, but in a nice and relaxing way, not like us robots who just make people go away if they didn't already. You people can repeat my jokes and everyone laughs ; when I joke, you're usually the only ones finding it funny.\n\nPros :\n\n* You people can meddle positively into my creative/weird moments ; it's really appreciated\n* You're genuinely open-minded (all *Ne*\-driven types, actually) ; it's possible to break taboos and even laugh. No bullshit posturing about how "wrong" it is. Had even some success with getting *xNFP*s to be devil's advocate. Try that with any non-*xNTP*...\n* *NF* types fascinate me, how you people feel something from things where I just look for the underlying mechanics ; it's particularly interesting when we judge art together\n\nCons :\n\n* Your lack of communication, which all of us *NP*s share\n* Your incapacity to put yourself into us rationals' shoes when emotional stuff arises ; we're fundamentally different, and when you stay secretive on your feelings/actions, or blatantly lie, **I'm about to stay awake all night trying to figure out what's going on** ! Really, we don't make as much drama about things like you people do, so just get out of your own shoes for once, will you ???\n* You secretly have enormous egos ; you play «*open-minded*», but it's visible that the moment I criticise, even when you ask for it, you get epic hurt\n* I **really** really hate your f\*cking *Fi*. It's not just that you *xNFP*s constantly try to combine things that do no match «*because that's how I feel it's correct*», and refuse to listen to my *Ti* and bump into the same wall over again/blame me when I refuse to follow (I used to date an *ENFP*, and it was this shit again and again and again and again). No, you also share our *NP*'s problem to make choices ; but instead of going for something considerate, you go for something volatile like your feelings. And then you whine about your lack of judgment and how we're not easily forgiving when we got hurt in the process... -\_- (For your defense, I'd like to state that at least you *xNFP*s understand and accept our grudges ; I've known many toxic people who just gaslight me instead)\n\nAs a general rule : I love you, *INFP*s, I really look up to you, and if I were to reincarnate and choose a type, *INFP* would score waaaayyyyyyy higher than my own :)
3	A bit awkward and can act really silly, but always in an attempt to create a happy environment.\n\nIf they care about a topic, they have an opinion, that is well thought out and backed up with logical arguments. But they don't show their seriousness very often, they cover it up by making very innocent jokes.\n\nThey are open-minded, and do not take offense if people disagree with them. They don't need to argue, but have absolutely full respect of others opinions.\n\nIf they sense that someone feels strongly about a subject, and that there is disagreement, they will back out. No need to cause disharmony. They return to being silly. It may look like they don't care, but that is often not true. 
2	Hmmm how to explain this. When I’ve met INFPs in life I’ve felt like, not ships passing in the night, but like, the village head shaman meeting the village head witch. We do similar shit, but at the end of the ceremony we need to go back to our mutual hermit huts BUT MAD RESPECT. Like a further relationship would fuck up their shit so much I’d rather just hang when we hang. 
2	My best friend is an INFP, I’m actually at her house right now. She is kind, reserved, considerate and polite. She is also a daily drug user, unambitious and willing to rip someone off unless it’s her good friend. She is also from a working class family who is of questionable character. She is very smart if she is forced to think critically about things, but she does not like to, typically. Talking to her is a lot of fun though, and she never judges me so why would I to her? \nShe is usually in a relationship, and devoted her entire life at the moment to whomever she happens to be dating, neglecting any non romantic relationships she has which are few.\n\nI forgive her when she ghosts me for long periods of time or when she moves across the country (or a different country) for her boyfriend of the month. \n\nAnd she forgives me when I’m irritated or say something that bothers her or sound condescending. 
2	* Your Fi is interesting in its nuances, and as our role function, Fi is an alien thing and something I find curious too. You're not too bad at Ti, as in, it's your role function, so you don't mix it with the other stuff. \n* You're pretty good at Fe, and we value it. You also don't expect it like it's necessary (like, say, INFJs) so no pressure. We can be ourselves. Your Te sucks, but we don't mind. \n* We share the rest, so we're similar. \n\n
2	We look at things from widely different angles but we still get each other. 
1	I like them but god they can be annoying if thet aren’t self-aware\n\nPros: Origional, very resistant to change (which protects them from bad people, however if the bad people get in then they have a hard time seeing it), creative, artistic (which we sorely need in our lives)\n\nCons: If they lack self-awareness, and for some unholy reason try to be logical, they can be the most obnoxious hypocrites.  But they ARE willing to reflect on themselves they can at least appreciate logical thinking even if they can’t do it themselves for very long.  But their feelings can align with logic if they are committed to virtue so they get to the same conclusions by feeling that thinkers do by thinking.\n\nFinal verdict: Mature INFPs are great (not old I mean emotionally mature).  We’re both prone to lofty intellectualism and inaction.  
1	Mostly, we think you are missing a T. 
1	INFP's have a strong sense of what's "right" and "wrong", which is a trait I don't regard as positive, because it often blocks the path to rational thinking. \n\nThe INFP's I've met so far are very smart. Sadly, their obsession with being authentic and all the typical Fi shit is what impedes them to become more rational and objective.
1	My closest friend is INFP. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to find her exhausting though.\n\nWe really click when it comes to stories, world-building, character development, and creative stuff, as well as the occasional debate regarding shows and issues in the world; but as I’ve gotten to has more friends and become more interested in things outside of that scope, I get tired of constantly talking about our scenarios and characters. She doesn’t though, and when we talk it never ends, but I can only take so much of that.\n\nAlso I’ve come to notice she has some really bad traits like jealousy/possessiveness. She never liked my friends when I was younger, but she really doesn’t like them now (even though she hasn’t met them). I feel like she’s trying to keep a claim on me. Not to mention that if she confronts me about something I do that she thinks isn’t good/doesn’t like, she’s too convinced that her own views on something (like how I act) are true despite my claims that they’re not. \n\nI dunno. Great to talk to for stuff like development and all that stuff, but tiring. There’s a sense of neediness and requirement of too much validation for me to be able to relax.
1	Just don't shut us out when we're trying to care for you.
3	Anyone else ever read "King, Warrior, Magician, Lover"?	
3	No but this just inspired me to go to the library today and read an actual fucking book instead of looking at this computer screen so much. 
2	I wanted a different take on MBTI/Archetypes and this book is fascinating. It takes a look at masculine archetypes and their roles as well as their shadows.\n\nThere were a LOT of "ooooofffffff" moments reading through the Wizard and King sections and the shadow functions there. I've definitely been there as the "trickster" and "innocent" shadow of the magician. \n\nAnyway, I got a copy at the library and am now considering buying it just because it's jammed with interesting takes on what we could be aspiring to.
1	Haven't, but because of the youtube videos about the archetypes i came here to see comments about it. Seemed really interesting, and considering to buy it as well.
3	I felt like today's journal entry belonged here	Overthinking makes me miserable. Of course it's simultaneously a source of great insight, but I add an unspeakable amount of self-inflicted complexity to life. My inability to rest psychologically under imperfect conditions is what it comes down to.\n\nMaybe diving off into the infinite space of imagination through philosophy has some influence on my restlessness. But that just simply is what resonates deeply with my Being. I love the abstract and the potential. Well, how about if I abstractly just chill the hell out for a sec and acknowledge that life just is what it is in its current state?
2	Problem one. After making this realization, you put the down pen and picked up the keyboard to post this. Follow your own advice to explore if you're onto something or not. 
2	Learn to turn on apathy for a while. I find that turning off the "serious" overthinking that gives you anxiety and instead overthinking some pointless pleasant things like video game systems really helps. \n\nI think thinking about things a lot really helps sometimes but at some point you hit a brick wall of what conclusions you can arrive at in your own head and it becomes unproductive. At that point you need some outside input to get new ideas. 
3	Lack of Drive & Focus At Work: Any Tips?	Hello, all.  \nI've worked as a marketing manager at a local motorcycle dealership for almost six years now. The perks of the job is that what I do on a day-to-day basis is essentially up to me, and I get paid to exercise my creative gifts.\n\n  \nThe cons are that the job itself often doesn't play to my strengths. The field of marketing requires a great deal of social intuition, so I usually feel like I'm taking a shot in the dark with my endeavors. I've learned to rely heavily on my more extroverted co-workers for ideas (particularly my ESFJ and ENFJ colleagues), and have seen a fair amount of success in doing so.\n\n\nBut some days, the sense of futility gets the best of me, and the idea that nothing I do will really matter anyway seems to take over my mind. When that happens, I spend my day doing mindless busywork at best, and goofing off at worst.\n\n\nAnybody else deal with a crushing sense of futility at work? What are some ways that you counteract it?
2	Yes.\n\nAnd... I don't.\n\nSorry :(
2	Do small stuffs successfully.\n\nAfter a while when it becomes normal, do more small+1\n\nWhen you are used to the scale of small+1, do small+3\n\nRepeat.
1	Changing job. Or at least, being payed enough to make that futility worth it 
58	anyone?	
32	Can you make this more blurry please? I can almost make out half of it.
29	I would hope you're a virgin in elementary school.  
10	I know the quality is fucking shit but meme thievery has its drawbacks
7	oh gosh that fit elementary school me perfectly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy family used to think I was an extrovert and I liked socializing(super young me), now I hardly ever socialize and don't need to talk to people at all. lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I say it fits me perfectly, I mean **perfectly**, I loved to cook(sorta just throwing things together, but it tasted gud) and obviously still a virgin xd, along with everything else on the list.
5	This is true for me. All of it. Is this a personal attack? 
4	* No dreams.\n* I don't fake emotions.\n* Yes.\n* Kinda. Unwarranted authority really \n* I look down down on elitists, even when they know more thing than me.\n* I don't keep count but probably.\n* Hm, is laughing an emotion ? It's linked to joy, and there's a definitive social factor too., but it seems different to me than fear/anger/sadness, etc\n* Stolen from that INTP bf image \n* Unreadable\n* Lazy, yup.\n* Lol, no. My diet consists of pasta and rice, and I alternate.\n* Close.\n* I was in my own little category, I guess.\n* Yes, and I dislike acronyms for that. Too many of them.\n* I was pretty active as a kid, but what I did was more exploring ? Like going into the forest, sometimes alone. Also, extraverted in typology =/= social.\n* I still don't study, but now, I have average grades.\n
3	Fuck. This hit deep. Every single one of those things is basically who I am. Its fucking devastating. 
3	“Warhammer 40k”
3	i don't think many intp's would be naturally good at cooking
3	Yes, that's me to the core
2	I'm gonna need more resolution, here. I actually cant read some of those.
2	You forgot, uploads shitty image quality memes.
1	Fits me but high school 
1	For anyone wondering, the third row, first block says "has mastered several disciplines, but doesn't believe in their self".  \n\n\nPersonally, I don't know that I've "mastered" anything aside from being lazy, but otherwise yeah, I need you to get out of my head.

3	Funniest?
12	We are the internet casual definition of Autistic.	I heard another INTP call herself the "4chan personality" which fits.
10	Stop. That is such a stupid statement and enforces stupid stereotypes.

4	we're autastic
1	Sometimes my best friend calls me a little bit autistic. Don't know how to response to that, I just acknowledge it, because why should I care? I feel fine and everythin else is unimportand.

19	Does anyone hate spending money?	any time I earn money I feel a overwhelming urge to never spend it. and when I do spend it was after hours of consideration and looking for cheaper alternatives. I especially hate when people gift me money to buy something, I have no idea why.\n\nAnyone else like this?
12	Bipolar Intp here, what money? 
11	I don't like to waste money on consumerist bullshit but will spend money on things that make me happy... e.g. books, dinners out, a trip abroad
5	I feel much the same way. Many INTPs struggle with an impending sense of doom and saving money would be a way of coping with that.  Additionally, we also tend to like having options, and keeping money = keeping options open.
3	Absolutely.  I hate spending money, always trying to be efficient or not spend at all.  Then there are times I went the other extreme, trying to use money to buy my way out of feeling sad or unfulfilled (seeing some of my friends do it).  It’s always left me regretful when I’m normal again, but with a lighter wallet and another thing to take care of.   I feel everyone has been tricked by consumerism during Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and other holidays, but you often have to play along.  \n\nAll this has led me down the path of minimalism.  Selling my house, most of my things, and moving away from America for a while.  It’s gonna be great living with the bare minimum without pressure to buy buy buy.
1	I think everyone on Earth hates spending money. It's getting stuff that's the good part.
1	Skipped college and choose the path of saving a ton of money. Very shortly I'll have to move out of my house so having a decent savings just gives me a peace of mind. I live pretty frugal.
1	I am frugal in my own head but I am so forgetful that I often buy things I already bought that I have lost. I get all my clothes at thrift stores, shop around for the cheapest groceries etc , to save money but it’s also a little bit fun to find a great deal.\nI am however, not good at saving money. I pretty much break even with each paycheck. I’m also in college and working a low paying job so that’s a factor too. \nBut yes the idea of spending money hurts me very much lol 
1	I'm okay spending your money.
1	I hate spending money but don't mind the cost if it's something I want. I actively try to avoid paying for transit fares
1	I dont buy anything frugal like fashion, but i spend a lot of money on making my life super comfy by buying nice food and renting a cool apartment. Also being an introvert means i dont spend much money in bars and clubs unlike many of my peers.

4	INTP with schizophrenia	  \n\nHi I am an INTP diagnosed with schizophrenia asking for advice. \n\nI m currently on medication of olanzapine and aripiprazole. Schizophrenia for me is caused by a major life stressor. I started to show symptoms, mainly delusions, of schizophrenia 2 years ago. My schizophrenia sort of stabilized around half year ago. \n\nOriginally I have a wide range of interest on things such as philosophy, psychology, astronomy and other hard sciences(Holland codes IAC(just same as the Ti Ne Si stack LOL)). I read books such as consolations of philosophy and watch documentaries such as 7up. I was a great abstract thinker and mentally quick sort of guy. I was on the stage which I have my Ti fully developed and developing my Ne. \n\nAfter I caught the disease, I seem to lose all my understanding power(Ti). I cannot read a book for a long time(low concentration). I have also seemed to lost the intense curiosity on everything. I don't know if the drug is playing a role here. I usually got a lot of ideas every day before such as making connections etc. Now my mind is sort of empty. It’s like originally you have a trump card on approaching everything (The Ti Ne combination). Now you’ve lost the trump card. It’s kinda really sad for me. \n\nHow am I suppose to do to regain my intp superpowers? How can I regain the love of learning I originally have?\n\nHere’s my hypothesis for the situation. \n\nDelusions of schizophrenia could be caused by overusing Ne with cognitive bias. Extraverted intuition is about seeing possibilities and making hidden connections. I seem to overthink a lot when I was sick. \n\nAnother hypothesis is that my drugs are suppressing all my cognitive functions. I m not sure about this. Since one drug I have is olanzapine which inhibits dopamine receptors. Since dopamine is responsible for reward-motivated behaviour. My love of learning and curiosity is lost because of this drug. \n\nI’ve found another video about schizophrenia.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEnklxGAmak\n\nWhat shall I do with My life now? Thank you in advance. :-)
6	Schizophrenia comes from an overactivity of the brain. Medicines to treat Schizophrnia are depressants which slows your brain down. A lot of yout curiosity likely came from your brains activness, now it's being slowed down so you've become less curious and wanting to learn. Not advice but a possible reason for why it is happening.
2	i don't really have too much of an advice but i'm also an intp female currently i'm also on olanzapine n other stuff as well (antidepressants mainly). my mental health has always interfered w/ my academic life and hobbies. but i'm better now (somewhat). however i don't think olanzapine interferes with my mental abilities. i used to take a lot of clonazepam n alprazolam which kinda fucked me up real bad..i'm still facing the consequences for that. i still struggle w/ mental problems but i'm thinking of quitting my meds soon. but i guess it's different for u. there might be other factors slowing down ur cognitive abilities. but again, i'm just stating a possibility..\n\nhope u get better soon. u can text me if u need to talk. i'm no therapist but i'll listen :)
2	Yeah, antipsychotics make you dumb as fuck. If I were you, I'd try to slowly ween myself off olanzapine and see how it affects the cognitive ability. You may find halfway through it that you've reached a dosage that allows you to function properly while keeping the delusions away. I don't know if it's the same way there, but in here doctors tend to prescribe way too high dosages that basically zombify you.
2	I have been treated for depression for a long time, and when my psychiatrist switched me to Duloxetine (a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, everything went to hell. I told him that I needed to get off, and he said that I had to taper over 4 weeks or really bad stuff would happen. It was hard to imagine anything worse, so I looked up the withdrawal effects and they terrified me. \n\nI decided that before taking any mental health medications, I was going to research the withdrawal effects.  My thought was that if withdrawing did horrible things to me, it could not help while I took it.\n\nMy psychiatrist later suggested an atypical antipsychotic to help me sleep. When I discovered the withdrawal effects, I said I will just stay awake.\n\nI don't know what treatment options exist for schizophrenia, but it sounds like the meds are just dulling your existence. If it were me, I would stop the drugs. Perhaps try others since there are many, but with caution. Frankly, the idea of a dopamine receptor inhibitor sounds like a drastically horrible idea. \n\nIf I might, you say that you "caught the disease" and were "sick." I used to see a wonderful psychiatrist in his 70's. I told him that my suicidal ideation was a terminal mental illness, and that when I killed myself, it would be the disease, not me. I said that no one blames people with lung cancer for dying.  He laughed and said, "You don't have an illness. You have a disorder." That really hit me. I was making my disorder into something that it wasn't. \n\nYou may have schizophrenia, but that does not mean that you are sick, and it certainly does not mean that you are broken. If your treatment is not making your life more rewarding, then maybe you should try a different treatment.\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your situation. You sound unhappy and distressed. I hope that you can find a less intrusive alternative.  Best wishes.
2	Fellow schizophrenic here. The meds suck but at least you can get a good nights sleep with em. I started picking up weight when I started the meds so feeling like a zombie isn't the only down side.
1	you should try zen buddhism
1	Ok ! Only one effective tip for you.\n\n\n\nFind a professional "therapist" work with him/her for next 6 months. 
1	1. stop eating bread and all grain products. I believe illness always has a physical component independent of your emotional/perceptual experience and affecting your emotional/perceptual experience. I know eating apples gives me insomnia and irritability but is not the only part of the problem. replace with animal meat and fat.  \n2.  try do develop your lesser cognitive functions. i've head about people with dissociative identity disorder having diabetes when one of the personalities controls the body and don't have when another does.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0kLjsY4JlU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0kLjsY4JlU)   \nif any lifestyle change affects positively the schizophrenia start slowly cutting out the meds  \n\n\nbest wishes  \n
0	Like every other normal person now. If you want to learn you just have to to put in more effort. \n\nOr find more drugs
66	I'm a temporary Best Friend	I dont know if this is an INTP thing. But I tend to drift through friendships. It seems that every year i get a new set of friends and they seem to really enjoy my company. I help them through tough spots in life and they tell me something along the lines of "You're the actual best, were gonna be friends till we are dead." Theyll make plans for the future and I'll get excited thinking I found my group. \n\nBut then like always theyll disappear, or I will. I'm not sure who does. I feel like I try but probably not hard enough. I always end up trying to find more people to hang out with. And I do, but its depressing knowing that theres a time limit till I'm not interesting anymore I guess. \n\nI'm posting this bc this time I found a group I actually like alot more than usual. I'm hoping things go different this time but if the problem is me idk what to change. They tell me the same sh*t about the effect I had on their lives but I know those are just words now. Anyone else have this problem bc tbh I feel like I'm gonna be alone on this one. I feel like a Drifter or A Temporary Best Friend for anyone who really needs one. 
25	Same. So much same it’s not even funny.
17	Welcome to adulthood past highschool/college. Turns out, making friends is hard as fuck when they aren’t literally sitting next to you every day. \n\nNow, try doing that as an expat where people come and go from your life like every year and that was my past decade+\n\nAnyway yeah it’s tough but maybe make an effort to reach back out if you need to. A lot of the time people just get wrapped up. And not only that but it wouldn’t surprise me if we INTPs tend to make friends with other high Ne/Fe types who are pretty flighty. 
10	You're not alone on this one I'm afraid, I've also drifted from one friend group to another throughout my entire life. I don't really know why, it may be that because we(INTP's) are able to be so apathetic to the point that we are able to easily detach from the people around us. And that detachment can make us feel lonely, even when in the presence of those we love. \n\nAlthough I do have a theory that we move from one friend group to another as a sort of necessity, and by doing this we constantly meet new people and gain a new perspective on life. Adding that perspective to all the others we've aquired within our mind, broadening our mindset to new possibilities, thus making us the unique creatures that we are.
8	Huh, completely relatable. Idk if this helps but someone told me I was too socially self reliant. I assume this is a semi-valid statement for INTPs (if not lmk). Which made me think more about the mechanism of friendship or relationships in general. Which then led me to think about how much reciprocation is important in a relationship. I mean it's hard to hang around someone that appears to not need anything from you while they're being such a good person unless you're an natural born leech. 
5	I'm skeptical about your story. Just what are these things you call "friends"? 
5	This is extremely accurate. I have had at least 6 different friend groups in the last \~8 years and I've always managed to ditch them or be ditched by them.\n\nExcept, it's more often caused by heavy bridge burning on my part than simply drifting apart. I don't play any "nice" and "friendly" pretend personalities around people that I'm willing to spend time with. And I'm quick to end relations with individuals that I no longer tolerate.\n\nI also find myself consistently regretting the decision to end relations and relationships afterward. Every single time. And message them when I'm lonely a few weeks/months later, just to be ignored.\n\nAnd the few times I managed to get a response and restart an ended friendship—I regretted restarting it soon after. In fact, I'm in the middle of restarting a friendship right now, which I lost three years ago. And I'm sure I will regret this one too when I realize that it will never be the same and I will never be as meaningful to them as I used to be.\n\nSo I never really make a mistake when I end relations, in my opinion. But it always feels like I've made a mistake because I become lonely and depressed until I find someone else who I can ditch a year later. Why do I never learn?
3	Everything is temporary, change is inevitable. What seems to be eternal today might as well be gone tomorrow. That's just the way it is, so you kind of have to accept it. \n\nI used to be really worried about people coming in and out of my life, and thought I was the problem. But the problem was never there in the first place. \n\nFriendships are tough because sooner or later you will find something that doesn't seem right. And you will start thinking about it over and over until something happens. INTP Experience had a nice chapter about it.\n\nFrom my personal experience, people tend to fall for my ability to solve their problems. Once that is done, they will disappear until they need me again. They aren't friends with me because they like me, they are friends with me because I am useful. \n\nBut that doesn't mean that everyone is like that. I've only found 2 people in my life who wanted to spend time with me because of who I was, not because of what I did for them. It takes time and effort to build meaningful relationships, but luck also plays a role here. \n\nI would say, enjoy your time with your current friends and cherish them. Be content with the present moment. Maybe they will stay in your life, maybe they won't. Relax and see what happens.
2	Yuuup which is yet another reason I have abandonment issues. 
2	I had a couple friends.  They were my best friends, being that there were only 2.  But I wasnt their best friend, because we didnt see each other often and they had lots of other friends they liked better.\n\nBut they've evaporated away.  I just started college, and supposedly it's normal to lose friends when starting college.  But the thing is, me going to college has nothing to do with it.  \n\n"Everyone I know, goes away, in the end"
2	Infp here, somehow ended up in this sub. I have similar issues with keeping friends.\n\nI'm very reserved and though a "good friend" I've been told I don't share much of myself and it makes them feel like we're not that good friends after all.\n\nAnother thing is, I've had to really put a lot of effort in keeping few important friends around. As someone said it's part of adulthood friendships, they no longer go without effort. You need to actually keep in touch a lot even though it might feel you don't have super much to talk about because you have different careers and as on, and remember what important is coming up in their lives. That is if you want to keep the friend and you haven't grown too much apart. Accidentally drifting off people's lives can happen when you don't check in enough.
1	Yes, same! I've been drifting too much it makes me feel sometimes
1	DUDE.. did you literally read this off my mind?!!
1	Like how? How do you find a group of friends? I can't even get to that stage man. 
1	I mean I helped a depressed and retarded kid out after he apparently attempted suicide. 
1	[deleted]
1	Something something self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe key here is to not have high expectations. You know what? It's great that you think it will be temporary. Then, if it lasts longer, it will have surpassed your expectations. Then who's to say it won't last longer and longer? As long as you put in minimal but consistent effort, it will.\n\nYou've got this. 
1	Friendship, like any form of relationships, eventually end. What matters is the effort you've put in it and if you really cherished the people you have associated with as "friends". Just don't be that friend who just decides to cut communications for no apparent reason. As much as we want to seek truth, we also owe others the truth. If it's a normal falling-out thing, be completely honest. It's normal. Also, don't burn bridges.
1	This has been my life's rumination for the past few months--namely, are all friend groups destined to be temporary? While I can never answer that question for certain, reflecting upon my past friend groups that either fizzled out, or ended more abruptly, has lent me the following insights:\n\n1. Some of these friend groups weren't such a terrible loss. Many of the people I'd considered my "besties" were, in fact, sensing types who liked me for my observations, my sense of humor, and my generally childlike demeanor, but just couldn't manage that deeper connection that I sought. They weren't bad people by any means, but so many of my insights, and even vulnerabilities, were met with a good-natured, yet patronizing, "Gosh, you're so smart!" and nothing more. These friendships were fun and lighthearted, yet fundamentally lacking in any sort of depth. Looking back, I'm hardly surprised that they ended up fading away.\n2. Some friend groups I left on my own accord, namely because of a shift in values. These friends, an ENFP and an ISTJ whom I talked to everyday, ended up making these destructive life choices that I couldn't stand by and support (I could never get behind the whole concept of "being there unconditionally"), so I simply peaced out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have high hopes for the current friend group that I've been lucky enough to stumble upon. My friendship with these two women, an INFJ and an INFP, seems healthier so far than any of my past friendships. I attribute a large part of it to a higher self-awareness than I've had in the past (thanks to MBTI), and the realization that I'm not "broken" or "messed up," just a normal INTP. I've managed to introduce these friends to MBTI, and they were sucked right in. Because of that, I'm able to communicate to them about some of my more difficult INTP traits, and vice versa.\n\nHope you can find some peace in your search for your "tribe."
1	Yeah I have this same issue. My closest friends aren’t those I see and hang out with often, but those that understand that my distance isn’t personal. One of the hardest things to stay conscious of for me is talking to people about how they make me feel so we can come to a solution together to either solve a problem, or just to let them know they make me happy. It’s just not something that comes naturally to me because I’m usually in my own head trying to figure it out how to deal by myself. But with relationships it’s not a one way street and shouldn’t be treated as such. Even with hard stuff. \nThat being said sometimes (a lot of the time for us) relationships grow in different directions, and that’s ok too.
1	I have a core of about 2 people who stay there and then 3 levels from that that all my friends keep shifting between, i rarely lose friends but I sometimes push friends out of the 2nd level out
1	It's generally always me who disappears. I've never really been good at the whole keep in touch thing. I've been lucky in that every friend that's meant something special to me has always allowed in me to drift in and out without any ceremony or negative reaction.\n\nIt's always just been as if I'd just came back the next day.\n\n

1	Hmm. What is discord?

57	Guy asked me to prom in front of class. Said no. Don’t feel bad.	A guy who has been crushing on me for a while asked me to prom today by singing my favorite song, giving me flowers, and making a big deal out of it. My teacher was even in on it. I’m extremely introverted and hate making a big deal out of things (I spent my 18th birthday at Taco Bell alone and running errands). When he was finished I simply said I’m sorry but no. I feel like most girls would feel bad and stress over it but I don’t even remotely feel bad. My apathy is strong today.
38	Good for you. 
28	It is really nasty to ask in front of many people. I’m glad you don’t feel bad. 
14	I feel jealous for INTP females. Humans actually crush on you. 
22	You do understand that MBTI helps us understand ourselves as opposed to justify our actions?? This sub is full of people who feel the need to show how much of a textbook INTP they are with this kind of post.\nMind you, if you don't like the guy and decided that breaking his heart in the most definitive way you could was a good idea, great for you, but posting about it here using "apathy" as a justification for you actions is just annoying for INTPs that aren't obsessed with their own sense of superiority over others. Post this kind of thing in a sub for this kind of topic.\nAlso, search for the website INTPexperience. It was written by an older INTP about his experiences in life and is usually very relatable. Maybe that will help you grow a bit.
4	I remember around prom season my teacher told anyone who wanted to ask someone to a dance in the middle of class that they would be turned away. I think someone showed up at class without telling him and was turned away, my teacher didn’t want anyone to feel pressured into saying yes through a public proposal. I’m sure your teacher could benefit from using the same policy. 
5	No need to feel bad if you're straightforward\n\nJust don't stretch stuff out and be an asshole
5	There is no reason to feel bad about it. Why pretend as if you like someone you don't?\n\nYou should have probably been more clear about the fact that you're not interested before he went that far though. People don't usually ask someone to prom if they expect the answer to be no, seems like you may have led him on a bit.
4	I love this, good on you! \n\nWhen I was in HS I was planning on breaking up with my boyfriend, so I asked my friends for advice. They freaked out and told me he was going to ask me to prom that day. I was so anxious about it I had my mom pick me up from school just to avoid him lol! He ended up coming to my house to ask me so I pretended to be asleep. It was a Friday so I didn't want to break up with him over text so I said yes...Monday came and I broke up with him and he was so pissed lol! \n\nSo yeah, you did the right thing by avoiding a situation like mine!
4	Wierd flex but ok
2	LMAO, it must have been glorious. I wish I was here to see it.\n\n"I'm sorry but no" in a clear but neutral tone *Walks away* leaving the room dead silent.\n\nHaha, raining on his parade effortlessly, not even trying. Just imagine the mood afterward, going from all Fe excited to nothing. \n\n***\nAnyway, good for you OP, there's nothing to feel guilty about, **he did that to himself by being overconfident.** I dunno why he did it in public (let me guess, he's an xxFJ?), maybe he thought everybody would clap afterward and didn't consider failure. Or he thought it would help ? In either case, guilt should never be a reason for dating someone, and there's no reason to feel it when you literally did nothing wrong in the first place.\n\nIf anything, you should cherish those kind of memories, since it's a pretty funny anecdote. \n\nNot everyone can appreciate it for it's true humoristic value, though. Not daring to laugh or whatever, but some of us do.\n\nIf you don't mind, what happened afterward ? Anyone called you a bitch or something ? Did he take it well or did he crumble ? \n
2	People try to manipulate others into that kind of stuff by publicly displaying it. That way, you can’t say no or you’ll look mean. Stay strong, emotionless robot!
2	So strong that you are telling us about it. I tell people when I don't feel bad about things all the time. Always comes in conversations: "What are you not feeling bad about?"\n\nI sounds like maybe you do feel bad. Maybe you are feeling bad because you were so embarrassed, but it is hard to see why you would not be complaining.\n\nIt seems more likely that part of you wishes you had said yes, but you couldn't. If that happened to me, I would tell everyone on reddit that I felt just fine about saying no.\n\nCan you try to see this from his perspective. He has a crush on you, but he probably is petrified to ask you to the prom. You are a mystery to him, and he has no idea how to approach it. So he finally decides to take an over the top approach hoping that you will either laugh and be amused, or maybe you will be impressed. The effort that your describe may be inept but it was earnest.\n\nAnd don't get mad at your teacher. She was just trying to help. We should all be so lucky to have someone care.\n\nMaybe if you relax and give yourself some space, you will realize that you are not feeling apathy at all. It is never too late to act.\n\nThen again, if it is apathy, what else is not bothering you?
2	I think you're completely justified.\n\nBecause of the circumstances. Not because you're an INTP. Never let the internet, of all things, tell you how to behave.\n
2	Congrats! I’m sure he didn’t mean to be manipulative or cruel but public proposals suck and can make you feel like you have to say yes or else look like an asshole. Good on you for being honest. 
1	weird flex but ok
1	Yeah, I can't imagine this shit happening. What did the bystanders think? I hope he wasn't in the same class/period as you when he did that, because that would've been awkward as fuck...
1	Baby, I wanna get you a taco 12 pack
1	I love watching/ read us argue. It's so entertaining with all the different perspectives and rationales. 
1	I mean, you *should* feel bad, it sucks that somebody tried so hard and got rejected in front of everybody\n\nThat doesn’t mean you should feel guilty, or irrationally sad for him, you shouldn’t hurt yourself because you don’t want to go out with someone. \n\nIt’s just logical to apply your feelings that way, but I understand if you don’t actually... uh, feel it. 
-1	I mean, I'm an INTP too, but I'm also not a sociopath. So, I can at least empathize with the way that he must be feeling after that, and it is a little disappointing that it had to be that way. He seems like an honestly good person to care about you so much, and to try so hard for you, but to still get a no (a cold, unfeeling one, at that), it must really suck. Especially if it was in front of everyone. That must be so embarrassing for him.\n\nI don't know how I would have handled it. I probably would have said yes, just because of the effort put into it, and then I would possibly regret it later. It's probably easier to deal with later though, rather than in front of everyone. Although, I'm also a guy, so maybe that changes things. I don't know.\n\nI don't think you should say yes just to say yes, and if you really don't like him, then sure, it's better to crush his heart than to let him continue to crush on you. At least now, he'll get the hint that you only let him walk you to your car because you couldn't tell him to go away. I just think it's a bit sad is all.
-1	Fuck him. You’re not there to make friends you’re there because you have to get that piece of shit paper that somehow signifies that you’re competent enough to be a productive member of society when most of the fucks who get a diploma are dumb as fuck. Prom is the most unimportant thing in the world. You’re still gonna shit out your food the same way humans always have. Honestly, the only thing that is important is survival. 
-1	I mean you could have said yes and then spoken to him later about it.....you know....and spared him complete and utter humiliation....
0	Honestly fuck people that do those things in public, it makes it harder to refuse and puts a load of pressure, I know people biologically need validation but schools are full of people tryharding to gain a lot of attention 
0	You should've said yes, because one day he'll be on television and be like "yeah, look at me now, olivia\_2000"
0	hahahaha 
0	If anyone did that shit to me, especially proposed in front of a crowd, I'd say no. Don't feel bad
-1	Who is that teacher and do you have evals at the end of the year?
-3	He's that ugly?
2	Is the Main Character from Pink Floyd's The Wall INTP?	I was driving to work this morning listening to my favorites play list on Google Play. "One of my turns" came on. During the first verse it occurred to me that maybe he was an INTP trying to cope with the loss of his father, an emotionally abusive mother and a wife that doesn't understand him.  The verse in question:\n\nDay after day, love turns grey\nLike the skin on a dying hyena\nAnd night after night, we pretend it's all right\nBut I have grown older and\nYou have grown colder and\nNothing is very much fun any more.\nI can feel one of my turns coming on.\nI, feel cold as a razor blade,\nTight as a tourniquet,\nDry as a funeral drum.\n\nThoughts?
2	He was just an archetype of people who grew up in Iron Curtain countries. The sort of depression that he had can happen to any MBTI type.
1	How is any of that related to INTP, the character from the wall is going thru cycles of psychosis and depression. I'm not really seeing the connection here.
1	never really liked the wall so dunno, but because of you I can't stop thinking about the line "which one's pink and which one's floyd"
9	INTP females: Do you have a peppy sounding girly voice or a more monotone one?	Or anything in-between.  I just can’t picture an INTP or INTJ female having a peppy, ultra-feminine, valley girl type of voice.  Maybe I’m wrong though?  I just see that voice matched with ESFJs, ESFPs, as well as xNFPs.  \n\nINTx females seem to speak slower and not in a high pitched exaggerated way.  Way more monotone (good female radio voice like on NPR).  \n\nWould be interested in hearing your perspectives.  Also link an audio clip of your voice if possible that I can enjoy for research purposes.  \n
20	I’d say my voice is low and on the monotonous side. I like deadpan, dark and/or sarcastic humor so that voice works well. When I’m in a really good mood or excited about some idea, I do tend to have a higher, faster voice though. 
12	does it count if your voice auto becomes more feminine when you're tryna get dick? my voice gets so blatantly girly when i'm flirting. it's embarrassing, but i'm pretty sure it happens with most girls
5	I have a soft voice and normally speak in a monotone. I do get high or snappy when irritated or excited. 
3	Mine is soft and monotone.  I can't ever tell if people can't hear me, or if I'm just dreadful to listen to 😂
2	I would say (from having to hear myself in videos) that the pitch of my voice is fairly high. I tend to be more expressive when I speak if I am speaking about something that is tied with my emotions.
2	Uuh my voice is like that of a teenager male. Sometimes it gets high-pitched, sometimes it's quite low and does not even sound feminine. It can become ultra-pitched when I'm with, say, high Fe users and I'm using my Fe badly to try to fit in, I guess. I have little control over how my emotions express themselves, so they sometimes slip outwardly in very awkward ways, especially with the sound of my voice (that's low Fe and it's no fun). When I'm in normal/Ti mode though, I guess you could say it becomes monotonous, even sounding mildly annoyed/bored (even if I may not be).
2	Monotone. A bit raspy too.\n\nMy sensitive friend mentioned once that my monotone voice makes her think I'm not excited for anything. (So I in turn exaggerated my face and voice. She scowled. Lmao)\n\nIt also doesn't help that I got a resting bitch face. Kek.
1	My voice is pretty medium in pitch and soft, but when I'm doing a presentation or speaking with someone in authority, the pitch rises. It's kind of annoying and I really hate it, but I do it subconsciously, probably because it's kinda hard to hear me otherwise.
1	Low and monotone voice definitely, it makes it look like I don't care about the topic/person. I usually have to repeat myself because it is so low
1	Feelers - Sing-song tone when discussing something important\n\nThinkers - Measured, almost robotic tone when discussing something important
1	My voice is pretty monotonous, and low. It also sometimes cracks and i feel like a teenage boy.
1	The latter. 
1	When I'm using Ti my voice is monotone, when I'm using Ne it's super fast and excited (but still fairly low in pitch), and when I'm on the phone it goes up super high because I'm trying not to sound like a bitch.
1	Definitely monotone...just been putting up with it lately now that I am just going through recordings of interviews conducted by me. But not as good as a radio voice...would say mine is a teensy bit more on higher pitch. \n\nBut ive noticed when im around a girl gang... sometimes i talk like them 😂 not that girly but close enough like them.
1	I've worked in customer service for the past 10+ years. I employ a very fake peppy voice. When family members call, more likely than not, they don't recognize my voice unless I drop the act. I have gone entire phone calls without them noticing they were talking to me (it's faster that way).\n\nWith my natural speech, I find recordings of my voice to be atrociously high pitched and foreign. It sounds much deeper in my head.\n\nLeery of recording anything, even in the pursuit of knowledge. Maybe a script would help..?
1	My voice is low and kind of nasal. I speak slower. 
1	OP's request sounds fetishy.
1	I have a deep voice for a girl
1	I am from southern California and sound like it.
1	My voice is annoying af. It’s probably medium pitch and not particularly smooth or soft. With friends I’m loud, and with others I’m more controlled. And regarding speech style, I’m a fast talker with a tendency to ramble.
1	Both. At the same time. Don't ask, it confuses me too.\n\nI'm monotone, but I exaggerate my words for humor. But it just comes off as crazy.
1	The tone/sound of my voice tends to fluctuate or change depending on the situation. Usually at work or when I'm generally in the middle of explaining something, I do sound monotone and very serious. I enjoy light banter with close friends and during those times, I may talk with a valley girl accent sometimes. I think it's important to note that I'm not heavily an introvert (55% I and 45% E)
2	INTPs are so hot	That is all. \n\nlove, \n\nINFJ
12	Wtf
3	Does a black unicorn have a white horn or a black horn? Asking the important questions ya kno.
3	Its hot in my room and i can't sleep so... Yes?
2	My wife is INFJ.  I will have to let her know.
2	Volcano is also hot.
1	Thanks. I love you.
1	You're hot. Call me sometime baby
1	I love you too babe 😍. 
1	Yes
1	I think an INFJ would be the perfect kind of girl.\n\nI - introverted like you, knows how to shut up, doesn't need to go here, there, and everywhere everyday\n\nN - actually has a brain and can and will process abstract things\n\nF - has feelings and keeps the relationship from getting too robotic\n\nJ - is organized and responsible and things could get really bad if nobody is
1	This is why I need a fan at the gym. That and when it's cool outside the air doesn't come on, and there's no air circulation. 
6	Mtg colors of INTP?	For those of you here who play mtg (magic the gathering), which color combination do you think would most go along with INTP? And why? Does this match your favorite colors to play in game? 
2	I always played Blue Counter or Red Removal with varying colors as a secondary, usually some type of creature I could protect and buff while maintaining board control via spells. But I haven't played since Darksteel. (2004)
2	UR for sure. The stereotype of the mad inventor in pursuit of knowledge fits us well imo. Could also be grixis but black fits intj more because of the ambition and evil stuff. My favourite deck is storm btw.
2	Most people I think would probably say izzet.\n\nPersonally, I consider myself to be bant however. With actually very little chaos in my life and slow but steady growth.
2	Depends on the format. I used to play modern merfolk but time/money have pushed me into playing edh almost exclusively. \nSince edh is more social and political I’ve found my cozy place in golgari. I mostly keep to myself and do my own thing. Nothing to see here, please by all means kill my creatures ;)
2	I use blue black, i just find the joy in ruining people's plans, although my first deck was blue red green tap dance it had this amazing card called aetherspouts that I would ruin people's games with and since all my friends knew about it i often bluffed about having it in order to avoid an attack or encourage one I once won a game against an eldrazi deck that got out all 3 of the titans and attacked me, we were both on one health so the next turn i just chucked a burn spell at him, although i stopped after kaladesh (I wanna get back into it soon)
2	I'd say mono blue.
1	Personally I'd say grixis (blue black red) or dimir (blue black) because INTPs are very much introverted and spend a lot of time thinking (blue thirst for knowledge and power of the mind), but also tend to be very insensitive to other people's emotions and are seen as very weird and different at times (black taboos).\n\nAdditionally, many INTPs are unaffected by social norms and laws, and tend to be very passionate when in areas they feel strongly about, whether that be in actual discussion with friends or in their private thoughts and projects (red freedom, rebellion, and passion.) However, red is a very emotional color, and INTPs are not very good with identifying or showing emotions, whether that be their own emotions or other people's, so there is an argument to be made against red. However, I still believe red is there due to the rebellious nature and passion (behind closed doors) of INTPs.
295	12AM: Brain exploding with all the ways I’m gonna do amazing stuff with my life starting tomorrow.	6AM: Snoozing my alarm cause waking up and getting out of the warm covers isn’t worth it.
102	When your brain keeps you up all night with ideas for tomorrow, so you need to sleep late into the next day.
38	I'm interested in doing stuff. It's just an abstract interest.
19	12pm: Still snoozing the alarm. 
19	11PM: Tune the brain in to easy listening so it doesn’t explode by 12AM.  \n\n6AM: Stop the alarm and immediately raise my arms in triumph, because I’ve once again defeated the snooze button that made me feel like hammered shit every morning for decades. \n\nFrame your reality the way you want it to be, and you have a chance of manifesting it. Frame it the way it seems, and you’ve already buried yourself in pessimistic mediocrity. 
16	12AM: Asleep. 6AM: Time to get up to do amazing stuff! 12PM: I should do some amazing stuff soon.
7	Fuck. I was having this episode yesterday. But a negative one. \nI went for a run to tire myself out at 2 am. \nDidn't help. \nTook half a j to sleep. \nEnded up being awake rill 7am.
4	Hi. 5am here. Can confirm. Still havent gone to bed.
3	Sounds like a song
2	Hope you remember them tomorrow!  Good luck!
2	It's 4am and I am still awake. 
2	I'm gonna make kombucha & keffir water & eat all vegetables & roast my own cereal & drink dandelion tea & grow my own..\n\n... Two toasted sandwiches & a bowl of potato gems later...
2	It happens every day and it's more disappointing than the last
2	This happened last night, couldn’t sleep because I was too excited
2	The reality is often quite underwhelming compared to the vision
2	This has happened to me so often over such a long period of many years that my initial excitation has been reduced to a mild increase in heart rate.  I fear the day when my subconscious will cease to even generate these ideas due to knowing that I'll never accomplish them or that it will require too much work or social interaction.
2	I have ADHD, so this attacks me on a personal level.\n
2	Think about the plan; talk about the plan; never execute the plan. 
2	After waking up... maybe I'll just watch youtube today.
1	3:20 now. I'm looking at a list of things to do tomorrow. One of them requires me to be presentable before noon. Ngl, I should go ahead and cross off that one.
1	I feel like i get the best ideas right before i sleep,so i write them down and then pass out 
1	This is me exactly. I decided to just stop setting unrealistic goals altogether. Right now, the only thing I want to achieve in life is to graduate with a GPA of >3.5 and get into a grad school.
1	Dont believe your brain. Make it believe you 😄
1	Today is the only day to get things done

1	12pm: Playing those video games cause trying is haaaaaaarrrrrrrd.
1	Tried to circumvent the loop by not letting myself sleep. Turns out you just replace sleep with another waste of time.

1	OMG every fucking day this is me. 
21	I wonder if life is about tearing down our false perception of ourselves in order to adapt to realities.	I think we can never really truly know ourselves, nor can anyone else. A sense of permanent and purely authentic identity is impossible because how we view ourselves is never objective, and others can only perceive aspects of ourselves we are willing to show.  \n\nThroughout our lives, our mindset changes and our goal changes. Most young children have similar dreams, such as being an astronaut, scientist, athlete etc because their experiences at that point of their life are similar to one another under most circumstances. However, as people grow older, dreams and goals become much more nuisanced because their experience and circumstances begin to diverge. No longer will most people consider them suitable to be an astronaut, a scientist, an athlete etc because they gradually became more aware of themselves through the lenses of other, as well as their growing sense of a conflicted self. \n\nPeople tend to become disillusioned of their dreams and fantasies because reality will never be as ideal to them as they would like, so they conform, accept, and follow what others do in order to fit in and adapt to the reality they live in. In the end, the sense of self becomes an after thought because we tend to realize we are simply one of many.
5	Who gives a fuck. None of this matters. Manipulate as much people as you can in this world because fuck it. We get caught up in all this day to day bullshit that we forget about the fact that we’re all alone and we always will be lonely. That’s the curse of free will. 
4	Oh god, you reactivated an old thread in my head.
3	>I think we can never really truly know ourselves, nor can anyone else. A sense of permanent and purely authentic identity is impossible because how we view ourselves is never objective, and others can only perceive aspects of ourselves we are willing to show.\n\nI think you can know yourself without identifying with any ideal, thought, feeling or object. One who claims our self-image is never objective does not grasp the self that lies within, only the image it casts. Others perceive neither the self of you nor the image you are trying to project, because everything you are to others is made up of not only what you intend to be, but what you actually are.\n\n>Throughout our lives, our mindset changes and our goal changes.\n\nYet the canvas onto which the spectrum of your mindsets and goals are painted remains static from age to age.\n\n>People tend to become disillusioned of their dreams and fantasies because reality will never be as ideal to them as they would like, so they conform, accept, and follow what others do in order to fit in and adapt to the reality they live in. \n\nThe people you describe are trying to build their happiness on idealized abstractions. You can achieve the same happiness by simply experiencing everything that is and letting that be an ideal unto itself. Thus there is no need to fit in, adapt, or change: reality has become an utopia and you the perfect citizen.\n\n>In the end, the sense of self becomes an after thought because we tend to realize we are simply one of many.\n\nYes and no. Paradoxically, the more you connect with your 'self', the less you become 'one of many'. The more unique and universal you become. For you are both the numerous individual and the absolute one.
2	As an artist and INTP, I think that one of life's most noble pursuit is to get to know yourself. INTP or not, I don't think many people put too much work into it. I very much think it is possible, but it's not easy. I used to use ideals to create a sense of self ( and though I think human beings should be boxed in with such labels), I now look at myself more through my actions, and try to work backwards what the heck I was thinking. I realized that my conception of self relies on stories that keep looping in my head, that reiterate to me who I think I am. Once you have more control on that loop, I think you will find what you are looking for.
2	I would argue that we always truly know ourselves. We just change a lot. There is no fixed you, so it is no surprise that your choice of career will change. \n\nIt is true that people care too much about what others think of them, but that can be overcome. \n\nI don't think that most people are disillusioned. I do think that as people grow, they realize what really matters is more their actual life and less idealistic images of something else. People tend to "conform, accept, and follow" people with whom they have relationships.  There is no loss in that.  It is just part of having relationships.
47	Thoughts?	
14	I don’t feel this way about kids. But adults? Fuck that. 
9	This is absolutely true. I hate being responsible for the quality of other people's work. As a manager, I'm always happy to help someone out when they need it but I don't like when I have to basically babysit adults. 
6	This is why I am satisfied being a developer instead of climbing the corporate ladder and trying to become a manager. The constant need to monitor other people doing their job or finding out that someone is doing their job badly (less than my expected standard). I just can't handle it. I don't have mental equipment/tool to handle those kind of people.
5	So true.  Leading and being a boss really doesnt interest me.  One, I dont want to be responsible for other people.  Two, im just too lazy.  Three, I don't want to have to fire people and stuff like that; way too awkward, and dont have the social skills for it.\n\nBut, if im in a group with a completely incompetent leader, and I know I can do better, I would be willing to take the lead until someone actually competent can replace me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's crazy, at work I have co-workers --with no authority over me-- try to boss me (and others) around just because they have override codes.  They're that power-hungry!  I don't get it, I just really have no desire to boss people around.  If I need you to do something for me, I'll just ask.
4	Depends on the circumstance. My wife and I depend and rely on each other for damn near everything. The fact that I can rely on her and the knowledge that she feels safe relying on me is a lot of the fun. Only 31 years, but still . . . . 
3	This speaks to me
3	As a mother to 11, yes. We are down to 8 at home. My youngest started 1st grade this year and I have my days to myself. For the first time in years (if ever in my life???) I feel so human and much better able to cope with my emotional well being. I feel like a much more stable and 'present' mother than I ever have. Simply because I have my days to myself. \n\nI have taught all my kids to be pretty self sufficient and to rely on each other for basic physical needs. I hate chores, and we all pull an even load here. The ones that are old enough that have left home have had an easy transition into adulthood. There were no big surprises about how to take care of ones self. \n\nFor years, every summer I would have to schedule a day off every week. I literally had to leave the house with nothing scheduled to just go sit in the shade somewhere. All day. It was the only way to keep my sanity. \n\nI've thought about getting a part time job, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I don't want to deal with other people. I've been lost in my art and writing. \n\nAnd pets. I swear this theory translates to pets. And house plants on a certain level. I love gardening, but I think that is on a more scientific level - I have a fascination with seeds. House plants don't change much and just need watered. I kill them regularly. And pets? Oy. Not my cup of tea. Outside cat is the closest I've felt to having an affection for an animal. 
2	It's fine so long as they are able to think for themselves a bit. I have kids so I may just be used to the pressure. 
2	This is all well and good as long as you exclude the first sentence. Although the further information is spot on, responsibility causes less than 1% of my anxiety.
2	I pretty much echo the sentiments here about never wanting to be a manager at work.\n\nThis is also why I've always ended up in a friend trio, even though I believed for years that I wanted truly wanted that one special best friend, like what I saw on TV or read in the books. (That "Bosom Friend," as Anne Shirley would call it)\n\nBut now I know better; having to be EVERYTHING to one person is rather suffocating and draining in real life. That problem is circumvented in a friend trio, however--if I can't be there for one person, at least I know that they have other person. Problem solved.
2	This is one of the reasons why I don't really want kids.
1	Forgot to add the source: (Link) \n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/10/this-is-what-triggers-your-anxiety-based-on-your-myers-briggs-personality-type/\n\nI'm just curious about whether or not this hits home.\nI know that, for me, it is rather accurate. 
1	Having boundaries is not the same as anxiety.\n\nIt's one of those shitty article where they tried to find one weakness for each type, somewhat related to the tittle, isn't it ?
4	How was your relationship with your parents?	I blame my parents for my social awkwardness and low self esteem. My parents always fought with each other. My dad is a mother fucker narcissist, who found it funny to emotionally and physically torture me from a very young age. He always found pleasure in insulting me and systematically destroying my self esteem in front of others. That made me withdraw and I started finding comfort in my own company.  Now I am 45 and living in a different country for the last 20 years. But I still cannot get him out of my mind. Every day, multiple times, I find myself thinking about his treatment and it's consequences on my self esteem, my career, my relationships and every aspect of my life. But the worst part is that, underneath the surface I still crave for his approval. Today I got an email from him, with his concerns over me becoming an atheist and not following Islam anymore. I feel angry and I wonder why can't I simply cut him lose from my life and my thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologies for such a long rant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder what other INTP's feel about their relationships with their parents? Also, what was your parents relationship with each other?
2	I suffered through a lot of  social awkwardness and low self esteem, but I cannot blame my parents for it. My parents were married for 52 years when my father died, and I do not recall a harsh word between them. They were best friends. I have 3 brothers, and the 4 of us were the purpose of their lives. They were strict when I was young, but consistent and supportive. My brothers and I are all still close.\n\nDespite all that, I felt like an outsider through high school and have suffered from depression and suicidal ideation most of my life. I shut out the world because it always hurt me.  \n\nI have to say that in the last 2 years, my life has changed completely. I am no longer depressed, and I often am happy for the first time in my life. It may feel like the die is cast at age 45, but it truly is not. Everything can change.\n\nIt seems like you may be suffering from the same thing that I did. Despite all that support, my parents really did not know what to do with me. They supported me and worried about me, but it always felt like they thought I was broken. They said that I was smart, but I never felt like I was given validation for anything else. I have come to believe that we need nothing more than validation. You understandably still crave validation from your father, and if you do not get it, you will hurt. I now get the validation I wanted from my mother, and it feels like warm sunlight. \n\nYou may never get validation from your father, but you can get it elsewhere. As much as INTPs tend to try to reject relationships, they are the only source of meaningful validation.  Being validated for your smarts or your professional accomplishments will never fill that need. We need to be validate for who we are.  And that can only happen when you are connected with people and in relationships. \n\nI suspect that you would always have an emptiness if your father never validated you, but you can get what you need from other relationships. My wife is far and away my primary source of validation.\n\nBy the way, validation does not work as a one way street. We have to validate the others in our lives as well.  The good thing is that giving validation is almost as rewarding as receiving it.
2	I’m socially awkward as well, but it is all me.  My parents fought a lot, bitterly; I didn’t get along with my siblings, and I lived miles away from a small town so I spent summers with no friends. (Unless you count cows).   But it is still all my fault...not theirs.\n\nAt some point you have to take responsibility for your thoughts and actions and not blame others for your own failures.   There is an endless list of excuses in the world, but none of them help you move on or improve yourself.  Endlessly blaming others just brings more bitterness.\n\nForgive your parents and forgive yourself.  No one is perfect anyway.\n\nBut let’s look at the social awkwardness.   For me, it was actually a benefit.  I’m not good at talking to people because I don’t enjoy it.   I’d rather read or make something.   I practiced guitar a lot, got really good with computers, all sorts of stuff.  I developed skills I still use.\n\nBest thing that happened to me was I left my small farming town for college and found a lot more people like me.  People that didn’t want to talk about the weather and fashion, but things of mutual interest.   They were awkward like me and it was wonderful.\n\nThat led me to find an awkward girl, have awkward kids, and a very strange family.   And we interact with other strange families.\n\nLong winded way of saying “it can get better”.   Hang in there.
2	All in all, pretty cool. They both had hard upbringings and were shitty parents. Keeping them at a distance mentally and physically is great. Talk to them and see them occasionally : )
2	My mom is a domineering ISFJ, trying to control everything.  Always judging and screaming at us.  My dad was a sweetheart but a pushover and enabled my moms behavior. \n\nNow that I’m older, I realize my moms an anxious mess inside.  She lacks a lot of relational and social skills to create healthy relationships.  Now that my dad has passed, she has no buffer for her behavior.  We don’t really tolerate her behavior anymore and she thinks everyone hates her.   But I find that she can’t empathize with us and treat us like normal human beings without trying to control or judge us, even though she tries.  It makes me sad to think this is what it has come down to.  She wants to be loved, but she doesn’t know how to behave in a way that lets her be loved.  We want to love her, but she always finds ways to poke at our nerves and push us away.  She doesn’t have much control of things anymore, but she can’t just let it go and relax.  \n\nSome of my more negative traits were definitely fostered by my mom.  I don’t blame her or hate her for it.  It is what it is, she had her own shit to deal with.  She did raise me, kept me fed, didn’t do rapey things or anything like that.    \n\nYour dad doesn’t sound too different from my mom.  It seems quite unhealthy to keep thinking about him like that on a daily basis.  It’s possible you are using him as an excuse for your own perceived “failures”.  I wonder if you will have these thoughts if you feel you had a more fulfilliled life, or at least if you are happier with yourself?\n\nMy suggestion is to acknowledge the past, but take FULL RESPONSIBILITY of your own life and future. Your love life sucks?  Work on becoming more attractive and better at dating.  Career feels stagnant?  Go start the business that you’ve always wanted to.  Once you start to seeing improvements, it will hopefully start building a confident self inside of you.  Only you can do this, and blame others only hurts yourself.\n\nWe can only try to learn from our past, but have the power to keep shaping our future.  Maybe once you are happy with yourself, you can extend that contentment to your father as well.
1	My relationship with my parents as a little one was quite good... I feared them but I knew they loved me.. Who knows what imprint it left on me.\n\nOne thing I felt I could add to the discussion is that, I believe we can't change our inner children, in my opinion and experience. They are the germ of what we grow to be. We cannot escape reaping what we sew either.\n\nI have a poor relationship with my father, and still want his approval. If I were to guess the reason, it is because my inner child cannot escape what it sewed. You know psychic imprinting on the one who can care for a child and the importance that person takes on as a role model must be reckoned with.\n\nI think the only solution is self-work. I, as an INTP relate!
1	Thank you very much to all for taking time to share your thoughts. It feels great to get advice from prior with similar personally type people who actually understand what I am taking about.\nI've again, thanks
1	I would describe my parents as the bitch and the buffoon.\n\nMy mom was prone to outbursts of anger and would take things to the point of becoming a total basket case to get her way, literally making it easier to just let her have her way. Meanwhile, she's just oblivious to what kind of emotional, relational damage this kind of behavior does.\n\nMy dad is an INTP with a lot of P. He's not intentionally abusive, but he's just a doormat for my mom to drag around. Sometimes, though, he has no common sense and does stuff that is really stupid. That causes the mom to act like a crazy psycho lady. He also seems to do just about everything in the most annoying way possible now, and when working on things it's always, "wait! wait! wait!" A lot of times I don't know enough about what's being worked on to know if his concerns are valid or not. Sometimes he's trying to make sure the chair we're building is strong enough to hold an elephant, not just a person (metaphorically speaking). \n\nMy brothers and I tend to avoid them, and only do the minimum obligatory amount of being around them. They don't seem to understand that we don't want more chaos, more worry-based, over-concern about things, and generally nothing positive and enjoyable.

0	Banned from MBTITypeMe for saying the MBTI is garbage *because* it's standard and common thus will never be universal nor even general. Neither logic nor standing out are appreciated when they violate the political party line.

3	Wtf did jung mean by "possibility" for intuition?	>Just as extraverted sensation strivesto reach the highest pitch of actuality, because only thus can the appearanceof a complete life be created, so intuition tries to encompass the greatestpossibilities,since only through the awareness of possibilities is intuitionfullysatisfied.\n\nSimilarly what did he mean by actuality. Jung, being the shitty writer he is, is all over that never-provide-examples grind for ambiguous words.\n\nMy best example within my own life is sometimes when working towards an Fe valued Ti goal I will get a sense that if I follow a train of thought or analyze something it will provide the biggest Ti defined impact towards my goal. The problem being I don't know what Ne's goal at any given moment is...Jung specifically makes mention that thinking and feeling are repressed which leads to a more immoral character for Se and Ne dominants because their primary goal is not thinking and feeling opportunity, but rather Ne guidance towards possibility.\n\nI don't see how you could define possibility without the goal, so the goal must be the acquisition of more Ne data. What is Ne data though?\n\nIs it like a feedback loop? Ne orients itself towards feeling more Ne? Like I feel this is self defeating.  Shouldn't the intuitive goal have something else comprised within it other than more intuitive feeling?\n\nI feel like Ne doms are seeking this feeling of "there is more behind this route" and that following that route has more Ne routes within it. But within all of this is an Fe defined goal of value(everything leading back into Fe, despite the process of moving towards the Fe goal being largely defined by the dominant and auxiliary function).
2	Your title is harder to decode than Jung's work.\n\n>since only through the awareness of possibilities is intuitionfullysatisfied.\n\nIs the closest quote I can find, which to me reads "intuition is only fully satisfied through the awareness of possibilities." (If you want a cleaner order)\n\nIt appears to me that he sees the goal of Ne-dominants is to strive to see and understand as much of the possibility space of a topic (reality, a game, a field of study, etc.) In an "it's not about the destination but the journey" kind of way.\n\nLook at it like this:\nSometimes you have a game, and that game asks you to *do* a thing. The Ti/Te thing to do is just to go do that thing as fast and effectively as possible. The Ne thing to do, however, is to poke around. See what neat tricks and gags are around this and that corner. Does it help anything? No. Is it fun to some people? Yeah.\n\nCertainly this comes down to the feelings: usually the reward center of the brain. Does that make it Fe? No. In fact it would be easier to say Fi, although you'd get quite a few protests for saying Fi users have a monopoly on dopamine, because they quite simply don't.\n\nBut what it seems to me is that these "goals" of each function-dominant type can be described as "how does this function/type seek dopamine?" Because ultimately people seek pleasure, in whatever form their brain guides them to.
2	No one here knows because none of us has bothered to read the source material--just a few shitty, two-bit websites and some CS Bobblehead videos.
1	> Jung, being how intuitive he is, is all over that never-provide-examples grind for ambiguous words.\n\nftfy. By the way, I would be really surprised if any introvert really could identify with any of his extroverted descriptions.

14	Does abuse make you more likely to score as an intp?	There are many side effects that people who had been abused share with those who identify themselves as having the intp mbti type.For example,my mother has given me little to no attention,and when she did it was just so she could conplain to me and call me names for whatever reason.My father was absent most of the time,but when he was there he always agreed with my mom.\nMaiby my overprotectiness and tending to misjudge other's intentions,plus other things could be linked to abuse,and make me more likely  to get intp as a result on a personality test?\nAlso apathy is for me a coping mechanism:I've learned to ignore my parents whenever they try to emotionally abuse me(apathy is known as one of the definitory traits of the intp).\nNow I won't get into too much detail about what has happend to me so far,so I'll rest my case.I'd love to hear the opinions of other fellow intps,and maiby their own personal take on this idea.
5	I was abused as a kid as well, but I don't have apathy. A few years ago I would probably have been an INFP, but certain circumstances have made me change how I react to different situations. I understand emotions because I grew up with them. (Mom is INFP) \nI think the personality traits are just different viewpoints/natural instinct on how to handle a situation. Apathy is definitely something seen in abuse victims, but I don't think it's necessarily a key factor of being an INTP. 
3	No. Also, this post will attract all the ones who were abused so it's an unreliable way to answer the question.
3	Abuse can definitely cause introversion. And introversion can result in more time in front of a computer/tv screen, which typically leads to "nerdy" personalities. I think that if there is a correlation between INTP and childhood abuse, then it is a minor one. But the correlation between abuse and Ixxx is probably quite significant.\n\nThe point is—I think it's more introvert specific than INTP specific.
2	you might be onto something. intp are rather withdrawn and somewhat internally conflicted, and for some people that might be the deciding factor.
2	 I'd say its quite possible to get mistyped as INTP due to childhood traumas. Maybe you would be more accurately classified as another type with symptoms of abuse? \n\n Can abuse teach your dominant functions to take a backseat? Seems possible. If thats the case by working through the trauma perhaps your functions can revert to normal?\n\n Might explain some of the negativity from some of the people here about being an INTP. I can see how someone who tests as an INTP because of coping mechanisms to trauma would be unhappy. \n\n Full disclosure, I'm just spit balling ideas and haven't read anything that can back this speculation up.\n\n I had a happy childhood.
2	My childhood Involved abuse too
2	It could be that we are more likely to analyze why we are the way that we are. We also may be more apt to look back on our childhoods realistically, not shying away from facing hard truths. Some people need to distort the past in order to continue idolizing their caregivers, unable to deal with the crushing reality of how they where treated. If there is one thing that INTP's cannot stand, it is taking the easy road through denying the truth.
2	Wouldn't such abuse lead you to become more of an INFP? How would our Ti be the result of abuse?
2	Sexual abuse as a child and seperated parents, now INTP hmm...
2	I literally just made a post asking this same damn thing. SHEEEEEEIT  \n\n\nI think the major trait of abuse/INTP is the dissociation. INTO MY MIND I WILL HIDE!
2	I think it does
1	Not sure about INTP. It will definitely rate one high as an asshole.
1	I've always wondered this too. I didn't have a very happy childhood too.
1	ayn speed dating	
1	I disagree with Ayn. Love is unconditional. Virtue begets respect, but not love.
1	This anecdotal evidence that Objectivism results in dating failure fills me with hope for the future evolution of our species. 
9	I think that "Live every day as if it were your last" is best represented by INTPs	The day before I die, I want to read a good novel, sleep for 12 hours, and eat some good junk food\n\nGuess we livin right
9	I have the complete opposite opinion. The INTP lifestyle tends to be a fairly stagnant one—not a lot of change or excitement in day to day life. What is the point of spending your last day the same way as you've spent the last 5 years of your life?\n\nIf it was the last day of my life, I would do an incredible amount of things that I've never done before. And many of them would be illegal.\n\nThe only way I can agree to this statement is that I definitely live every day as if I didn't have another 30+ years ahead of me. As if the rest of my life doesn't depend on what I did today, or more precisely, what I didn't do today. But that is a pretty different mindset from the way the phrase is meant to be interpreted.
2	Honestly, if I knew for certain that today was my last day, I'd go about my physical business in a fog as I obsessed over what could possibly happen next.  Any out of the ordinary physical activity would be completely wasted because I'd be stuck in my head.
1	The point is that you will need to accept the POSSIBILITY of your death.\n\nPOSSIBILITY, Carl
1	Well, we force ourselves less to do stuff than we don't want to do than others types... So I guess that's true
1	Tldr;\n\n"I'll do it tomorrow/nextime." mindset can be detrimental to your own progress and others. 
8	INTPs and Emotional Trauma?	How many of ya'll have emotional trauma?  \nAsking because when thinking of INTP traits I see trauma coping mechanisms.\n\nDissociation (spacing out, fantasizing)\n\nEmotional Detachment\n\nLittle emotional regulation (easily perturbed, inability to handle even moderate emotions)\n\nHiding emotions (being afraid to open up)  \n\n\nOnly thing that strongly doesn't sound like normal trauma is the pervasive self-aggrandizement.  \n\n\nSo give me the scoop, are yall emotionally disturbed?  \n\n\nI think I am and I know i'm INTP.  \n
4	Disturbed, no. Traumatized as a child, yes.\n\nI'm pretty convinced that a non-INTP would have come out the other side of that worse off than me. Took me a while, but that detachment from emotion and ability to be hopelessly logical/objective sure comes in handy when you're trying to psychoanalyze yourself out of some screwed up behaviors from a shitty childhood.
4	Everyone "regulates their emotions" the difference is wether it is an adaptive or maladaptive form of regulation. Even expecting others to regulate your emotions for you is a form of emotional regulation. It's just super co-dependant and underdeveloped.
4	I wasn't abused in the classic dramatic sense, but I was certainly emotionally neglected. I think that this fact could certainly cause someone to turn inward for stimulation. I was definitely a maladaptive daydreamer, unfortunately with age your days eventually go from being filled with ponies and adventure dancing through your head, to anxious rumination and fruitless attempts at finding answers to your life.
2	I don't consider myself "emotionally disturbed." That's just a crutch to excuse bad behavior.
2	Yeah, that one time long ago I did something really embarrassing, and at random times it keeps me awake at night remembering it.\n\nBut every INTP has that, so it doesn't count...
1	> Emotional Detachment  \n>  \n>Little emotional regulation (easily perturbed, inability to handle even moderate emotions)  \n>  \n>Hiding emotions (being afraid to open up)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'm a little off here, but aren't "Emotional Detachment" and "Hiding Emotions" both forms of "emotional regulation"? Granted, not healthy regulation, but regulation nonetheless. Again, I could be wrong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo answer the question: I don't know if it counts as emotional trauma, but I was the definition of "latchkey kid." I'd see each of my parents for maybe an hour a day from age eight on. 
1	It takes a certain environment where being hypo-emotional and hyper-rational is an effective survival strategy. For social animals that isn't a regular way to develop.\n\nI suffer from Childhood Emotional Neglect. For as long as I can remember I was just a side show to my parents toxic and dramatic relationship. That river in Egypt ran through our house. From the outside it looked like the perfect middle class family. Behind closed doors is was a cold war zone with lots of verbal and emotional abuse. \n\nI experienced no physical abuse, but it being made clear that you're a disappointment to your own dad leaves a lot of invisible scratches. Mom didn't have time to tend to my emotional needs. She was busy surviving my dad and doggedly not willing to chose her own happiness above the marriage.
1	I cannot say that I experienced any emotional trauma as a kid. There was a bit of arguing in my house as a kid because my mother was an alcoholic when I was young, but I never held it against her because she was trying to change and eventually did. That is the only thing that may be seen as trauma but I largely forget about it and moved on the next day 
1	I was not emotionally repressed by my family as a kid. I had very loving parents who have always tried their best to accept who I become and my extended family was always pretty supportive. My big issue was that I was an example of a kid that got targeted for bullying for no real reason. Looking back at things now it always seems like in elementary school kids don't often get bullied for specific reasons (being over weight, socially awkward, dumb, scared) but seem to just randomly get picked by someone and then it starts and doesn't end for a while. So I was that kid. I liked what other kids liked (Spiderman, trucks, sports, Mario, crayons) but I would just randomly get bullied and I couldn't figure out why. This resulted in me developing avoidant personality disorder, a mental disorder that essentially causes you to believe that you as a human being are fundamentally flawed and everything you do is a failure because of you being the one to do it. Because of this I very quickly began interpreting casual jokes from my parents as insults and messages of disapproval. For instance I always liked to play video games (something I got from my dad) and sometimes when I'd sit down and turn on my N64 my dad would hear it turn on and say something like "off to save the world again kiddo." But the only thing my brain would get out of that statement would be "blah blah blah AGAIN kid." And that translates inside a young mind to "my dad is dissapointed in me because I play video games too often." \n\nI just realized that what I wrote is a giant wall of text and I think what I'm trying to say is that I think I'm not naturally an intp but I think I made myself one to protect myself from the hatred I apply to myself on a daily basis.
1	I was emotionally abused by my step mother everyday for over 10 years. So yes, emotional trauma.
1	Wow, this is interesting.  \nBut how many of you clicked on it because it sounded like you?  \n\n\nMaybe people who DIDNT feel traumatized dont care to click?
2	How do you guys deal with rejection?	I’m a few months from graduation and the rejection letters keep pouring in.\n\nToday, I found out I got rejected from a PhD program I thought I was a shoo-in for (one of the faculty specifically wanted me, but he wasn’t on the admissions committee). \n\nI don’t know what I’ll be doing, where I’ll be living, and it’s really got me reeling.\n\n
5	Oh yea, I remember this shit. I started freelancing as a writer and editor after getting rejected a PhD program.\n\nDo what I didn't do and apply to more than 20 other PhD programs with the anger (that you have to cultivate) from your rejection. 
3	Hmmm work in industry. I usually have to be alone for a while to recover from rejection. I calm my mind slow down and get back to using  my hero function.
3	Take some pressure off yourself, have a plan B. Maybe it’s going abroad and teaching for a year.  Maybe it’s getting further in your field in a non-acedemic way.  The rejection might stinging more because of the uncertainty of what happens if you get rejected by everyone.  It definitely sucks, but life isn’t over.  Take responsibility and blaze your own path
1	Well... there's no reason for me to dwell on it. Yes, it will haunt me and whatever's going to happen but no matter how uncomfortable and stressful it is, I force myself to push forward and find other opportunities. If, I am still rejected, then I get to check what seems to be wrong. This is assuming that you have made your initial assessment before actually diving in.
1	It has taken me three application cycles to finally get into a PhD program. Getting rejections after the interviews succckkkedddd. You'll be fine, but it's ok to feel bad for a bit. \n\nI ended up getting a job at a university with a program I liked. I feel way more prepared for school, and the plan worked out. Research/work experience is only going to help you, so I recommend working for a couple of years before going back to school. I don't know if anyone who regrets gap years, but I know there are people who regret goingv straight into a PhD from undergrad.

7	If I act selfless only in order not to feel bad about acting selfish	am I \n\na) a shellfish person because I am only motivated by not having guilty conscience\n\n2) a selfless person because I have so developed sense of conscience that I feel bad for being inconsiderate
6	Well, you do it in order not to feel guilt, right? Assume that that's all there is to it: you don't want to feel guilt. Then logically, you would choose to get rid of your conscience (if given the power) in order to avoid feeling guilty. So really you don't give a fuck about your conscience or the right thing to do, it's just some burden.\n\nBut, maybe you try to avoid feeling guilty because you want to act according to your conscience; you use your feelings as a signal that you're in or out of sync with your conscience. That would then mean you want to do what your conscience says is right.\n\nSo it all comes down to what you're fundamentally valuing. The right thing to do, or just the experience of some feeling?\n\nYou didn't really distinguish between those two situations which is an elementary as fuck distinction, and yeah it annoys me I had to do it for you in order to clarify your post. So the answer to your question comes down to the answer to my question. Well, really I don't know if it comes down to "selfish vs selfless" but whatever.
5	I have referred to this as my "Morality of Laziness".  Sure, I could do a lot of crap things with my life.  I could lie about things...but then I've got to remember the lie, figure out how to maintain that lie, and then balance that lie against other lies I've told people in my circle...bloody hell that sounds like work.  Never mind I just won't lie.  I could cheat on my spouse...but then I've got to lie about that, gotta make sure my trail is covered and if it wasn't a one time thing then I have to figure out how to maintain two relationships...blood hell that sounds like work.  Nevermind, I just won't cheat on my spouse.  I could break my promises...but then I'd disappoint people, I'd have to deal with the shame, I'd have to make it up to them...bloody hell that sounds like work...on and on and on.  :)  I could be a selfish bastard...but then I'd end up alone and in a sad sorry state, without family, drinking myself to oblivion on a nightly basis and that sounds expensive...and just a different set of complications so...why not have the healthy thing?  I'm still not sure what to do with it, actually.  lol.

0	Is there a certain way an INTP is supposed to behave?	So lately I’ve been getting into Jungian typology and have been looking at a lot of videos related to it and doing all sorts of tests and quizzes just for the heck of it. I tended to get INTP and ISTP and I don’t wholly relate to either although I have way more INTP tendencies.\n\nThe thing is I get annoyed when people point out how someone can’t possibly be INTP especially since mainly INTPs are the ones that state that someone can’t possibly be a certain type. This can only be attributed to close minded thinking which basically goes against the supposed basic mindset of an INTP. \n\nA lot of INTPs seem to stick themselves into some sort of box and truly believe that only a few characteristics can make them INTP, and because of that they either don’t want to change or purposely act a certain way. I’ve seen people who seem to try way too hard to BE like an INTP by using big words to sound intelligent and purposefully coming off as condescending. \n\nThese kinds of negative things actually started to affect me as I got more into typology. Even though I very much believed I was more-so an INTP I would see others ridiculing someone who was supposed to be INTP as well because they didn’t fit the “criteria,” and this would confuse me. (This is the reason why I say i might not be wholly INTP)\n\nI guess I just want to point out that not everything has to be set in stone and that just because you’re  a certain type doesn’t mean the environment didn’t mold you into the person you are. You can change or improve on aspects that are traditionally INTP to better yourself and/or your life.\n\nI care what people think. I like to pay attention to how I dress. I can look people straight in the eye, but that does not mean that my actions don’t have a purpose that I thought deeply about, that I am not doing these things because I don’t have some sort of aspect of myself that I want to change or that my parents didn’t force their views on “image” and presenting oneself to others. (I’m also a girl so this may or may not affect things).\n\nTLTR:\nDoes anyone else see the obvious behaving to fit in mentality that some who have gotten into Jungian Typology present?
6	In general I would say no.\n\nBy cognitive function alone, we could say we are more likely to react a certain way, so certain reactions could be "more" or "less" INTP.\n\nAlso, it doesn't help that most descriptions of the type focus so much on how "awesome" and "intelligent" and "logical" we are, making people justify themselves with the type.\n\nOn YouTube you can find a video called "INTP-INFJ Interaction" (by Vase Face) were they talk about their personality, and it was pointed out in the comment section that we are usually social chameleons, acting the way we believe we should act depending on the circumstances.\n\nYou will also find, in the same comment section about how the guy is "too pretty" or "too good" or whatever to be an INTP. But hey, to each it's own, right??
3	Keep in mind that the people on here are also all reddit users and people who cared enough to figure out their personality type so a niche within a niche within a niche, so yeah there’s gonna be a certain environment. \n\nIf you don’t like it just forget about the tests and personality type, it’s not the end of the world if you don’t fit in perfectly with other INTP people or any of the groups. I’m sure people IRL like you just fine and that you have your own little real life niche right there. I understand introspection can be fun but if it’s bothering you then just try a different type of test, the True Colors one is simple and nice.  Gave me Green as a dominant and Orange as secondary. \n\nI also am a girl and I do care about how I look for the most part, wear make up and dress according to what should flatter my skin tone/ body shape. Even with that I see myself trying to break it down into a science planned out by tones and shapes 😂.  I also have non intellectual things I enjoy, like watching hours of YouTubers try on clothing I will never buy. So some stuff regardless of our personality will come down to how we are socialized, yet again none of it makes you less of an INTP ... unless you want it to then just pretend you never saw the results and move on 🤷🏼‍♀️
1	Ok, so im gonna be lazy and just answer the title and not read the post.\n\nMy answer is no, *kinda*.\nThe types are these sprts of categories of what you are most likely to use, but not always. It narrows down a persons function set into this one set that you use most. Get other answers, though. Im interested to see what others think.
1	No there isn't.\n\nStudy the function, it will help you understand, and, yes, there are tons of people trying to fit in. It's part of the stage when you still don't get the type or their definition. It's a pretty known phenomenon, especially when some are actually mistyped.\n\nSome never break out of that stage, some do...\n\n
1	I feel personally that I take everything in internally. And I’m a pretty stoic individual although most of the time I’m laid back and chill. But my mind is constantly filled with thoughts about how irrational this world is and if I ruled the world everything would be perfect. But I’m crazy like that and I smoke a lot to dull the thoughts even though I know that’s not healthy but fuck it, it is what it is. And I find it crazy how easy it is for me to piece things together, no matter the situation. I love problems and when unexpected things occur I can go with the flow easily. And I can appeal to be lazy but that’s only because I’m constantly surrounded by things that don’t interest me but, the things that am interested in, i get DEEP into it. But that’s just me. 
1	The only thing that holds us together is how our brains process information and our nervous system
1	Behavior is generically modeled by the functions and their ordering associated with the type. INTP behavior as Action = 3rd function Si. INTP behavior as Principles = 4th function Fe. \n\nhttps://i0.wp.com/www.alittlebitofpersonality.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Thought-Process-INTP.png?fit=968%2C415\n\nWe can't say what an INTP *ought* to do, but we can say that when functioning properly, the INTP's Actions will be of a 3rd function Si variety, which tends to mean a linear, orderly process based on the INTP's Si "model", while their Principles will be of a 4th function Fe variety, meaning the INTP's Actions are done with an intermittent (4th function) Fe passion, if they're to be done at all. 
1	I see a lot of what you are describing here. One overlooked INTP trait is the belief that we have arrived and will not change. People do change of course. When you are 30, you will look back on your 20-year old self with a mixture of cringing and laughter. When you are 40, you will do that for your 30 and 20 year old selves. When you turn 50, you will be too tired to bother, but you will have changed again.\n\nPeople tend to think that INTP is what they are right now. They also tend to assume that INTP is exactly what they are and nothing else. I think that this is just the way our minds work. \n\nI also am noticing more focus on "functions" and Fe, Te, and Si or whatever they are. As I see it, that is taking things way too far. MBTI is useful to loosely identify people who share some characteristics, but there are a hell of a lot more than 16 kinds of people. People are not something that you can define or predict. \n\nYou say that you have tested as ISTP and INTP. I never even heard about MBTI until my 40's, and when I was curious, I took a bunch of tests that all screamed INTP. When I read the description, it meant nothing to me. Parts of it would have been accurate long ago but no longer, and other parts never described me.\n\nThen on a whim, I found this place, and it was a revelation. I discovered that I have people. And they were here. I understood what they were saying, and they seemed to understand me too. All my life, I thought I was a one-off and would never find my kind. As I see it, the value of MBTI is that I can find generally like minded people, even though all we do is argue. MBTI is useful for that purpose. Trying to take it any farther is nothing I want to do.

34	Horrible Introvert usually but life of the party when drunk??	Okay I don’t have to be super drunk but once I have two glasses of wine in me I become very talkative and generally people seem to like me/want to hang out with me? Why can’t I be like that without the alcohol? Is it something all INTPs have in common or is it some type of a personality flaw?
22	I have the same thing. When I drink, my subconscious takes over. As an INTP, your subconscious is ESFJ. It’s annoying when people meet drunk me and then realize they don’t like sober me all that much. I stopped getting drunk in public because my ESFP subconscious thinks breaking the law and running from cops is a fun time, while hungover INTJ me has to retrace my steps looking for my purse the next morning.\n\nCurious though... what happens to extroverts when they drink? In my experience, they just get louder than they already are..
13	thats called social anxiety. You might even be an ENTP if you're lucky
4	Alcohol takes away anxiety so you’re able to be socialize more/easily/freely without thinking too much about it. Maybe.\nI’m pretty much the same\nI will be a lot more social with a few drinks 
4	Same. Although I’ve noticed once I do this, I get a little more comfortable around those people when I’m sober. 
5	The INTP shadow archetype, on occasions such as being drunk, is ENTJ.
3	This is why people like drinking socially. It loosens you up, so you can have a good time, by slowly shutting down your ability to think.
2	I was a very active standup comic back when I was drinking. In large group settings (if I'm comfortable with most of them) I'm cracking jokes and being gregariois. I.E. life of the party. I then meander through the crowd to find folks I'm closest to, tone it down and converse with them. But timed down end more towards a general conversation 
2	Same here. At parties I cling to my friend until I’m drunk. Then I’m best friends with everyone

1	Relatable.
1	I don't drink anymore due to migraines,  but wine used to make me very chatty indeed. 
1	I am an INTP and whenever I’m at a party or club and I’m sober I’m pretty shy and just keep to myself. I get REALLY ballsy sometimes whenever I’m drinking though. Of course it’s just me doing the first thing I think. But people seem to dig me so whatever. It sucks though because I really don’t want to have to rely on drinking to be comfortable in a social setting like that. But usually before I do something anxiety inducing like going on a date I’ll drink just a bit to loosen up. 
1	People like me more in general when a talkative mood strikes as long as I’m not talking about stuff that’s too boring to them. I actually tend to sort of monologue at people and I can’t tell if they like it or if it’s more annoying then me being quiet. 
1	Alcohol makes for good social lubricant by calming down the areas of your brain that are responsible for anxiety and other mental "issues", if you will, that hold you back.
1	Nope at all. Try drinking without any expectations and see what happens. Alcohol's effects are heavily influenced by our expectations (there are plenty of studies about this somewhere), if you expect alcohol to make you extroverted, it probably will. For me, I get more relaxed and open to socializing, but still very introverted and in control. Alcohol affects everyone differently, it might have little or nothing to do with mbti type, but it certainly won't mak moste people act out of character on its own, unless it is abused too often.

2	I don't mind shaking hands, tbh. It's the constant eye contact that bothers me. I can't help but focus too much on their eyes, to try and seem like a normal human being, and then that causes me to totally tune out from whatever they are talking about. I just need to hurry up and get an advanced degree so I can come across like an eccentric professor instead of just a socially awkward weirdo.

1	Why cant I lie or act like the asshole I am?	**Why cant I lie or act like the asshole I am?**\n\n*(If you can't handle subtle irony, didn't reach mental adulthood or have a need of presenting your morale superiority, this not the right post for you and maybe not even the right MBT-community. ;) )*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*What follows is a maybe too long and repetitive explanation of my thoguths and their backround, but I rather expect it to be neccessary to my point than a waste of our time:*\n\nI am an asshole, at least in most people's eyes. For the sake of being accurate I'd rather describe myself as being very liberal, open and with a huge distaste for most people, their behaviour and their motives, which results in almost zero compassion for my fellow human beings. From my point of view this is totally fine and pretty INTP-ish. I don't know why but I also have a dark side that enjoys violence and my Ne does not only find opportunities to help others and solve stuff, but also to harm and destroy others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn social interactions I view myself as a wolf among sheep. I see many opportunities to exploit people through lieing or manipulation, which in many cases would totally be in line with my code of ethics (remember my distaste for other's behavior and motives). I don't do it though, which does not make any sense. This is especially stupid when you know that you can prevent harmful siutations that are unjustly brought to you by either people's stupidity or their distasteful nature, or because they were manipulated by another wolf, who fears competition.\n\nAny way, I should lie or manipulate, it would be just, it would rightfully defend myself but I don't... By the way just because one asks question's does not mean he deserves answers. And if he would punish you for denying him his answers he lost his right of receiving the truth - it was his choice, he made the rules.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to manipulation, despite of thinking rather lowly about the cognitive abilities of others, I fear it wouldn't be subtle enough. Just to see another wolf doing what I considered but in a way that makes me cringe and leaves me speechless, seeing it succeed. -> So let's do not focus on manipuation. ->Lieing... I can't! It harms me, always. \n\nImagine job interviews - people ask questions, which answers either exceed their mental horizon or they don't want to hear. I know that, the moment I hear the question, but I can't lie and also have difficulties of being inaccurate. (Let's assume by the way that there is zero need of sounding smart. In fact I prefer sounding dumb with most people and don't care what they think about me or my points. I rather find it very nice of me of trying to bring them the light. A niceness I am not always willing to perform.) Having difficulties being inaccurate is also pretty normal for us INTPs. I am not so sure about the huge mental obstacle when it comes to lieing though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's get to my last point before we reach the final conclusion: I guess I am not polite nor emitionally supportive, but I pretty rarely am unjust. I'd say that my behavior is pretty cold and heartless for people who want to get emotional support or who want to get emotionally close or who want to get valued by me. But from the perspective of a rational (at least mostly) business interaction my behavior would be excellent, providing you with all the information and cooperation you need and even being proactive, so you can reach your goals easier.\n\nYet most of the time I also give people more than they deserve from an eomtional point of view (friendliness, closeness, etc). It is more than I see as being appropriate but I do it just to be on the safe side, because I know that I cannot act purely based on my values if I want to stay in society. It is a rule I put on myself because I knew it wouldn't work otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My conclusion I'd like your perspectives on:**\n\nMaybe I cannot lie, despite it being the only reasonable choice in many situations, because I am afraid of turning to my dark side, totally loosing any place inside society and not being able to draw the line once I have begun exploiting others and even lie to those few valuable individuals and harming those relationships due to misjudgements.  \nStarting to use and exploit the possibilities I have, might be the more rational choice but I am not sure if it also would be the wiser one. It is that could choose anyway since something deep inside performs such a strong force preventing me from being even slightly untruthful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think about my conclusion?\n\nHow are you handling lieing and your dark side in general?
3	I understand your hesitation but I think your conclusion is inaccurate. Simply put, your subconscious values (which are more "emotional" in some vague sense) do not match your conscious (logical) values. (A person who is powerful, confident, productive, etc is able to behave in accordance with their values, which are coherent.) My theory is that when your values are misaligned, it means your emotional perception of truth is distorted; there are things preventing from behaving how you believe it makes sense to behave, and those obstacles may be messages you've picked up from people around you and society in general, or from fears or anxiety or habit or whatever. In totality, there is part of you that believes or questions whether it is truly okay to behave as you imagine, and if you can uncover and dismantle that resistance (which may be a deeply connected network of things) as well as opposite it in action to break past thought patterns, then you're going to continue acting "irrationally".\n\nSo I disagree that this "dark side" is dark at all or that there is any slippery slope you should be afraid of. You are afraid of something but that thing is not the dark side.
4	You are afraid lying becomes a recurrence, then a habit, and eventually a part of you. You realize you would have to spend tremendous effort to get rid of it, so you rather not play at all.\n\n> very liberal\n\n> almost zero compassion for my fellow human beings.\n\nLiberalism is funny like that. The more freedom you give to the humans around you, the more you start to loathe them. Subconsciously you are realizing that people are likable only by the virtue of the surrounding society that has taught them to be likable. Liberalism sees such indoctrination inhumane, thus the people are left to revert to their vulgar (or virtuous) selves. By being a liberal you deny the essential need for the society to hammer its people into their places, in good and bad.
1	You act as if you are just the way you are and not responsible for any of it.  Oh yeah, you're INTP, and that makes it OK.  Not in my existence.\n\nBeing liberal and having a distaste for people sounds like being male and female. Maybe you like humanity but don't like people. My mom said that about me once. \n\nDo you like who you are? It sure feels like the answer is no. If you don't, did you know that you can change? Are you the person that you want to be? 
1	I'd say go outside, but TBH you really just need to stay inside and *never interact with the rest of humanity* 
1	I stole this from the internet, but I remember a quote that's true, "Ethics is like a condom. It's fun without it, but we know better..."  \n\n\nEdit: kinda true* 
3	Psychopath?	I've had two exes compare me to Sharron Stone in Basic Instinct and a best friend who has said that Im like a psychopath but not. Is this because I'm bad at calling...anyone else get confused for a psychopath? 
4	INTPs and INTJs get confused for sociopaths/psychopaths pretty often. I'd say it's because we tend to not show emotions so if you want people to stop calling you a psychopath start working on having a more expressive face and a friendlier tone of your voice.
2	Sharron Stone had Borderline Personality Disorder in Basic Instinct.
1	Intp grief	I am seeing an intp guy and we met through an online platform. He has been going through some bad times as he lost his parents during last and this year consecutively. We are in long distance relationship. He lost his mom last year and he grew more serious and silent afterwards. He hardly talk about how he feels and kept himself so busy with work.Also, he suffered from health issues.\nIt's been a week that he lost is dad in the same month his mom had died. I have no words to console him and I know I can't walk in his shoes and experience same as he is doing. But i want to be there for him in his dark time. I haven't met him yet. Past one and half year has changed him a lot. He has distanced himself from everyone. It's like hiding from world.i want to help him getting rid of his grief and giving all the space at the same time I am scared to lose him in the process. I somehow feel connected to him.what you intp say I could do to soothe him and save him from getting lost.
5	I guess this is one of those cases where it's not just INTP related, and you should really let him make his own choices, including those where you'd lose him.\n\nAs an INTP, I'd behave the following way : I'd force myself to tell how I feel («I think I can help you ; I can be there for you. What do you think ?»), and then wait for the person to make up its mind, in a clearly positive or negative way. I expect the same from people towards me. Us INTPs tend to be loyal, so don't worry too much :)
1	I think that a lot of INTPs crave safety, but they are very reluctant to see it. Sometimes you have to hit us over the head. You might ask him to tell you how he feels. Tell him that you worry he thinks he is all alone when he isn't, that you suffer when he suffers.  If you can break the dam, you may experience a huge flood, but it could lead somewhere.

We view the world in a similar manner but respond in mostly complimentary ways, picking up the slack for each other. He sees the forest, I see the trees, but we do our best to stop to try and see what the other sees too. We are different in all the minutiae, but similar in all the things that count.

7	Does physical affection mean anything more to an INTP?	My INTP friend and I had a history of being friends with benefits two years ago which stopped because I started dating someone else. Now that I'm single we've been sleeping together again, however it's much different than it was two years ago. He used to just come over for sex and then leave (on occasion that we did end up sleeping together he never liked to touch me in the morning). Now he sleeps over and cuddles me in the morning as we have hour long discussions that range from world views to best movies (which we can never agree on). I personally feel that this new morning cuddling has started to spark some feelings within me but I'm not sure how it is for him. If we're out in public together or with other friends he doesn't like me or anyone else touching him. Is this indicative of anything? I've read mixed opinions on it so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; INTP gets extra touchy touchy but I'm the one that's getting all the feely feely and I want to know if it's mutual
11	Absence makes the heart grow fonder\n\nI had to "break up" before finally admitting that i was in love the first time, now that I know the feeling I can be more honest with myself.\n\nHe might be either afraid of commitment, or seeing other girls.\n\nYou can solve both by suggesting an open relationship if it's okay by your principles.
7	Could be indicative of anything. We can sit here and hypothesize all day and never come close to what he's thinking. Luckily the person in question is an INTP so we can get pretty direct with our questioning. \n\nHe's likely to appreciate direct inquiry into his thoughts and feelings. So long as you make an effort to make him comfortable in expressing his most likely confused and barely understood emotions then he'll probably be fine. Try to make it one of your fun morning conversations. Figuring things out such as this can be kind of like a game for INTPs. Since it's about how he's feeling then this is likely to be even more true since analysis of emotions from a detached point of view allows an ease of access. Keep judgements out of the equation and you should be well on your way to finding out just how much an INTP doesn't know about how they feel. 
5	Is that a gay relationship ? ("He"+ Tony in your username.) I ask, because that's a different context (gender roles out the window)
3	Just ask, take what he says at face value.  If he says no feelings, stop sleeping with him, its not going to be good for you.  If he secretly likes you, leave it up to him to chase you.  Check this subreddit for suspicious posts
2	Who knows.  Just ask.  
2	He's more emotionally open with you now that he had more time to process everything, and he's not a fan of PDA. Past handholding, I'm not either.\n\nThis is all hypothesis, though, until you ask him.\n\n/thread
2	Personality type doesn’t determine your love language, I am INTP and mine is words of praise but I certainly don’t mind a good snuggle. \nLike many other people said ask him if he really is an INTP I’m sure he won’t mind explaining himself since I’m sure at this point he knows his introspective nature might lead him to leave others in the dark. 
1	Omg I do exactly the same thing as him haha
20	"You can call/come over anytime!" feels like a trap	I've had several blossoming friendships very quickly wither away because of this: I never really believe anyone when they say I can call, text, or come over anytime. \n\nI know these friends are not just being polite (in the way that people so casually chirp, "Call me if you need anything!"); I do discern a degree of earnestness and sincerity in their delivery.\n\nBut, no matter what, I can't bring myself to do it; I can't invite myself over. If I do so, and detect even the tiniest hint of annoyance from my hosts, it sends me spiraling, and I'm most likely ghosting them soon after. \n\nTo make matters worse, I can tell that the success or failure of these new friendships seems to hang on my reciprocity to their open invitations. That added pressure is, if course, my bane.\n\nHas this been true for any you? Any words of wisdom or mind hacks for this social derelict?
14	Ok. Extrovert weighing in here. \n\nIf you are getting the vibe that these are genuine friendships, then the advice here is probably wrong. When dealing with my introverted friends (especially NTs) I want them to know that I’m not going to force myself into their alone time. I know they need lots of downtime, but when they are feeling lonely or are ready to be social, I want them to let me know!\n\nYes, the whole “call anytime” is often used dismissively between acquaintances. But if these are budding friendships, that phrase from an extrovert is very genuine. Unlike INTs, they *really do* want you to call. (Extroverts are weird that way.)\n\nIf you’re on the fence, here’s a way to know if they’re genuinely wanting a deeper friendship. Text them saying you’d like to hang out, and give two dates/times. If they blow you off, problem solved. If they make an effort to meet up (even if they offer alternate times/plans) they do want to pursue a friendship. \n\nPlease remember that extroverts like to be with people. If there’s a genuine spark of friendship, they will want to pursue it, but they tend to have lots of people who actually do reach out, so yeah - you have to make an effort if you feel the person is worth it. This is true of ALL friendships. \n\nINTPs may be awesome, but so are a lot of other people. Until we’re close/deep friends, I’m not going to spend my time chasing your company when I have other people initiating contact who making an effort to be my friend. The extrovert perspective is that we gave an invite and you didn’t reciprocate. (Also, we’re not all as confident as we seem. Your lack of contact can also be construed as a rejection. We thought you were cool, you didn’t feel the same about us. Shrug.)\n\nP.S. A number of my closest friends are introverts. Once we make that deep friendship connection, I *will* annoy you and invade your me time. But only once I break through the initial wall and feel comfortable pushing you out of your comfort zone and feel equally confident you’d tell me to go away - knowing our foundational friendship would survive the push and shove. 
6	You do not say how old you are, but you sound young. When I was younger and people said that, it felt like a burden, like I was supposed to come over or had to. It just never occurred to me to visit someone. So they would give me an open invite, I would never take it, and they thought that I did not care, even when I did. I finally learned to explain to my friends how introverted and in my brain I was, and that as much as I genuinely appreciate the invitation, I would never act on it. I told them especially early in a friendship, I relied on the other one to drag me out of my shell. And then I resolved to accept every time they reached out to me. It was really hard at first, but over time I began to look forward to their calls, and then I even found myself initiating them. \n\nIf they really are a friend, they will appreciate your honesty and take the reins, especially if they are an extrovert. No idea what you do with two introverts.
3	depends on your emotional IQ and how u assess the intimacy and their competence.   \nif u like em, u want high intimacy, if u got high intimacy > then abuse the rule and see what happens )   \nif that person really likes u ull know, if they dont ull know . i doubt u wanna spend that much time there anyway
2	just let them know you want to come over... its that easy, then wait for them to say ok\n\nalso your friendships will continue to wither until either one of your friends understands this (really rare) or you tell them.
2	I had one person I was comfortable doing this with when I was young but besides that yeah I’m like a vampire, please invite me in. \nAlso I agree with the if they seem annoyed ghosting thing too. I hate being an annoyance and have a pretty fragile ego so if someone seems like they want me gone at any point I stay gone.
1	I totally relate to that, it sucks tbh
1	Dude, I am no good with the friendship. \n\nI can give zero credible advice.\n\nI do think if you always have free beer and a firepit and invite folks over and feed them, you'll always be able to eventually find a few folks who will sit and drink, eat the free stuff in exchange for talking to you while they smoke. Some also include pot in the mix. If you've got pot you share, you'll have friends. So I have seen.\n\nNow, how do you get an actual friend who does not want you for the free stuff you dole out? No idea. None whatsoever. I kinda think there is always a trade. You tell them how great they are in exchange they talk to you. You help them do stuff, and they talk to you. 
1	Have you tried just texting them "wyd" then if their response implies they are free offer to join them? 
1	It is just a way of saying "fuck off, love you". People who really want you to pay them a visit will emphasize their sentiment. 
1	Or when you’re dealing with something stressful and people offer support by saying “Just call me if you need anythng.” It feels like they’re trying to be nice and show that they care, but don’t actually mean it. If someone really wanted to be there for you, they would ask you what you need them to do. 
1	If calling or going over isn't detailed with a purpose to do or talk about something specific then I just assume they're just saying words.
1	I would take this as a cop-out on their side and be frustrated they expected me to do all the "work" for the relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey put you in a position where you have to always initiate and always be the one putting yourself up for "rejection" while they have the excuse that they said they are just "always available", which either means we're talking about your retired grandmother or these people are exaggerating.
12	I finally reached 1,000 songs on my favorite spotify playlist!	If you're an INTP and like music and might need some new tunes, check it out! I also have some more playlist on my Spotify account you're welcome to follow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/user/ln4ebyq5si573cftxodd4ojnx/playlist/5lsbFDJOgMQqAsQeIZy8ZM?si=Su24KtKnQBqSsBsG4oxcSg](https://open.spotify.com/user/ln4ebyq5si573cftxodd4ojnx/playlist/5lsbFDJOgMQqAsQeIZy8ZM?si=Su24KtKnQBqSsBsG4oxcSg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI update this playlist nearly every day, I'm definitely not stopping yet. I'm very happy I got this far. Please let me know what you think! 
4	I want to say I'll definitely check it out, but I know that I can be a lazy procrastinating bitch with stuff like this so I probably won't. Either way, thanks for sharing.
3	No hecking way! I thought I was the only one. [Here’s mine](https://open.spotify.com/user/1239147902/playlist/2ofGY4rw9YE01dzoW5kUV9?si=WE9re78sTRm-SKGghIkIPQ). I noticed we share a lot of the same music, AND you listen to Beach House!\nI must know your favorite musicians. 
3	Yes Satan, you do come from God. That doesn't mean anyone should be listening to you.\n\nNow which is more likely, the Holy Spirit sharing the musical tastes of 'dumb tart' or Satan doing so?
1	I have done the same on YouTube. But the problem is, unless I can somehow guarantee that I'm going to like the songs in your playlist, I'm not going to listen to them. Oh well.
1	Time to skip to the same 3 over and over
1	You're slacking.
6	When I talk with others INTP they feel like fucking robots	I think I hate the others intp. They don't show emotions and don't think to care about what I think. They ignore me WTF \n\n\n\nIm INTP too btw
21	They think the same of you too\n\nBut you have to realize that even though it appears an INTP isn't listening, they are.\n\nYou're one yourself, you know that.\n\nSo if it seems like they dont give a fuck what you're saying....know that they are at least hearing it.  Unlike some other types who dont even hear our words.l and actually just completely tune us out.  *cough ESFJ cough\n\n
13	As an INTP, if I do not immediately light up and start talking a mile a minute, then I am simply not interested in the conversation, which is approximately 95% of all conversations. If it's stuff like "hey, how was your day?," it's just boring, and I don't care. I will try to find the quickest escape route so that I can go do other things by myself. I want to talk about quantum physics and the meaning of life, dammit.
6	This and the constant impression that INTPs judge you, usually negatively because blunt affect. (And we do ; *Ti* is a judging function, and somewhat visible even though introverted !)\n\nAnd when an INTP suddenly starts talking it's going to be either some intellectual blabber that you've got to keep up with (*Ne* stuff), or some criticism that really hurts badly because it's so true. No shit given on sounding "*nice*".\n\nLooking at myself from an exterior point of view, I sometimes think I can understand why I constantly get in trouble with SJ types.

3	I often wonder what people's perception of me must be.  I, honestly, just prefer to be in my thoughts.  It probably does seem uncaring. 
3	If it were me, its because my interests are so specific that I can't relate to most people about them.  So talking to me might seem like a chore if you are not interested or interesting in anything.\n\nHowever I've had people tell me they were shocked to realize all of the things I know and interests I have once they know me.  \n\nI think showing emotions is kind of rude.  
2	Weird. I loved talking to other INTPs, when I used to know a couple. They understand me like no one else.\n\nDamn, now I’m sad.

28	Talking is so fucking complicated	So the communication part of my mind is a bit weird(I think),  if the topic is interesting or if I'm passionate about it, it's like, I'm generating thoughts faster than I'm speaking them and like, a part of my mind has been thinking about the topic while I was unaware of it, sometimes it gets a bit out of control because so many thoughts just keep on generating from multiple points. People have to really listen for some time to make sense of what I'm saying while a certain projection of me (in my mind) is viewing the whole conversation in third person in real time in awe like damn did I just think of that and their's another part is so terrified that I'm not making sense and another part wants to observe their facial gestures and then morph what I'm saying to make them understand in a better way, like I can handle it but it's a bit tiring and I wish I could talk as easily as others make it seem. I don't know if this is an INTP thing or not but figured it could be.
16	Process and collect your thoughts before speaking. If your mouth is anything like your writing style, you just need to collate your thoughts better and what comes out will make more sense. It takes time and skill to understand what is worth communicating to others.
6	I know that, it's just so exhausting and sometimes a bit embarrassing. But it's extremly difficult to control.
6	I do this too.  I find that I jump into the details before expressing my main point.  When I back up and start with that I can communicate much better.  
4	I don't have this problem, because I don't talk to people!
4	I relate
5	It's both amazing when you do get into the zone and so tiring when you aren't.
3	I had a similar issue; never liked answering questions in class because I had more information than was useful or necessary for an answer. You just have to work on self control and thinking things out prior to speaking. It is a good practice to try cutting as much fat as you can while sparing the integrity of the idea. Also, try to narrow down one main talking point. I realize that you may want to revise it or hit things from multiple perspectives, but it's best to just get one point across just adequately than none or a confusing jumble of points. 
3	I get you. All the thoughts are there. Just getting them to come out coherently is the challenge.
3	I have an idea for what to say and finish the sentence on autopilot to give me time to figure out what to say or do next. Unfortunately, by that time, what I'd planned to say probably isn't relevant or making sense anymore. Then I end up running over or interrupting someone because I'm not in real time anymore, I'm letting the sentence catch up to my mind.\n\nAll anyone else sees is a rude bitch who doesn't care about what the other person is saying. Fml. 
3	Relatable. That's why talking to other people is so tiring for me in real life. I just have so many things I'm trying to pay attention to, am I making sense, are they interested, blah blah blah. It's very exhausting.
2	meh, the hard part is not being authentic.  \nif you express your values all the time its not draining.  \nthe second hardest is to not get attached to intimacy and the topic
1	Im an intj but reading this made ne wonder if im actually mistaken lol
1	Enfp, relate to lesser degree
470	Usually I just grab a picture of “Big Bird” online and add a controversial/racist joke at the bottom...that usually works for most of the INTPs I’ve met...	
138	I love having conversations that are basically just sharing random facts. 
85	man everyone on this sub is 12
72	Yes, yes. Holy shit. I don't know if it's BDSM or not, but every now and then I get too full of myself till someone puts me back in my place and then my loins get frothy for that person, fuck. Dominate me you sexy fucks
16	So basically, we're cats?
18	Agreed with all of this except thb I'm not the biggest pun fan
6	minus the disprove their arguments \ni turn into a nightmarish immature brat that is torn between “my knowledge is best” and convincing myself im “open minded” to new ways of thinking oof
42	Vegan INTP here. No meat snacks please.
8	For the most part, I dislike puns.
5	These will totally flip my shit
4	Disproving my arguments is a great way to get my respect. The problem is that it happens so rarely with most people just resorting to insults.\n\nOnce on a different forum, I came across someone who could take apart my arguments. So I kept bothering them with more arguments.
6	Since I have a large crush on... well, a lot of INTPs, this is dynamite, thanks.
3	I feel personally attacked by this /s
3	Pretty spot on. 
3	I can't relate to this i hate memes
3	OP please, I can only get so erect 
3	Yes! Lot of pun hate in this thread. I love puns, but not because they're puns, because they make me cringe! I love cringe!
3	I had a bf that sent me messages in Latin. I don't read Latin. That was hot!
3	This was probably written by an ENTP and is more accurately called "how to seduce an ISFJ" aka "How to be an ENTP"
5	Everything except "disprove their arguments" is bullshit\n\nRashil is definitely not an INTP :(
9	Do not disprove an INTPs arguments if you are trying to seduce them :) If you want to be their friend and want their respect. Yes. If you are trying to seduce an INTP. No. Instead, show that you understand their arguments and pretend like the stuff they say isn't random and weird at all :) You can leave the disproving of arguments for later in the relationship :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way I'll take a nice essay or something fun over a love letter or meme :) Though. Who does that anyway?

7	Where are you getting your current news from?	I'm looking for more interesting or better news sources.  \n\nCurrently, I'm consuming irregularly the Washington Post, a business newsletter called The Brew, an industry specific telecommunications newsletter called the Owler,  two science news subreddits, and a Florida news subreddit. Sometimes I listen to NPR news on my commute. Sadly, they don't seem to play the BBC news which I find deals more with world events and has an interesting outside view on American events.
23	Credible news doesn't exist. Read the news and understand they are pushing a narrative. Try to use that info to find out the real story.
5	phil defranco
11	PewNews
6	Memes
3	Honestly I use every news source. I dig through the narrative that they try to push and take the most common pieces of each story first i.e. who was involved, place etc. Then I fact check each individual detail to try and decipher the truth as best as possible.
3	First and foremost Reuters.  Then a combination of sources as long as I can cross check and verify.
3	Mostly from the in game radio in GTA vice city
3	Myself because apparently everything's a ton of BS now. 
2	Try Flipboard. People flip articles into the app from varying sources. You get to choose topics that interest you in your feed. 
2	I'm currently not watching the news anymore ; just too busy these days. Also, I'm not sure if it can help anyone because none are in english. But basically :\n\n\- **SRF's Tagesschau** (CH) : the only newsreport show I have found on TV that does decent journalism in german\n\n\- **NRK** (NO) : quite good look & feel, and indicates clearly whether you're reading a newsreport or an opinion\n\n\- **RUV** (IS) : used to be for the lulz, but NRK tends to be much too NATO-aligned for my taste\n\n\- **De Morgen** (BE) : has sometimes different views than the other media I see\n\n\- **Ken.FM** (DE) : this one has **highly** controversial and diverse contents, but I like having my views challenged, so...
2	If im going to be COMPLETELY HONEST:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPew News (Pewdiepie), political youtube channels, and memes.  (And hearing someone tell me)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor real.  How did I learn about the Mars rover dying?  Memes.  If I want to learn further, Ill try to find somewhat objective news sources online.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(But more people watch Pew News than CNN, so... )\n\n[https://www.redstate.com/brandon\_morse/2019/01/29/youtubes-pewdiepie-watched-news-mainstream-news-outlets-millions-views/](https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2019/01/29/youtubes-pewdiepie-watched-news-mainstream-news-outlets-millions-views/)

2	I read articles in the BBC App, can recommend it.
2	I skew liberal, but prefer a factual basis for things.  The site [talkingpointsmemo.com](https://talkingpointsmemo.com) has proven to be as balanced as any political site can be. [Politico.com](https://Politico.com) is also decent for politics.  I avidly follow [NewAtlas.com](https://NewAtlas.com) just because they find interesting things. [https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/) and [https://www.reuters.com/](https://www.reuters.com/) are both decent but less raw than they used to be. If I care about something, I find the original source material.
1	doesn't matter, as long i can cross-check them against other sources to verify them - if i care.\n\nthere is just too much sloppy "journalism", clickbait articles with misleading titles or just copy-paste articles that show that their author misinterpreted the source message, willingly or not.\n\nit's just so much hassle, i barely even care about the news anymore. unless they are on topics of science, because there it's easier and faster to filter out the BS. anything else is most likely biased, misinterpreted or made up.
1	r/geopolitics + Reddit in general
1	What are your science news subreddits?\n\n&#x200B;
1	To be honest, I watch whatever is in my YouTube feed. It's a mix between the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and random YouTubers like David Pakman. If something seems fishy to me, I just google it and read an actual article about it. Ultimately, they are all pushing a narrative. Some of those narratives are worse than others, but even still, it's always important to cross-check with other sources. Not everything CNN says is wrong, just because it is CNN reporting on it, and not everything the White House says is true, just because it is the White House reporting on it.

11	I'm a Christian INTP struggling with agnosticism. (+Half my life's story) Sorry for the ramble.	Just did 16Personalities a few weeks ago and I've not been able to stop thinking about it since; it was just so spot on. Part of me is thrilled that there's other people who have the same thought processes I do. It would just be nice to have some like minded individuals to share my thoughts with. (Btw if anyone wants to argue with my theological beliefs go ahead and PM me)\n\nSo, I'm going to post a short story (Not so short I now realize) and maybe some of my religious friends here might relate. I think you'll all relate with the form of the struggle if not the content. (Go down to the separating line to see the part I think we all understand)\n\n(Coming back around half way through to edit, I see now this is turning out to be more a story on my struggle with Fe. At least the first part.)\n\nI first picked up a Bible when I was about 12. I had a cousin invite me to a youth church camp and my dad just gave me a Gideon New Testament that he had sitting up in a closet somewhere. I didn't think much of it at the time; it was just a good excuse to hang out with my goofy cousin. I lived way out in the Oregon hills on my grandparent's property, so I didn't have many friends besides a few family members who lived out there as well.\n\nDuring the first sermon/teaching I experienced there I remember being told to open to a specific book and I couldn't find it. My cousin, seated to my left, "It's not in that Bible, Chucky." I felt a bit incompetent at that. I felt that a lot through my childhood and teen years.\n\nIt was a three day thing, I remember there were games and activities, but I wasn't all that interested to be honest. I remember very clearly the preacher telling us a story about him taking his young daughter to an amusement park and describing how she had looked up at him, fearful to go on one of the rides, tears in her eyes, saying, "Daddy, will you go with me?" reaching up and grabbing his finger. He goes on to describe his feelings, telling us that this is how God feels toward us. \n\n(I know now that this is a type, a figure of what our relationship with God is like. It doesn't completely line up, but aspects of it are similar. The world is full of these figures and types... anyway, moving on.)\n\nThis kid my cousin and I had been sitting next to kept trying to talk to us. Having been so emotionally moved by the preacher's explanation of the Father's love toward us I remember feeling so appalled that this kid didn't seem to care at all about this thing that to me was fundamental to the world.\n\nThere was an altar call the last night. I didn't know what that was or what was happening, but I followed my cousin up to the front and knelt down like everyone else had done. \nI didn't know what to pray for, having never prayed before. So after thinking for a minute, I said "God, keep my family safe." And that was all. I didn't know what else to say.\nI waited for other people to start standing then I went back to my seat.\n\nThis experience stuck with me.\nIn the following couple years my sister, who is a couple years younger than me convinced me to start coming to an Assembly of God church with her (She had started going, accompanying one of her friends from school).\n \nI had started reading that Gideon Bible a little bit before this, but someone ended up gifting me a full Bible and I began to devour it throughout the next few years.  \n\nBesides video games and a few sci-fi and fantasy books the Bible was the only thing I felt was worth while.\n \nTo be Absolutely candid with all of you around this time my parents got internet. And I discovered, among other things, porn. I don't know how the Bible and... that held my mind at the same time. Still don't. It's still a constant battle...\n\nMy grandparents had pirated a whole library of movies on VHS, not all of them kid friendly, so I had seen plenty of nudity growing up and neither of my parents were shy about adult topics, but this is a different level and I don't care what anyone says, porn will turn a kid's life upside down. It's like a drug, plain and simple.\n\nI often wonder what my teen years would have been like if I hadn't gotten hooked on that abominable activity.\n\nI lost so much sleep. Maybe I would have gotten more than just barely passing grades in school. Maybe could have really learned something. Held an interest in something more worth while... I'm just barely breaking free of this stuff now about thirteen years later. It's still a fight. It's one of the few things that distracted from the anxiety that I think we as INTPs, many of us, fight with...\n\nAnyway... I digress from that tract of thought... onto another difficult one.\n\nIt's also about this time my grandmother passed away. I loved that woman so much. Some of my most cherished childhood memories are spending time with her. (From what I understand we also as INTPs often get stuck in nostalgic memories).\n\nOne of my last memories of her conscious, she's laying in a hospital bed, struggling to breath through a hospital mask, "I... love... you..."\n\nIt was a fairly slow process. She was in her mid-late sixties, had lung problems from smoking, her bones were getting brittle, very weak. She was in and out of the hospital pretty often the last few years. \n\nShe tried to get out of the hospital bed to go to the bathroom (she was a bit stubborn). She fell and fractured her hip. They put her under and she stayed that way until she passed.\n\nFor the following year I had dreams every night of going to visit her at their house. Like everything was fine. Walking up on their porch by the window and hearing her tell my little cousins I was there, "Look, Charlie's here!" and they all came running out to see me, hugging on me. \n\nI still can't differentiate between the dreams I had that year and real memories. That whole year was a daze.\n\nI struggled to know where my grandma had gone. I know everyone deals with this thought to some extent when they lose a loved one, but this defined me for a while... still does, in a way.\n\nAt some point I managed to push that thought out of my mind. About my senior year of High School probably. \n\nLike I said before, I graduated by the skin of my teeth. Wasn't very satisfying. I knew more than other people in my class (A class of 9 people, btw. Would have been more, but one dropped out and the other killed himself).\n\nHad my youth pastor tell me about a little Bible school up in WA, so I made plans to go up there and try that. Roomed with someone up there that my youth pastor knew for cheap rent. Took me a lil while to find a job. Learn much from the Bible school, but i did gain a few study resources.\n\nI was up there for about 9 months. Looking back I think it was a good learning experience for me. Would have spent probably another year there, taking some simple classes on exegesis and hermeneutics , but then my grandpa died. I had just made plans to go fishing with him the next summer. I knew he wasn't going to be around a lot longer, having dealt with the grief of my grandma passing the years prior... to little to late I guess.\n\nI think my grandma's passing had numbed me. It's this numb anxiety I still feel. I didn't feel more than about thirty mins to an hour of real grief after I heard.\n\nI was tired of feeling so alone up there though. Felt so isolated. I don't make friends easily. I needed to go see my family, people I was familiar with.\n\nThis is the setting when I really started focusing on my theological beliefs. \n\nMy sister had started going to a new church with a guy from school she was crushing on. This guy was actually one of my good friends. They're married now; I had them do 16Personalities and she's a ENTJ, he's ISTJ. Preschool teacher and an engineer. Neither of them go to church anymore. She doesn't know what she believes, but he's confidently agnostic. We've had lots of debates.\n\nAnyway, I had Trinitarian beliefs at my entrance into Christianity. It's what I had been taught. It's how I read it. I know I hadn't really **thought** about it.\n\nBut at this point my sister invites me to this Pentecostal church and I feel very out of place. They're doing their clapping and running and all their expressive worship and I'm thinking "God, are these people crazy? Why would I want to be here?"\n\nI ended up grappling with their doctrines on the Godhead. Namely what they commonly call the "Oneness" view of the Godhead. Trinitarians often refer to them as "Unitarians" which conflates them with a cult that doesn't believe in the Godhead of Christ. They may also call them "Sabellians" or "modalists" meaning that they only believe God manifests himself in "modes," sometimes as the Father, sometimes Son, sometimes Spirit. This is a straw man though. An unintentional straw man, I believe, but still a straw man.\n\nWhat they actually believe is that the one person, God, the Father, manifested himself as a man, that being the Son, Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit caused Mary to conceive (The Holy Spirit being the Spirit of the Father and the Son. I still don't really have a clear understanding of what spirit is). They don't believe the Son was pre-existent as the Son, but was the Word, the Logos of the Father.\n\nI struggled for about a year with this, studying it off and on before I came to an understanding and the conclusion that they were right.\n\nIt's been about eight years since I changed my beliefs on this and It's only been about a year now that I have really come to be settled in the ontological separation of Christ and God rather than a personal separation between the two. One person, two simultaneous ontological states. Like an author writing himself as a character in a story.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBut this is where I get a bit of a psychological hang up.\n\nI was wrong before. I believed in something I now don't think was true.\n\nHow do I know that what I believe now is true? What if I find out that my current doctrines of theology won't hold up to scrutiny after a time? \n\nThis thought process tumbles out of control until I'm wondering what if there is no God? Logic? No objective meaning? Moral Nihilism?\n\nAt times I feel like I'm falling into this void of meaninglessness and I'm reaching out to grab anything I can, but it all crumbles and the anxiety is so much that I have to go to my closet and just break down. \n\nThen I just push it down all back down. There has to be meaning. Reinsert foundational beliefs. Go about reestablishing footing. Try again... There **has to be** objective meaning...
10	Fellow INTP Christian here.  And yes...there **HAS TO BE**  objective meaning.  Even if it's as simple as math there is objective meaning.  Questioning is never wrong and never a "sin".   \n\nWhen I was about 19 I gave up the faith my parents instilled in me because I was at a VERY similar place.  I believed that if God was real then I would find him again somehow, that I would find evidence along the way, but I HAD to divorce myself from what I called my Parents "faith" and find my own.  My goal was the Truth, no matter where that led me.  I started out atheist but that didn't last long.  Any in depth study of nature or the human body shows how complex just basic life is and the notion of it being random happenstance didn't hold any water with me.  Then agnostic, then Buddhist, then Zen and Tao, and then Kabbalah, which brought me right back into the arms of Christ.  The journey was worth it.  The questioning was worth it.  Every step was a constant barrage of learning, standing back from it to view it objectively.  I'd find things that fell apart here, there, how it lacked the courage of its own convictions, etc.  A lot of people get bent out of shape about Christians not following their own beliefs so they must be full of crap, but one thing I found was that The Bible puts it on us individually.  "Yeah, that guys a jerk, that guy is sinning here, that lady is barely a Christian at all but YOU....YOU do x, y, z no matter what anyone else does.  YOU be the light.  YOU draw near to Me.  YOU follow Me.  YOU think on these things even if the world around out mocks you."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI STILL go through seasons of re-evaluation of my beliefs.  I still break it apart like a clock and put the cogs back together when I get a hint I may be running down a wrong path, or have accepted some doctrine that is bull crap.  \n\nHe tells us "Taste and see..."  It's pretty much a dare.  "Ask...knock...seek..." and He says He will respond every single time.  Not always in the manner we desire, but He does.  He's not scared of the questions and He has all the answers.  As Thomas Jefferson supposedly said, "Question with boldness even the very existence of God; for surely He favors honest questioning over blind-folded fear."\n\nI'd recommend digging into some of C. S. Lewis' non-fiction work.  He is one who came to faith not through persuasion, or through guilt.  He declared that He came to Jesus through logic and reason.  If memory serves, "Surprised by Joy" tells how he got there and "Mere Christianity" is a book MANY Christians should read as it makes less emotional and more objectively reasoned cases for why we should do what we are called to do how we are called to do.\n\nGood luck, Brother.  
5	uhhh try philosophy before theology. once you understand plato and aristotle the bible will make a whole lot more metaphoric sense. ive heard from my catholic honors english teacher that the religious leaders with the most understanding admit their inability to understand what god is, because god is simply the set of things man cannot see or do (an infinity, in a sense).\n\nand be open to the possibility that there is no god at all, that its just a human thing.
4	One of the biggest hang ups I've noticed with Christians while discussing religion is how much their grasp upon the world relies on their beliefs being true.  Christianity has an all or nothing approach when it comes to it's system of beliefs.  I see this as both a strength and a weakness.  It requires that it's members take everything on blind faith alone and give themselves over to God entirely.  This level of trust creates an intense bond between it's followers and God, and because of this Christians tend to be some of the most devout and spiritual people that I've met.  The downside to this level of commitment is that the doctrine is thousands of years old, and even if it is the word of God, it was written by men.  Much of it's scripture is flawedand doesn't hold up against modern theories.  Because of the level of commitment made, Christians are unable to separate the beliefs that hold truth from the beliefs that are beyond unlikely.\n\nI personally am not Christian and never have been.  I have spent a fair amount of time exploring religion and meeting people with varying beliefs.  I've found that most people are simply finding different ways of describing the same thing.  Christianity has some really interesting beliefs, and I do find the holy spirit fascinating and somewhat similar to my own findings.  \n\nI personally like to take the best from all religions and philosophies and apply them to my own beliefs.  Just because someone doesn't believe in God, doesn't mean they find the universe meaningless.  There is a lot of order, mystery, and complexity to the universe, and I believe that there are much better philosophies and theories out there that explain how it functions than Christianity does.  Part of searching for the truth is the acceptance that you will never hold it in it's entirety.  If you want to get closer to the truth, you must adapt your beliefs upon finding new truths.
3	>How do I know that what I believe now is true?\n\nHow do you know that you are truly believing in anything in the first place?\n\n>What if I find out that my current doctrines of theology won't hold up to scrutiny after a time?\n\nIs it so bad to be wrong? You are trying to be right, not infallible. The universe respects a good try. \n\n>There has to be objective meaning...\n\nThere is. Objective meaning is self-existent. If something exists, it is meaningful, because nothing truly meaningless can spring into existence. Whether or not any of this is something you as an individual human can fathom, that is different question.
2	Enter ENTP-world. Question everything. Start at the beginning. How do we know there is a divinity? Well, we don't. It makes us feel safer to believe in one. In fact, conservative brains are more fear-based than non-conservative brains. Conservatives are also much more likely to be devout in whatever faith they have. They need more comfort.  \n\n\nLet's instead assume a divinity. How do you know it's a monotheistic divinity? Very few religions take this direction. Still, can you prove only one? Well, you can't prove one in the first place, so how do you prove multiples? You can't. Okay...  \n\n\nSo let's assume that it's impossible to know either way about either of these. Abrahamic faiths such as Christianity have an 'I'm right, you're wrong' clause that require you to spread your story with others, which you still cannot prove. The story given isn't really one of life and love - it's of death and punishment for wrongdoings. It starts with 'you're born of sin and need forgiving'.  \n\n\nSounds pretty fuckin twisted in the head to me. A divine being who is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent intentionally created humans so that they could be ashamed of themselves? Humans alone of all the animals on this planet? Give me a break. If it's omnipotent and omniscient, it knew that the free will clause with rules was going to lead to trouble and did nothing to start it. The whole religion is based on arrogance - arrogance that the people who stole the stories in the old testament from older religions like Hinduism were right about a divinity in a way that no one else is and failure to follow their way leads to eternal suffering and that the divinity that created everything needed its ego stroked by its own creation - which we know didn't take 6 days, but billions of years.  \n\n\nI'm going to stop there. I could pick it apart forever. The short story here is that it's good to question things. The single largest factor for what religion you follow is where you were born in the world. Nothing else predicts these things. Religion is a kind of subtle social brain washing. You can choose to believe whatever you want, but it doesn't HAVE to have meaning. Life on this planet was formed from the contents of the primordial atmosphere and its conditions - lightning storms that struck the earth many hundreds of thousands, millions, however many times until RNA strands began to self-replicate that. I believe that life exists just to create more life. I follow a nature-based religion and mostly tune in to respect our tiny blue ball of life and be aware of the natural cycles upon my body and mind.  \n\n\nBest of luck with your questions.
3	ideology offers little to the rational mind.  \nseek motivation in reality, in your value system. in your competence.  \nu waste time on things that will never be proven )
1	I'll admit that my eyes started to glaze after a bit and only really came back after the break in regards to your questions, but I may as well\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're asking if your current set of beliefs are correct, and are experiencing doubt, correct?\n\nTo be frank, I think that this is exactly what should be done, especially for the type of people INTP generally are.\n\nIf you doubt it, then find what that doubt is, and where it comes from specifically, and see what answers it, if it can at all be answered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally divorced myself from Christianity for a while before I revisited the subject from a different angle; rather than focusing on foundational beliefs and proof, I myself found a lot more convincing argument if looking at it through a different lens entirely.\n\nFor example, I'm generally fairly interested in sci-fi, and one rampantly abundant trope is the insertion of time travel as a plot device. Time travel itself is fairly nonsensical, especially in fiction, but despite this there are multiple ways to rationalize it as potentially being possible using the parameters given.\n\nThe simple fact that we as a species are able to grasp and rationalize things that should be theoretically impossible in this world is to me pointing to the fact that we aren't \*meant\* to be in this world. It's like a square being aware of the fact it is able to form a cube despite it only existing in a 2D space. We as a species have descended down, like a cube that has been flattened into a 2D space.\n\nSomewhat esoteric example but I hope that made sense.
1	I think it's difficult for someone who thinks like we do to be able to accept something if we can't poke at it, prod it, ask it questions, etc.  But if God just walked up to you and said "ok here I am" then you wouldn't really have a choice to believe, would you?\n\nMost people's exposure to Christianity (at least where I grew up) was sunday-school as a kid.  Santa-claus-esque cutsey stories that really don't put things into a very coherent perspective or at least don't translate very well to the larger and deeper concepts of what Christianity is actually all about.\n\nI don't think it's wrong to question your beliefs and sometimes if there's a particular thing you're questioning it can be helpful to discuss with others.  In the end, though, we're not perfect (and neither were the people who translated/published the bible).  Sometimes we can get so caught up in the details or semantics that we can get distracted from the big picture.\n\nThe more I've studied, prayed, served, and just spent time "hanging out with God" the more I've gotten to know Him.  It sounds a bit weird but almost like you can recognize a musician by their music or a painter by their paintings, etc I think we can start to recognize glimpses of God in our daily lives.\n\nChristianity isn't about rules, it's about relationship.......focus on the relationship He wants to have with you.  I'm content knowing He can explain all the complex stuff to me at whatever point I'm actually capable of comprehending it....until then I trust that He's got things :)
1	> I was wrong before. I believed in something I now don't think was true.\n\nYeah, that's kind of a warning sign, isn't it? You could conceivably go through this process, over and over again, through hundreds of the world's religions, each one convinced that its teachings are correct and others are incorrect. How do people not find this fishy? I think they just avoid thinking about it too much.\n\nBelievers reject almost all of the world's religions in favor of one -- typically the one they grow up with (how convenient...). The only difference with a non-believer is that the non-believer rejects every single one.\n\n> At times I feel like I'm falling into this void of meaninglessness and I'm reaching out to grab anything I can, but it all crumbles and the anxiety is so much that I have to go to my closet and just break down.\n\n> Then I just push it down all back down. There has to be meaning. Reinsert foundational beliefs. Go about reestablishing footing. Try again... There has to be objective meaning...\n\nI'm sorry, this sounds really difficult for you. Maybe consider seeing a therapist to work through it. Existential dilemmas aren't easy.\n\nBut personally, I gave up any remaining bits of belief as a teen, and I've been fine. There's no meaning, just intrigue. Isn't that exciting? We have no idea why we exist, why the universe exists, or what the nature of consciousness really is. But we're working on it, and it's very interesting to follow new scientific discoveries in these areas. You don't need religion to teach you how to live a good life or be a good person -- there are plenty of real-world examples to follow.
1	I'm  a former protestant transitioning to Catholic...I can relate to that question of "How do I know that what I believe now is true? What if I find out that my current doctrines of theology won't hold up to scrutiny after a time?"\n\nWhat I've done is basically intensely examine every question I've had, read a ton of books, take notes, and even write out my own thoughts to process them.\n\nSo far, Catholicism has the most compelling arguments from a logical perspective so I'm going with that. Most protestant writers lean on logical fallacies left and right. Catholics are not immune to them but I've found a lot better arguments from the Catholic perspective. But I digress...\n\nThe thing is, if I find out some day that it's wrong, I can just change my mind.\n\nUltimately does it really matter if you're wrong? Do you think God will condemn you for not being able to come to a perfect understanding of him?\n\nI recommend the book Theology and Sanity by Frank Sheed if you want a really mind-bending theological read.\n\n\----\n\nAs a Christian and INTP who needs to take my own advice here: I would suggest you try to spend a little more time simply doing devotional things like praying and contemplative reading of scripture or other books. Theology is fun but it should ultimately help grow our relationship with God. We get so stuck in the details and sometimes forget just how beautiful our faith is.
1	Yeah, it's really too long, I didn't read it all. I will just answer the tittle/give my take : \n\nNever believed. My father was raised a Catholic, my mom a Muslim. They never took to any kind of religious stuff, so I was never endoctrined (Negative connotation of the word non withstanding. I'm just describing the process.)  I also live in one of the more atheistic country in the world, so no reason to do it socially. \n\nI don't think a God exists and if one does, then all the religion of the World are probably wrong. Thinking you're any closer to God because you're religious just seems conceited to me. From the most humble/genuine form of faith, to the televangelist telling you to send him money.\n\nThere's plenty of examples of idiots using the name God out here, acting like they are superior to you for it, while not actually respecting the teaching they claim to defend (not like I respect the one who follow them to the letter either.)\n\nEven again among the Christian faith, there's three big group (Catholic, Protestants and the Orthodox) + tons of aller ones. And Christianity is but one of the Abrahamic religions. Who can tell who is right ? It also means the other are wrong, so probabilities aren't on your side.\n\nTo me, staying skeptical of it all is **the only reasonable position**, and if there's an afterlife or whatever, if I get punished for it, then it's a shitty God. \n\nReligion is good/useful for societies, since it brings stability, but that's not like you can't achieve that by other means. I won't look down on the religious, but I don't like when they look down on me.\n
1	Whats the real question? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy do I believe? \n\nWhats the meaning of our existence if god exist? \n\nIs there a god? \n\nWhats the purpose/meaning of our current life here on earth?\n\nIm kinda lost what what *exactly* you're looking at for an answer. 
1	I grew up catholic, with the nuns and plaid skirts and all the Irish catholic guilt you can imagine. However I am now atheist / agnostic, not because I simply don’t believe but because that religious practice gave me more grief then joy. \n\nIf your religion brings you peace and joy, calms your mind keep it. If not search for another or no longer practice and find your own moral meanings in life. \n\nI hope you figure out the right path for yourself and if it takes you a few years there’s nothing wrong with that. 
1	>But this is where I get a bit of a psychological hang up.\n\n>I was wrong before. I believed in something I now don't think was true.\n\n>How do I know that what I believe now is true? What if I find out that my current doctrines of theology won't hold up to scrutiny after a time?\n\nNow you have humility. 
1	From your post, it seems to me that you are in the middle of something both terrible and wonderful: a crisis of faith.\n\nI’m not sure what I can offer except to say that faith takes many forms, and while uncomfortable, uncertainty is not something to fear. Paraphrasing Kierkegaard, the best antidote to despair is possibility, and uncertainty the air that possibility breathes. \n\nIn the process, be careful to honor reality, and don’t damage yourself by warping your perception of it so that you can fit it neatly inside the confines of a too-small faith. Be aware, however: growth can be painful.

5	Man this is so me 😂
2	This is why election seasons are my favorite cycle
1	Oof you got me
1	Lel
1	If that's the path to self esteem then I'd be the cockiest motherfucker on the planet. 
11	Anyone else super lonely	Feel like everytime I make a joke it's either me being sort of an asshole(which makes me feel bad) or some weird observation/hypothetical that always gets a confused "wtf"response. I dont even really make jokes anymore because its such a drag to have to explain it every time...
6	I know exactly what you mean. There are very few people who actually understand my weird ass comments and they are the ones who become my best friends. Otherwise, they'll give me a kind of weird side eye and ignore my comment. \n\n\n\nThis is probably why I have more inside jokes with myself than with anyone else.
3	And just finding things funny that nobody else does.  Im so bad about it.\n\nLike at work one day, the vaccum cleaner broke.  I found it in the dumpster, and someone stuck a Warranty Return sticker on it before throwing it in.\n\nI laughed my ass off about it, but when I told others, they all just had the Confused WTF Face ^(TM).\n\nJust subtle things, I find hilarious.  Im glad I find joy in it, even if I can't share it with anyone. 
2	This must be why I have no friends at the office.\n\nThe stars have to align before an opportunity comes up, I think of it in time, and actually deliver it well enough to be funny. And that's just for a simple pun or comeback. 
1	Yea.. most people don’t process things or have similar trains of thought like we do.  I can be pretty quiet around certain kinds of people, even some friends, because of this.  Their funny is not my funny.  Or I try to adapt my funny with their funny (which can be hard).  
1	jokes suck though
7	In a relationship, do you think about your future with your partner?	Hi! INFJ here! I'm wondering if you guys think about where your relationship will be in the future? I'm referring to big steps in a relationship. I've been with my INTP for almost 4 years but I've noticed that he doesn't talk about the future (relationship-wise) with me. If I bring it up then he gets a bit awkward and usually says "I haven't thought about it. I just know I want you." Is this common for you? Why so? \n\nUPDATE: I asked him if he ever thinks about the future. Anything. He said no. I asked him to talk to me about any future plans he has involving me. He said that i was frustrating him and feels interrogated. I feel so confused and sad. He said that he doesn't know if he wants marriage in general. And that he wanted marriage at one point in our relationship but then flip-flopped and doesn't want it. I would admit there's been conflicts in our relationship but they were average misunderstandings and issues that I thought helped us grow. What is his issue? Is he even an INTP? 
7	All the time; however, I feel extremely insecure about discussing it with my ISTP boyfriend. My anxiety is centered around whether my ideas are too soon or too much for him.
5	Ah!  Greetings dear INFJ!\n\nMe, it keeps me up at night.  It's a problem, actually.  When you think about the future alot, anxiety tends to come with it.\n\nBut when I like someone, im already imagining us being old married farts watching the grandkids.  LOL.  But I cannot imagine just not caring about that stuff.  Its so short sighted.  I dont know.  It's crazy to think about it.
4	Yes. I don't have much relationship experience but I fantasize about relationships a lot. The things many people dream about though seem very arbitrary. It's like I'll think about what we'd do. What things would be like. I don't think about marriage or kids. If I do think about kids I think about what I'd teach them and how I'd mold them, but then I say I don't actually want kids. I don't know how well I'm explaining it, but I think it's just like the logistics don't matter as long as we're happy together ya dig.
3	I do think about it, in that I like to sometimes fantasize romantic things, while other times have anxiety over the fact that I don't know how things will really go, or whether I even know how I want them to go. This may be the key INTP thing. Full of ideas, yet indecisive and out of tune with my own emotions. 
3	Not much.  I have been through the family divorce court oven.  Won’t go through it again, for anyone.
3	I have been married 31 years to an INFJ. Early on in our relationship, I was much more comfortable discussing the future in terms of doing things than in being things. Talking about "us" in the future just seemed contrived. I have flipped and now enjoy our future us. Over time, I realized that all my future plans included my wife and would be empty without her.  Starting with concrete future plans helped me a lot.
2	I think about my future with my ENTJ all the time. The only time he's really awkward about it is when I ask when. But we have fun making plans for the wedding, whenever it may be. \n\nI personally think it's important to talk about the future, make sure you stand in the same position on things like if you want kids, if you're willing to move, etc.. 
2	Yes. Dating an INTJ and we surely entertain the future. She's a world-class planner, so I happily give her the reins many times. But initially those convos were best through text. I got time to prepare words just right since the topics were important.
2	I think it has more to do with the individual than their type. I personally think about future, because I’ve learned that it will not work out well if two people want different things from their future. Compromises are only possible to a certain point, but most people want things from their future that are well beyond that point. It’s fun to hang around with people who aren’t compatible with me in these areas, but I’d never get serious with one of them.
2	Might be a bit different because I am a girl and grew up in a community where the idea of marriage was paramount to me ( Irish catholic family and church).I think about the future on a weekly basis maybe bi weekly and have told my boyfriend what I hope/ expect for the future. We have also been dating for 4.5 years. \n\nHow long have you been dating ? How old are you both? And what are you hoping to hear exactly?
1	I doubt anyone will disagree if I say that for INTPs, everything is up for consideration. (Doesn't mean we will, there's only 24 hours in day after all, so we pick subjects that interests us. If it's 4 years, he ~~definitely~~ very probably thought of it at least once )\n\nSo the answer is a simple Yes. \n\n***\nIdeally, though, I would prefer to take it easy and see where it goes. I kinda project myself in the future, but that's never something  serious. It's just a possibility. \n\nIt's also about if I'm missing out on better options, though. "What if" are how I think after all. \n\nBTW, "thinking about" and "planning for" the future are different things. What you seem to be doing is the latter. \n\nI can't talk for others, but personally, I think planning is stupid in general (outside of the time where it's warranted. Say, organizing/coordinating with people. It's short term, though). I also mean planning, being prepared, however, is not stupid.\n\nAnyway, I noticed Ni Dom like to plan and do badly when it's pure improvisation (Se). I would say strong Ne user in general do not like to plan at all. We actually are opposed to it, a plan means a restriction on our freedom. But that being said, Ni is our shadow function, we use it too. We just don't like it.
7	Annoying favorite INTP	INTPs are very complex creatures, which is something I love about you guys. But it also makes it complicated to know how to communicate. \n\nMy INTP friend always becomes really annoying when he's happy that i'm around or wants to show affection. Like he does it on purpose. I know he acts like that because he's very comfortable and happy. And while I'm happy that he has all these emotions, it can really make me feel down sometimes. especially since he actually tries to annoy me. It's not just being playful. He seems to find it fun.   \nI don't know if it's genuinely his natural way of showing affection or if he's just trying to puch me away because he's not used to being close to someone.   \nAnyways, I'm not sure how I should handle this. I don't know if I should just try to make him change his behavior by adapting mine in some way or if I should just talk to him about it. Although I have no idea how to talk about it in a way that he would actually listen.   \nSo yeah... any advice?   \n(help out an infj)
13	I call it my "happy high" when I'm extremely happy. I usually feel bad and regretful of my actions afterwards for how annoying I was. I kinda don't realize it until someone says I'm being really annoying.
6	Sounds a bit like a child that wants to get/give attention, but doesn’t know how to do it in a positive way, so they do it through annoyance.  He *might* take it as a slight if you bring it up (he might consider it as part of his “charm”), depending on how immature and insecure he is.  But it’s one of those things he needs to grow out of. \n\nNext time it happens, without laughing or anything’s just tell him “hey you know, I don’t like it when you do that”.  He’ll try to come back with some excuse or witty comment to save face.  “I’m serious.  If you want to X, just Y”.  Then re-establish fun mood.  If he continues, just leave.  He needs to know his actions will cause a y reaction.  \n\nThe guy that suggested to ignore him might work, but the problem is you’ve established it as appropriate behavior, so he will likely ramp it up even higher, to the point where I’ll get to your boiling point.  
2	You might want to have a serious talk with him about it. Reading between the lines, I think I was much like what you describe until I realized what a jerk I had become. I thought it was all fun and games, but there was a foundation of hostility in it based on my feelings of being rejected all of my youth. I decided that I had to do something about it, but I realized that could not just turn it off.  The comments and clever asides had become too automatic. However, I could redirect it, and instead of attacking people, I could support them. Same skill, just different ammunition. For me, that worked, and I learned that I enjoyed building people up more than tearing them down.
2	**TELL HIM!**  Tell him how he makes you feel!  If he really does care about you, it will hurt him to know it, and he will be greatly sorry.  If I found out that I was hurting someone I cared about, id start crying, for real.  Me, I love directness and honesty.  "Just tell me what you think!  Tell me what's wrong so I can fix it!"\n\nIf he's an INTP, he has Fe Inferior.  He's very self-conscious about how others feel about him, and how he makes them feel.  And if he thinks he's making you happy, he's gonna keep doing what he's doing.  But if you let him know, he will know how to re-orient himself to not be so hurtful.\n\nAnd of course, trolling is a sort of show-of-affection commonly associated with INTPs.  Note the word AFFECTION.  He has to know that you arent getting affection from it.  He has to channel it in a less hurtful way.
1	Can you give any specifics or what they are doing that is annoying you?
1	There's literally zero useful information in this post. We don't know what he is doing, just that you find it annoying...\n\nHow are we supposed to explain it if we don't even know what you're asking about ? Lol, I think the communication problem maybe isn't his "complexity"...\n\n
7	He must be very ignorant for he answers every question he is asked.” – Voltaire	
5	Keep in mind he was a philosopher-mercenary who served under absolutist king, praised Catherine in spite of the all atrocities , dissed masonry all life long just to join them
2	Doesn't make much sense. Are knowledgeable people supposed to ponder all questions ? Isn't knowlexge having answers anyway ? Not all of them, but answers nonetheless... And if you have actually an answer, even if general, why not just give it ?\n\nReal lesson here is that appearing thoughtful probably is more important than actually being thoughtful if you want to impress people... So throwing a bit here and here of fake pondering may be useful. (Of course, Voltaire is going against the common idea that having all answer mean knowledge, ironically, but still. Some people will look down on you precisely for knowing more than they do),\n

3	ur on the internet, u steal a ton of books. who can even count 
2	I will have to count but the ratio isn’t to good after stealing all those books from my school library 
2	Interesting, there’s a lot of contrast here. A lot of people saying they’ve read a lot and own very little, and a lot of others saying that they haven’t read much but own a lot.\n\nI’m personally in the latter category; I own a ton of books but haven’t gotten around to reading many of them. I know that there are a lot of different (and perhaps more convenient) ways to get information nowadays, but I love collecting and owning books. I’m super lazy about ever taking the time to read enough though.\n\nI’m not sure the exact amount of books I own vs. books I’ve read because I’m at college and a lot of my books are at my house, but the amount I own is definitely much higher. 
2	I read something like 150-200 fiction books last year. And I bought probably around the same number. \n\nIn my life history, I've read WAY more fiction books than I have bought. \n\nSelf help and non-fiction: I do one of two things. I either read the parts of the book that I want to know or understand, or I don't read it at all. So, of the maybe 30 non-fiction, self help, type books that I bought last year, I've partially read maybe 10 or 15 of them.\n\nSo when it comes to entertainment I read everything and anything.\n\nWhen it comes to knowledge and learning: I usually shift my interests or focus to something new before I get through the book. And I only start it at all if I haven't become interested in something new entirely before I get to it.

1	Meaning of life!!	Hi,\nI know it is getting so cliche these days talking about meaning of life, but I have a psychoanalyst who is trying to tell me life is just these little things like love, sex, job, and death at the end. I was so engaged in finding the meaning of life which led me to articulate and plan the goal of working and advocating anti-aging research and AGI to finally understand what is the meaning of life, and now it is all breaking AGAIN( I am so tired of that process). But the frightening part for me is, what if there is none, and what if I am choosing the wrong path( maybe spirituality and art would be the answer). Anyway, what I wanted to ask you is this:\nIt seems to me that whatever it is this hive mind of human collective intelligence, it is evolving, because nobody wants to live in the misery of the past, so that could be a place to start. We can say that we are going to somewhere which might be deeply embedded into our collective unconscious for reaching to a final point or there is no final point and we are going to evolve like that forever until everything dies. But there are several sub-final points which are extremely exciting that worth as much as the final point from where I am standing today. For example, the point in which we will solve death, the point in which we will eradicate material scarcity, the point in which maybe I won’t care anymore about the damn meaning of life because maybe all of it is created by the sufferings that we go through. So I think it worth it to try to reach to those points to see. But I agree with him that I need to satisfy my material needs right now because they are biologically necessary and I am a biological creature who wants to reach there, so I need to maintain it.\nOne question might be, what if these points are limitless and you will go on and on. I think it is interesting enough to see these points, and if they are limitless let it be. \nWhat is it that my brain is missing, because that’s complete insane, and everybody is mocking and running away from me? I am extremely tired of this process of finding meaning  like a 90 years old. I sometimes think it might be some sort of brain damage or trauma that my brain doesn’t see some part of the equation.\nHelp me to get out of this.\n

Most people read right past them for the same reason that you make them. And they notice, most people understand what you meant and move on. Do  you judge people for their typos?

5	Trying to apply process and structure to something that lives organically is probably the most counter intuitive way of approach but I guess here we go, lets give it a try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Observe and collect data before formulating approach into social situations.\n2. Practice, Practice, Practice -- come up with ways to handle certain cookie cutter social situations and practice them with a friend or in the mirror : this would help you from freezing up when people ask you how you are or whatever much like prepping for a job interview.\n3. Always have an out prepared -- things are getting awk and you don't wanna be there anymore so you gotta pull your outtie; is your mom calling or your dog needs to go to the vet? Who cares!\n4. Devalue any and all social interaction: Its your job now, not something you enjoy doing. You HAVE to do it meaning it's now meaningless and sucks yo soul outta your husk-less body. Find solace in the fact that you have to put up with 4 more hours of this in your day and you can crawl home and hide in your hermit cave to recharge.\n\nHow'd I do??

1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;

14	I used to think I was mature for my age when I was a teenager, but now I feel like a clueless child in my early twenties.	When I was a teenager from age 13-18, I thought I was a mature and sensible young man;  I was arrogant, vain, and thought highly of myself because to me my peers were clueless and superficial with their focus on things like relationships, partying, popularity and all that middle/high school drama. I thought I was one of the few sensible ones out there who cared about "important things" like education and "morality" while others were too busy role playing what they thought as "adult-like". However, I was a loud, nerdy, and cringy kid who was not self aware enough to see I was just as immature and superficial as those I had judged. I still cringe over my teenage years at times because now I realize I was just like everyone else, and I was probably too stupid and clueless to see the truth. \n\nNow I'm 23, and many of the people I deemed to be immature back then are actually further than me in life; some are married with children of thier own; some found their passion and is making the most out of their lives; some already made progress in their careers that they are entirely independent and still climbing. I'm currently working for a mindless minimum wage job with an  "useless" college degree while still not knowing where to go in life. I have seen people who are younger than me more mature; I have seen people who are "dumber" than me more competent. Now I feel like a clueless child in a biologically adult body who has no idea what to do with his life.
9	It gets worse. Look around at all the teenagers who who know everything. Must be tough knowing that you are not yet 20 but have nothing more to learn in life. It usually is college that shatters that illusion, and it can be devastating. We can get feeling lost with no instructions to find ourselves. My theory is that we process our emotions through our brains, so we do not develop emotional intelligence as quickly as some others. That can make it appear that others are far ahead of us, when we are more developed in some intellectual ways. But when the floor collapses, that does not seem so important any more.\n\nThe good news is that we have the capacity to develop emotional intelligence. It takes effort and risk, and people find it at different times. Along the way, some of us realize that we are in fact emotional, in fact as emotional as anyone else. We do not lack for feelings. Once we make peace with that, we can establish a balance between mind and emotion.\n\nIn the right circumstances, that can result in a strong and well balanced person. I fought it every step of the way because I refused to accept my emotions. I am 54 now and in the last year have reached peace and contentment. Wish it had come earlier, but not sure that it was possible.\n\nI think that the key to surviving is to remember that you are OK. INTPs are oddly judgmental. We intellectually think that things are right or wrong, and when we deem something wrong, we tend to reject it outright. So instead of seeing your situation for what it is, you see others succeeding and decide that you failed. You have not failed. Others still marvel at the clarity and crispness of your thinking and may well think that you are ahead of them. The strengths that you have developed are strengths.\n\nInstead of seeing your current situation as a failure, see it as as new frontier for learning. Learn not to judge and just experience and observe things as they come. Do not cling to your former conclusions about how things are.\n\nMy own journey was greatly aided by my INFJ wife. We met when I was 20, and I learned so much from her. Through her, I learned to be present in conversations and to see people as full human beings. I learned to turn off all my thoughts and judgments and just participate. I discovered that everyone has something to teach me and a fascinating life story, if only I would find them. I think that the 20s are a great time to revise our thinking about other people in general and to stop thinking of them as boring, irrelevant or stupid.\n\nMy wife and I were friends before we were lovers, and I sometimes cringe when I see people here trying to "date." They seem to treat dating as the goal without much consideration about their partner except for looks and meeting their needs. Without a basis in friendship, the relationship has nowhere to go when the honeymoon is over. My wife and I have been married 31 years, and more than anything, we are best friends. I still grab her when she comes to bed, but it is familiar, not novel.\n\nNot sure if any of this answers your post. It is my experience, not a road map for anyone else. Use what helps and disregard the rest.
1	Why the fuck do I relate to this?!?\n\nWell, I’m 17 but I’ve come to the same conclusion as yourself and I’m kind of wondering why it’s happening.\n\nI guess I’ll let life sort itself out.\nComparing myself to others is the equivalent to comparing different fruits to one another; just because one looks better or taste better doesn’t mean the next person views it that way.
1	Sounds like my experience at that age. I would suggest not comparing yourself to others unless if motivates you to pursue your own interests. 
1	I find that your experiences and thoughts are very similar to mine. I felt somewhat compelled to share my experiences here. This might not be important but I lived most of my life in Asia before I moved to the US for college.\n\n I was born in an Asian family that sees grades and results as an indicator of future success. Before high school, I was considered the 'bright' kid who does well academically. More often than not, I was placed at the top 10% of my cohort and I did so with seemingly less effort than others. I eventually learned that having an easy life without struggles and still getting positive feedback from others is extremely harmful to a kid because, then, I have not learned how to put in the work to get what I deserve. Now that I'm surrounded with people that works hard and are as intelligent or even more so than me, I felt, for the first time, challenged as I was thrown to the bottom of the 'society'. I felt that they are achieving all sort of different things that I could only thought about. \n\nI have also noticed, as I'm sure many of us did, that there is a clear distinction between the people of the  'nerd' group and the 'popular' group in any level of school. I used to feel that I'm better than them because I wasn't interested in, what I call, 'superficial' goals of partying and having 'nonsensical' fun that the 'popular' group seems to gravitate towards. However, have you ever thought that the 'popular' group actually felt that way towards our goals too? My sacrifice of  forming stronger relationships with peers in exchange for academic results is also completely ridiculous to them. Now I lack the necessary social skills and character to interact with mature adults of my age because I lack the experiences I could potentially have if I tried to socialize more. \n\nMy only consolation is that I still have time before I graduate to change but that is a struggle I have to face every day.  Honestly, we all have two choices to either wallow in self-pity and bitterness or try and change for the better. Let go of your delusional expectations of what you should have done and what you think others have expected of you. Instead, focus on what you could do better the next day. \n\nWell, it's somewhat therapeutic writing this. I guess it's a note to myself too. \n
1	You're looking at what they "have" over you, but what do you have over them? \n\nYOU ARE FREE.\n\nYou're not tied down by marriage or kids at such a young age. You're not tied to a job you hate because you have a family or lifestyle to support. You have the opportunity to become you, any you you want. And I guarantee it'll be 100 times more interesting than following the path of those "successful" people you mention.\n\nThe worse thing you can ever do is to compare yourself to other people, especially the ones who are just mindlessly running the track that was set for them by society. You don't have to let them dictate what success is. You decide what it is, and then you chase after it like it's gold.
1	I relate. I tried so hard to be sensible middle and highschool, that i didn't make any mistakes, therefore didn't learn anything, and so now im clueless 
1	Normies are soooo great at totally avoiding areas/topics where they fail badly, you will never know . Se or Fe can do this I guess. Do you flip between "Normies (as a group maybe) are retarded vs Normies (individual) are so better than me" a lot?
0	Anyone well versed in Jungian perception functions: wtf is going on here	Okay so I've been trying to get a hang of Ni here and it's throwing me for a loop. In fact all of the perceptions are, are despite knowing the general difference between introverted and extraverted functions.\n\nTe is : energy on jupiter is 99.8, energy on earth is 50, and energy on mars is 12\n\nTi is: E=mc2\n\nTi is unprovable(as there could always be another element of E that we don't know yet). Te can briefly utilize Ti equations to seek out data points that it needs once they are well established, but it would not codify it into the psyche and its natural tendency is to measure the gravity in each individual scenario.\n\nSimilarly Ne can come up with association data points(tree in this scenario) : roots, water, leaf, trunk, wood.\n\nNi comes up with an association equation that could explain all possible associations that can arise from the object of tree.\n\nI believe myself to be an INTP, so I'm gonna tentatively say I use Ne, and I'm gonna try to briefly assume an Ni equation had a certain form for say...steel. Now if the Ni equation for steel is identical to...clay, then would not all possible associations within clay be able to be projected onto steel? If I have played with clay a lot before then I might have a lot of Ne data points of association to work with I.e. the water you dip clay into to soften it is like the furnace you put steel in to make it malleable. The hand you use to mold clay into its shape is equal to the hammer that you hit steel with.\n\nAnother example: Introverted functions vs extraverted functions in a race are like a car that takes wrong directions versus a motorcycle. The car takes longer to get up to speed, but once it gets going it goes much faster than the motorcycle. The car happens to take wrong turns though every now and then. Since this is an equivalent to the introverted vs extraverted functions we can also draw parallels from the race context such as "when the car takes a wrong turn the crowd is likely to label then dumb or laugh at them." It's just projecting data points in the context of a race back on data points within the experience of the introverted dominant function user.\n\nThis seems like Ne utilizing Ni to find more data points though. My ne is using steel=clay to find associations that must exist with steel because I am more familiar with clay and have used it before. I just say "since Ni=Ni, then all of the Ne in clay must also exist within steel." Of course Ne would never keep steel=clay in their mental schema as a result of not knowing what they don't know. They would think that eventually there might arise an association that makes the two differ, so Ne would only briefly utilize Ni in the search for more data points.\n\nIf Ni does not lead back into the object, like Ti who after knowing E=MC2 simply uses the equation until it doesn't work and then finds why it didnt work, then Ni must be using Ni equations not to draw parallels between objects and their contexts but as interactions between objects themselves.\n\nHow does that work though??
1	Discussion: extension of Boolean algebraic functions into higher dimensions	[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqBWr-1H8yD4pkU-68vl\_eTCLADJYgaQrABulTnL3sY/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqBWr-1H8yD4pkU-68vl_eTCLADJYgaQrABulTnL3sY/edit)\n\nthis should explain where I'm going.

0	need help	so i am intp . i helped a female classmate about websites design and now she is like ask me some thing in return so what should i ask ??\ni am not into this girl\nshe has brozoned me\nany suggestions plz help 
1	It sounds like you are not keen to advance a relationship. Perhaps if you asked her to show you her website and explain why she made it the way she did, that would keep things within the bounds of what you gave her. You could plausibly say that you are curious what people do with your help.
1	ur asking us what you like?  \nyou really need to learn who you are and what you want. plus being able to assess your context and what you can demand from it   \nthird - negotiation skills.   \n\nso as a projection, id figure out if she has access to meat, and have her give me a fresh lamb or something.  \nif theres nothing material i can get from her   \nid ask her to do something dificult for her own good, but not too dificult. try doing a 5 minute cold shower   ,  \nor read aristotle and come up with a discussion topic   \n) 
149	Mmm	
17	- everyone laughs at my answer\n- own it and try to be even funnier, when appropriate.
22	soft and shapeless indeed
36	The worst part is that you *did* get it right, but the class couldn't follow your logic and the teacher was mildly annoyed at you bringing up parts of the material that they haven't covered yet so they don't bother to stop the other students from making fun of you. And then by the time everybody catches up, they forgot about what you said but not that they laughed at you for being "wrong" about something.
7	Idk about that one. 
9	Solution: have more right answers.\n\nNot a solution: Being afraid of showing what you know, or learning what you don't.\n\nLaughter is just noise. It can't really hurt you, and none of the people in that room are relevant to your education except the teacher. So fuck them. If your answer is right, even if it's laughed at, defend it until you're proved wrong. If it was wrong and you're laughed at, well you were wrong- ridicule of silly answers isn't surprising, listen up and learn the right answer, then be right next time.\n\nIf you use school for what it's value is- learning, when you leave they may be laughing at you, but when you excel using what you learned later, you will have the last laugh.\n\nYour box can be armor for battles, or your hidden lair where you develop your powers, it doesn't have to a shelter to hide in. Having that box, that place where they can't touch us inside our heads, is our secret superpower.\n\nUse it. 
6	Are we really smiling in that box?
2	What's worse when you have the right answer, get picked to answer but then you forget how to speak?
1	I love it!
1	this is why i never raise my hand no matter how sure i am that i know the answer
2	How far does your indecision go?	Being that we tend to be into many different subjects and have a hard time choosing a profession, do you feel like there's also a dichotomous thread that runs through all your choices? Not necessarily that you experience one thing but would prefer the opposite, but rather that you prefer to experience both rather equally and simultaneously. As if you were created with indecision as a feature, not a bug (despite wanting it to actually be a bug). \n\nFor me personally, and as a nomad, the dichotomy is between: tropical vs non-tropical places/people, city living vs country living, outer world vs inner world activities. And in terms of actually preferring the opposite: getting 'good' opportunities in areas, and with people, I don't want vs those I do want. 
2	Yeah man, that's they fun/frustrating part about life. There's so much fun shit to do and so little time. In my opinion though there are way more than two threads running through my choices. I have to prioritize by asking myself "What would I regret NOT doing as I lay dying?". That kills my urge to beat RE2 with just a knife real quick.
1	I'm not sure. 
1	same same, i recently decided to not get a degree, not sure if it's a good idea but i do art and there's too many styles out there and i do all of them literally because i don't want to choose, lol, but i don't rly got the time either, i really need to focus on 1 thing
2	So I've only met one confirmed INTP irl and she used to tell me she heavily related to Salad Fingers as far as her relation to reality. Metaphorically, of course. Thoughts on this?	For those of you who've seen Salad Fingers, anyways. 
5	I haven't watched Salad Fingers in eons.
6	I get why. Loneliness and the inability to vocalise it is like a staple of the series. I can totally relate to the concept of the series, but I have a knee jerk reaction to it because of the creepy unsettling setting and story.  
4	She has problems, probably deep rooted issues. At least that's what my take is on it if you can relate your reality to salad fingers.
2	Metaphorically, somewhat in terms of the theme of isolationism and social anxiety. But if she thinks that her "reality" then she probably needs a therapist.
1	i read on idr labs that infjs...?	i read on idr labs that theoreticaly infjs would make the best pickup artists.\n\nwhat would the logic of this be, why infj?, and how would there cognitive functions work together to be a good pickup artist?
3	They exist in between the rift of logic vs emotions so they have the easiest time relating to both types of people. They are some of the most balanced people to begin with and it would be easy to see why they could potentially make a good pick up artist.
2	They're overrrated, just like pick up artists are. They are great in theory ..
17	INTP and break up	Hi, I was cheated on by my newly wed wife. I try to move on, but I am lost and alone. I don't have the looks to be sure that somebody else will love me and my character doesn't help either. Being alone is something I charge my batteries with, but now the loneliness is killing me.\n\nIs there anything I can do or am I doomed?
11	I recconend Rollo Tomassi.  It sounds like you are chronically unaware of your enviornmdnt when it comes to women\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8eLDzfH6YfZRDbDuMsNWiA\n\nI suggest getting a lawyer and getting the marriage annuled before she can sink her fangs in for almony.
6	Go out and join social groups. Work on yourself to attract better people and have more to offer. Get out there and live and eventually it'll be better. It may not all go away but it'll be better because you'll be better.
4	Sorry to hear that brother. I have no practical advice but wish you well. 
3	The best thing you can do is not think that way about yourself. You HAVE to love yourself. It's the only right thing to do. Do what you must to love yourself more and find value in yourself. Get good at something, work on your looks, chase fun opportunities and situations, whatever. Valuing yourself as a person and as an individual, I believe, is the key to a good life. If you really love yourself, you don't NEED other people to fulfill or "complete" you. This will eventually, ironically, attract people to you. It'll make you take the right decisions for yourself, because you know what's important to you and you know that you're the most important person in your life. Although it may be harsh, I kinda like the expression "If you don't love yourself, why would other people?". \n\nI also like the classic thing with thinking of your inner voice as a friend. If you had a friend saying "You're ugly and useless." would you keep being friends with that person? And psychologically, if you had such a friend, who kept saying that to you every day, you'd start to believe it. No matter who you were and how you looked. So treat yourself well. Treat yourself like the best friend you could think of ever having. Who knows, maybe it'll even make you a better friend to others.\n\nAnd I'm hoping I'm not overstepping a boundary here, but your wife is trash, doing something like this. Get away from this person as fast as you can and don't look back. She doesn't deserve your thoughts.\n\nEdit: Oh and if you have friends or family, reach out to them. You're not alone because you have one less person in your life. If you don't have friends, find some through your interests/hobbies.
2	Regarding moving on, you cited the main problem as "your looks."\n\nYou are definitely doomed if you are obsessed with that.  If you take care of yourself, then any weird appearances will serve as an automatic filter to weed out shallow women.  Unless you want a shallow partner.\n\n\nAnd look into what led to you committing to a woman who wasn't interested in committing to you?
1	I read your comment wrong. Have you considered taking a closer look at the type of women you find yourself infatuated with? Consider looking for some relevant directly/indirectly support group- preferably one that is free.
1	 \nYou talked about hoping she liked you. \n\nWhat were the goals of your marriage?  Maybe you would be more interested in getting a pet? \n\n
82	Major life hack by Jet Li	
7	There's one person in particular (an ESFP) that I've learned to do this with.  \n"Is this the hill you want to die on?" has had to become my mantra of sorts.
6	Or just ask them a question so that they contradict themselves and are stuck in their own faulty logic. 
1	Haha this is funny. But have you ever seen someone do that to you?  The gall!
1	Aren't we victims of that trick more often than not, though ?\n\nLike, every time you argue with an F type about something serious, and you are winning, this will come up. Type like INFJ with Ti third will try a "fighting retreat" of sort (Ex : shitty one liner to get the last word then run away) so that honor is safe, but still (I guess other T tertiary have similar tactics). \n\nT types, regardless of Te vs Ti are too stubborn for that, tho. \n\nAt least, for debates. If the discussion is in the F domain, then the role are reversed
1	that's something my sister also came up with, and she's 6 years my junior.\n\nThis post just reminded me of her advice.
1	I thought I was the only one who did that lol
1	B-but they never stop. It's like they take your nodding as something that requires further elaboration or yet another absurd showcasing that connects with something that has no relevance to the main argument. The idiocy has no breaks and the train goes on forever!

12	What kind of people would romantically like an INTP?	Things didn't go well for me in Valentine's and I'm realizing that I'm not likable, social, or interesting enough to get someone else to like me. Throw in poor self esteem, a lack of development of the typical strengths of INTP, way too many weaknesses, and it's a recipe for struggle. \n\nIt also brings up the internal conflict: am I supposed to change who I am so I'm liked better (even if it means I'm forcing myself to be something I'm not), or am I just improving myself to be more genuine?\n\nWhat kind of people would be interested in INTPs? And how should I change/improve myself to make things work? 
21	People aren't interested in the fact that you are INTP; people are interested in YOU. You need to buff up that self confidence and believe that there are people out there who like you for who you are. Changing yourself to fit in just makes you a chameleon. Be who you are comfortable being and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Eventually, you will attract someone who is into you for being you not who you fake being.
11	The comments about improving yourself are spot on. \n\nHere is the dark side of the truth of your question though:\nINTPs that are competent, functional, confident ... They end up also being successful at whatever they do. In addition to attracting people you have in mind right now, this "package" will attract people who look to use "romance" as a means of linking themselves to you, then ride you through life. Using you.\n\nAnd I suspect that you will attract this type sooner than you will attract the "good" type.\n\nThey will tend to be people who use emotional manipulation, because it is what we are weak against, often blind to.\n\nBe aware.
3	Disclaimer: I just woke up so I hope this is coherent and thought out.\n\nYou improve yourself for your own benefit, not for others. You go out and do social things so you can feel better equipped at doing social things and figure out what style of socializing is best for you. You work on your self esteem so you feel more comfortable being yourself unapologetically. You figure out how to be. You figure out your likes and dislikes and who you are as a person so that you can live your life how you want it as much as possible.\n\nAs you become more and more of a self assured person, people will react to you more (positively and negatively). You'll be a fully realized, three-dimensional character in the lives of the people you meet. There will be people who want you to continue having you in their life as you progress and you'll be better and happier for it.\n\nNot much of this happens to those who decide to put likeability over personality though. You need to get out your comfort zone with an openness and a willingness to learn how you can fit in each experience. And if you realise you can't or don't want to fit then just do what you think is best and people will adjust.
3	INFPs
2	> likable, social, or interesting enough \n\n* Likable doesn't mean much.\n* Social isn't hard to improve on. Just show up. 80% of success is showing up is especially true for us. \n* Interesting is arguable. Some will find us just that when we aren't doing anything. Just our sheer weirdness/idiosyncrasies.\n\nYou will have to define what you think people find "likable" or "interesting". I don't know what will come up, but I'm pretty sure it isn't something that hard to attain.\n\n> am I supposed to change who I am so I'm liked better (even if it means I'm forcing myself to be something I'm not), or am I just improving myself to be more genuine?\n\nBoth, I guess. Specializing in what interests you, but getting goid at presenting it to the group. You won't please everyone, anyway, and people like people who can at least stand for themselves (if you can't help but become fake, what are you? Sure, there are popular fake people out here, but still.)\n\nWe're unconventional anyway. Might as well bank on it \n\n> What kind of people would be interested in INTPs?\n\nAre you asking to fit their needs ? That's desperate.\n\n> And how should I change/improve myself to make things work?\n\nSe. Work on being present. Work on observing stuff. Work on awareness.\n\nSe is our PolR blindspots and the cause of lots of our problem. Say, we blame our bad Fe often for not reading the mood/offending people, but it does fine. the real problem is when you're not paying attention, so you don't get the info in body language, facial expressions, etc, that let you reads the mood.\n\nCan't be successful or social if you're not here.
2	Okay look. I’m an INFP dating an INTP.\n\nHere’s what I think. Before even wondering or worrying about what kind of person would like you, think what kind of person you WANT to be. You say you have weaknesses. Are they fixable? Can you better yourself? Then do it, if you want, but do it for you!! Not so someone will like you.\n\nBut to answer your question, I’ll tell you why I like my INTP.\n\nThe dude is so typically an INTP, doesn’t give you the time of day if you’re not competent or seem like an idiot. Straight faced, knows like everything there is to know about everything, likes to plays devils advocate on the simplest things, points out  things about me I wish he wouldn’t (even though he’s just being honest not mean), and we literally wouldn’t talk for a week if I didn’t text him first all the time.\n\nWow he sounds terrible.\n\nBut I’ll tell you what. You’ll never meet a more brilliant person. His mind and thought process are like nothing I’ve ever encountered. The way he lights up when he talks about computer parts makes my heart warm. And he’s honest. I never have to wonder what he really thinks, he doesn’t lie. He doesn’t feel like he needs to, even for me and I love it. Plus, once INTPs trust you, they love so deeply and wow that shit is the best.\n\nSo yeah, INTPs might not fit the “perfect bf” mold but who tf cares?? I for one appreciate everything that’s different about him. One day, when you are confident in yourself and like who you are (or maybe not), someone will appreciate all of who you are. Trust me, people like you are just hard to find lol
1	Leaving some food for thought for you. Ask yourself:\n\nWhy do you want people to be romantically interested in you? Do you really want that?\nOr are you just hopping onto an unreflected bandwagon?\nDo you want to be romantically interested in others?\nWhy? Why not? What makes someone interesting for you? Do you offer the same quality? Do you think it‘s objectively a thing to strive for? How about trying to acquire it yourself?\nWhat would you need to be like in order for you to date yourself?\nAt your age, why would you push yourself towards a relationship? What are you looking for?\nIs that something you really need someone else to provide or can you work that out yourself eventually? Or is it something you really need a relationship for? What‘s the endgame?\nDo you think your concept of relationships is realistic? Why does it bother you to not date? What do you base your self worth around? Why? Are there other options? \n\n\n
1	go out and use that ESFJ in you and use Fe
1	I had the saaaaame problem. (F INTP, 27)\n\nFinally a strong, firm, silly, fun, serious, goofy, adorable, competent, juvenile, capable man put up with me long enough to love me. He won't take the tests, but I'm pretty sure he's either ESTP or ESTJ, possibly on the line.\n\nHe's often exasperated with the aspects of my mind that he doesn't understand, but we do have a lot of deep conversations together, and he has helped me learn to interact better with people.\n\nI'd say we've been very good for each other. 
1	I just gave up on women tbh OP.  You gotta weigh the pros and cons.
2	Vidyagames	What kind of videogames do you play?\n\nI am a fan of JRPGs and God games. I do reallt loke Overwatch though, although I’m not very good at it.\n\nMy favorite game that I am currently playing is Nier Automata, but I’ve putting it off as I haven’t been in the mood for it lately, or just games in general. I like to watch videos on YouTube abkut gaming, but I don’t really play videogames much anymore these days. \n\nWhat about you?
6	Referring to video games as “vidya” makes me irrationally angry 
2	My main games right now are Black Desert Online and probably Apex. I used to play a lot of Magic the Gathering Online (Paper also) and I got up to low diamond in Overwatch on XBox.
2	Currently playing Kerbal Space Program and XCOM 2. Though if I had to pick an all time favorite it would probably be the Dragon Age series.
2	I love games where you can make things like Minecraft (jam packed with mods), Factorio, civ 5, Prison Architect, Cities Skylines.\n\nI got Rainbow Six Siege during the Christmas 2017 sale and fell in love with it, but I don't really like many other multiplayer shooters.\n\nI'd recommend Portal 1 & 2 and Q.U.B.E. as fun puzzle games
1	EUIV and CK2 but I haven't played in awhile due to school. 
1	I like playing video games it's just that I have a lot of school work and I am kinda bad at managing my time, so I do not really have as much time as I would like to video games, but I am working on fixing time management issues.
1	I like strategies games like Fire emblem or Zelda and animal crossing when I just want to relax I like portable systems so I only ever played Nintendo games. :) I really like the first party games and I really never been interested in Play station or Xbox my sister has a play station and my brother has an Xbox so I have played games on there but they tend to go for realistic Graphics and i prefer to have a game with a unique art style.  Persona is great thought and killing random people on GTA is a sort of therapy!

1	Tes Oblivion, Skyrim and Morrowind.\n\nStardew Valley, The sims 3 & 4, Civilization IV.\n\nSometimes I go back to Minecraft but I get bored quickly.\n\nI also played League of Cance- Legends, but it's TOO competitive and toxic, and tbh I'm not too good at it.
1	I’ve been on a kick of The Sims 3, Age of Empires, — a lot of strategy games, looking for suggestions like AOE by the way.\n\nOn console I’ve been addicted to red dead redemption 2, I’ve become obsessed with Wild West history and have gone onto buy books and binge movies like rdr2. \n\nAfter all is said and done and I beat rdr2, I’ll go through a period where I don’t even touch my ps4 for months and you wouldn’t think I am an avid gamer
1	idle games. I just want to get those numbers up for easy dopamine 
1	Alligators freeze in swamp with noses above ice	
2	Just like INTPs at parties.
2	this just puts the quote from Archer in a whole new light for me.\n\nonly thing those things need are opposable thumbs and a bit more iq, and we're fucked.
71	INTP trying to actually do anything	
13	The way i think is actually so fucked up. My brain must be a mess. I am so fucking irresponsible. It's insane. It is like a disease yet at the same time its my fault. The worst thing is i cant stop complaining about it. I think it's not ok. It's bad. Fuck. Can't be happening. Ok. On count of 3 i get up. 1 2 3 
3	I don't know what that is but I'm considering going back to bed
7	I only have this when I'm unmotivated and bothered.\n\nOnce I want something I do it and even improve it. Maybe a walk could help to clear out your mind?
17	Loneliness as seen from INTP perspective	
24	It's a fucking Kurzgesagt video, how is this an INTP perspective ? It's meant for everyone, and they are a team, anyway.\n\nHaving to slap that "INTP" on it just because you related to it just showcases that you didn't research this typology stuff enough...
3	Hmmm....What if you've gotten to a point where you only feel good alone? Is that still destructive to your health? I require such little interaction.... in fact it would be my paradise if i could earn income in a role where I hardly ever have to deal with another person. People stress me the fuck out and I've always felt it was the opposite... that being around others was harmful. 
1	Thought this vid might help some of you struggling with loneliness, or at least understand what it is and why its happening. Knowing is half the battle!

1	Someone who I was starting to like betrayed me yesterday, and I’m pretty sure I went through that whole cycle.  
1	So this social pain + ghosting explains why I’m still so fucked up :(

2	My Friends are Friends with Everyone	My friends are few and far between, but the ones I love spending the most time with are the ones that are friends with everyone, considering how extraverted and charismatic they are (pretty much ENFPs and ESTPs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is good sometimes because it allows me to make other friends by association.\n\n\n\nBut I don't want to become too dependent on these type of savior extraverted types who happily adopt me....when I don't have someone as a conduit and I'm meeting someone else for the very first time, it may take me YEARS to open up.\n\nEdit: I become extraverted when with my extraverted friends\n\nAnyone relate
3	Yup, this has been pretty much all my friends.
1	No my friends are all fairly reclusive 
1	Same here. All my friends are super social and have a ton of friends. It’s weird. I kind of think they all just adopted me because they know I have a good heart but I’m shy af
1	You just riding their wave. Getting adopted by extroverted types is nice but it will also make you lazy af about your own relationships. There's pros and cons to having/not having extroverted friends. 
1	Wow, I cant get along with Es 
8	Would anyone else here be upset if God really existed?	I grew up with a large religious family with several pastors as either parents or uncles/aunts. 3x/week church life until I was 14. Grew to hate why religion appears as an emotional crutch more than a positive framework to flow with life. As much as I like imagining unknown answers, I see a myriad of things that make religion despicable to me. Not writing that all out lol.\n\nAnyway five years ago my father (former pastor-turned-"backslider") told me an analogy. He said this:\n\n"Take for instance this ant right here (in the backyard lawn). This ant has its entire day's worth of work ahead of it - getting from this point here, all the way to the front and back with something. It's going to do its job as hard as it can, and won't ever notice your existence. Unless you step on or around it, and then it'll think '*Oh my God! What is this grand thing above me?'.* It'll see your size at that moment, but might never notice you outside of that moment. Tell me why it can't be that way with God..."  I had to think. And I still do.\n\nAside from whoever picks to share shitty ant science, I imagine this may be discussed here often.  Who here left room to think how they'd feel if they died and saw God?  I would be extremely embarrassed to see him go "*Hey man, yeah. I've been here forever and you didn't see it. Took a long time to conclude it, but still, you chose wrong so hell it is,* u/thanks_bruh *. Lo siento.*"
16	If you're sentenced to eternal torment for being a good person but not making the right social gestures, or whatever being "saved" means, then it's too late - you're already a pawn on the chessboard of a sadistic deity. What kind of God does that? Or requires constant worship? You'd better hope the God of the Bible does not exist, because he's a sadistic narcissist. 
7	I still hold the possibility that there is a god that most religions are describing in their own perspective. I don't however think the God of the Bible would be anything like the God up above. God in the Bible is possessive, quick to anger, and authoritative and I just can't see those traits being real for a being who is so above us that our ways of living basically does not effect him.\n\nI would be surprised but also fine because I lead a life trying to help those I can. I lived in a way as not to deliberately harm for the most part and I kept an open mind for a higher power even though I don't like religion in general (especially Christianity). If people got into heaven out of belief and not out of being a good person because it's just good to do I don't think heaven would be so nice anyway.\n\nAlso I don't really believe in hell but that's another thing.
3	Yeah, \n\n\nthat would mean innocent people are suffering for a reason, which is worse than no reason.
9	Religions represent truth and truth is a lifelong pursuit.  Following any form of faith is not as linear as many think. Being a follower of God is not as simple as deciding to believe in a deity and then moving on to live the rest of your life.\n\nIf a single person's/church's awkward take on faith can ruin your faith, chances are you are not following God, but dogma. Someone who is familiar with the intuitive experience that we call Holy Spirit, Tao, Shakti, and so on, knows that all religious dogmas are but paths to the same universal force that is greater than the conceptual boundaries of any particular religion.\n\nEither you see God in everything or you don't see god in anything. A man of the former quality understands that no matter who you are or what you believe in, the capability to experience God lies within us everyone. It's up to no one else but you whether or not you choose to open up to this presence. \n\n\n
6	in short, no. i already believe in god so i'm not upset. \n\nbut i don't think whoever is skeptical of god's existence would go straight to hell. it's actually better if you keep questioning so your faith isn't in vain. 
3	The existence of a god being proven or disproved makes little to no difference to me.\n\nHowever, people expecting me to *worship* the aforementioned god just because it exists, well I have a problem there.
3	Not sure. At first glance, I wouldn't think I would care, why would I? Even if this all-powerful being created me, I'm still my own person, who's in charge of my own life. All he did was create me, the people I co-exist with, the world I live on, and the animals I eat. It's not like he would defy logic either, nothing does, and if he does exist it would have to be in a very scientific way, like he's a similar to a highly evolved version of us with an EXTREMELY long lifespan and maybe not creating planets out of thin air, but understanding the science behind universe creation enough himself to make it happen through science, not bullshit. The part that I am concerned about is Heaven.  A perfect paradise where I can live (Well not "live", but afterlive, I guess?) Forever, and not be influenced by the toxicity of the world I currently live in, what's not there to love. This might be most people's thoughts, but as for me, that's not the case. A thought came to me not long ago which was simply: "Would I enjoy an afterlife?". As INTPs we are often troubled by a constant stream of thought, and while we love to think, the inability to shut our minds up, can sometimes make it hard to stay safe, figuratively speaking of course. I always thought of death as a mercy since I know, at some point, I'm gonna get bored with life, I've already started going down that path for a couple of years and I'm only about 20. But more importantly, it means my conciousness will finally end. However, if there is an afterlife, that means my conciousness will continue for eternity, and that sounds like torture to me, not mercy. FUCK THIS IS A LONG POST! Kudos to anyone who read completely through it.
3	I'd be only interested in what God could do for me/ offer me. As a higher being I wouldn't really be sure what he would need from us lowly humans but if he was offering something I'd be willing to trade. Want me to worship ya? Well, what you gonna give me in return God?
2	I didn't bother to read everything but I think I would be the happiest person if they exist. I would only need  answers on how they got there, where they born, if so who were the parents, are they born with powers (if so what's the science behind their powers, do they have to follow physics and biology like us), CAN THEY READ MINDS. Fuck! I hope they don't exist, I will be slaughtered.
2	I would be upset. He/She/it would have some major explaining to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStephen Fry expressed this far more eloquently than I ever could:\n\n(*Asked what he would say if he was confronted by God at the pearly gates of heaven):* “I’d say, bone cancer in children? What’s that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world to which there is such misery that is not our fault. It’s not right, it’s utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world that is so full of injustice and pain. That’s what I would say. ”\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-suvkwNYSQo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-suvkwNYSQo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus fact: Stephen Fry was investigated by the Irish police for these statements. Make of that what you will.
2	Have you been to r/exchristian? It's a good community of fellow former believers. 
3	I'm confident in a higher power. ... Insert math joke here.\n\nI'm content to call it "God". I see too much that has no clear explanation. I'm also confident that the major religions are all based around the same thing, and only really differ with how humanity has tried to interpret the same thing, and true to any collection of humans, everyone has a different perspective. And there will always be people looking to exploit others based on their beliefs. Pretty much all versions, iterations, twists, cults, and dogmas of the major religions seem* to function as a result of these two facts.\n\nI hate religion as a consequence. \n\nBut faith in a guiding hand? Faith in a power, energy, or force that set the laws of the universe in motion? Faith in something that binds every disparate facet of life together in such a way that a chaotic AND harmonic balance is achieved without anything being in direct balance?\n\nYeah. I do.
-1	I am a Christian.  It's a scary thought for someone who isnt one.  To paraphrase C.S Lewis:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the atheist: If God isnt real, then when you die you cease to exist for eternity.  If God is real, then when you die you are condemned to hell for eternity.  It's a lose-lose situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get the idea that I hate atheists or something.  I love atheists.  I love them so much, that I hope that they can turn to God. 
0	I think he does and I think we need to talk.

5	How likely is it that an INTP can be really good with people?	I haven’t asked the guy I’m dating to take the MBTI yet but I’m almost positive he’s an INTP. He acts like a typical INTP from what I know of him this past month. There are only two things that don’t seem to fit quite right.\n\n1. He was super excited and open with me during our first date six weeks ago. Smiling at random times, kissing me multiple times, even telling me he was only able to do this because he knew he could trust me.\n\n2. When we go out, he always seems to make a friend. Always relates to our waiters (usually about their tattoos), asks their opinions on drinks. While at Best Buy the other week he talked over the details of a camera he wanted to buy with an employee for almost an hour, ended up showing her some pictures on his phone.\n\nAnd another thing, once when we (mostly me) talked about my feelings and doubts, at the end he told me “your issue is that you care too much about making other people happy, you have to make yourself happy” and pretty much summed up all my issues with that which blew my mind.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Is he just a socially competent INTP? Is he not an INTP at all? I know the MBTI isn’t an end all, I’m just looking for your opinion.\n\n((Little back story, we knew each other through his ex four years ago, hung out for like a month while I “dated” his best friend and never talked again until this past December. Four years ago and we had no romantic interest in each other at the time, or so I thought...I didn’t...))
9	That sounds extremely similar to me. I'm very bubbly and curious when I'm out and about. I love being excited and easily excitable. It's fun. I definitely don't have to be but it's what I choose because it makes me happier. I make friends all the time and I remember as a little kid coming home and telling my parents about all the friends I made from my first few days of school.\n\nI like to enjoy myself so I keep myself in a state where I find the most enjoyment. I'm also very confident with good self esteem (for the most part) and that shows very much as I've been told that's how I come off a lot.\n\nIt's as much a part of me as how robotic and unfeeling I can come across when discussing things over text with someone or being serious in real life.
7	Eh, I don't have trouble talking to people. I don't put useless walls, and not like I will see them again, so whatever. New people also makes me curious.\n\nWe are bad when it comes to maintaining that stuff. 
4	I'm a very social warm INTP. Honed that skill through want and practice.
3	i am good at socializing with people i have to meet often, through my initiative. mostly through practice and taking risks and getting past the small talk relatively fast.\n\ni get to know people, and i help them out with their problems - if they feel like it, and i am competent enough to do it. i listen to their problems and offer some advice, if applicable.\n\nthe bad part is that 99% of the time they don't really reciprocate, so i don't really get any support or attention from them - other than a pile of gratitude. then again - i don't really need it. \n\nbut helping people out gives me that fuzzy feeling that makes it worth it, and a bit of experience with dealing with various people. plus, it makes me seem more adept at socializing that i would ever give myself credit for. so that's also a win for me.\n\n\nat some point in my life i got few remarks that i am pretty good at building relationships i am not an essential part of. i bring few people together into a small network of friends, and even if i move on they still usually stay in touch with each other. i guess that doesn't sound very intp-like.
3	>"To take the MBTI \[test\]"\n\nOh no, dont do that.  The tests are AWFUL.  I tested as everything BUT INTP.  But after tons of studying, self reflection, and asking others stuff, I came to my conclusion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou just simply can't test yourself.  Just study him.  Pretty sure he's an INTP? Then he probably is.  It's a hell of a lot more accurate than a test.  ESPECIALLY if you understand cognitive functions. 
3	The issue for me isn't talking to people, especially strangers . In fact, when feeling good I enjoy talking to people and am genuinely curious in what they are saying. However once that fades or it is someone I now have to see on a regular basis unless we really click, maintaining that relationship becomes quite hard for me, and it then becomes tiring because I feel like I'm upholding some kind of act idk....  generally can't seem to connect with the person and the conversations become increasingly more awkward... Especially the more I try to avoid them. \nI feel unable to think of things to talk about or just become generally uninterested. \n\nSucks. \n
5	It's perfectly possible. INTPs aren't really like the cold, calucating stereotype. It's all about that sense of childlike wonder and excited curiosity when we are interested in something. And in this case, they are interested in you...  \n\nExtroverted Feeling (Fe) is all about being able to feel out a vibe in a room, or sense how others are feeling, and adapt to that. In our function stack, this may be in our 4th, inferior position, but we still do use it, and it can become more well  developed as we mature. 
1	Contrary to popular opinion Introverts can be sociable. Being sociable can be learnt or practised and shouldn't be a factor that categorically defines an INTP. I talk to pretty much anybody, eventhough I don't really want to. I'm just not invested or interested in talking all the time.

3	How much sleep do you usually get a night?	Just curious. For me it's about 6 - 7 hrs on weeknights and maybe 10 - 11 on weekends.
8	Makeup sleep doesn't replace real sleep. I'm not preaching. My sleep habits are shit and revolve around drinking way too much to shut up the circus in my mind. But according to the prevailing science on the matter, it's better to just fucking sleep.
6	it's very hard to say, because i struggle to fall asleep and i sometimes wake up early. it might be 5-7 hours, despite my fixed sleeping schedule with 8 hour sleep slot.
5	Anywhere between 3 and 16 hours.\n\nMy sleep schedule shifts forwards by around an hour each night, so I progressively get less and less sleep until it comes full circle and then I do about half a day. It's proving difficult to fix. 
5	Not enough 
2	I sleep 2-4 hours a night then randomly once a week or month I'll sleep 16 hrs straight. But never a normal amount. 
1	4-5 hours
1	4-8 hours, generally 5 or 6.
1	I go to bed early but usually toss and turn all night. Sometimes I wake up at 4am and I'm ready to go for the day other times I don't want to get up. So I lay in bed for at least 8 hours but how many hours is continuous is maybe 2 at best.
1	I try to get the standard 8, but typically end up with around 6.5-7. On the weekends it's the same.
1	The best thing to do to help sleep is to wake up and go to the gym before work. If you have a desk job get a standing desk. Most of the time I can’t sleep is because I commute 1.5 hours a day then sit on my ass at work and then come home and sit on my ass and play Xbox until it’s time to go to bed. Then I try to go to sleep but struggle. Then I remember no shit you can’t sleep dumbass you don’t have a reason to be tired. However, the days I go to the gym and use my standing desk most of the day I’m out like a light. 
1	Typically either like 4-5 or 10-12, there's like no in between.\n\nAlthough depression is a thing so you know, that might be a thing.
1	[deleted]
1	5-6.5... not enough. I try to get 7 if I am working out hard.
1	I used to sleep for 3 hours nightly (4am-7am) but now I'm nocturnal, and sleep from about 4pm to 10pm
1	At night? Barely anything at all, like 2 hours. During the day? 8 hours, for a total of 10 hours.
1	Generally 3 to 6. It's just the falling asleep that is hard for me since once I'm asleep I'm out cold, but most days up till 3 or 4 am and work at 8am. \n\nAnd while I know you can't catch up on sleep but man do I love to take some nighttime Advil or some variation of it... and just sleep for 10 hours plus on weekends. 
1	Easily ten hours with meds, usually seven to eight. Without meds naturally ~3-4hrs total in 30min intervals.\nTook me 30 years to finally get to sleep and now that i have working meds and working sleeping schedule i no longer think of sleeping as a waste of time like before.
3	Is Bo Burnham INTP?	just curious.
3	Saving this for later, big fan of his myself
2	Maybe let’s ask him
2	Kurzgesagt - Loneliness - part of my INTP experience in the past	
5	Third time this video has been posted here within 8 hours. 
4	What helped you get your goals and ideas of the ground and into reality?	;)
4	For me I like step one in any big undertaking to be evaluating my life and what I can part with to make room for what will become a new lifestyle.\n\nIf you want to become a woodworker you can buy the nicest table saw, but if you don’t have anywhere to work you will be frustrated, make mistakes and not enjoy the thing that you want to enjoy. \n\nBut why stop at organizing your garage? You want to put as much time as you can into this new thing. So when you cook and your pots and pans are hard to get to and your laundry is all over the place you will have less time to become better because thats 10-15 minutes less you will have to practice for each little task. \n\nWhen we are good at something I think we do much better at sticking with it. We need practice time and we need to find ways to enjoy it. \n\nStreamline your lifestyle to make room for the new thing, make your daily tasks easier and still leave time for family/leisure so you don’t burn out. \n\nI think for us, getting caught up in all of the little bullshit in our lives can be a major thing that holds us back.\n\nI highly recommend using the five S philosophy to dictate how you organize your home and your workspaces. It is important to do a self evaluation of these spaces every quarter to determine if you life has changed and therefore your setup needs to change at all. \n\nAfter all of this then I focus on watching videos 1 hour a week min, reading about areas I know I need to explore min 1 hour a week and practicing as much as I can/interacting as much as possible. \n\nCommitment and desire are two different things and committing to regular smaller improvements and accepting mistakes has done a-lot more for me than desire. 
3	Pretty much nothing.
2	Emotion. If you don't get pissed off enough to change your life, you'll never do it. 
1	a practical need to implement them. if i have a specific goal to accomplish, i will do what has to be done. \n\nif they are just hobbies, they barely go anywhere. if i have a use for them - i progress pretty fast.
1	Freedom to fail.\n\nAnd I mean that externally and internally.\n\nAnd of course it's nuanced to hell and back.\n\nBut basically when the fear of failure gets removed, or the cost of failure gets mitigated (often the same thing), I can pursue it for the intellectual fun of it. If I can't solve for those, my ideas get archived where they can watch for a change of information vectors and triggers re-evaluation. Some ideas have taken decades, and still keep going back into the vaults.\n\nOnce the fear and costs are bypassed, it takes turning the idea into a mental challenge to prove myself right. Virtually all of my successful ideas came to be because I could continue refining the process of achieving it and my satisfaction of completion/success is almost entirely based in a satisfaction of "being right" about what I've learned was needed to make it happen. \n\n\nThere is a glaring exception to each of these, which are polar opposite in some manner.\n\nSometimes the fear of failure, or the fear of the cost of failure, is surmounted by a fear of the costs of not succeeding. As in "I can't afford to fail" being different from "I can't afford to not succeed." The former can usually be delayed, postponed. The latter can't be. It demands action. \nAnd sometimes it's not about proving I was right to myself, but proving I was right to someone else.

1	How common are INTP enneagran 9w1 combinations and what does each say about the other?	I am an INTP and have tested true to it for a couple of years. I just recently took to enneagram test and was classified as 9w1 after taking the test 2 times in different days. How common is this pairing? They seem rather different from eachother.
1	How common are ENTP 8w7 5w4 3w4s?\n🤔🤣
1	I'm a 9w1 but I have met other 9w8's INTJ / INTP. As for 9w1; I'm the only one I know and possibly one other INTP I met recently. It's not per say common to the type but we do exist. Most INTP's from my personal experience (all anecdotal) have been mainly 5's. Either 5's with a 4 or 6 wing. I've seen a lot more 5w4's than 5w6's though. Just personal observation. I haven't really seen any or many intps that roll outside of this though. If someone identifies as like 7w8 INTP; I'm more inclined to believe mistype scenario than an actual INTP 7w8.
2	INTP’s and Anti-depressants	My mother recently stopped taking an SSRI/anti-depressant that her doctor prescribed to deal with the issues of menopause. At first, it was great and her mood improved, but after about three weeks she began having more anxiety and some huge crashes and emotional outbursts, so I told her to discontinue taking it. My doctor had recommended years ago that I could take SSRI’s for anxiety and low energy, but I never considered it until now. I am still very skeptical of SSRI’s and anti-depressants in general, as I have read about the many potential side effects, and have witnessed them manifest in my mother, so I wanted to know if any INTP’s have had success with them. 
3	I have been on one antidepressant for 25 years. The older tricyclic antidepressants just made me sleepy. The SSRIs have been a mixed bag. I have been on Fluoxetine (Prozac) most of the time and am now.\n\nThe action of SSRIs is well understood now. By blocking serotonin reuptake in the brain, they functionally increase the available serotonin. Some of the newer ones also block the reuptake of norepinephrine. The straight serotonin inhibitors have never adversely affects me, but the ones that also block norepinephrine mess me up. There also are some more complex drugs with additional effects, and all of them have been awful for me. Duloxetine was by far the worst. They know a lot less about why they work.\n\nPersonally, I do not notice a difference in myself when on Fluoxetine, but my wife does, and I trust her judgment more than mine in some respects when it comes to my state. As others have noted, people respond differently to different SSRIs, and trying another is a good idea if the effects of one are undesirable. I would suggest trying Fluoxetine because it seems like the most basic of the SSRIs. Since it does fewer things, it may have less side effects, and if it does have side effects, if it does, they are likely to happen with others.\n\nI have been fortunate not to experience any side effects from Fluoxetine. For many people, it decreases libido, but that did not happen to me.\n\nI should say that I have had depression but never anxiety. I am less familiar with the effects for anxiety.\n\nThe right SSRI can provide a lot of benefit for many people.  I think that you are right to be skeptical, but not to the point of writing it off. For me SSRIs never conquered or stopped my depression. It reduced the symptoms I guess but was no silver bullet. In contrast, transcrainial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was a silver bullet for me and eradicated my depression completely. Dialectical behavior therapy helped me more than SSRIs did.\n\nOver the years, I developed the habit of looking at going off drugs before I started them.  Some of the SSRIs required a long tapering, and even then people feel horrible. Look up the drug name and withdrawal. I decided never to take a drug that was difficult to stop. It seemed to me that anything that harmed me when I stopped taking it could not be helping while I was. A lot of mental health drugs have horrible withdrawal effects. \n\nHope this helps.
3	I did after a very stressful period in college. Meds kicked in one night. I randomly I felt so elated my chest was bright or warm inside. The next several weeks I had the best conversations of my life, promiscuity, and unbelievable self-confidence and empathy. Wonderful feelings-wise. But I blew through all of my money and ignored my plans and school. Failed my last semester of college and really was depressed at the wreckage I did so suddenly.\n\nIt was described as hypomania and subsequently misdiagnosed as bipolar type II. Never had that feeling before or since, nor depression outside of coming down from that.. I am just fine with proper coping skills. Just my story.
2	I had a brief, but bad, experience with Prozac and I would never take another SSRI. Luckily, I found a great alternative - SAMe. It's actually a prescription antidepressant in Europe, but in the U.S. you can just buy it in stores. For me it's almost literally a happy pill. I take 1600 mg/day. It's also good for your joints and liver.  
1	I myself am considered a depressant as I tell people the truth and don’t coat it in sparkly wrapping paper with a big red ribbon on top. I prefer to hand them the truth unfiltered and complete.\n\nDue to myself being a depressant if I were to consume any form of “Anti-depressant” I would cease to exist and people would miss my shitty memes!\n\n
1	Yes
1	Due to specific genetic markers, people respond differently to these types of medicine (most common is CYP2D6). People make different amounts of an enzyme that is important in processing antidepressants.  \n\nUnfortunately, 
1	They gave me Visual Snow Syndrome and fucked my brain up. Do not recommend.
1	SSRIs have the same effect as placebos \n\nIf you want to boost your mood and energy take testosterone.  I started taking an OTC testosterone booster last week and notice a difference.  I wake up feeling awake and have not wanted to nap.  \n\nAlso exercise.  
1	Belief poll (please only answer if you tested as INTP)	Online tests count.\n\n[https://www.strawpoll.me/17449916/r](https://www.strawpoll.me/17449916/r)
3	Everything's made up.  Stay woke. 
3	INTPs are never certain. I'm sad thah there's no option for unsure. 
3	I clicked all three.\n\nI thought this was a TEST!\n\nDamn, should of read the title...
3	I tend not to believe in things, because belief means to confidently assume right without proof or needing proof and continuing with the assumption despite contrary evidence. Won't it be illogical for an INTP to believe in a deity or a pseudo-science? Is an illogical INTP even an INTP?
2	&#x200B;
2	Astrology is interesting, I just don't buy the "explanation" 
0	Family members with same personality?	So I took the mbti test years ago and of course I got an INTP. Then I took it again months ago and got INTP - T (Turbulent). My brother (only sibling I have) recently took the test and he also got INTP - T, the exact same personality that I got and this is just sooooo fucking rare and it kinda does explain a lot.\n\nI'm wondering if any of you guys have family members with the same mbti as you do and explain the relationship ya'll have.
1	Me, my two brothers, and my dad are all INTP.\nMy step sister is INxP. \n\n...yeah. My family's a neurotic bunch.
1	Yea, it's not that rare I think
1	not sure about dad, grandfather intj and mom ESFP.  stepdad ISTJ
1	Books + Lessons: What Are They?	New here. Is there a book list, or known lessons, for INTPs to either\n\n1. Create balance in their life\n2. Succeed and use their advantage to thrive; while mitigating disadvantages
1	The balance that I have achieved has come through normal means. Mindfulness and meditation were important.\n\nNot sure what you mean by disadvantages. I have seen and experienced differences but no disadvantages. INTP is not a curse.
5	Advice to a new discoverer of his INTP qualities and dealing more beneficially with these traits.	I have always been aware my brain worked differently to most but I often regarded the reasoning for this to possible underlying mental health issues and improper social choices leading to this state of mind. After taking the personality test and reading in depth the common traits people of this category I feel somewhat more at ease in the knowledge I am not alone in this way of thinking. I have many issues in my personal life with confrontation and constant debates (arguments from everyone else's perspective it seems) causing my relationships with friends and my partner to often become far too hostile. My motivation is extremely lacking and I suffer from severe laziness yet a constantly active brain full of ideas. I am a creative and focus my little energy on creating music, writing, photography and art but am unable to finish many projects or do anything with my specialised talents. I am studying a degree in audio engineering at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also partake in fairly frequent drug use which I have read is a common trait which I am hoping to try and improve on. However from my perspective I use them as a tool to access a different state of mind which is helpful in me self assessing and producing more experimental ideas in my work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I have only just discovered that the INTP personality type exists I was hoping for any advice on how people combat the issues that are commonly seen in people similar in nature.
4	Only advice is to keep treating it like a tool and not your manual. I think its awesome that you’re just now discovering the elements that compose you and figuring others out as well. Keep on going; it’ll only get better from here!
3	Try to stop the drugs. Getting caught up in the sensations I once got all too comfortable and stopped doing important things in life career and relationship-related. But, I understand some weed can help you be creative. Time-management is very hard on drugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would continue to learn about what's behind the four letters (if you haven't already). You can use them to understand your weak points in decision making and relationships. For me, mindfulness and running helped in every way. For others, I spent time studying emotional expression and public speaking to better pass in public. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, learning about other personalities was a big deal. I can now see why I hate certain people or vice versa. I get better everyday at knowing how to help people or using them them to get what I want (because I would paralyze myself thinking of other others' feelings etc.). Overall, stay positive and I hope you find this is fascinating like a lot of us : )
3	> I have many issues in my personal life with confrontation and constant debates (arguments from everyone else's perspective it seems) causing my relationships with friends and my partner to often become far too hostile.\n\nWell, my basic advice would be to don't mind it. I mean, if they can't accept that, is it even worth it to have them as friends ? That tendency to argue it out of multiples perspectives is literally TiNe, or, the core of our type. If they reject that, they kinda are rejecting you.\n\nYou also won't change that about yourself, nor will you enjoy a relationship where you hide it (hiding your strengths leave you with your weaknesses. Then everyone thinks they are above you) \n\nThat being said, you can smooth the edges/be smart about it : \n\n* Saying it nicely/padding it.\n* When the first signs of annoyance appear, stop it here. \n* Sometimes, how an argument will end up is predictable, and since it has a social cost, it's better not to do it at all. Basically, an opportunity cost analysis.\n\nA better strategy is to remember those questions you had, and triangulate them somehow into a bigger whole. For example, taking multiples observations of their action, and distilling into one question about their life philosophy ? (While keeping it casual) Then, if you're right, depending of if they like you or not, they will either think you're insightful or creepy. \n\nAnyway, typology wise, that's Fe. Reading the mood. But also a good chunk of Se, actually being present and paying attention to your surroundings. Se is our Blibdspot/PolR function, our biggest weakness, some of what you describe above can be interpreted as a lack of Se. \n\n> I also partake in fairly frequent drug use which I have read is a common trait which I am hoping to try and improve on. However from my perspective I use them as a tool to access a different state of mind which is helpful in me self assessing and producing more experimental ideas in my work.\n\nYeah, I wanna call BS on that. I'm not part of the moral busybodies, it's fine to do some, but don't make excuses for enjoying it.\n\n***\nSince you're new, I would say to research the 8 cognitive functions, since they are the basis of the model. You will then be able to confirm your type, and actually understand yourself/others. 
2	Just wanted to say that I am in the same boat as you, OP and I JUST discovered MBTI and, consequently, this sub. I had every intention of making a very similar post today until I ran across yours. So I just wanted to thank you for making the post, as well as just let you know you're not alone! \n\nAlso, to expand on OP's post, I just wanted to say that I've seen a lot of people (on and off the sub) that say things like "before I developed my [this or that]", and I'm wondering if there are any resources on developing certain letters or aspects of your personality. For instance, I tend to fluctuate between T and P regularly. Is there anything I could read up on as far as developing my T? That kinda thing. \n\nThanks again, OP! 
1	I think NP types are at greater risk of ADHD. I started diagnosing process at 30
5	Emotional Connections to Friends are Rare	Hello, all. \nYesterday, I read an INTP factoid that said something along the lines of, "INTPs can be best friends with someone for ten years, and never feel an emotional connection to them." \nFor me, that sums it up quite nicely. I have two good friends that I've known for over 12 years; I'd consider them my closest friends, and I know they'd do anything for me (and I would like to think that the reverse is true). However, I have almost zero emotional connection to either of them. If one were to press me for any sort of feelings regarding these two women, I'd say I was:\n1. Grateful that they've accepted me and stuck with me for so long.\n2. Admiring of them as human beings, in a way that one would admire a beautiful art piece.\n3. Largely comfortable around them, and appreciative of that. \n\nEvery once in awhile, however, a friend will come along that I do feel an emotional connection to-- that "spark," if you will. When that happens, it's a heavenly sort of hell.\n\nI won't be able to stop thinking of that person, becoming so obsessed that I embarrass myself. I've gotten better at hiding this obsession (mostly through, er, trial and error), but it still consumes me in secret. Losing this person becomes a terrifying prospect, and I grow hyper sensitive to even the tiniest signs of that happening (e.g. they respond to a text with only an emoji instead of a phrase).\n\nHas anybody else experienced this? Any practical tips that you could offer me?
6	Yes. What it is, is that you are emotionally immature. I refer to it as the INTP creepy stalky crush obssessive syndrome but what it really is, is us not being able to manage our weakest function (Fi) properly. I still get it and go through it but I’ve since learned how to manage it better by getting in touch with my emotions. \n\nWhen you are in this state, you probably feel overwhelmed with stress, anxiety, excitement, infatuAtion. My theory is why it’s so intense for us is because we are unable to discern what emotion is what. We are not a feely type but we do feel and often when we do feel, we feel strongly and this is one of those situations. Learning to control and manifest your actual emotions into concious reality is how you’ll continue to improve and mature. \n\nAs for practicality and how to improve, you can work at it slowly. Learning to express and recognize how you are feeling without using your “cognitive empathy” is a step forward. You can also cheat like how I did with psychadelics. Spirituality / meditation is also another avenue you could explore. It will take years of personal development but you are at least aware of your own issues and willing to improve which I think is great.
2	Yeah I do this, I only have one friend that I actually have an emotional connection with and I’ve known her for over 6 years, I’ll sometimes get that “spark” with some people I meet and do get “friend infatuated” but that almost always fades. I’ve had friends for 10+ years that don’t really know me, because if I ever try to explain my emotions or thoughts they just don’t relate. It’s something that makes me feel lonely even if I have quite a few friends.
2	Hmm, maybe before around age 12 or so. At some point around then, I started feeling these waves of deep appreciation for those I call friends. \n\nMaybe if I’d been close with my family, things might be different. But it’s been a hypothesis of mine that I sought emotional connections with friends due to not having them with family. \n\nI’m a straight dude, and I get “man-crushes” regularly. Got a couple right now. I really like hugging other dudes and used to get pushed away for doing it too much as a teen. 
2	This is shockingly familiar. \n\nI have two friends, twin brothers, who I've known for I believe 13 now. We're essentially all brothers at this point, yet I have no emotional bond to them. Their company is appreciated, but if I never saw them again I wouldn't think anything of it. And that's terrifying. \n\nI believe it's what some of the other respondents were saying, it's emotional immaturity. Hard to provide answers, since I don't know them myself. But I suppose life is more about the journey than the destination. 
1	What does happiness mean to you?	If the idea of it exists or would exist for you.
5	Bread, butter, water, shelter, and the ability to do whatever the fuck I want and whenever the fuck I want.

61	Anyone else wish they were smarter?	I find myself craving for knowledge constantly, be it textbooks, wikipedia articles, online courses, I just want to *learn more*. The universe is an infinite of wonder and discovery with no human limit to what you can know.\n\nBut often times, as I delve into more and more complex topics, particularly things like advanced math and computer science, I can't help but feel frustrated. I've tested well above the average as far as IQ goes, as I'm sure most of us here can relate to, but I can't help but feel wanting for more. We are the minds that have an endless thirst for knowledge, and yet I feel for many of us, we face a wall that is our own intelligence. Of course, these walls can be scaled with time and dedication, yet to see others scale those walls with ease, often understanding topics that would take most of us days in as little as an hour or two. If you look across  history, you find that humanities greatest inventions, greatest ideas, they were all the products of brilliant minds. Minds that think and process and comprehend in a way that most of us will never be able to have ourselves, and that have made intellectual contributions to humanity that most of us simply *cant* make, even with years of study.\n\nCan anyone relate? Does anyone long for a sharper mind to take in and understand the world only that much faster?
14	I think a more focused study could yield similar results as to what historical great minds have achieved. If we focus our attention on one particular topic, to the exclusion of everything else, and only focus on it for years (while limiting distractions that didn't even exist in the past: video games, social media) we could probably be phenomenal.\n\nUnfortunately, I also have the intp characteristic of being a dabbler. I become preoccupied with something for a while, then move on to something else, then something else, sometimes cycling back, etc. 
9	I love this post especially because the people around me aren’t the same and I feel lonely I guess is the word. I enjoy reading Science articles about random topics and I love sharing facts with those around me but I feel like sometimes they don’t care. I’m like how can you not care that blue whales eat 1.5 million calories a day? That’s crazy.  
6	I relate with the entirety of your post.  Continual thirst for knowledge, boundless curiosity, and limitations of cognitive capacity to most deeply plumb the depths of several topics of profound interest to me.  Some topics, like hominid evolution or classical music composition are well within my capacity, but the mathematical underpinnings of quantum field theory and electro-dynamics are not.  If we existed in a time when mental upgrades were on offer, I would be first in line.
7	Can totally relate. Jack of all trades master of none is my way with the world too. Do not really care for specialization in a particular area because that would take away the time I can put in to learn about the myriad stuff I don't know yet. 
3	Idk. On the one hand yes, on the other hand, potatoes
3	...yes.
3	I spent a long time trying to find ways to be smarter. My focus was on drugs. Brain ehancing drugs are called nootropics. I still take one, Modafinil. But as I have aged my awe and desire for smarts has wanted. I have come to realize that there are more kinds of intelligence than I could count and that everyone excels in some aspects. What we focus on is a narrow range in the spectrum.\n\nMore horsepower would just have you knowing the calories per day of every whale species. Do not make the mistake of thinking that thinking is all there is. What you do with your intelligence is more important than how much you have.
2	Hm! I’ve never really thought about that before\n\nI guess the answer is a soft yes. There are times when I wish I could learn everything easily so I could do everything\n\nBut I do feel pretty satisfied with my intelligence and I’m happy that we have the power to learn even really hard topics just by continuing to do it
2	There are plenty of things you *can* do to make yourself smarter, though. I’m not even talking about increasing your knowledge or skillset either, which you can always do. \n\nOptimize your sleep, exercise, eat right, supplement correctly, keep yourself healthy and challenged, do n-back drills every day. The effects are tremendous. Ordinary superpowers are truly available to so many of us. 
2	Yea man, I wish I was smarter.  I don’t grasp things particularly quickly, but usually willing to put in the time and effort to learn it thoroughly.  But it feels slow and frustrating. I try to focus on things now that add real life value because of how limiting learning ability is.  But still fun to think about more theoretical things
2	I'm intp and I say this often.  
2	I completely understand what you mean. The pool of knowledge is infinite, and sometimes I get disheartened knowing that I can't possibly know all of it. 
2	Too true.
2	Typically I take the strategy of "if it's too tough, find an analogy I can understand".\n\nI do something until I reach a halting point (I.e.: a brick wall), and instead of waiting for inspiration or a burst of creativity, I look in places I might find a similar problem in, and work until I reach a halting point there and come back to the first. \n\nIn the end I have a network of analogies where each one helps another, allowing me to tackle things similar to that network more easily.\n\nAlthough the problem is that now it's hard to find that problem in a field where I have enough easy links to get to that problem quickly, so I have to figure out how to persevere in those topics to keep this strategy sustainable.
2	I have always wished for a higher IQ than what I actually have, but I also understand being smarter doesn't necessarily mean I will have a more fulfilling life. What is holding me back in life isn't my intelligence; Instead, it is my own laziness and indifference toward things. If my personality and mindset stay the same and my IQ suddenly becomes 150+ the next morning, I think it would actually make my life more miserable because I would become more bored, more vain and more dispassionate about life in general because I would be too lazy to actually apply and challenge myself . Of course I would be able to comprehend things at a much faster rate, and probably at a much more complex level, but in the end what would I do with that intelligence without the passion and conscientiousness that could complement it? Intelligence measures potential, not actual capability and accomplishment. 
2	I would absolutely trade some of my intelligence to be happier and/or for the kind of mindset/traits that would make me happier.
2	What you want is a double edged sword, pandora’s box. I’m not going to disclose my level of intellect over the internet but I often wish the exact opposite of you. Having a duller mind or “ignorance is bliss” mentality is very attractive to me. I am constantly learning things and overwhelming my mind with information. Processing is overkill. I had grey hair in my early 20’s for god sakes. \n\nHalf my daily struggle is managing my self as crazy as it sounds. Like when i need caffeine when to eat vs when to sleep; how long I should sleep for optimally. when to wind down. When literally everything becomes a process around you and you see the connections and underlying systems, yes you gain power through that knowledge but fuck all of that. If I could live in the mountains staring at clouds all day, that sounds appealing to me. Understand there be drawbacks to having a higher capacity. There’s more to consider than I’m smarter now. Sometimes I wonder what operating at a lower capacity would mean and fantasize about lobotomizing my own mind. Hope this perspective helps ya.\n\nSincerely, \nsomeone on the other side of the garden.
1	It would be cool to be smarter, but I sure could go for more people smarts, to be wiser. At 50, I have a lot to look back on, and I could have made better choices and decisions and done just fine with my current brain power. It's like I'm both very smart and clever and very dumb.\n\nAs a side note my ISFJ girlfriend is the same. Smarter than i am, also kinda dumb in some ways. It makes me think brain smarts and people smarts are inversely proportional.
1	Sure, I wouldn't say no to being smarter, I mean, why not?\n\nBuuut I don't really care all that much about knowledge. I'm drawn to novelty, knowledge is often a tedious, detail oriented grind that I find boring. 
1	At 36 years old, I still spend a good proportion of my free time accumulating knowledge. And yes, I always wish I had 10 more iq points, despite being well above average. I changed career 3 times already, and I'm prepared to start a 4th. When I was a kid, my parents would be discouraged that I would start something without finishing the previous one, over and over again.
1	I relate with that, I'm always thirsty for knowledge and improvement 
1	I was always that kid in high school who would hit everyone up with the “Did you know....” won’t the response of “why do know that”. \n\nDamn I hated high school 
1	there are fields where my mind just throws in the towel. \n\npolitics, taxes, accounting, law, history, various complex types of physics, humanities. i feel like an idiot at those times.
1	[deleted]
-1	Work at it you lazy fuck. \n\nHardwork > talent. Every time, and let's say you actually some, then add hardworking to it.\n\nI'm pretty sure there is plenty of people here who were praised for being smart when they were little, calling them "gifted" or whatever.  Then, did nothing to improve on it, so in highschool, they were only above average, and by 20, totally average. It's totally on us/our lazyness (or even conceitedness). Being normal is fine, but you're the cause, so don't complain about it.\n\n\n\n

5	Manipulativeness later on in life, anyone ?	I've been hanging around with this ENFJ friend, and we seem to have taught each other a **lot** about our respective inferior functions. She used to say that getting an understanding of her Ti completely changed her perspectives on how to take decisions (not sure if she said that as an attempt to make me happy) ; on my side, getting to understand Fe was a much more covert thing, and I'm still not sure about what it is there for. (Harmony, blah blah blah)\n\nOne of the changes that I noticed since then, is the fact that I've become somewhat more *controlling* : there are these friends who get themselves involved into stupidly preventable situations, and whereas in the past I'd simply rant about «*how can you not even see how it's gonna fail badly ?*» (+ explanations), and consider my deed as a friend done, I end up nowadays to actually want to do more, as in I want to **streamline** the thought processes shaping their life (they're my friends ; I care about them) and **control** the way they feel as to make them avoid these pitfalls.\n\nThis kind of behaviour is more or less what usually NJ people do : they have this **ideal** they want the world to conform to, and they either use Te or Fe to get people there. So in some sense, getting a better control on my Fe has made me somewhat less of a *judgemental jerk* (my usual Ti rants), but more of an *idealistic manipulator*. (Which is kinda what ENFJs do : they selflessingly manipulate people into harmonious group dynamics.) We used to joke with her that by hanging around together, our brains are kinda getting swapped ; I sometimes wonder to what extent I've become manipulative myself.\n\nAnyone else has noticed these kind of things happening once they got a hang of their Fe ?
5	I have no patience for manipulative people. I can see through it easily. I sometimes let them keep doing it and make them think it's working till I get what I want out of it and then cut them out of my life.
5	Well, I hesitate to use the word "manipulation" to apply here, as it's always carried that negative connotation. I prefer to call it "influence."\n\nBut I do know, to some extent, what you're taking about--and it's exhilarating to see it actually working in real life. As someone whose social standing, and ability to make and keep friends, has been almost entirely at the mercy of other people for most of my life, it's refreshing to learn that I might have some sort of power in a social context, even if outsiders might label it as manipulative. \n
2	More doing, less thinking doesn’t make you less intp but makes you a more developed intp. I recently noticed this too by improving my inferior Fe cuz my INFJ friend nags at me all the time for it. And its exactly as you describe “harmonious”. Getting what you want from people by being more harmonious isn’t manipulation. You want people to be happy or you want things to work out. Instead of lecturing them, you make the situation actively better. Manipulation lies in intent and if its not malicious, I think its ok. Did you manipulate your friend into a better relationship with you by complimenting them or telling them how you feel? Imo nothing wrong with that. Getting a grasp on your Fe definitely for us helps us in conjunction with our Ti get us to where we want to go. It is definitely a very powerful tool once we have learned to develop it.
2	Your form of idealistic manipulation seems to me a bit harsh, as opposed to caring for someone assertively and respectfully. When it's done as a form of guidance, it's more about offering suggestions for others to make their own decisions. Example: my INFJ friend chooses to offer perspectives to people who have a decision-making authority, but as far as I've figured she uses her Ni-Fe to gather astonishing insight to understand others. When she wants something to happen, she will weigh the options with assertiveness: '(1) this is the situation, (2) this is my point of view, (3) here's a reasonable, measurable decision, (4) look at how I think it will benefit both of us' (I was surprised when I found the same procedure in CBT, under 'Assertiveness'). It really helps skillfully avoid areas of conflict when I myself may be perceived as aggressive.\n\nSure, sometimes people think they came up with that decision themselves. Well! It is their decision to make anyway, we're just assuming a supportive role. (her reasoning not mine).
1	I take a step back when I do it. Or for people I care about I sometimes give semi-blunt answers. *"You are upset because of x, y, z. You should probably try a, b, or c".*\n\nI have a sense of who will listen to me and *when* they likely will, but won't force it nor take advantage of **all** opportunities.  Some people need to live life and learn. Just as we mature our decision-making, others should too.\n\nI step back from manipulating often but boy does **Ne** swing my thoughts. I normally keep it fresh and throw ideas ''into the air'' if you will, rather than blunt or direct statements. That way I said my peace without pissing someone off or exactly condescending them. Objectively, it's still being manipulative/selfish and I wish I didn't care. Rabbit hole for another day though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearning cognitive functions is a double-edged sword. Now I often see what people miss in life when it comes to connecting and influencing others. But, now I want to experiment on people I know daily. Even from my detached perspective, it is manipulation. I lament that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne: couple words. Gotta get my words right :)
1	The Freudian Complex That Best Describes Each MBTI Type | astroligion.com	
3	> INTPs who first learn about their MBTI personality are likely to take special satisfaction in the validation it gives them as a person of intellectual fortitude. They like being associated with geniuses and enigmatic thinkers such as Einstein, Newton, and Descartes in part because many INTPs may not actually feel that smart in the traditional or practical sense.\n\ni just like feeling like i actually belong somewhere. because i just feel i don't fit with people around me. everyone around me is more socially proficient/developed. they have lasting friendships, while mine just fell apart.\n\nand there are plenty of smarter people around me - i am merely an dumb engineer around some really smart folks. one that is apparently socially retarded. so i never had an occasion to feel good about myself intellectually - although i feel that's the only thing about me worth a damn.

10	INTP and long term relationships	I have been contemplating and looking into this for a bit (it is actually what led me to this community) but how does INTP manage daily relationships and love? How do they normally work out for you lot?\n\n----background stuff that can be skipped or skimmed---\n\nI'm asking because I've been married for 7 years and we've grown apart. Looking back we've pretty much been growing apart since year 1 but it became very apparent, to me, in year 3 or 4. This has led me to an on and off questioning on the nature, reality and practice of love.\n\nOnce the obsessive form of love wore itself out, I assumed companion or dutiful love would instigate itself sooner rather than later. I waited several years for it then last year I had a revelation: I am not one for duty and I don't consider him a companion. I've been waiting 4 years for something that is likely not coming.\n\nI contemplated divorce last year but there would unpleasant confrontation and unhappiness, talking to strangers, filling out forms, explaining things to people; just all around misery. I explained the situation to him and he was very upset, there were conversations about feelings and eventually I just started lying to make the conversations end. Now he's spending all this time with me and it's absolutely sweet of him but it's taking away from my alone time. I really fucking love my alone time.\n\nI'm back to contemplating divorce but I'm concerned that this situation will somehow arise again. If this vaguely unsettled discontent is just me in relationships, then I can stay in the one I'm in instead of setting myself up to accidentally stumble into another one. He's happy. I'm not unhappy. Things aren't terrible. \n\nThere's also the option of going back to all those conversations about feelings but, dear god, wtf. I literally do not have the vocabulary to engage in a lengthy conversation about how I feel or why I feel that way. \n\nMy question to you all is... how do you fare in long term relationships?  Is this an experience you've had before?
10	I hate to break it to ya, but your whole situation sounds immature. Not trying to be hostile here or anything. First off your husb is doing the right thing IMO. You two have drifted apart because you failed to actively maintain / evolve your relationship. Being together isnt simply a tie the knot and see you in 25 years deal. Relationships are two way streets. You put in effort and rewards come back as well as your partner. \n\nMarriage is about committment and relationships are about compromise. You need to start thinking about how you fulfill the needs of your partner; what you both bring to the table and modify accordingly. 7 years together I’d at least like to assume that your husband understands that you prefer your space but being INTP you also need to understand that what constitutes as “space” is not normal for other types. Asking your husband to accomodate you or compromise to this level is unfair. Personally, I think you need to sacrifice some of this alone time or change your frame of mind to be more accomodating to your husband’s needs. You also need to work on your communication with your partner as you should never feel like you are not understood or simply opening your mouth is a waste of your time.\n\nImprove your communication and put in some effort and I believe most of your problems will correct themselves. You’ve been steadily falling out of love for years and I think you need to relearn what it means to fall in love again. Hope this helps ya!
7	INTP female here, was married for 12 years, now divorced.\n\nBetween Reddit and the INTP female group I belong to on FB, there are more than a few happily married women on there, and not one that I’ve read who was married to an ENTJ (supposedly our perfect match).  \n\nI don’t think all INTP long term relationships will just leave you feeling “meh” about things at some point.  I think it takes being married to someone who understands how you operate, and will make you feel secure.  \n\nI’m not sure how many of the previous comments were provided by male INTPs, and although there are two camps in regards to who has it harder in relationships, it doesn’t change the fact that INTP females are the exact opposite of the preferred ESFJ stereotype.  \n\nGrowing up, I was constantly told (or shown) that I was wrong.  Emotionally and mentally wrong.  I do not think or feel like a “normal” woman.  \n\nThis led to a significant insecurity about my feelings in my marriage.  I was never sure that what I felt was “right”, and my ex-husband tended to capitalize on that, arguing about his feelings until I capitulated.  \n\nThere’s always two sides to every story, and neither yours, nor mine, will be easily expressed on an online forum.  \n\nBut, you could ask yourself a few things.  First, does your husband put your needs before his own?  Did you tend to put his needs first until you realized yours weren’t being met?  Do your feelings matter to him?  When I say feelings, I mean INTP female feelings...you know, thinking/speaking rationally and calmly while your heart is bleeding out.  Or, a messy outburst which is then later regretted for not solving anything and doesn’t make you feel better.  \n\nAs for the mess of a divorce, it’s a pain. You don’t have to explain yourself to anyone.  You’re not the bad guy for not wanting to stay, and 7 years is plenty of time to realize you might not have married the right person.  \n\nPreviously, I used criticism from others as a guide to when my behavior didn’t match the “norm”.  This is common behavior in Aspie girls, because they don’t understand social cues.  That doesn’t mean you have Asperger’s of course, but I’ve heard from other INTP females that they camouflaged or “normed” growing up to fit in. \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out that a lot of people are critical, and I just have to do what I think is best.  And try not overthink it (ha).  Just remember, they don’t know what you know.  They are more than likely not correct in their assumptions, and their attitude is based on incorrect data.  \n\nMy only piece of advice to you would be to work on accepting your feelings.  As in, gaining confidence about your feelings being valid, and recognizing that your feelings are just as important as your spouse’s.  You’re not a robot, you have feelings, they are equally important no matter how developed your Fe is.  
3	I've been thinking of this from the opposite point of view for the past little while: I'm NOT a natural "relationship" person, but I find myself longing for a companion / traveling partner these days.  However, like you, I totally need to find a way to maintain my alone time.  Hell, I probably even need to keep living totally on my own, and that's gonna be tough with a partner.\n\nI've been a bit...analytical about how to do this, but some of the analysis might help your situation:\n\n1) It turns out there is something of a correlation between various types and how they make us feel in relationships.  For data on INTPs in particular, see https://www.man42.net/blog/2016/11/mbti-relationship-survey/relationships/intp/ (based on an initial reddit posting; turns out our happiness in relationships as INTPs is improved with other Intuitive types at least.)  and http://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/content/intps-love\n\n2) INFJs are supposedly a really great pairing for INTPs, as they both require massive amounts of alone time, but have differences that keep the relationship interesting.  I found a woman at my workplace in the last 6 months who is this personality type, and she fits that bill exactly, so I can attest to it.  There are certain things about us that don't quite vibe otherwise, but she opened the door to me at least being hopeful and positive that it was worthwhile to at least consider the possibility of long-term relationship happiness.\nBecause I adore this woman at work, and because it is often referred to as the "Golden Pair" in terms of relationship success for an INTP, I really appreciated reading this reddit posting about INTPs making relationships work, from an INFJ perspective.  In particular, the comment from /u/slvmxo/ was truly insightful and might give you a path forward in terms of how you should ask to be communicated with in a relationship, either if you choose to stay in your current marriage, or if you venture off in search of greener pastures:  https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/af3jzn/how_exactly_does_a_infj_intp_relationship_work/\n\nAnyways, I hope this help...
2	7 years? Holy shit. My longest relationship was 1 and a half year. I'm 27 now, and been single for a long time. The more I age, the less patience I have for relationships.\n\nWhen I date someone I find it extremely difficult to stay interested in it. I usually lose all interest in a relationship within a few months.\n\nEdit : I HATE lying and leading someone on with false promises so I just end up breaking it off. Eventually I stopped dating altogether. It's too taxing. Especially in 201X.
2	Interesting. I was in an 8 year relationship and I’m in my late twenties.\n\nWe too grew apart but that’s just how things go sometimes. I don’t have a bad word to say about it or her - our long term outlook on life was just too different as we grew and aged together. \n\nTo be honest, I can’t be assed to develop that sort of relationship with somebody again because it is a lot of effort that I’d rather spend elsewhere. Now, for me, it’s just not worth it. I’ve already acheived a LOT more since it happened because I can truely do exactly as I want and that excites me.\n\nI’m sure you’d agree, there’s always a project or something else you want to do. The sacrifices you make in relationships distract me too much from my own goals, projects and aspirations. \n\nPeople view relationships very differently...as an INTP, I couldnt care less. Platonic or romantic.

And you don't want to talk about it. I guess he should just read your mind? You want a companion but you sit on your ass waiting for it to happen instead of initiating it yourself. You don't even know what you want. How do you expect him to know?\n\n&#x200B;
2	I've been with my lady for almost 5 years now and the biggest thing to realize is that society is a bullshit illusion and we all need to learn to be vulnerable and share how we are feeling while also accepting your realities for what they are. Too many relationships fail from the lack of proper communication. I think the best way to see what matters sometimes is to lose it.
1	Rather than random internet people have you thought about counseling? These feelings are dense and have been building. We’re probably not gonna be able to solve your marriage. But I wish you well.
1	This sounds like a clusterfuck and a half. You say you don't wanna express yourself to anybody but here you are in a 7 year old marriage with somebody you don't consider as a partner of any kind -somebody you'd rather lie to so he shuts up and you have your peace instead of even starting to attempt some kind of communication may I add- exhausting yourself by working overtime  in order to....?  What? So that he is more able to dabble in his business/hobby/whateverthefuck and he remains more in the "shut up" mode? And all that cause by divorcing you'd have to "fill out some forms" and shit and because you expect to evolve to "Legit Companions" at level 16 or something?\n\nI think describing all that as "vaguely unsettling discontent" sounds more like an attempt at humor than actual assessment of the situation and if you are being objective at your descriptions of the events the only solution to this whole thing seems to be the "GET. THE FUCK. OUT." route. You ain't in the mood to fix this and all these years of winging it make it incredibly hard even if you were, so just get out and live for yourself for the time being. It's what you seem to want after all.
1	I can actually sympathize with OP quite a bit and oddly enough see aspects of myself in both her and her husband.\n\nFiance and I recently moved back to the US. I own a business but she went to grad school. I picked up a LOT of the slack in terms of bills, making dinner and house duties while she was in school. But we got into a nearly 6 month long argument because I wasn't taking care of 100% of the expenses. Mind you, I was taking care of like 60-70% of everything but I couldn't get as high paying of a job as I'd have needed since I hadn't been in the US in ages.\n\nOn top of that, reverse culture shock is REALLY REAL. The job hunt upon returning to the US, plus not being around my daily group of expat friends and support-system lead to a lot of depression. \n\nIn all it was a cluster-fuck. I felt like it just damaged our relationship beyond repair. The pressure of moving back + grad school + working in the US + constant arguing have made it so that personality quirks are now red flags I can't ignore. Like if this is how we are just because of moving back to the US, how will we handle kids, home-ownership, etc etc.\n\nSo yeah I have that same hesitancy where I feel like this is all going to happen again and even bigger next time. We're not married right now and it's ALREADY really hard to just walk away because we've also been together for 7 years. Getting married will make it feel fucking impossible.\n\nSo, to OP, I'd say take stock and get a divorce. Your husband sounds a little Incubus-like. The fact that he thought it'd be cool to start a business just because you were pulling in a little bit of overtime money is just boneheaded. \n\nAlso, you sound very much like me in the sense that when someone says that want to do something, you trust that they want to actually do it and are ready. The problem is that most people aren't. Too many people in this world want to bounce their issues off of you by presenting them as though they're already thought out.\n\nFinally, when I get back home I'll have to PM you this great interview with Amanda Seals (she's an actress in that show Insecure) where she talks about EXACTLY what it means to have someone in your life who is a COMPANION. If my fiance and I don't work it out, my next SO will have to be someone who already has their own shit figured out. A companion is someone who can give you your own space to keep yourself gathered and not be leaching off of it. And that's exactly it; you sound like the type of person who needs space to develop into to really feel alive. Another person being in that space all the time really is just taking up room.\n\n

7	Goldilocks Zone Non-Advice	"Dress nicely but don't overdo it."\n"Pursue actively but don't be overzealous."\n"Be polite but not rigid."\n"Use, like, some garlic but not too much."\n\nRight. How about instead, I just don't come to you for any guidance any more since you have nothing meaningful to say? Good talk.
5	Haha I feel you. \n\nThis “advice” can basically be summed up as “just do what everyone else is doing”. Which is the last thing we want to hear when we ask someone for their personal thoughts.

6	Ignorance is bliss - knowledge, the opposite	I've been training my extroverted functions, learning about how to act socially, but the more I understand how 'extroverted' people act, the more I become self-concious about my inability to act socially smooth like them. \nHow do you deal with that?
4	I have "days off" to hang out with extroverts and I even mastered doing it without being intoxicated by alcohol. However, it's dull and boring for the most part.\n\nI'll go to a science fair any time than to a pub to talk about topics irrelevant to anything except for someone's feelings.\n\nI understand people, I just mostly don't care for them unless they're somewhat morally and ethically alright in my book.
3	Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise
2	Growth, development, maturity, and wisdom occur in phases. \n\nI remember feeling vastly ashamed of my lack of social skills upon first attempting to study the way socially intelligent people behave and interact with each other. \n\nAfter I overcame that and worked hard to implement what I observed, I hit the next obstacle - disillusionment. \n\nIt felt like these “social games” were so transparent, fake, and anti-truth. I hated that people would believe what I say based on how confidently I seemed to say it rather than how verifiable its veracity is. \n\nThat disillusionment could have led me down a dark hole of hating humanity for its weakness and limited tolerance of truth. However, I’ve realized over the years that a good part of maturity involves learning about ways in which the world is totally f***ed up, and then understanding how to accept it and do something about what you have the power to change.

10	INTP Christians and Language Learning	I have a question that I often think of when talking about scripture with Christians. The situation with this honestly confuses me a little bit. \n\nIf we are talking about an INTP (or any other thinking type personality for that matter) that is a Christian and believes that their understanding of the word of God as written in the Bible and Torah will ultimately save or damn their soul... Why would this person, who is normally willing to read and learn the most obscure random facts on the history of the race to the south pole, or the timeline of how philosophy developed during the renaissance. Why would this Christian with a both an interest in the material, and a damned good, soul saving reason to do so, not take the time to learn either Hebrew or Greek in order to be able to read the actual text that can save them? \n\nI mean if I thought my soul was at risk, you best believe, I would at least be hitting up duolingo and the dummies books to get an understanding of the original context that my holybooks were written in. \n\nSo, my question to any INTP Christians out there is why are you not learning the languages that seem to be important to your full understanding of a book that you seem to think is the most important book in the world. 
9	I do love languages and have significantly studied Biblical Hebrew. The translations from Greek to Latin/vernacular may be of better quality than the Hebrew ones so there is a lot to get into when you consider a Semitic mindset.  I think it’s fair to say that studying Hebrew will yield more interesting results than Greek...\n\nHowever, I don’t actually think that my knowledge of Hebrew will somehow help me uncover something that will impact my soul after I die or something.  I’m not sure many Christians actually believe what you are claiming.  Christianity doesn’t actually rely on individual knowledge, “hidden” doctrine, or intellectual understanding.  The Bible exists within the context of Christianity... if some think that Christianity exists within the context of the Bible I can’t really speak to how they would respond.\n\nGreat question though!
6	Yes, I’m interested in learning Hebrew and Greek and reading the oldest manuscripts we have. \n\nHowever, I’m only interested in the same way that I’m interested in *just about everything*, so about a thousand other things take precedence. \n\nAs for eternal fate, I am saved by grace and by grace alone, not my own goodness or holiness (of which there is none). Reading the Word of God is essential for a Christian, but becoming an advanced biblical scholar does not make me any more or less faithful. \n\nPersonally, I am way more concerned with being of use in the salvation of others, of sharing and spreading love. 
4	I've thought about it. Didn't have enough time/ kept putting it off because college. I just do as much research as possible on verses I'm interested in.\n\nAdditionally there are enough people who do read Hebrew and Greek to confirm the translations are very accurate. Learning the language adds more context, but does not change the basic meaning. 
3	English, Hebrew, Greek, Arabic...what's the difference?\n\nUltimately each is still a human's perspective on trying to relate something they don't really understand. Sure, there can be some translation error, but ultimately any grevious translation errors would have been found over the centuries, making any existing differences solely a matter of opinion.\n\nLearning new languages just to try to find those differences of opinion is not likely to grant me significant benefit as a reward for the significant cost involved. And it certainly won't change the core of my beliefs.
3	Because people a lot more knowledgeable than me translate and fact check each other closely. Why does knowing old culturally irrelevant language need to be part of my beliefs? I don't need an ancient dialect of Hebrew to be a Christian. I outta learn spanish so I can order at mexican restaurants easier
4	We have Bible scholars who are well versed in ancient Greek and Hebrew, and alot of modern translations are based on the best ancient linguistic sources available. I kinda have to take their word for it. \n\nI have entertained the thought of learning Greek and Hebrew, but I’ve been tdnit sinreallt dofficult and would need to go to college to become fluent in it. I have picked up some Greek and Hebrew worss from learning about theology on the Internet, though.
1	Well. As a Christian INTP myself. Currenly I am only 14 years old(so I'm a bit busy with school) and learning both Spanish and Russian. Although I do hope to eventually get around to learning Hebrew/Greek and probaby other languages too, I just haven't gotten there yet(And yes... I have been procrastinating quite a bit with Russian lately... but I WILL learn it... eventually).
1	Much of the time we just have to trust people. There are many skilled and passionate bible scholars that have worked countless hours translating the versions of the bible that we have right now. I would love to learn hebrew and Greek  so that I could read the origional manuscripts, but that is not the best use of my time right now. If i have questions I can read a side by side translation with explanation of word use. \n\nAs others have said, we can trust the translations that we have now, at least on all of the major topics. My time is best spent spreading the love of God and finishing my studies. Later on I will have more time once I am done with my degree, but my time will never be better spent than letting others know about the saving grace of God. I have assurance of salvation and reading the bible in hebrew will not change that. 
1	Considering I want to learn Mandarin, Spanish, and French too, I just don’t know when I’m gonna get around to any of them honestly
10	Anyone else love that there's not really any rules?	Besides the normal "no personal info" and "normal Reddit rules" stuff, there isn't anything written in the "Rules for r/INTP" section. I'm pretty sure this was due to either 1. The fact that INTPs aren't big fans of rules or 2. INTPs are thought to be "lazy" sometimes, and probably didn't feel like making one. I'd definitely lean towards #1 but #2 could still be an option. This has probably been pointed out before, but oh well.
11	This wouldn't be an INTP sub if there was a single rule. To be an INTP is to self govern. We know the rules already. We don't have to post them. \n\nEdit: this is given that we must follow Reddit's rules because everyone must follow reddit's rules. \n\nNo personal info is just covering our own asses for people looking in. 
16	Yes. I’m horrified every single time anyone calls for moderation here. I hate the memes that are posted here, but I’ll always be in favor of people being able to post them if they want. \n\nI’m #teammrhaircut
3	It's a libertarian subreddit (reddit wise, not politically).  I absolutely love it!\n\nAnd it's perfect for INTPs.  We tend to be wiser and better behaved than many other types, I think.   XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould probably be a monkey cage if we were talking ExFx.  LOL

1	Intp in vampire: masquerade	Hey fellow nerds and geeks. In the vampire: masquerade an intp is more like malkavian, tremere or toreador? Any idea?
2	It has been a while since I have looked at the books but\n\nMalkavian = insane\n\nTremere= sorcerer\n\nToreadore (sp?) = artist\n\n\nNone of these really fit the intp very well. You would have to go outside the Camarilla(?) to find one.\n\nI would say the True Brujah. They are intellectual rebels. The current Brujah are bikers and outlaws, but originally they were... heretics I guess is the best word. They upheld ideas that went against the grain.
2	I need to get that game, don't I?Played it at ex' house (INTJ) and loved it but we didn't last long enough so I could finish the game :/  \n(next Steam sale is mine)
1	Man, this reminds me of that mobile game by Square Enix called Bloodmasque about 5 years ago. It was repetitive, but there were some really cool visuals, and I liked the story. It’s a shame they shut it down. 
4	Who Likes Maze-Like Puzzles More, INTP or ENTP?	
3	As an INTP, I wrote several essays on maze generation algorithms, and I even earned some money selling a maze generation tool I made.\n\nAlso, after looking at the context of the original post, I should mention that I work at an escape room, and I make labyrinth video games in my free time.\n\nSo yeah, I'm trying to be "the maze guy."
15	Non-people People Person?	I like understanding people. Looking at the various interpersonal interactions is interesting. After communicating with someone, I spend countless minutes thinking what I did, what I could have done, and what the outcome was. \n\nBut for all the pleasure I get from analyzing people, I feel like I don't understand people. I claim to have an understanding, but then I can never apply it. I guess I'm the "non-people people person."
1	It's because you are still missing info. You can't understand a person with just one conversation.\n\nAlso, you probably are over emphasizing TiNe in your analysis (basically, an assumption that they work like you. Because you're the only thing you know. The starting data point.), so what they think and why. Their philosophy. \n\nBut there's the 6 others functions, which are pretty alien to us.\n\n
1	Each person is a universe and there is always something new you can learn from them, as there's always something new to learn about ourselves too.\n\nWe perceive the world through our five senses and processes with our brains who act like some sort of filter of information. There will never be a complete understandment of anything.\n\nBut for some reason I find fascinating to still keep asking questions :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I didn't developed the senses idea. - As we perceive the world through our senses, we never know which information we are missing. So It's impossible to understand everything just because we don't even know if we are capting all information available, we don't even know if we are able to do it. 
1	Why play a role of one when you can be countless? (serious question and psychoanalysis)	Switching jobs, homes and positions through my life I learned that with it, I switch accents, behavior and thinking patterns.\n\nThis is something that seems to be normal in every Myers Briggs type, changing your "moodset" so to speak,  \nbut I'm talking about completely changing my mindset depending on the circumstances / surroundings. (This is one of the reasons why most of my relationships didn't work).\n\nOnce I am bored or reacting on something, I "randomize", so being an INTP as myself I went into a deeper analysis of this behavior to understand should I act upon it or just let it be (let myself be?).\n\nI talked with other female INTPs from over the world and something that I noticed was common is the accent switching depending on their mood and day, speaking more than 1 language, listening to variety of music genres.\n\nSometimes they will be talking about a ex. heavy philosophy topic for 3 hours straight, the next day they are completely confused as to why did I bring it up again and will be completely unresponsive, but ex. share an art idea or recommend a documentary and we will be on it hardcore.\n\nThis might seem apsurd and I'm not saying "every INTP is like this, hurrdurr I'm INTP science" but there seems to be something going on there that most don't understand (or care about).\n\nInterestingly, I know 1 INTP male and he doesn't seem to have the same "problem", however he started scoring as INTJ as from recently. Keep in mind I don't generally feel relatable to male INTPs as I feel a bit more open minded and less strict (this could be wrong as it's all from my experience, Se <3).\n\nPerks of randomizing patterns of humaning:  \nI am easy going, people open up to me, feel welcomed and safe to talk about anything and appreciate my input. I don't bother nor pry, people generally love hanging out with me (especially when the rest of the world is bothering them). I am generally neutral/happy. Diplomats and highly educated people seem to like me better than common folk, I have very loyal friends who have my back and know I have theirs.\n\nCons of randomizing patterns of humaning:  \nPeople can't seem to describe me properly (as when I get described, I switch it up). They often don't seem to be able to talk to me about anything except their problems, nihilist topics, interesting and indulging ideas, projects, or art. I don't act well to smalltalk and wasting my time so I get a trait of "impudent" every now and then (some however describe me as extremely kind). I filter people out very easily so "people come and go" a lot.\n\nWhen I talked to my psychologist about it (who claims that I am a normal, authentic person which needs to change surroundings), she told me to build a social micro-environment and that I shall be in peace.\n\nI am in peace, I don't have problems with people, they are the ones who think they have problems with me which only makes them irrelevant in my book. Why change when I'm not affecting anyone badly (unless they affect me first)? My core beliefs stay, I am a humanist that's annoyed with people's stupidity (closed mindedness, impoliteness, forcing opinions that aren't confirmed by science), and I am a working member of society that is constantly self improving. \n\nSo, my question stays: Why be a 1 when you can be countless?   \nIs it so people can be happy with their parataxic distortion and pigeonholing of individuals?  \nIs it so they can always fill their self righteousness meter and conduct their totalitarist regime of telling people who they are and what they can and cannot do?  \nWhy should I be bothered by playing a strict role of a certain someone?\n\nAny inputs, thoughts, ideas, notices, criticisms are highly appreciated but if you start memeing and being irrelevant I'll delete the post. Cheers to all people of goodwill and common sense.
4	My own thoughts at the age of 54 and after being beat up life too often. I am male, but don't hold that against me.\n\nYou say that you are at peace, but your post practically screams that you are not. It has tones of wondering if you are missing something or doing something wrong. First of all, you certainly are not doing anything wrong. You sound well adjusted and comfortable with who you are.\n\nI would suggest that you might be missing something. For the longest time, I prided myself on being a chameleon par excellence. I could be whoever I needed to whenever I wanted. I thought I was perfect. As I aged, however, I realized that I did not know who I really was. I had lost myself among all the faces. The more I thought about that, the more it bothered me.\n\nLike you, I was perceived as easy going, and I could fit into any social circumstance. But I changed so seamlessly that I did not even know it. And when it was over, I had no "me" to return to. I realized that others might be at peace around me, but my mind was always racing to maintain the manifestation that I wanted.  In truth, I was never relaxed, and I never let my guard down.\n\nYou mention people becoming irrelevant and you becoming bored several times.  You even threaten to delete posts from people you deem irrelevant.  That was me too.  However, life circumstances and some fortuitous encounters changed that.\n\nMy Yogi among others showed me over the years that other people are not stupid, irrelevant, or boring. They are full fledged people with abilities and attributes that I lack. I realized my conceit of the mind was entirely misguided. My mind does fabulous things with what passes for intelligence, so I decided that those were the ones that matter. And then I concluded that people who were not as good at those things are not worth.  Easy to be excellent if you define excellent as being like you.\n\nI also realized that when I was with people I was not really with people. My mind was always off somewhere else solving the problems of some parallel universe. It occurred to me that if I was was truly present with other people, then my judgments about them were suspect.\n\nSo I dived into mindfulness and living in the present.  When judgment or stray thoughts crossed my mind, I recognized and acknowledge them, but let them pass.  The fact that we can choose what to think about is a mind blowing discovery for most INTPs who make it. We all think that our minds run the show and decide what to think about.\n\nThe more present and aware I became around other people, the more I realized that I am someone. There is a me, and to be honest, I like who I am. IO am kind and generous. I like to help people, and I hate to hurt people. I realized that no one knew that person. Hell, I did not know him.\n\nFrom that spawned the realization that no one is boring or irrelevant.  Everyone has something to teach me. Everyone's life is fascinating and compelling story.  I just have to find it. When I quit thinking about other things and judging people I discovered that they were as deep, complex and substantial as I am. From that, I developed friendships and other relationships unlike anything that my smarty smart mind knew before.\n\nIn the end, this left me content. Content sounds like "at peace," but it is not.  It is a feeling of being a person like everyone else, of fitting in, and being satisfied with that.\n\nThe people who know me seem to like me a lot more now, and I certainly like them more, except the ones I do no like. I find that I spend far less time in my mind and more time in my emotions, without letting them control me or run wild. Looking back, I see my former selves as incomplete caricatures.  I see that my mind was running the show for its own purposes and not doing me any favors.  \n\nFor the first time in my life, I feel like a good person. And that turns out to be what I needed all along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to delete.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I don’t think it is a good idea to play any roles. Act like you want to act, be who you want to be and stop caring what others think. \n\nI found the more you do your own thing ( you do what you think is right, no matter what others say/think) the more successful you are.\n\nSuccessful in the sense of money, social status and having a good environment. 
2	I am curious, does your interest in mbti and pyschology extend to Jung? It sounds like what you are describing are different persona. Personae are like masks or hats we wear, depending on the role we play..  they can shift, change, and blend, and we can wear many hats in any given environment or situation. The problem can arise when we confuse our Self with a persona, and self identify with it. Then, when that role ceases to be relevant, it can feel like we have literally lost our very identity. But we are much more than just a singular role we play. \n\nI am female INTP also, and like you, I can relate to the "social chameleon" thing. Part of it is that I am constantly building (reworking) mental models and theories in my head. When a model becomes untenable, it is time to demolish it, and I find I can do this with relative ease without becoming too attached to a particular belief system...but on the other hand, it can be hard to acknowledge you *have* a core belief system at all. Being open to possibilities, I can never truly feel I belong anywhere. I have struggled with exactly this kind of commitment. \n\nYour observation about INTPs and languages is interesting. I can relate to this too. I am extremely language and verbal oriented... not only am I am a very verbal learner, relying a lot on written language, I'm also very interested in studying different languages as a hobby as well. I just find them fascinating, and I enjoy puzzling out new vocabulary and grammatical patterns. 
2	I know you went through a lot of effort through this post but I’m gonna dumb it down to some short form wisdom for you. If you want to we can expand but in short: Stop worrying/concerning yourself with other people problems and focus on your immediate environment. Focus on your own problems and the path that will ultimately lead to you being happy. Let other stupid people be stupid; that will never change and there’s no reason to stress ocer things out of your control. Hope this helps!
2	Funny, I used to think like this. I wanted to be a nobody, because being nobody means you can be everyone, and I fantasized having a full range of diverse experience. I wanted to try different personalities, try different cultures, and observe how people respond to different perceptions. \n\nI’d have taken it a step further with learning accents and inventing cover personas, but I was not skilled nor inclined enough at deception to be willing to make the effort. \n\nNow, I desire the opposite. I am seeking complete congruence and truth in myself, a standard which is by definition for a human to uphold. Therefore, it is a lifelong pursuit with a foregone conclusion, the value of which is contained in the efforts and not results. I’ve realized that not only does my mission require that I be some*one*, it also demands that my mission and myself become synonymous.

1	What up with all the pendrive?
27	To all INTPs who've been able to find love...	Well what exactly is love? I mean, how do you define it? More importantly, how did you know your SO is *the one*.\n\nAnytime I feel an emotion for anybody, I just write it off as an infatuation. I've always felt love is really just an extension of habit. Like you spend so much time with a person, you can't imagine spending life without em. But, had you spent the time with someone else, maybe you would've liked them? I mean, there's 7 freaking billion peeps on the planet. No way there's only one person absolutely right for you.\n\nI realise I'm probably wrong about this. In fact, I'm hoping someone does prove me wrong. So what do you folks think?
26	The problem is, you're looking at the fairy tail version of love with an objective lense.\n\nIn my opinion, these are the traits that are characteristic of what love really is, based on my experience:\n\n-someone who has complementary personality (I'm engaged to an ENFJ, and wherever I'm weak, she isnt, and vice versa - I've known her since I was 12, so said relationship isn't predicated on mbti lol)\n-someone who inspires you (she does what I aspire to do as a person so well and effortlessly, that it baffles me)\n-someone who you have mutual respect with/for (we understand boundaries of one another and dont push them)\n-we can be completely honest with on another without fear of childish consequences \n-we compromise when there are differences \n-we value each others opinions \n-we get one another out of our comfort zones (very important for personal growth)\n- we share enough core values to make things work, but have enough differences to make things interesting \n-we dont have any childish preconceptions of love;we understand people aren't perfect and things require work\n\nEtc, etc. My point is, we all idealize what we want in relationships (unless you're a legitimate psychopath, then you have desires such as this, and you can tell whomever,  whatever,  but you cant lie to yourself), but the reality of them is far from that, so if you come across someone who gets close to that without any effort, and you want to maintain that relationship for the expanse of your conscience experience because it makes it more interesting, that's when you have to put in work. If you wait too long, you risk regretting a lot in life, and it's better to make mistakes because you learn more that way.
13	I've had more than a few intimate and non-intimate encounters with women. When I was a teenager, I was under the impression that love is indeed, something you feel for a single person. And yet, I would find myself casually falling in love with a pretty face, or a casual gesture someone executed without thought. I would even indulge in frivolous thoughts of romance and marriage with an individual I did not know well yet. As I grew up, my sheer greed for sensual experiences drove me (momentarily) to seek more love from women. And yet, quite often it never extended beyond holding hands or kissing. \n\nBut I did find my love. She's emotionally astute, wise beyond her years. She quiet and never loses her temper. She's elegant in thought and indisputably strong-willed. She's married. So we can't be together for now. \n\nFor me, love is about sacrifice. For an INTP, freedom represents home. Choices are very important. If your mind finds love for a person to be an acceptable alternative to having more options, I'd say you've found love. \n\nBut, like a true blue INTP, I can tell you that finding love (and then marriage) is a relatively new concept - only about 200 years old. In the last century, people have been looking for self-actualization or fulfillment in another person. I do not need to tell you folks how misguided this sort of notion is. I can tell you with absolute certainty that no one can find satisfaction in love unless they fulfill the idea they have of love. So, it is necessary to have some realistic notions to associate to love. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn physics, you can make fairly reliable predictions of reality using approximations based on rules that are understood. The exact solution to a sophisticated problem usually cannot be found. Similarly, finding 'One Love' is improbable at best. However, the closest approximation is probably much easier to find. Should you choose. 
9	Well, first off, although the idea of *the* one is romantic, it's also nonsensical.  A person sort of *becomes* the one over time, as you learn about them and they learn about you and you realize you still care about them and they still care about you after all that.\n\nLove is not a feeling, it's an attitude which leads to behaviors:  ^**4** Love is patient, love is kind, it isn’t jealous, it doesn’t brag, it isn’t arrogant, ^**5** it isn’t rude, it doesn’t seek its own advantage, it isn’t irritable, it doesn’t keep a record of complaints, ^**6** it isn’t happy with injustice, but it is happy with the truth. ^**7** Love puts up with all things, trusts in all things, hopes for all things, endures all things. ^**8** Love never fails. - 1 Corinthians 13:4-8\n\nAttraction isn't all there is to love--being in love--it's kind of just the pre-step.\n\nI've been married for 28 years, with the girl I started dating our Senior year in high school 33 years ago.  Yes, it started with attraction: I saw a girl I considered to be *very* pretty walking down the hall one day.  If I hadn't found her incredibly attractive, it might easily have ended there.  But, because I found her unusually attractive, I began looking for her down the hall, and then trying to get her attention (INTP here, so immediate, direct action was sort of out of the question), then smiling back at her, then saying "Hi," or "Good morning," and on and on, until I found a friend who also knew her and got her to introduce us.  Fortunately, for me, she also found me attractive, so we went on a date, and as we got to know more about each other, we found we actually *liked* the kind of person the other was, which led to *falling in love.*  as we spent more time together, finding that we liked most of what we learned about the other, that we liked the way we felt when with each other, that we continued to be physically attracted to each other, we each became *the one* to the other.\n\nCould someone else have been *the one* for me?  Possibly.  Could someone else have been an even better "match" for me?  Also possible, she's an ISFJ, so the way she perceives the world and interacts with it is sometimes almost completely foreign to me.  Do I have any regrets that she became *the one* for me?  None.\n \n\n
4	Love for me is just perfect acceptance - as in, no hesitations or barriers (goes from both sides), i feel drawn to people like that in a strong way. And, mind you, i believe love is infinite and not limited to sexuality at all, thats just what society nowadays has made it out to be.\n\nEven if you write it off as infatuation - and thats what i do too - you can learn to draw strangth from that emotional blunder. Plus,you can enjoy emotions as kind of guilty pleasure i guess, putting them to some good use...\n\nAnd, mathematically, theres a finite amount of people, so one is certain to compliment you better than all others.
5	(You are REALLY good at overanalyzing!)\n\nStep one: meet someone you find extra nice , and something feels a little off because of course that person would not be interested in you. \n\nStep two: keep interacting with said person because it feels so good and of course you know you are extra comfortable around them and that must mean something... like.... maybe... attraction... but of course obviously evidently no way it can be mutual. They are just being nice. \n\nStep three: act a little stupid/out of control around the person. But they don’t seem to think you are weird for it! So cool. Wish someone like them would like you someday...\n\nStep four: kiss/make out with/put the person’s parts inside your parts while you think “WOW this is so fucking good.  I wish someone like them would like me”\n\nStep five: listen to them telling you a funny story. Laugh hard. Blurt out “hahaha you are the greatest”. Awkward silence. Feel extra super uncontrollably energetic when talking to them. \n\nStep six: admit that they actually like/love you. They were not just being nice. And that odd feeling of wanting to hug/kiss/squeeze/touch/be around/please them is actually love.\n\nStep six: definitely let go around them. Enjoy! Shower them with affection. Tell them about your plans for the next 100 years. Blurt out “I love you too, forever” when they say they love you. Feel afraid for a second. Feel reassured after they don’t judge you, but give you a looooong long kiss instead.\n\nStep seven: think to yourself “wow! I’m so damn lucky” whenever they remind of how good it feels to be with someone that makes you feel so comfortable. Do everything in your power to make sure they feel as loved and appreciated as you do\n\n(Bonus: try out some cool sex toys!)
3	Idk either. But I always realize it the moment they are gone. There's just that special feeling. Love is ephemeral so I can't quantify it with mere words.
3	I met my INFJ GF at school. We both studied animation. Basically, we just found that we're really compatible and kept meeting up in the computer labs over the summer. Eventually we went on dates and never stopped. Now we're looking to get an apartment together.\n\nWhen I was looking for love, my criteria was 5 things. You can use these or figure out your own, but I think it's important to know what you're looking for.\n\n1. Am I attracted to her?\n2. Do I respect her?\n3. Can we have fun together?\n4. Can we work through things together?\n5. Do I feel positive emotions when I'm with her?\n\nThe 4 and 5 take more time to discover but 1-3 you can assess fairly early on usually in that order too.\n\nAlso #5 is hard to assess in general. I don't feel very strongly about anything so that took a lot of time. You can also mistake anxiety for positive emotions. It's kinda like that cliche "Take her to ride roller coasters as a first date. She'll attribute the adrenaline rush to loving you" advice. Your crushes can induce anxiety which make you think that's love. Try to learn the difference between those. \n\nIn my opinion, love should feel like he or she is your best friend, family, and a sexual partner all at the same time. If it goes long term, that's literally what they become. A best friend/family member you have sex with. Sounds weird but think about it.\n\nYou could also take the MBTI approach. They have 4 "mates" you can have.\n\nMind mate\nSharing your thoughts and ideas\n\nSoul mate\nSharing your emotions\n\nPlay mate\nHaving fun together\n\nWork mate\nBeing able to work together effectively\n\nI'm oversimplifying but it's something to consider researching yourself. Me and my INFJ are the first 3 and we're slowly building to work mates. I think mind mates for INTPs are a must have. We identify with our ideas pretty heavily. I also think playmates is a necessity for any pairing. Being able to have fun is kind of like a safety net. If you're going through tough times and can still laugh or have fun together, you'll make it through anything.\n\nTo your point, infatuation can turn into love but you're looking for compatibility. I don't feel like I can't imagine a life without her but I've decided I want her in my life. I think that's the key. You could fall in love with anyone and life could be great with anyone, but you choose this person. Don't think about finding the one, just find someone and see where it goes. 
3	"The one" doesn't exist. Given the size of the planet and the number of people, the chance of you being born within travel distance of "the one" is infinitesimal. Truth is that there are multiple compatible people out there and it is a bit of random luck which determines who you'll bond with.
3	Monster answer to a monster question, but semblance of an answer as someone who, once over, had the same perspective as you voice.\n\nI understand love by comparing my first and last ‘long term’ relationship.\n\n**First relationship.**\n\nWe’d a lot of reasons / excuses to fall apart (as individuals and as a couple), but the more life threw at us the closer and stronger we became. Everyone thought it must be ‘true love’. But we were more like two comrades in the trenches than star crossed lovers.\n\nWe shared some of the most formative years of our lives, and some of the darkest. But we were fighting for an end, an afterwards, a beyond, ultimately; we'd have just ended up fighting each other once there was nothing more or left external to fight together, and we knew it. It weren’t love. It were survival.\n\nSo, happily, we served our time together for four years and then parted ways.\n\n**Last relationship**.\n\nTwo years in, he told me: *I love you.* Then, without waiting for a response, he went to make coffee. I realised, he hadn’t said it expecting or demanding a response – he just wanted me to know it: I was loved, *without condition*.\n\nTook another two years (in true INTP fashion), but I also realised and told him: *I love you too*. He just replied: *I know*. Then, got up, adding: *and one day, I’m going to ask you to marry me.*\n\nThough it weren’t natural to him, he made a constant effort to tell rather than ask, to hope rather than demand, to wait (often, for years) rather than push, and to *look* for answers rather than *listen* for them, in the meantime; that is how he knew I loved him even before I did, and part of why I love(d) him.\n\nTo return the respect and love he showed, I made a constant effort too. Ended up telling him things I hadn't even admitted to myself; he made me feel safe enough to explore my feelings like I never had alone, or with anyone else.\n\nSounds ironic, but it actually is both the reason my heart broke when, after a decade, we split and the reason I didn’t break; love empowers you to be you in the truest sense and say no to loved one's bs aspects. And we all have them. And, sometimes, they are so strong, we have to use what loved ones taught *us* against them – to be true to our authentic selves, and try remind them of theirs.\n\nEven now, he’s the only person I have ever said *I love you* to. And I would have married him,  would still, but if he taught me what love is and that I am capable of it, reality taught us both that sometimes, even love ain’t enough...but love is possible.\n\nAnyhow, and **in conclusion**, if my first ex and I were like comrades, united by being on and fighting for the same side / outcome, despite being polar opposites as people; my last ex and I were like two lost soldiers from *opposite* sides who met in no man’s land and, faced with each other, realised –our differences were entirely superficial; beneath the uniforms (of class and culture) and separate languages (of verbal vs body), we were united in all the stuff that we both individually held dear and believed mattered.\n\nAnd *that*, I think is the difference between being *with* someone (and even being relatively happy with someone) and being *in love* with someone (even when and even though love don’t guarantee a fairytale 'happy ever after').
2	Yes, I think you're basically right, but it's a good not a bad thing that there is no "the one".  Love is as much a process and state of mind as some emotional epiphany, and the love for one person is not necessarily the same as the love for another.  It's a very per-relationship sort of state.  There are many in the world we could find love and happiness with and none would feel quite alike.
2	When you can't wait for the very weekends, that you used to look forward to, to get over so you can see them on Monday, which becomes the best day of your week. Am I an INTP? Because almost all the time, I am calculating, overthinking, finding the most efficient way to do things. I am always in control and never am swayed by my emotions, except when anxiety takes over and I can't do anything then, no matter how hard I try. Like you said, there can't be only one person out of 7 billion specimen, who fits the bill for you. Sometimes, even I wonder if I will find someone, who possesses exactly the same specifications, or something quite close to, what I desire. I can't be with someone who is totally different from what I have in mind, even if that means staying alone forever. At least, that's the way I feel now. After a few years, when I see my friends getting married and starting their own families, maybe I will change. I don't know. The best and the worst things about the future is uncertainty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To add, I, also feel, love is when you just completely accept a person. Their shortcomings, their faults, nothing matters.
2	It's a long term mutually beneficial arrangement that continues to add value that you couldn't create on your own
2	I'm dating an ENTJ and "love" him more than any other person I've met. The main difference between this relationship and every other one is the amount of RESPECT I have for him. He challenges me, makes me laugh, teaches me new things, understands my random trains of thought/ideas enough to respond intelligently . . . and he respects/appreciates me right back. (Every single day, without fail, I feel this way.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of my other relationships have formed through infatuation and then sunk into a "friendship" (from inside jokes, shared experiences, disclosure of secrets, etc.). I've ended every other relationship because I knew I wasn't "in love" (i.e., "unquestionably full of respect for") those people. Plus, I didn't think those people fully appreciated my intellect (appreciate meaning: value OR realize the extent of), either, and so I felt like I was wasting my time even trying with them in a romantic way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of "romance," I am not romantic. I don't indulge in feelings of "lovey-dovey-ness." Rather, my version of romance is donating my time/energy/attention to my significant other so we can genuinely bond. In the past, if I ever gave myself up like that and felt like I wasn't receiving something genuine/intellectually deep/transforming, I knew I wanted and deserved better. I think it is partially a matter of realizing your worth. Good luck.
2	Love isn't about finding the one best person out of 7 billion people. That's ridiculous to expect. You can love anyone as long as you have a genuinely great time when you're with them and they have boobs. 
1	Love is your involuntary response to virtue if you are virtuous
1	Oh yeah. I feel even if you love someone you can most certainly have feelings for others.  
1	You get what you think basically.  Just relax and stop overthinking it. If you write everything off as infatuation then that's all you'll get.
1	well, what I do know is that it lasts 3 years, yet we based our entire society on the idea that two people of the opposite gender should screw eachother for the entirety of their life
1	I think it is nonsense that one has to look far and wide for 'the one'. Let's see. Wasn't there research done on how many people you actually meet in your life? And to what degree? You have your family, co-workers, acquaintances and friends. Some randoms. All in all a few hundred, at most.\n\nIn that small pool of possible mates people find 'the one'. \n\nI think most people are compatible. If not, there would be few, let's say, successful copulations to produce children. \n\nThere is a lot of talk on places about MBTI on what type goes well together. But if that is true, these small pools of people you meet must have all the types right there. \n\nI think love just means giving someone you feel some sort of attraction to - not even truly necessary - enough benefit of doubt to get past the fact they scratch their ass or pick their nose the wrong way.\n\nMost people can be lived with. Plenty of touching, produce some funny peptides and voila, a relationship blooms. With friends wondering what the hell they even see in each other. \n\nIn a pool of a hundred people there might be at least 20 you could spend a life with. Then again, half of the marriages fail, so whatever number you like to come up with, divide by two.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Love is a pain in the ass.
1	> what is love?\n\nA mutually beneficial feedback loop, plus powerful hormones and chemicals.
1	In my only 2 meaningful relationships (first one probably just had the illusion of one actually), we thought we were meant for each other because we had the same definition of love and were equally as bad at taking things slow. Compatibility seems to be determined by the things both partners have in common and their tolerance levels for other stuff.\n\nFor example, I consider it love if a woman and I are fulfilled by pursuing goals together, but I can never be with someone who comes too close to micro-managing me.
1	I don't know my SO is *the one,* and I don't really believe in that.  There are definitely people you're going to be more compatible with, and vibe better with, but the majority of successful relationships require work.  I don't think there's one special person out there that is just perfect for you,  so I do agree with you there.  I do also have to note I'm asexual, and believed myself to be for a sometime aromantic as well, until fairly recently.\n\nIn my case, comparing a past relationship to my current, I realized quite quickly that I was neither in love with nor would be able to grow to love my ex. With my current SO, falling in love was easy, and I made the decision to take the plunge.  It was an entirely different experience from being with my ex.  So I do draw a distinction between infatuation and love.  With my current SO, it feels ...safe.  Comfortable. I think of being unconditionally supportive, of making them happy and caring for him, despite the effort, as something I want to do, rather than something I should.  It's a pleasure rather than a duty.    I don't feel like I owe it to him.  I suppose after all that what I'm trying to say is love is a choice?
1	there are various kinds of love. probably as many as there are people.\n\nto me, is being happy with someone you cannot imagine your life without any more.
881	My brain is also like this.	
66	I finally just decide to bookmark it, and still tell myself I’ll get back to it eventually... I don’t know if I’ve ever actually opened something back up from my bookmarks yet.
42	And then you accidentally close one and it bothers you for the rest of the week
14	Download Pocket for Chrome. It also has an app so you can read things saved on your phone and vice versa.
14	I have :) number of tabs open. It’s all important stuff. 
10	I only have 5 currently. Husband (INTJ) has six, all of which are Wiki pages checked for the purpose of proving somebody wrong...
9	Yep. Had the same tab open to a phono pre-amp I'm considering buying for over a month now. 
10	Only 67? Ha.
9	Does anyone else use multiple browsers just to keep their tabs organized?
9	I don't even kid myself at this point. Plus the excess tabs is overwhelming.
5	Huh, I don’t do this. Or at least, extremely rarely
3	Touché.\n\nEvery time I open Chrome on my mobile, I'm greeted with :D\n
3	I’m constantly at the 500 tab limit on my phone. 
2	I keep my posting history tab open, renewing it regularly, because I am to lazy to retype the same paragraphs over and over again. Same argument, different day.
2	DAE keep tabs open to remind themselves of something? I have a Google search of Full Metal Jacket open to get around to telling a friend to watch it. It's been... about a month.
2	Guilty as charged. 67 tabs is a rookie thing though. Also 67 ongoing things in the mental todo list.
2	Get the Tab Snooze Chrome extension! You can schedule a tab to open up later
2	Then your system auto resets and it's gone, gone....
2	I’m strangely protective of my tabs, like don’t delete any I need all of them okay
2	thank god for pocket
1	My mobile chrome crashes once a month coz of all the tabs. Whaddya think? :/
1	I tab things I'm pretty sure I'm coming back to. If I don't come back to it for like, a month, I clear them. For ones I know I'm not coming back to, I close the tab. I've got 3 rn :D
1	Oh m, just 67. Try 133.
1	I have over 100 tabs open on my phone \nI’ve been hoarding them since like... at least 6 months ago
1	my browser only allows 50 tabs :(
1	It's called OneTab 
1	I think I once counted 150 open tabs at one time.  I've gotten better....
1	Why is this a thing? Its extremely inefficient. Just look the shit up again if you're trying to go back.
1	Only one tab? Lol. Lets just say I know after 99 tabs open, mobile chrome gives up and replaces the numbers with :)
1	Ones I can afford to put off are tabbed; ones demanding my attention aren't, with relatively important ones to the left and urgent to the right. God bless tabbing btw learned about it only a few years ago. Right click your tabs for more fun tricks, guys!
1	leave my google chrome app smiley face alone
1	Still have tabs opened from planning a trip 5 years ago. Damn you Safari I'm spoiled.\n\n(Total tan >300 damn me)
1	I think I have 70 tabs open on my phone
1	My reading list is pregnant. 
1	There's over 1,000 tabs through 20 saved windows (in like seven google accounts).\n\nThank you, Tabli.\n\nAlternatively, however, when it comes to my brain, if I don't act on or seize an idea almost immediately, it's safe to say the idea is gone forever. As such, I have to handle my mindscape accordingly because choosing to stick to old structures I've built is boring and restrictive.
1	TooManyTabs\n\nSome of the webpages I have saved in there don't even exist anymore.
1	Try 2 months. I've been meaning to try this cheesecake recipe the first... Chance... I get...
1	This is why I had to download the browser add-on "OneTab." When the year started, I had over 300 tabs in OneTab. Now I only have 202 tabs open in OneTab.\n\nI know what you're thinking. I know, because I'm thinking it too, but I need *all* of these tabs. They're important.
1	Forget about tabs, you should see my youtube watch later list, i have videos there for 2 years and i won't delete it because i may open it any minute now
1	*months
1	Its still there since september
1	I was using this SnoozeTab thing for a while that made them go away but pop up again at some point in the future.  Just resulted in resnoozing anyway.
1	I eventually decide to close them when they become too many for it to be comfortable
1	Me with the autohotkey tutorial
1	The tab bar on my phones chrome browser just has an infinity symbol these days...
1	59 tabs on phone, 12 on laptop
1	it lags so i close them all, don't have this issue lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut this is essentially hoarding, which i do a lot with other stuff
1	Get OneTab. Condenses all yer tabbos into one neat tabbo
8	INTP's and weed	When I'm sober, I can half ass a conversation with anyone and they'll never realise that I honestly don't want to be talking to them. When I smoke though, I'm very picky about my company. \n\nEither you'll be interesting enough for me to have a mind blowing conversation with, or I won't give you an second of my time. Anyone else feel this way?
7	I'm actually the exact opposite. When i'm sober, i'm much more irritable and i really have to pick and choose my battles with regards to whom i can speak to. I'm succinct and a bit standoff-ish with 90% of people. However after i've smoked, i'm a lot friendlier and talkative. Being high allows me to be much more patient with everyone around me.
4	Weed helped me become alcoholic. It's a love-hate relationship.
5	I feel as if when I'm sober I can easily put on a facade and shut people up but when I smoke or something I'm way more picky with who I'm around and cant stand people who dont understand me as a person and just have npc lives

1	You sail in such a specified lane. 
1	Im curious about altered mental statuses.  If they werent illegal here, I would try marijuana and LSD, just once.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIve gotten drunk before.  Well, not really drunk.  Buzzed, you could say.  Light headed, tingly, floaty, happy, laughing my butt off, couldn't walk straight, etc.  I remember all of it, and still had my self control.  \n\n(It's true, the more you drink, the more you want to drink.  I had the self control to limit myself, and not go too far.  I drank tons of water with it, so I didnt get sick or hungover.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was an incredible experience.  I was experimenting with myself, really, trying to learn as much as I could.  LOL\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, I value my unaltered mental state too much to be high/drunk all the time.  I'd miss my intelligence.  And besides, Ive had far too many ancestors die of cirrhotic livers, and im not gonna join them. 
1	Alcohol makes me enjoy any event, weed amplifies my reception of things. So if anything is annoying to me while high, it'll be REALLY annoying. I wouldn't say weed makes me picky, in fact I think it broadens my field of interest. It does amplify some negative emotions however, like for example any loud noise becomes much noisier and disturbing.           \n\nEither way, if I am really stoned at a social event, I don't have the neurological dexterity to move from a couch to another couch, which means I become really un-picky about who's keeping me company, just for the sake of keeping my seat.
1	Not for me. If I smoke weed I become extremely incoherent. I start to mutter a lot, ideas I normally could talk about or explain when sober become hard as hell to talk about when stoned. I remember an incident when I guy I met on the bus asked me about a Kierkegaard book I was reading, I was high as hell and I sounded like a total idiot trying to explain it to him lol. 
1	I'd really love to smoke weed with an INTP, no one I know even comes to understanding me when I'm high. This is why I smoke alone most of the time 
4	procrastinate too much	anyone else in here that procrastinates too much? Like I'll procrastinate anything and everything to the point where i start hating myself.\n\nseriously, it's so bad right now and i don't know how to stop it.

1	Typology help	Recently I've come to learn a bit of typology to help me manage my social difficulties by better understanding people. However, I'm not too sure which are the best sources for such information. Youtube channels I have taken interest in are C.S Joseph, Talking With Famous People,  INTJ & INFP Coffee, DaveSuperPowers and Eric Thor. Does anyone know which is best for learning to type others? And what are the sites for accurate and reliable information? \n\n# 
2	Ben Vaserlan added a huge amount to my understanding of typology. In watching his videos my understanding and framework(s) became a lot more robust and complete.
4	I have turned into an asshole	Before you guys says: "omg, that's so me" bc we're all pieces of shits, I'd like to emphasise something... I see the value of positive social interactions, and playing along with the social norms of society. It provides me with a framework for interactions etc... It doesn't take a lot of mental gymnastics to see what I mean here, so I'll just jump right to the point.\n\nI currently live with my ESFJ grandmother, and Jesus fucking christ.... She keeps thinking out loud, but the twist is that she expects a response....? As I'm writing this, she is talking to me, asking what animal might have walked past her window in the snow. She has asked me this at least five times a week since the snow stuck to the ground (4 months ago) and I have told her on numerous occasions that it is probably the neighbour's cat, since I have seen it. What is worse, is that every time she says something I have to pay attention, because if I choose to not answer the SAME THING SHE HAS SAID 1 MILLION TIMES BEFORE she starts sulking. As you can probably tell, this is something I find quite infuriating, especially since I have had to deal with this for 6 months now (finally leaving in three weeks btw).\n\nHowever, I do not like this turn in my patience, considering it used to be much more durable. For instance, I get annoyed by just hearing her voice now, and she's not a bad person. There are not enough rational reasons as for me to be this annoyed with her... It almost bled out-to my professional life, and I will not burn bridges when it is not necessary. \n\nI am probably writing this to vent, however, regardless of that I do wish to read your thoughts on this, if you do have any. Similar experiences and such, idk
6	How does this make you an asshole? ESFJs are just annoying people, simple as that. My mom is an ESFJ and perhaps my least favorite person I've ever met. But it's not because I'm an asshole. It's because our personalities just don't get along. That's just part of life. They are our opposites in every way.
5	My mom is like this... I'm on week 3 of being back home (long-term) for the first time in over 6 years. Your sentiments are almost dead-on with mine. I love my mom so much. She is such a good person and she has done so much for me. But holy FUCK do I wish she would Shut. The. Fuck. Up. I have another two months before I leave. Idk what to do. She's killing me slowly, I'm sure of it. I have no real point here, just using your vent as an excuse to vent. Good luck! Haha. 
4	I think you, as an introvert, are annoyed with her that much, because it has been going on for 6 months now. Living with someone, who demands your attention probably all the time, is extremely exhausting. That might be why your patience is getting thin. But once you get your space, you'll be more patient again. I guess. 
3	I dated an ESFJ and that sulking... omg i swear.. Idk if he thought he was hiding it or what but it irritated me so much. \n\nIt's passive "no I'm fine" continues to act distant and disinterested in everything. \n\nAt the time I had patience and just tried to talk to him calmly. \n\nOfc it wasn't until I gentally calmed down the annoyed cat that he finally comes out and says it. \n\n"You show your cat more affection than you do me"\n\nAt the time I responded with soft words. \n\nToday however... with hindsight of my overly kind self that neglected to see the problem with this. \n\nID FUCKING MURDER THUS PERSON! (Not literally) \n\nBut gosh.. so many times he would talk about his interests but be so damn obviously bored when I talked about mine. \n\nI swear they're open books. He would boast about how he knows the intentions of this other person, and how he knows how they see him. \n\nI'm shaking my head the entire time thinking "he's  seriously not as smart as he thinks he is" \n\nNot all ESFJ are that bad though! \n\nI had a friend in collage, we spoke now and again and she was a complete nerd of Doctor Who. She would certainly speak aloud everything on her mind, which I was alright with. \n\nBut if you spend too long in their company it becomes competative and a chore to keep up. \n\nMy grandmother is an ESFJ and she loves to talk. I like that because she will talk to herself and as long as I nod and act like I agree, there's no passive aggressive \n\n"oh if you want to be difficult, sure it's fine, whatever " (she does not vividly say that, but you sure as hell know that's what shes thinking) 
3	On the subject of patience, I wonder if we are actually good or bad at it. Like, I can showcases some control, but it's a bit like starting projects, I don't finish it.\n\n
2	I see you accommodating her, but does she accommodate you? Any onesided interaction becomes old very quickly.
2	I think your definition of "asshole" is based on someone else's evaluation of your actions.\n\nTelling someone the truth with an intent to hurt them is being an asshole. Telling someone the truth to help them isn't, even if they get hurt by it, or even "hurt" by it.\n\nNot hanging your life, thoughts, or emotional state on someone else's need for validation isn't being an asshole either. They will say you are, but it's because you aren't feeding what they have come to crave being fed. What they are addicted to.
1	1. I’m not even remotely a piece of shit. Don’t know where you got that idea from. \n\n2. Like all emotions, being pissed off can be, and often is, pretty fucking irrational. Trying to rationalise why you’re irrationally pissed off while you’re irrationally pissed off is a great way to misattribute your frustration to things or people that don’t deserve it (like grandma, who seems lovely), but it won’t make you feel better. \n\n3. Accept that you’re pissed off, sit there and feel pissed off for a while, and you’ll feel better. Then when you aren’t pissed off anymore you’ll be clearheaded enough to figure out the actual reason you were pissed off in the first place, and calm enough to address it. \n\n4. You’re in a shit mood. It happens. It passes. There’ll be plenty more. Get your shit together.

3	Do you guys connect to the lyrics of this song?	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ3V50XoLOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ3V50XoLOM)\n\n(turn on subtitles)\n\nsorry not sure if this is against the rules but this is something i feel deeply connected to\n\nOften than not i feel like making a decision takes so much effort, especially decisions about what i want for the future.  Sometimes i'd doubt my own decisions and listen to others, but then different people would tell me conflicting opinions.\n\nThere's just don't seem to be the absolute right thing to choose for, everything can be good or bad right?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's why this song really resonate with me, in that i really want to make decisions for myself and take on my own responsibilities, i guess it's the idea of freedom and the consequences of having the freedom to make choices.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Analysis paralysis. Indecisive af. A year later and I still haven't decided where to *really* work.\nI get ya.
24	Anyone have issues with relationships just drifting away	Its hard to explain, but it like a thing for me. Except my parents and family a lot of my friend relationships drift away. Its hard finding a clique 
17	If you find out how to prevent this let me know.  I cannot keep a relationship going on my own initiative.  I fear a successful relationship as much as an unsuccessful relationship because of what a relationship could mean in life.  I find that sometimes that it is best to avoid relationships just to avoid a big what if in life, fear.
10	It's this thing where you lock yourself up and time passes and you are stuck in a rut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmy closest families and even people i am in relationship with, they seem to only know a fragment of me because i am so good at hiding myself (unconsciously) , you tell different people who don't know me well enough and you get all kinds of descriptions, sometimes even closed ones, and those who can't put up with it drifts away, i think you need more awareness of the reality.
3	How old are you?
3	Its the same for me. I am not always texting or something and so it can happen that I don't communicate with someone for some weeks or even months.\nWhat I would need is a level of relationship where we can always meet. What I mean by that is that the trust-level and friendship-level does not drop passively when we don't see each other. When we see we would just start where we left and all would be fine.\nBut I did not found anyone who would agree in that yet :/ \nOr maybe my approach is false.\nHope this make sense for you ^^
2	Your friendships are probably going to be something that arises out of a common interest or hobby and not something you can really easily create from nothing.\n\nAs a college student I'd probably recommend putting forward the effort to find a society that interests you. Chess club, DnD group are the stereotypical stuff.\n\nPersonally, I've had great luck getting stuck into cooking classes.
1	Nope.
1	I know from past experience that what most people would think are "friends" to me will end up either stabbing me ruthlessly in the back or carelessly drift away. What others think of as "friends" are simply acquaintances to me. Being social is overrated, anyways.
0	Adults don't have friendships. Get over your childhood. Adults who spend time together have mutual business interests (eg, that's what "marriage" is), and pretend to be friends to smooth out the process of becoming corporatized robots. Upon instructions from higher-ups (promotions), old "friends" are expended for new ones. 
30	Emotions as data	Hey guys. I’ve made a lot of personal growth this year. And I discovered something interesting while getting more in touch with my emotions. \n\nWhen I start to feel something I trust it completely. I don’t try to put logic on top of it, explain it away as irrational, etc. I see all of my emotional responses as coming from some rational place. Even if they don’t suit the present moment, they are still rationally produced from something else. \n\nFor example, I had a panic attack today. I knew there was no real threat guiding me to feel panicked. But the panic attack started with adrenaline. And then shifted to panic. And then shifted to dissociation. Getting in touch with my emotions, and my anxiety specifically, has allowed me to map the occasions on which I feel the most phobic, learn what actually triggers my anxiety, my panic, and my dissociation. I can then look back through my history to uncover why this was my emotional response and deconstruct the maladaptive emotions, while understanding they come from a real place instead of allowing them to generalize to everything.\n\nHope that helps.
20	Ahhh, the maturing INTP is such a nice sight to behold. \nBut on the real- good for you m8. Glad to hear you're improving.
3	Yes. This is helpful. 
5	Emotions are our guidance system. 
3	Your going somewhere 😉. I've downloaded past life data via emotions and when your rational mind is not in the way it can be quite expansive, it's a work of art. 
3	Emotions without logic is no more destructive than logic without emotions. Denying one is denying half of yourself, which isn't logical.\n\nThis is literally how I start that path myself. Logic can explain all emotion too, some are just way harder than others. Someday I expect to also find that emotion can explain all logic, since it doesn't make sense that it's one sided, but I'm not there yet.
2	To continue on this, you can identify the origin, or the why of emotions. It's actually all based in evolutionary psychology. For example, Fear and Anger correspond to "Fight vs Flight."\n\n[Here's a good article](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/emotion-wheel/). Don't be fooled by the title. The stuff about the 8 primary emotion, on 4 axis of sort, and the combination giving you the whole spectrum of emotion is interesting.
2	Ive been maturing in this area recently.  Starting to learn to use it.\n\nIf im upset, it's me telling myself "Something is rotten in Denmark!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart of mastering your emotions isnt just about stopping them from clouding your reason and controlling you;\n\n*but to accept them and use them.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's what the Vulcans missed.

14	Any music creators here?	On my own I'm learning keyboard, guitar, music theory, music composition, and how to use DAW software (digital audio workstation) on my PC to create my own music. I'm finding it all to be pretty easy to understand, but there's just a lot to learn before I have enough technical knowledge to start developing my own songs. It's all very new and fascinating. What's been your experience in this field? \n\n&#x200B;
4	I've been playing and recording for a few years, the biggest thing I struggle with is actually learning new pieces, because there is a huge difference between understanding and playing. Some of the best musicians just play a lot and that's how they're good, but it was never like that for me. It's really easy to get stuck playing the same things you already know, so I'd really recommend chasing down your ideas and not giving up on them, also playing with others can spark inspiration.
2	keep up the good work 
2	I'm right there with you brother\n\n[here](https://soundcloud.com/p-a-r-a-d-e)
2	Just try your best to focus on one thing at a time. I know it's your nature to keep hopping around, but you'll see results quicker if you zero in on one thing. And I don't even mean *one* instrument. That's far too restricting to ever work for an INTP. Perhaps instead, come up with an idea of a composition and make it a point to get it done. That way, you have actual parameters and it'll become much more clear what you need to work on to make it a reality; which instruments you need to get better at, which plugins you need to master to get the sound you want, which aspects of the DAW you need to become more familiar with, etc. My biggest hurdle has always been work-flow. I'm always tweaking the instrument itself, running one thing through the EQ, swapping out this hat or that snare... 3 hours later I realize I'm still on the basic intro drums and I've totally lost where I wanted to go with the track.  It's agonizing. But try to reel yourself back in every time you notice it, almost like meditation if you've ever done that. Good luck, OP, and NEVER STOP CREATING!

1	I have a big interest in this, but I am just starting too. The digital side of things actually inspired me back to the basics so I've been learning piano and guitar scales and music theory but eventually I'll get around to producing something with LMMS or Fruity Loops. Also it inspired a love for analog synths that hit me out of nowhere lol.\n\nI'm going on a long distance thru hike soon this year but I'm trying to learn about how I can hook a midi instrument to my phone and record into FL Studio Mobile to make on the go music with tiny keyboards and synths.
1	don't skimp on the basics
1	I would absolutely love to learn how to make electronic music but have never been able to successfully do it despite trying on and off for years
1	First of all. Keep at it. :) After years of training on my own, mind you (I never had the means for a singing teacher), I now can call myself a singer without fear of embarrassing myself.\n\nRight now I am at the same point where you are, wanting to learn about music composition and I was wondering if someone had some starting tips for INTP musicians, like with which subjects to start and similar stuff, since I have the curse and blessing, as I imagine many here have, of being capable of learning everything with easy about the subject once they understand the system and once they learn to keep on a subject. It's the same with anything else, for example languages.\n\nAnyway, good luck with it. 😜
1	While I've been learning about Music theory and DAWs, I was feeling like this reminded me of computer programming, which I used to do and I was good at it. I found an article which explains why musical composers are also good at computer programming. Here it is:\n\n[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/anthony-hughes/composing-code-why-musici\_b\_10714288.html](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/anthony-hughes/composing-code-why-musici_b_10714288.html)\n\nSo now I feel like I have a good reason to believe that I have a big leg up in this field and I can be a good musical composer.  The article says that both composers & coders are analytical, logical and methodical. It also says both music & coding are about recognizing and manipulating patterns. Shit, my brain is all about those things. That's naturally what I do all the time.

2	I’m unsure how much it’ll help, but my biggest sleep issues seem to come from having too much energy, so I just wear the hell out of myself throughout the day (do motion-y things, spend dead time walking around the block or something, try to avoid sitting down whenever you don’t absolutely have to). My mind and my legs (which are usually jittering) are too tired to keep me up when I lay down after a day like that, and as a result I’ve been sleeping pretty amazingly recently

2	I’m more frustrated by people that just repeat the same statement over and over.  Each time you address the statement and explain why it is a bad idea, and they repeat the statement again.\n\nMy wife does this a lot, usually because she didn’t get the answer out of me that she expected/wanted, so she assumes I didn’t respond at all.  So by the time round 3 comes around I get angry, tell her I answered her and how.   At that point she realizes she wasn’t actually listening.\n\nThen I feel bad for getting angry and she feels bad for not getting it and tuning out.   After that we make up and have fun.
1	People hate me when I try drop one. So I've learned to just talk about them with my best friend, and some cool teachers, and keep it at that.
1	What is your blood type?	My blood type is O- which means I can donate my blood to anyone _but_ I can only receive O-. It is quite rare and apparently there is certain characteristics of people with O- blood that is different from the rest of the population. There is also claims that O- blood is of alien origin (there are a lot of absurd theories), because it does not contain the Rhesus  factor and this comes from our ape ancestors.\n\nA lot of the "characteristics" of people with O- blood are very similar to the characteristics of people with the INTP personality type such as:\n(Yes some of them are quite silly and very far fetched)\n\nA feeling of not belonging\n\nTruth seekers\n\nSense of a “Mission” in life\n\nEmpathy & Compassion for Mankind\n\nAn extra rib or vertebra\n\nHigher than average IQ\n\nESP Ability\n\nLove of Space & Science\n\nMore sensitive vision & other senses.\n\nIncreased of psychic/intuitive abilities\n\nLower body temperature\n\nHigher blood pressure (some say lower)\n\nPredominantly blue, green, or Hazel eyes\n\nRed or reddish tint to hair color\n\nIncreased sensitivity to heat & sunlight\n\nUnexplained Scars￼\n\nEmpathetic Illnesses\n\nAbility to disrupt electrical devices\n\nExperience strange unexplained phenomenon\n\nPsychic Dreams\n\nCannot be cloned\n\n. You are thought of as a person who is cold emotionally.\n\n Being the INTP that I am, I've been researching quite a lot and I'm very curious  to see if there is any correlation with blood type and personality. So if you know your blood type, write it below! Thanks!

7	O- are more likely to reply to this thread (me too).\n\nWhat is the name of this bias?
12	As much crap as the MBTI gets for not being based in science and not producing useful results, it is still miles better than any science I have ever seen on blood type correlating to personality traits. This is likely another pseudoscience that has actually been used to discriminate against people for no objective reason. I am interested in where you pulled your traits through, as the ones that I have seen have O's as being easy going, leadership types ([for instance](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/japanese-blood-type/#blood-type-o)).\n\nThough, for completeness, I am B+.
5	INTJ, O-\n\nAlso stats person, take into account blood type proportions. And similarly there is a selection bias, since those that know their blood type are much more likely to be types that can donate blood to larger groups. I know my blood type after getting blood tests done, and being told that I should maybe consider donating blood. While it’s literally on the lab report, many people don’t actually read the lab report unless they are interested or told in some way that their blood type was somehow relevant.

1	Conspiracy theorists have complete J logic
1	There are as many dumb coincidence theorists. Both groups are large and nebulous. It's easy to cherry pick unflattering examples from either side.\n\nTo uncritically agree with authority is just as retarded as stringing random pictures together on a pinboard. And it's far less entertaining.

5	A few INTPs with counterculture ideas that I think are worth [binge]watching	I've found a few elders that I think we should listen to. I'm just using my own intuition on this 😉 but I'm fairly sure these outside the box thinking world changers are INTPs.\n\n\nThese guys get demonized for their ideas a lot in the media and mainstream academia by people that incorrectly summarize their lectures in short sound bytes and click bait headlines, but if you listen to their words I think you'll find some truths contained in the online audio and video content you can find from these heavy hitters:\n\n\nAlan Watts - Reality, Religion\n\nPaul Stammets - Mycological Research\n\nRichard Feynman - Badass quirky physicist\n\nMike Maloney - Financial Wizard\n\nMilton Friedman - Political Philosopher Extrordinaire\n\n\nSearch my recommendations above and watch few lectures on your favorite interwebz streaming service. Go overload your Ti and thank me later 😁 \n\n\nEdit: Formatting; Also, please tell me of others you know like this that are being ignored or swept under the rug. We have to stand on the shoulders of giants see anything of clarity these days.
2	I would add Richard Bach and Carlos Castaneda.
2	Check out Gatto's underground history
4	* Allan Watts is ENFP. \n* Feyman is commonly typed as ENTP.  \n* Friedman could be an INTP, but not sure.\n\nNever heard of the others, so I can't tell. I know this, though. Not everyone who says thing you like/think are true are INTPs "elders".\n\nI did the same mistake before, followed by research in other stuff they said and mini-worship until I found something wrong with what they said (=> Idols destroyed). \n\nDunno if it's worth telling you, maybe it's a cycle or stage we all must go through ?\n\n
8	What’s the best way for us to get into dating?	
20	Try to be funny. Actually talk to people. Hope for the best\n\nIt sucks.
11	Talk to enough people until you find one that you are compatible with.
11	Talking, presenting your meme collection, and dropping knowledge bombs so they become interested.
7	Me, before I EVER date someone, I want to at least be best friends with them first.  \n\nI dont understand how people can just date someone they barely know.  There is no foundation!  It's an artificial and forced bond, it seems.  It's skipping a step.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be best friends with someone, and date (or rather, court) when we cannot go further as only best friends.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, Ive never been in a relationship with anyone, so...
6	Hahah. We dont.
2	Have you tried online dating? I’m not a fan of it personally but it’s one of the few ways you can find people you’re interested in who are are also interested in romance/whatever. 
2	Friends of friends.\n\nUnfortunately those are all male for me.
2	Probably using one app like Tinder like everyone else.
1	   I’m super shy and the handful of times Iv ever actually put myself out there and got rejected...well let’s just say a cringe just ran through my body. Whenever I like someone instead of trying to get to know them I am pretty much only capable of ogling from afar. I would say that the best way is probably going to be to do things more centered around your interest so you can find potential partners there. Surrounding yourself around comfortable people so you’re more in you’re element. I have a very outgoing and friendly INTJ friend who I take with me to parties and stuff to ease some of the social pressure off of me. So maybe get a solid wingman? Pretty much anytime Iv been out and met someone it’s because they’ve approached me. \n   I liked using tinder a lot though. I’m so much more comfortable and able to talk when I’m not actually talking in person. So I was able to have some nice witty banter. That unfortunately never meant that meeting them at first was not uncomfortable. If you’re looking for people to just hook up with I think it’s a pretty easy way to get out there. It also made me less anxious knowing that all the people I met were in theory attracted to me. Ironically enough I did meet my INTP bf on a tinder date but I really hate admitting it lol. But if you’re looking for good genuine connections with real potential, well there is a lack of it there. Best of luck. 
1	Play on your strengths. Have an arsenal of weirdly interesting things to tell people. It's super effective if you have funny stories of weird people to tell the dates. People are what we have the most in common. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not interrupt the date if you have something awesome to say. Say it later, but connect it to the conversation at hand. You are probably going to overwhelm the date with your constant thinking. So just try and remember the awesome thing you wanted to say for later. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTalk to more people, and act cool af around people you probably will not interactive much with. Good street cred works for getting dates. I've had women I barely know refer me to other women for dates. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the whole, I think that you will get better at everything you do if you really discipline your mind. Try meditating. The calmness you experience will undoubtedly attract people to you. 
1	I feel it's not that hard I can just put up an act of being funny and dont let your mind overthink things and you should be fine

0	I’ve been an INTP for 9 years	Is it possible to be an INTP and be dumb at the same time? My depression may have played a major role as to why I had bad grades/a lot of hard time focusing and concentrating(I’ve had depression and insomnia for 13years now). Although comparing to other people/what other people expect of me, I can only see how slow (but deep) I process things. Whenever I read anything, however simple it is - I have to read it 6000 times to comprehend it because my mind is always working about something else in the background. This is really bothering me. I hope someone can share their experiences  and how you coped. Thank you. 
6	I regard myself as dumb, even with all the accolades I've earned. I still feel dumb because I cannot relate to social interactions.\n\nAll my high school life I've been told I was 'smart' and I was confident with my intelligence. But whenever I looked around the class; classmates mingling about, laughing at particular jokes I cannot comprehend, just being humans. Even my bestfriends jokingly call me the 'slow' person since sometimes I really cannot understand. I'd always feel something in my chest that I cannot fathom.\n\n\nI felt disconnected. But I didn't know that that particular moment was hurting me back then because I'm numb. I got used to the workings in life where people around me always asked about my accomplishments, get disappointed with me when I started deteriorating and not giving a fuck to grades anymore, until they left me.\n\nNo one asked me how I felt till college. I was the 'leader' of one huge project. We passed yet I didn't feel it was good, I fucked up and I owed it to them alot because I wasn't a proper leader to them. I just sat there, looking blankly ahead in the class, still surrounded by my groupmates, until my friend asked me.\n\n"Are you okay?"\n\nThere was something growing. The emotions I thought I did not have came rushing to the frontlines, just halting at the tip of my tongue.\n\nI didn't breakdown luckily. I can't remember what I said but I fell into deep thought after that.\n\nRight now, I still feel dumb. But I'm in the process of accepting it. Also in the process of identifying my emotions and being self-aware of why am I this way. That I'm just different from others.\n\nLife's a marathon, not a race.\n\nI wish you good luck and happiness. May you find peace within yourself.
6	* You didn't "become an INTP", you just are.(Well, if this stuff is innate or developed is debatable, but I can ateast say it's fixed by the time you're 10~) Your type doesn't change.\n* INTP and depression are different thing. If you're an "INTP" because you're depressed, then you're no INTP at all. \n* Your type doesn't determine your intelligence. INTP just have a preference for Ti as a function, we like logic etc, but doesn't mean our brain are suddendly smarter.
1	Y'know, I used to be an INTJ before school.
1	See. How can i be an INTP if I’m this touchy-feely -I’m influenced by alcohol btw
8	Feelings	How do the rest of yall deal with your feelings? I have never been in touch with mine until very recently and now i feel kinda miserable. I dont know what to do with them. They feel alien.. do you know what i mean? I don't have a lot of friends and there is no way i can/would explain these feeling im having to them. Do other intps relate to this? I would like to know how you all deal with your "sad" feelings.
7	The worst thing about my relationship with feelings is how I deal with the "bad" ones.  \nSad? No, I feel shit.   \nAngry? No, I feel shit.  \nDisillusioned? No, I feel shit. etc\n\nI guess years of ignoring and pretending they didn't even exist is eventually going to bite all of us in the ass.
5	I shove them at the back of my mind, hoping they rot and left forgotten. But no, they *always* come back with a vengeance. Like a bottle bursting from sheer pressure, these 'feelings' make me feel weak, vulnerable, and *human*. I hated it. Although I know logically that I need to deal with it, I repeatedly avoid it. The vicious cycle repeats.\n\nI get you. I can relate with you. And towards these 'sad' feelings, I'd lock myself in my room and cry, just letting my body process these emotions until I'm neutral again.\n\nI hope you can have someone to be your listener, someone open-minded enough to take all your thoughts, may it be robotic or out-of-the-world kind of thoughts. They are the best for unloading such feelings.
4	Emotions are a gift, but can also be a curse. More importantly for this argument, they are information. They are to be taken into consideration, felt, experienced. They tell you about needs and wants, fears and hurts. Also, since they are attached to bodily function, if left to their own devices, they can wreak havoc. We are not, and cannot be purely "logical" beings. In psychology, bottling up or ignoring your feelings is part of what is known as "experiential avoidance". It is considered an unhealthy and counterproductive way of coping. More importantly, over the long term, it may be connected to the development of alexithymia, or blindness to one's inner emotional experience and an inability to express it: "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22990482"\n\nAlexithymia is NO GOOD. It is, arguably, a dreadful thing.\n\nA person may become numb or blind to his own emotions, but, one way or another, they end up ruling his life. Alexithymic people have worse health than others. They suffer more psychological and psychiatric issues too. Anxiety, depression, all the good stuff. And the unmanaged stress can end up showing in somatic symptoms. As you probably know, chronic and unmanaged stress destroys your immune system, affects digestion, damages the cardiovascular system, disturbs the endocrine system... The list goes on and on.\n\nEven worse than all that, if the bad emotions go, the good ones can go with them. Less love, less empathy, less beauty. The myriad intricacies of deep feeling that give life its meaning and color, all diminished or erased. And creativity too, for good measure, since it is associated with positive emotions. Alexithymic people are indeed less creative and imaginative, per the literature. Even their dreams suck.\n\nEtc, etc, etc, etc.\n\nDo I offer a solution to your issues right now? No. Am I trying to scare the fuck out of you so that you don't fall into the typical INTP trap? Fuck yes. But I didn't lie. I'm an INTP too after all.\n\nTake care.\n\n*Edited some stuff cuz I'm a idiot and misread other's comments
2	Emotions don't always make sense so its often hard for me to just hit undo. But when I am feeling negative I try to find the trigger for why so I can can understand it a bit better. I pay closer attention to my thoughts and mental narrative as clues for a cause and potential solutions. I also work out when I'm pent up and stressed because short term emotional impulses depend heavily on brain chemesty and hormones and exercise fills the brain with good positive juices. Good luck on your self analysis friend
2	I am the most content with my feelings after Iv expressed them. Since I loathe pity, and looking vulnerable to other people I do this privately. I will usually write. Sometimes I draw/paint. Getting those feelings out and looking at them from an outside point of view is soothing to me. Sometimes I just don’t feel up to creating. When that happens I’ll bury my emotions or convince myself they’re useless. That just builds on itself and makes me even more unmotivated. Then I will have a kind of emotional outburst probably from all the repressing. So you might give it a try. \nI will say though, whenever I am experiencing an unfamiliar emotion it can be much harder to express it. I’ll have a hard time figuring it out. If you’re not in a usual pattern/habit of creating please please don’t let that discourage you. It gets easier the more you do it. 
2	Deal with it bro. The more you put it at the back of your mind, the more it's gonna come back more confusing since more information adds up to it and if you're gonna understand it before even more information adds up to blur up what it really  is, you're gonna get fucking depressed. You don't wanna get fucking depressed, trust me on this one. 
4	I used to have this problem as well. I got REALLY into psychology because of it (I think my issue resided more in the fact that I'm a high functioning Autist), and I was better for it. If you dont want to see someone in the field of psychology (it helps plenty of people and there isnt anything wrong with needing help, even if it does feel that way) then I would recommend doing some research into the field, yourself. Someone who I found very informative, and whom I respect as an intellectual, is Jordan Peterson. Very informed and deep thinker. He's studied, rigorously, some of the greatest minds in the field (Carl Jung might seem pretty familiar, if you know of the functions) and can explain things from a logical perspective in a way that has helped me tremendously. I'd start with Jordan, and if it suits you, go further down the rabbit hole. It's improved my understanding of myself and my understanding of others, even if it isn't derived from an emotional aspect. I'll see if I can find a good video to start with and link it (he has a podcast and a YouTube channel, as well as a few published books).
1	INTP are Principles via Fe. Forget about *your* feelings for a moment, and realize your primary aspiration is to develop universal harmony (Fe) through Principles, which means universal, scientific Principles whereby harmony is certain since any and all observers agree and are thus equal.\n\nRealize that other types don't access Principles via Feelings whatsoever, and so they don't have any Feelings whatsoever about unfair or inhumane Principles. In fact, other types will oppose any scientific Principles unless they stand to profit from them, as per the unilateral opposition to each and every advancement in science as per  the treatment of Galileo, Einstein, Tesla, Turing, Wegener, et al.\n\nexample...\n\n> "...the hypothesis was initially met with skepticism from geologists, who viewed Wegener as an outsider and were resistant to change.."

3	Relationship Advice: Intj(female) + Intp(male)	My intp friend and I have known each other for over a year. When we first met, we got along really well and at first he was really unsure about dating because of all the "options" on campus, but then he became really persistent about dating. We were dating and growing closer to each other but then I broke up with him (long complicated story). Over the time we were dating he's accidentally said "this is what two people do when they are in love with each other" and I've accidentally blurted out "I love you". He's told me he "doesn't know what love is" and he doesn't know if he feels the same way and I have just accepted that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n When I told him he had been hurting my feelings, he cried and said he didn't realize it. We are still really close (nothing has changed) and have only been broken up for three weeks. A week ago with tears in his eyes, he told me that he didn't want to date me (even though I didn't ask) and that now he was unsure about dating again. After he did that, he started acting really passive-aggressive and bizarre. Due to this, there was a lot of tension between us and it was an emotionally exhausting week, but we finally resolved it. Now, we are behaving exactly like a couple but we aren't "official". Lmao, I'm still supposed to meet his dad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are both somewhat attractive. I ignore or politely decline guys that are interested in me. He's usually oblivious that a girl is interested, but I worry that if a girl is more direct with him that I will lose him (especially if the interest is physical). \n\nHow do I earn his trust again and keep is attention?\n\n&#x200B;
4	What will happen will happen. You can't really control the trajectory with INTPs that are so unsure.
6	This is a great opportunity to use raw milk to your advantage 
1	I see a lot of my former self in your description of him. Way back when I had no one, I used to tell myself that choosing someone would eliminate other opportunities. No idea of that is an INTP thing or just messed up, but in my case it was real. \n\nIf I were to hazard a guess, he is struggling with his feelings. He has strong feelings for you, but does not know what to do with them. As a result, they might seem threatening. For me it was really hard when I wanted a relationship with someone but was terrified about the risk of rejection. It put me in a passive aggressive mode. \n\nWhen my wife and got together, she made me feel safe. For once in my life, I did not feel like I needed to keep an eye on the exists and hedge everything I said to avoid pain if I got a reaction I did not want. For most of my life, I felt rejected, and I was always prepared to bolt. My wife sensed that, and she smothered me with acceptance. She basically said that there was nothing I could do to make her reject me, and for once I did not test what she said. \n\nIf I am right, which I very likely am not, what you are seeing is fear. It is a fear borne of countless rejections in the past. If you honestly care for him, you might try to give him safety. Once I realize that my future wife was safe, everything changed. Take it for what it is worth.
1	>When I told him he had been hurting my feelings, he cried and said he didn't realize it.\n\nGosh dang, I know how that works.  I know me:  If I love someone, and they tell me ive been hurting their feelings, Im probably going to start crying as well. The last thing I want to do to someone I love, is to hurt them.\n\nThey go through my Thinking shell, and into my Feeling core.  Hence the crying.\n\n(But I don't really have experience with it.  Im somewhere around 20 years old, and Ive never been in a relationship.  Only a giver of reciprocated affection, my whole life.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"When a ~~blind man~~ INTP cries, dont ya know; he feels it from his soul."  (Deep Purple)
1	So, let me summarize. You want him to think of you, so he doesn't date others girls, and thus, you can keep him around as a back up option ?\n\nWell, I'm not helping you.
2	Are you an INTP-A or an INTP-T?	I'm personally an INTP-T. I got 0% assertive and 100% turbulent, anyone else \nwant to share their results?\n\nEdit: I know it isn't really a part of MBTI, I was just curious as there's not much left unanswered about everyone's types as most of us here, I'm assuming, are INTPs.
10	I don't ever bother with the -A or -T. It's not really a part of Myers-Briggs, it's just throwing in neuroticism so it can have all the elements of the Big Five even though it doesn't interact with anything.\n\nThat said, I am highly neurotic.
5	The A - T thing is something totally unrelated to MBTI or typology in general. It's just one thing a website added to be somewhat original and make more sales.\n\nLearn about the functions, that's the only reliable stuff. Switch to socionics once you find MBTI limited.
6	Do INTP-A's even exist?
4	I'm INTP-A. 57%. I'm really only assertive when no one else will be.
2	INTP-A. 97% Assertive. I have no stress or anxiety in my life. I'm 96% Introverted aswell so if I had any social anxiety I would never talk to anybody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy full percentages by 16personalities(I have results from other tests but lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI - 96%,\n\nN - 72%\n\nT - 76%\n\nP - 92%\n\n*A* \- 97%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to stress out and get anxious a lot. But I stopped at about age 8, I didn't like it I told my self to stop, I did. That was when I generally stopped over thinking. I miss overthinking though(I still do it sometimes), it gave my brain stimulation when I was bored.
2	Reading Chernow...Ulysses S. Grant: INTP? Thoughts?	
3	Ulysses is a great name
3	Relationship advice on a INTP	So I am an ENTP, my fiance is an INTP and I was hoping to get some help, or advice. He is super logical compared to me, I let my emotions seep out from time to time, but he is brutally honest and doesn't seem to think sugarcoating anything has a point. Because of this he blatantly insults me and it really hurts my feelings a lot. But he refuses to change and I see that it is a lot of different problems internally. Because he has a low self-esteem and a lot of self-loathing and he seems so hell-bent on logic and so trapped in his mind to try to change anything. I don't want to leave him but, I don't know how to help him. I have tried being more blunt about problems as well and his answer is always, "This is how I am and I am not going to change."
14	Being an INTP is no justification for being a bad friend or lover. INTPs have as many feelings as anyone else, and we have the same capacity to care  how we affect those around us. If he is being brutally honest when he blatantly insults you, then you should expect to be insulted as long as you are together.\n\nMy wife of 31 years is an INFJ. Early in our relationship, I sort of expected her to adapt to me and to let me remain the same as I was. There is a lot of that amongst INTPs. As a group, we seem unusually resistant to changing for people we love as if it would be a character flaw. When I realized the ways that I was hurting my wife, I felt awful. More than anything else, I knew that I did not want to hurt her. So I talked to her about it, and I was floored at the extent to which she had gone to accommodate me. When I looked at my own accommodations, I was humiliated. \n\nIf he is going to thrive as an adult, he is going to have to learn to accept that he can be his way, but most of the rest of the world is not, and that everyone else is not wrong. I think that INTPs take longer to mature than some others, and a lover is most often the reason that we do.\n\nIf it were me, I would just tell him what he does that hurts you and how much you are hurting. I would not ask him to stop because you should not have to. If telling him that he is hurting you is not enough to effect change, then your future together is bleak. \n\nI also would encourage you to validate and support him whenever it is appropriate. A lot of INTPs grew up without much validation, and that leaves us starving for it even if we will not admit it. When my wife told me that she accepted me the way that I am and that there was nothing wrong with me, it was so glorious. And when she recognized my efforts to be a better companion, that gave all the motivation I needed to try harder.\n\nUltimately, anyone who says that they are not going to change for a relationship is not a worthy partner. The changes that I have made for my wife have all been for the better and benefited me. If you love him, then tell him that he has to change if he wants a relationship with you. Explain that you have changed for him without any regrets. If he says no, then don't expect any change.\n\nThis reminds me of a joke or a wise saying.  Women marry men hoping that they will change, but they don't. Men marry women hoping that they won't change, but they do.\n\nBest wishes to you.
5	I could see it slipping from time to time, but blatantly insulting someone is different from being brutally honest.  But its hard to tell without knowing details.  If true, he doesn't respect you, or projecting his insecurities onto you.  Bad juju either way if that's how you feel, its going to eat into your own self-worth if it keeps happening. 
2	>"This is how I am and I am not going to change." \n\nThis usually means you should leave. An INTP with low self-esteem is not gonna easily warm up to your support.
1	Make him read this post and have a conversation about how this is affecting your relationship. \n
1	Maybe rethink this "fiance" situation here girly. You can't expect a person to provide love for you if they don't even have enough for themselves. \n\n
1	Well, he is dead now, by why then did he leave his library to me and ask me to deliver his eulogy?
0	> Because of this he blatantly insults me and it really hurts my feelings a lot.\n\nBut did he ? Isn't it just his truthful opinion ? Aren't insult about intents anyway ? And actual words with definitions ? Words like "asshole", "idiot", etc. \n\nYour hurt feelings don't determine his intent, nor if it was an insult or not.\n\nTbh, it's so weird. It's like you're complaining that he isn't lying enough to you ?\n\n> But he refuses to change\n\nDamn right. It's on you, imho (because in the end, all we can do is help ourselves anyway) We might change because we're outnumbered in society, but that's all. We don't actually value that change nor would regard it as more valuable than "our core". The change would be superficial if it's forced, and even the superficial stuff would be rejected.\n\n> and I see that it is a lot of different problems internally. Because he has a low self-esteem and a lot of self-loathing\n\nNone of those are explanations. I think you're just saying that shit to feel good about yourself ?\n\n> I have tried being more blunt about problems\n\nWhat problems ? Besides that need for dishonesty? (or at least, less of the brutal honesty)\n\n***\nHe's right when he says he isn't going to change (at least, not his core. Everyone changes bit by bit). Personally, intelligent criticism is something I like and welcome. I think it's valuable, so I tell people, and I kinda expect people to tell me (just kidding, I know they will talk about it to everyone beside me. Gossip...). Anyway, people we don't tell anything  are just strangers or people we don't think it's worth bothering ourselves with. He isn't always right, though.and here eitheir :\n\n* You can convince him that whatever he said to you is wrong, which really isn't that hard. Especially for an ENTP, typology wise...\n* Or you can continue complaining about it.

151	Dear INTP	We would first have to discuss what the meaning and concept of love is, but I think (in theory) I could fall head over heels for you. \n\nHappy Valentine’s Day \n\nLove ENFP\n
73	That's great! I just told my mom, and she's so excited to meet you!
26	whenever you're ready to discuss it let me know. I will talk to you, inwardly define your definition of love, go home then process a middle ground and decide if I like you, or love you, then one day describe how you could possibly earn my one true type of love and other possible types. Is May too far away for you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy Feb 14th  :)
30	"Love" in its most simple form is "dependency." For any statement of the type, "I love x", you can restate it as "I am dependant on x for y" without losing any contextual significance however the harshness of tone of the latter phrase can easily be misinterpreted as cynicism. ("You(x) complete me(y)").\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a slightly more complex form, love is a willingness to deny one's own self in order to promote comfort(z) for oneself or another (in most cases, both) ("I am so dependant on you(x) for emotional support(y) that I am willing to have my bank account to go into the negative to ensure that you(x) are happy(z)")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn an even more complex and cynical form, love is a willingness to allow oneself to become dependant on some x in return for some y where y is uniquely beneficial to the host of love. This is why the best examples of love are always symbiotic in nature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENFPs are fun to be with because they are often able to make me laugh with their goofiness and i rarely have to wonder how they feel. Though they are prone to emotionally abusing INTPs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\--- Edit ---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's really funny seeing quite a few people state that I am "trying" to be analytical without thinking, "Maybe this poster is a Software Engineer and performs analysis very often." 
8	Theoretically, there is a high probability that can get along with ENFPs quite well. I love ENFPs!!\n\n- an INTP
9	The enfps I've been with were bat shit crazy. I mean it, worst mistakes ever. 
7	You git git outta here with yo feelins and what not. :blushy:
6	Dear marble.\n\nI notice you did multiples of those threads, yet, you still manage to come off as genuine. Congrats
8	OK, ENFP, but when you fall head over heels, you need to land on us.  Otherwise, we won't be sure that you are into us, and we will just slink away.
3	How do INTPs tend to interact with ENFPs by the way, in your experiences? I feel as if I am most compatible with them
4	Me and my ENFP husband discussing the meaning and concept of love is just us making a bunch of jokes and pranking each other.... or him texting me a million times while my phone is in my purse on silent. When I finally look at my phone he's had a full discussion and argument with himself and then come back around full circle with love and happiness and asking for forgiveness; then I lol at him and send him relatable memes and the jokes start again. \n\nLove you Enfps 😗
4	Lust is natures way of keeping two people who don’t actively hate each other together long enough to procreate by suppressing the awareness of each others’ flaws. \n\nLove is two people knowing precisely what they hate about each other, but choosing to share this earthly experience together anyway; because there is nobody they would rather have by their side to weather the unrelenting shitstorm of difficulties and complications that is life.
3	lul\n\ngeneral categories of love\n\nfeel free to debate this\n\nfraternal love: oxytocin\n\nplatonic love: mutual understanding\n\nmaterial love: some weird attachment to physical stuff that i do not understand\n\nromantic love: some weird form? of love that i understand even less\n\nalso im generally ok with enfp\n\nalthough they could take life a BIT more seriously
3	Love, just like other emotions is a manifestation of human mind.\nCould I live without it? Yes.\nWould I want to live without it? I'm indifferent.\nWhile I imagine having an extrovert partner would fill the gaps in my life, it has never practically worked out.\nI'm curious as to why you think you would fall in love with an INTP?
3	Neat! I've been waiting for ages to show my diagrams to a creature that doesn't have a tail attached to. So grab a pen and paper, scooch over and pay attention, cause this is important.
3	That's romantic.
3	Love is the involuntary response to virtue if you are virtuous
6	Begone thot
8	I don't like ENFPs because my sister is one. I am highly agreeable so I copied her traits and now sound like a whiny bitch. 
2	No. You assuredly couldn't. I'm egotistical and dull.
2	Said the doctor when he saw the new born baby, "You are so hideous only your mom can love you"\n- Love
2	Thank you, ENFP. And thank you for all that those of your type have contributed to my life, including introducing me to MBTI. Happy Belated Valentine's Day.
2	I'm an ENFP, and my husband is an INTP\n... Sometimes I think my excessive romanticism confuses/ overwhelms him 😅 
2	ENFP's be cheating on us INTJ's. \n\n**lol**
2	ENFP seem drawn to me but I cannot stand them. It is probably because I cannot stand them and most people adore and admire ENFP so someone disliking their presentation is not familiar.
2	God damn ENFPs with their flirty asses leaving many "book-smart-life-dumb" INTPs here hoping for nothing
2	I love to study people in times of intense emotion. Very few subjects that I've studied understand my curiosity and will give me a play by play of what they are going through. It is very insightful!
1	Hmm I'm already coupled with another intp & love? Familiarity over time. Plus try not to be a cunt. Plus remember to make me laugh. I'm still not really sure

2	Favorite books?	I’ve burned through most of my library and would love recommendations
3	If you want science-fiction, I really like Dune
3	Beyond Good and Evil, and Genealogy of Morals by Nietzsche.\nCrime and Punishment by Dostoevsky. Notes from Underground is also great, and short. \nPortnoy’s Complaint by Philip Roth, if you want something raunchy and funny.\nNausea by Sartre.\nAnything by Kafka or Gogol. They’re definitely my favorite short story writers. \nThe man who mistook his wife for a hat by Oliver Sacks.
2	Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, and the age of Social Catastrophe, der enzeige, fear and loathing in las vegas
2	Not sure what you are looking for, but a book that I am reading now has drastically changed my perspective on a lot of things.  [The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Ancient/dp/B000WCTRW8/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2IBCU5T7QYHH8&keywords=happiness+hypothesis&qid=1550281272&s=gateway&sprefix=happiness+%2Caps%2C203&sr=8-1) by Jonathan Haidt.\n\nIf you are looking for offbeat fiction, I enjoyed  [Nop's Trials](https://www.amazon.com/Nops-Trials-Donald-McCraig/dp/0517551896/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nop&qid=1550281186&s=gateway&sr=8-1) by Donald McCraig \n\nOlder, but I like just about everything by Uberto Eco including  [The Name of the Rose](https://www.amazon.com/Name-Rose-Umberto-Eco/dp/0307264890/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=eco&qid=1550281350&s=books&sr=1-2-spell) and  [Foucault's Pendulum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WUYPI8/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1) \n\nLastly, I loved  [One Hundred Years of Solitude (Bloom's Guides (Hardcover))](https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Years-Solitude-Blooms-Guides-ebook/dp/B007IETMI2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1HMS0II02V739&keywords=100years+of+solitude&qid=1550281433&s=digital-text&sprefix=100years%2Cdigital-text%2C195&sr=1-1)  by Gabriel Garcia Marquez 
1	Romance novels 🍆. 
1	Anything from Heinlein.
1	You might like The Elementary Particles by Michel Houellebecq
1	I've been listening to Stephen Fry reading through the Sherlock Holmes Definitive Collection and I've really enjoyed it so far, fun putting the clues together/following Holmes' reasoning in the more inscrutable cases. Im about 30 hours in.
1	Peeps got sophisticated taste, wherein I fancy chinese novels translated to english.\n\nI'm really into fantasy, rpg like, isekai genres. Idk if you'd like them but here're the classics that I love: "I Shall Seal the Heaven, Coiling Dragon, Praise the Orc, Overgeared, The Novel's Extra, Solo Leveling" and many more.\n\nHead on to www.wuxiaworld.com for them (except SL)\n\nBut what got me thinking in deep level is Paulo Coelho's works.
1	Not my favorite, but currently reading Unsong by Scott Alexander (the guy behind slatestarcodex.com)
1	Pretty elementary, but The Giving Tree has grown in me
0	Reading is for nerds.\n\nUnless it has pictures.
6	Does anyone having trouble hiding emotion	I noticed that when ever I feel something it just shows immediate on my face. It has recently becomes inconvenient, so my question is how to be like a sociopath and be able to contain it when necessary. 
4	For me it was mindfulness and cognitive behavior therapy. If you suppress your emotion, it will remain and pop up again. In most circumstances, your face should show your emotions, but in an appropriate way. Emotions are transitory. They come and go. For me, learning not to try to control them was essential. 
3	Awareness of a thing is the first step to changing a thing... if "changing" is the appropriate word. \n\nOne pays attention, to feel emotion arising, and this recognition allows one to put some separation between arising and reaction. That separation helps one to NOT react...\n\nAnd shit like that.
2	I dont hide all my emotion. I just mask them with joy. I just smile and make dark humor out of everything that makes me angry or sad. For example. My father died in 2008, My friends will be complaining about their dads so I'll say "well it all lucky, I havent heard from my dad in a decade" that's shuts them up to an awkward laugh and quickly changes the subject. Not the best way but they think I'm happy n it changes the subject.
1	I have a different trouble that I don't understand my emotion, so it's difficult for me to show it.\n\nHowever, I think if you focus on your every movement and you notice your emotion, perhaps it helps you hide them.\n\nAnd I have some questions. How do you know that you are showing emotion on your face? And, what kind of emotions that often be shown and it's a trouble for you? 
1	My face is super readable, but I thinks it's because I've cultivated it that way. I've found that I don't really have to reply to people verbally if I make an expected facial expression. I use it to show that I'm engaged in the conversation without having to reply before I've had time to process what's happening.  Other perks include hiding my depression,  people insert their own interpretation to my expressions(meaning I live up to their expectations), not having to really pay attention to the words just the tone, strong comedic effect.\n\nTbh, usually the only genuine emotion I can't hide is when I find something funny. Meaning I'm a terrible "prank" lier. I also get in trouble if people are acting like unreasonable idiots with me at work. I've definitely had people demand to speak to my manager because I had a smirk while telling them I can't meet their unreasonable and impossible demands.
1	Nope. I can very easily just robot-out on command and kill all emotion, but that's probably because I'm an extremely jaded individual. 
1	This happens to me a lot. I didn’t realize how much I do it until a friend of mine pointed out that whenever I’m really engaged in texting (like I’m mad) I’ll make facial expressions and mouth the words. I didn’t even know I did this. Iv been told my face is either very expressive or very stoic. I have a bad case of resting bitch face but as soon as someone mentions something I like I’ll light up. I don’t have a lot of control over it. Sometimes I’ll show my reactions to things whenever I didn’t mean to and have to back track my way out of it. 
1	Im extremely good at hiding how I feel.  **I THINK.**  Im sure my body language really gives it away.\n\nBut you know, you gotta hide it alot when youre INTP.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are like M67 Frag grenades.  Powerful Composition B (Fi/Fe) in a strong steel pressure vessel (Ti/Te).\n\nSometimes, we get so upset, that our Fi explodes, and our Ti pressure vessel only strengthens the explosion; and the Ti becomes shrapnel, and does extraordinary damage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPicture an INTP who has finally lost his sh\*t in anger.  He only cares how he feels (Fi), and uses it to justify himself.  And he uses his Ti to think of a way to hurt the person who angered him, in the most damaging way possible.  He will burn down that guy's world.  \n\n(Im speaking mostly of ideological damage, like annihilating a relationship.  Or, it's possible it could be physical damage, if he has lost all semblance of self-control.)
6	Learn More Outside of School?	I tend to learn most of my information about things that don't really matter outside of school rather than waste my time learning it in school. Even as a freshman in highschool I managed to stay home from school on a regular basis and would spend my time on a computer basically learning more about the subjects in school than I would learn in an entire week of showing up. Does anyone else do this? Does anyone know how to make this an advantage? 
9	School is not set in place to help you learn. School is simply here to instill that you must obey if you want to function in society. \n\nIf you don't obey, you will not make it through school. If you are the dumbest person on the planet, and are good at obeying, you will get better grades than an INTP.\n\nBe careful, and don't let them know you can think for yourself.
1	[deleted]
1	I learn out of school better a lot of the time as well, I can safely presume that if my computer science teacher had taught me what I know about computers, it would have taken much longer to learn. But I would recommend going to school just for the social aspect and also the aspect of going to a college where you can specialize in one specific topic or more. I wish they had college for high schoolers lol. 
23	Cat MBTI results	I decided yesterday to do MBTI tests for both of my cats (yes, I know).  I tried to get myself into their mindset and answer as truthfully as I could for each of them.  One of them came out INTP while the other is ENTP.\n\nI can’t decide if the results were influenced by my own personality, or if it actually makes perfect sense that we share a personality type with cats.  Has anyone else engaged in this weird experiment, or care to do so now and share results?!
29	I think we may of reached next level memes.
17	Is one a loudmouth and the other one a genius?
15	okay this is epic
7	[deleted]
4	Totally normal\n\n^^/s
4	I did with my fish once.  I know what you are thinking, but they are saltwater fish, not stupid freshwater fish.
3	Oh, yes.  First cat was a cold and calculating intj who was only happy when she was alone with her people.  Did not play well with other cats.\n\nSecond was a gregarious but anxiety ridden esfj who always jacked the yet to be mentioned cat's sleeping spots.  World class cuddler but sort of a social slut.\n\nThird is a shy, reclusive isfp with a troubled past,  belligerent and stubborn streaks, and a lot of love.  We suspect she prefers to be an only cat, as she only truly came out if her shell after the esfj passed on. \n\nDon't judge me.  I'm not even one of you. 
3	They are onto us 
3	That's it i'll be at r/memes see yall
2	I figured my dog is ISFJ.\n\nYou're not alone.
2	So, my cats are: ESFJ, INTP, INTJ, ISTP, and my dogs ISFJ and ENFP
2	Im sure the MTBI isnt accurate for a completely different species.... but prossibly is fairly good for other apes, tho youd still have to make some species allowances i guess.
1	I've figured my cats for ISFJ and ESFP.
1	Mine is definitely an ExFJ - super communivative and clingy, attached to all of us, reacts and gets upset every time someone feels unwell/angry/sad, and has his own everyday routines he likes to follow. Just not sure how to distinguish N/S animal behaviour 
1	This has to be the most INTP thing ive seen in a long time...  XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(The other day I was doing the mirror test with my cats... only to later learn in my Psychology class that the mirror test is actually a thing!  Always rediscovering stuff.  But none of my cats even recognized the mirror.  They just totally ignored it. Typical for cats, it turns out.)
1	HAHAHA
1	My first thought was: you're biased and the results were based on sensory information as you ignored fact that a it cannot be anything, but a sensor as their brain isn't as well developed as people. Or you were clearly joking.\n\nBut then I thought that unless somebody will deeply test cats brains, we don't know anything about them. They can be literally more inteligent than human kind. They can be so smart and lazy to not show it. And everytime we try to test them, they are trolling us.\n\nSry for bad english.
1	Your cats are intuitive?\n\nWhat are their plans for the future? I’m intensely curious about this. I’m also very curious about their introverted thinking process.\n\nPlease elaborate.
3	How many saved pages did you have on Stumbeupon?	I haven't been on the site in years but I racked up over 20k saved pages of really interesting stuff I will eventually open and go through.\n\nEdit: awkward wording 
3	This offends me lol. So sad I missed my account transfer to the new generator.
2	Ask my circa 2010 self 'cos I've no fucking idea
1	Bad news: stumbleupon is dead. I lost my list of about 1000 sites ive saved to it. 
1	Seminal moments/life paradigm shifts	Curious to see what you guys and girls see as seminal moments that directed large changes in your lives.
3	1. When I was in kindergarten, I a precocious little bastard. I always had a wise ass comment, and I preferred the company of adults because they made for more interesting targets. One day, my mom had a male friend over, and I gave it to him good, but then he turned the tables and he was good. He actually made me cry and run to my mom, who held me and said, "Honey, don't dish it out if you can't take it."  Slight miscommunication. I interpreted that to mean learn to take it and you can dish out whatever you want, so I resolved to take anything and dish out whatever I wanted. My mom and I both remember this 48 years after the fact. I tell her that she created a monster, and she thinks it was my fault.\n2. My junior year in college, 1984, I studied abroad in France. The plane I was on to go there had some issue, but they could not let us deboard because we had cleared customs. So we had to sit and wait. The stewardess offered me free headphones to watch An Officer and and Gentleman, but I declined. So I sat and pondered the vicissitudes of life. That led me to consider my life and what a shit I had become. I was such a dark unpleasant person ready to savage anyone I crossed. And for some reason, I realized that I hated my life. It dawned on me that I was about to land in a country of 60 million people, none of whom knew me. To them, I would be whoever I seemed to be when I got there. And if I could change and keep it up for 6 weeks, then everyone would know me as the new me. All the social reinforcements would support my changes. So I spent the entire trip designing a new and better me. I even made myself a vegetarian for some reason. The new me was outgoing and positive. I knew that I could not stop my need to respond to everything, but I could redirect it to support people instead of attacking them. To my great surprise, it largely worked. I did slip in some ways, but at the end of the year, I probably had become 75% of my changes. \n3. One spring Friday in 2011, I told my wife that I was taking the day off to get some solitude. She had experienced that before and just sighed, then asked where I was going. I told her and then took off for the mountains. Once I started, I realized that it was the Friday before Memorial day, and that there would be no solitude where I said I was going, so I chose a new destination 50 miles away. It did not occur to me to let her know. I drove to the end of forest service road and threw my keys under a rock. And then I climbed a very steep mountain. I don't do trails. I climbed up in a deep ravine with steep sides and came across a magical waterfall. After hanging out for a while, I decided to keep climbing, and I had to climb a steep rock wall because the waterfall was at the bottom of the ravine. When I got to the top I checked things out and decided to keep climbing.\n\nThe next thing I recall was coming to at the top of the waterfall. I do not remember the climb or the fall. I was laying on my stomach, and when I tried to get up, my elbow hurt more than anything had hurt before. I realized that I had broken my arm, so I grabbed my phone to call 911. I had no signal. I tried 911 anyway just in case, but nothing happened. So I tried to get up and realized that I couldn't until I grabbed a tree with my good hand and pulled myself up. I could walk by putting one foot forward and dragging the other. But I could barely breathe. \n\nI soon realized that I was stuck at the top of a waterfall and in the bottom of a ravine. I could not climb down the side of the waterfall, so I had to climb out of the ravine. I spent all day trying to get out, but I just kept falling back down and hurting myself.\n\nAround 8:30, I realized that I was too tired to keep trying and would not get out. No one had any idea where I was and no one would find me. So I found a comfortable spot and laid down to die.  I have Addison's Disease, which means that my body cannot respond to physical stress, and I was sure that I would not wake up. By this time, I also had noticed that the back of my head was leaking an alarming amount of blood. I was not angry or upset, just resigned, and I closed my eyes.\n\nA while later, I realized that I was still awake, so I opened my eyes. I discovered that I was standing at the top of the ravine looking down at the waterfall. I have absolutely no idea how I got out. Or rather, I know that I could not possibly have gotten out in my condition. I slipped, fell and rolled my way down the mountain and came out close to my car. So I crawled to my car and drove to where I had a cell signal. I called my wife and we both called 911.  She was not pleased. \n\nThe Sheriff got there first, and he came up to the car where I was leaned back, and he said, "Son, who rescued you?" I shook my head and said no one. He said "That's impossible. People in your shape do not self rescue." Everyone kept asking me who rescued me and telling me that I could not have rescued myself.\n\nI spent two weeks in Harborview. I broke my pelvis and sacrum, broke a bunch of ribs, shattered my elbow, collapsed a lung, and had a bad concussion. When I was released, I was in a wheelchair. \n\nThe thing is, I could not possibly have gotten myself out. But no one else did. Some people say God saved me, but why would he leave me at the top of the mountain. This experienced changed my perspective on a lot of things. I am much more open to experiences that defy logic and to the idea my life has a purpose. The sense that I was given a second chance is inescapable. I realize that it is not fair for me to go off into the woods alone and off trail, and I am more thoughtful about how my actions might affect others. It was a hell of a way to learn a lesson, but I emerged a better person, and that change has stuck with me.\n\n&#x200B;
841	Banana Man understands	
58	As an INTP turning 50 this year, who has been in this place, allow me to provide a [counterpoint](https://godmeandmydiary.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_20140813_183158.jpg).
33	It’s nice to be alone without feeling lonely.
55	This is figuratively me
23	I've always wanted to be left alone. Lol.
8	I feel attacked. \n\n
5	I try to convince myself of this all the time
5	Literally me. I’ll put “master of being alone” on anything I ever apply for 
6	What's this from? Adventure time?
3	I feel the opposite
3	For me I want to be alone but I have duties so I can survive on Earth.
3	To those who comment that being alone is amazing, - Yes, we are good at it and we have endless topics we can think about, endless theoretical problems we can optimise, but also imagine falling asleep while spooning/cuddling.
2	This is me but I am gonna go out for V day and hopefully meet someone. I would like to meet another INTP but I never see them in public
1	Banana man has changed since I was a kid...
1	I wish it we're a comfort or interesting or something to me that there are other people who exist in the state I'm in but it's not a feeling for me. At the most this post raised a mild oh at the Robin William quote because Robin Williams was a special human I did like. Still mild interest. That's all. That's me and probably you too?.
1	Why even the need for people? Solitude is by far the most enjoyable aspect of life.
1	My brain is fucked up from the lack of social interaction 
1	I used to want to be left alone, but I’m starting to see that having a wide variety of people around you is a great way to really make life more enjoyable. At the very least, you can crowd source different perspectives than you might think of, and that can lead to a lot of really fun conversations and personal thoughts. 
1	HELP: is my friend an intp or an istp?	## \n\n📷\n\nalright, fellas, i need some help with typing my good friend.\n\nfor months I was certain he had to be an intp, the descriptions fit him quite well and he seems to agree. functions wise i have never doubted he's a Ti dom. dichotomy wise, i - t - p are all very obvious in his behavior. we've both been introverts our whole life and somewhat lazy.\n\nhowever, me and him were talking about mbti today in class, this isn't something we usually do, because he is not even remotely interested in reading about functions. or mbti theory in depth, i believe it bores him (made me suspicious because it seems like intp's are at least moderately invested). During this conversation, he mentions reading this sub and not relating, apparently people seem a bit stuck up, decorate their sentences with pretentious word and in general, aren't "chill enough" etc. i think: idk intps are obviously all different and this is the internet.\n\nlater i wondered if maybe he was mistyped, and i was biased enough to type him as a intuitive because of something subconscious. Ne isn't all that present in him, at least not externally recognizable. we are both fond of deep conversations and it's genuinely something we enjoy doing. say we're talking about immigration: if we did things his way there would be an exploration of immigrants until we both were satisfied and ready to move on to the next topic or when the awkward silence appears.\n\nin retrospection - i am always the one steering the convo to loosely related things, making connections and bringing in anecdotes "thats like..you know when...similar to". he follows along and isn't irritated by this at all.\n\nconfirmed Se users i know tease me for always bringing so-called random experiences or ideas into a discussion. the problem is that, he doesn't fit se stereotypes either. he definitely is a thousand times more observant than me, but "active", "hands-on" and "thrill-seeking" aren't adjectives i associate with him.\n\nwhat do you think? any traits that are very intp i should be looking for:)? how does one differentiate?
1	There's not much info here to go off on, but imo he doesn't seem like either. Maybe INTJ?
1	[deleted]
1	I will say what you suspects, ISTP. \n\nIn socionics, Ne is their PolR/Blindspots function, while Se is ours. It explains the absence of Ne in him that you noticed. ISTP aren't juggling with thousands of ideas, they perceive a lot of stuff and distill into an Ni vision/idea, which is theirs.  The blindspot/PolR also explains the absence of Se in you. Being more observant than us is easy.\n\nThe Se descriptions are bad. At it's core, Se is simply pure observation, or awareness of your surroundings. It's Extraverted Sensing, not Extraverted Daredeviling (reference unintended.)\n\nTo confirm, why not just orient him toward r/istp and see if he does relate. He already did so for this Sub, so why not twice...\n
1	Desperate for advice. How to stop feeling.	I won’t get into detail but I am experiencing loss of a person. This is everything I know:\n \n- I’m not the first person to have to go through something like this\n\n- I will go through this again probably a few more times in my lifetime. \n\n- it’s best to distract myself and not let it consume me. (lol)\n\n- eventually I won’t feel the same pain forever. It’ll get duller. \n\nWhat I want to know is how to skip feeling this way. I can tell myself all day that ultimately there is absolutely nothing I can do to change the situation. I can look at all the facts and everything makes sense.\n\nBut.\n\nI still hurt. And I don’t know how to make it not hurt. I can usually will myself not to care about most things but this is affecting me in ways I’ve never dealt with before. I don’t want to do this anymore. Even when I’m distracting myself all I’m thinking about is the problem. It’s just there in the back of my mind ALL THE TIME. \n\nAlso. Is it normal for my emotions to physically hurt me? I find myself having to literally hold myself because my chest feels like it’s going to cave in. My heart/chest PHYSICALLY hurts. 
7	I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nAccept it, don't deny yourself to feel the pain. No matter how you force yourself to skip the pain, your body needs to process it.\n\nJust like downloading programs, you can't skip it, lest it malfunction. You just have to wait for the feelings to pass.\n\nAnd yes, it's normal for your body to physically hurt when grieving. Your chest must be in pain because you're stifling yourself. You're not giving yourself the chance to let out your grief. Try screaming, wailing, or just letting yourself out. That would help.
5	The only way out of feeling is straight through it. Pushing it away only gives it power.
3	The more you think about not thinking about it, the more you are actually thinking about it. I never could surpass this terrible way of thinking. 
3	It's a part of the human condition. If something bothers you enough, it will hurt; sometimes literally (i experience this too). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou never want to stop feeling. Instead you should focus your effort on healing. If something happened and you are still hurting, it is most likely because you are still being bombarded with negative stimulus. Sometimes the only way to get rid of that negative stimulus is to admit that you fucked up and work towards changing yourself. Sometimes the feelings is a result of having been gaslit so even though objectively you are in the right and did nothing wrong, you still feel as if you did because you were emotionally abused. 
2	ime, willing myself to not care about things makes the times where caring is inevitable far more precarious than they are when i accept feelings and caring on a day to day basis 
128	Relatable	
25	W0w, you have people interested in you?
14	There is pretty good guide how to decide [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-4IAR\_9Yw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-4IAR_9Yw)
12	Anyone else ever feel like its a trick also? I find myself suspicious when someone finds me physically attractive, even though I know I'm a decent looking guy. Maybe its just me. 
8	A girl once full out flirted with me 20 minutes straight in clas and I played dumbass the whole time because I had no idea how I was supposed to react
6	Either this is me and I don't know. Or nobody likes me and I don't get hints. well then
4	Unrelatable. I can usually tell if a girl likes me, I either just don't care or don't have any assertiveness to do anything about it. 
3	If you mean things like call you her boyfriend, send you a letter with her perfume scent on it, or kiss you on the lips... then, yeah.  (3 different people.  The last one is my wife, so I did eventually figure it out.)
6	God this is even worse when you also have to find out if they're gay
2	Just so weird having people describe you, to you. 
2	meh\n\nsometimes it be like that\n\nalthough sometimes im absolutely certain they are into me but just dont want to be with them
1	Happened many times. Told them -nonverbally- to fuck off, for reasons beyond my understanding.
1	Bold of you to assume someone would even like me in the first place.
6	Why do people push themselves (and others) into categories so hard?	I've taken the MB test and im an INTP (ive known this for years but just found this sub) And it reminded me of this question I've had for a while. But this sub seemed like a good place to talk about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEver since the rise of the LGBT community in recent years (this is not predominantly what im going to be talking about, just what has spurred the thought) I have been wondering why people go to such great lengths to align themselves with, a majority of the time pretty staunch categories. Whether it be political, sexual, gender, or even things such as personality types.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI perfectly understand the concept of wanting to feel as though you are a part of something bigger such as an organization or club, but I have a real disconnect with strangling oneself with a rigid identity of any kind. I'm a straight male but if I woke up tomorrow in the body of a female I don't think i'd try to change back. It would probably be weird and tough but I don't feel so strongly attached to my masculinity that I'd go to lengths to get it back. I feel no need to align myself with any particular political group because a majority of them have rigid views to subscribe to whereas mine are a mixed bag. This actually gets really annoying especially on places like reddit where if you don't want Trump to die a torturous drawn out death you're labeled an alt right skinhead nazi racist (most of the time). Not to mention how annoying it is when I have to vote. Really nobody aligns more than 50% with my views. And even as an INTP I feel no particular allegiance to this label. It's just another way to assume who someone is without getting to know them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I suppose I answer my own question a bit with that last statement, labels makes it easy to judge others and give them your attention or pass them by, but I don't really believe this is a good attitude to have. Placing yourself into these categories and making a point to vocalize it turns people away from you who may not actually dislike you if they got to know you without the label, and on the flipside, you're attracting like minded people who will not challenge your opinions, help you learn, or contribute to any kind of growth other than that of a vile echochamber. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dunno. I'd like to hear some other peoples thoughts about this though.\n\nEdit: just for clarification this post isnt specifically escewing the use of MBPI or any other label/category someone might want to align themselves with. I just personally find it more freeing to disregard most of those types of things in my own life, not only when looking at myself but when looking at others too. And i wanted to see how some people felt about that. I figured a place sub built upon a clasification system (with the one i am) would be a fitting place for this discussion.
5	Its because people inherently can’t just handle being who they are. I think we all innately try and “belong” or want to fit in so MBTI for some become a way to do that. Like you said, categorizing or cookie cutting people using a system is unhealthy. It’s no different judging people by MBTI or any other system we humans can dream up. Imo everyone is different within these MBTI archetypes and we should all try and look past our labels to get to know each other more organically. However some people just can’t get past using lets say Ti as the defining point to intps and it is a defining point but it’s also so much more than that. Just because we all weild a similar hammer in a similar fashion; doesn’t mean we all choose to use it in the same way. I like how our type has a natural curiosity to learn and become better, absorbing information along the way. Point being yes, our composition may be similar, but we are each all different in our own unique way. Even those of us that are similar are innately different and some just can’t accept that. For some, they cannot live without a framework; rigidity, process, rules. We humans are good at that; trying to make order out of chaos.
3	From what I’ve noticed, the closer to ‘average’ someone is, the less they seem to need labels. I think part of it is that people who are ‘different’ in some way are more likely to be bullied/excluded or thought of as a weirdo. For example, me being left handed is a (small) part of my identity not because I think it makes me special, but because as a kid, other kids at school were constantly telling me how annoying it was that my left hand was in their way of their right one when we were writing. Also, because we had to use pens with ink that took about a minute to dry, the side of my hand was permanently blue. I was constantly reminded of how I was different. \n\nAnother example, if you look at gay and lesbian history, they formed a community because what they were could get them killed, beaten or raped. Forming a community made it possible to defend themselves. Society considered them different and forming a community, with labels and rules kept them safe.\n\n\n\nIn short, society is always going to label you. You’re either normal, part of the group, or you’re weird.\n\nPersonally, I’d rather be called an introvert, lefty, lesbian, intp, than a weirdo. Those labels seem to make people treat me more like a normal person, possibly because it helps them understand me.
3	It's easier to think about people when you put them into boxes. I do it all the time and so do many INTPs although we're probably less prone to this than others, or at least we may think of "different" boxes than what's conventionally accepted. 
2	I don't know if it's categorising as much as a shorthand for their identity most of the time. 
2	[deleted]
1	You're not as unique as you think you are
1	It's part of our human nature. We learned that being in groups and following dynamics was beneficial to our survival. Eventually people with similar opinions start to flock together and the loudest members of the flock dictate the opinions. It's part of our hunter gatherer nature. Now that that's obsolete we search for other ways to fill that hole.
1	I do it to make some sort of sense of my rather off the beaten path existence, not because I'm suddenly desperate to fit in.  Aligning your identity with a political party is another story, though, as the ultimate in hive mentality and completely devoid of critical thought (I might be being a little short sighted, but I think this is the reason why we've found ourselves in such an emotionally driven political atmosphere where statistics are deemed hate speech).
1	Peanut butter tribalism 
1	Western countries are losing their sense of national identity and as such they turn to other places for a sense of belonging. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, because progressives typically believe that America is the worst country in the world, and that their government is shit, they become ashamed of their national identity and as such begin to embrace subcultures. These subcultures become their national identity and something that they become "proud" of and as such they seek to carve out a niche for themselves within that subculture with hopes of filling a void in their hearts.

2	Get in MAH BELLAY.
2	My first question was: "why this eaten one stopped moving after being eaten?".
2	Damn I didnt know SPORE had a remake. Looks high quality
168	Bold of you to say I’d last that long	
16	Meh, I think I do better than a lot of introverts when it comes to social battery.   \n\n\nIm a strong I by all means, but as you mature it becomes more or less a non-issue.
8	I just get depressed afterwards, the severity depending on how long I was pretending to be good while running on empty
7	Me 30 seconds into a conversation 
6	yep, i usually tell my friends\n\n&#x200B;\n\n''enough exposure to the normal world boys, i gtg''
3	I think a lot of introverts do things in public that keep them from getting overloaded. I'm usually spaced out by myself and not paying attention to much. 
1	I read bois is BIOS. Which is says a lot about my idea of having a great time.
41	Too many hobbies?	Anybody get interested in too many hobbies? Do you buy supplies & equipment for a hobby, and then a couple months later you move on to a different hobby and buy stuff for that, and then repeat again and again? And then you don't have time for all your hobbies, plus all the time you have to spend to make money, do chores, and do annoying adult responsibilities like income tax return, a smog check, auto repair, and endless bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;
12	For me it's the opposite. I'll get really into one thing, go all out with it, then stop caring a few days later and go back to a depressive state of doing nothing lol
5	Affirmative. Be it an art form, instrument, game, research topic... I’ve always got a few on the go. Normally I forget about them for a while then go back to it when I have the time. It’s cause there’s so much cool stuff available.
3	I decided to learn my self programming today, gonna make an AI soon 🙂
4	The things I want to do are getting in the way of the things I want to do!
3	yeah you’ll come back to it in a year or 2 
2	100% Same. I kinda maintain all my hobbies but like 25-70% mastery vs the 95-100% mastery of a person who has that one and only hobby.
2	“Jack of all trades, master of none, but better than master of one”\n\nIt’s your money, do whatever you want with it. If you feel like it is an issue you may consider setting a long term goal for one hobby(only example I can think of is pick a hard song you want to learn on an instrument). If you don’t think it’s an issue, keep doing it, though some organization may be worth your while for when you want to pick a hobby back up. Anyways, I’m not your dad but there’s my two cents. 
2	My home is full of expensive cool stuff I never use and books I don't read. It is my personal religion apparently. Except for politics. That one stuck. And it's cheap! But I don't get anything real or "useful" done. Making money is the biggest waste of time ever devised to keep us stupid.  \n
2	I tell people all the time, I am an inch deep and a mile wide.\n\nI have so many "hobbies" I can't keep track.\n
1	yep, i have so many interests in a variety of different things but either get super into and stop after awhile or never begin in the first place because i think it’d be too much effort. 
1	It's rare that I'll completely lose interest in something, but the honeymoon phase does wear off and it'll balance out to a manageable level.  My hobbies span different genres though, so most the time, they don't interrupt each other (though my mbti/psych rabbitholes have been taking significant time from my art as of late).  \n\nJack of all trades is correct.  Life is more interesting with more hobbies.
1	Are you me??? 
1	I long to find something I can stay interested in for a long time but my interest seems to be in the new and novel. 
1	Yup! I purchased a notebook and 2 pens, in the hope of writing a book. The notebook is still good looking, new and lovely but pens, they are about to finish.
29	standard intp interaction	step 1: I ask someone a simple, straightforward  yes-or-no question\n\nstep 2: they respond with a wordy, roundabout answer which doesn't actually tell me what I need to know\n\nstep 3: I restate my question in simpler terms, making sure to keep it yes-or-no\n\nstep 4: they give the exact same excessively wordy and uninformative answer as before, verbatim\n\nstep 5: somehow I'm the one who looks stupid\n\n(optional step 6: I go into the woods, build a tree house, never return to human society)
11	Haven't reached no. 6 yet .. But think about it everyday
7	Additional context is required here. It is rare that a question can be answered with a simple yes-or-no. For every yes-or-no question, there are about 10+ questions that can be derived from that single question that cannot adequately be answered with a yes or a  no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that said i have also experienced this phenomena at times. I guess i am being a bit pedantic here so i will stop typing now.
4	for those who have requested additional context, the question was:\n\n"is there anyone in that shower stall?"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso yeah. i fucking dare you to have a hard time answering that.\n\n&#x200B;
3	This is me except I'm the person who can't answer yes or no to the yes or no question. You're more likely to get "I guess" "Probably not" or "Well, that depends..."
5	Who's the INTP in this scenario? When people ask me questions, I love exploring ideas without actually coming to a decision. Simple yes/no questions usually lack the context needed to give a simple answer. I've written whole essays responding to yes/no questions on ambiguous homework problems to make sure I have an answer for every possible interpretation.
2	Ive gave up on asking questions. Ask a different question or fake understanding and give up questioning them again.
2	Perhaps the problem is not with the answer but your interpretation of it.
2	Why don't you try us then? Ask us a question.
2	i really do think about option 6 like every other week
1	step 2=emotional monkey wrench jamming\n\nstep 4=j type\n\nstep 5=s type (but this conclusion is a bit more complicated)
1	As an INTJ I can relate to this. Repeating the same question which doesn't require any subjective answer is so troubling. I admire INTPs who get right to the point I'm making during conversations. 
1	Or you tell someone the reason for some problem and they keep going on and on and they just can’t figure out what the reason is\n\nExample “why does my girlfriend do this that and the other blah blah blah\n\nMe:Because she doesn’t respect you\n\nThem:  yeah but blah blah blah never ending story I just don’t know!
1	Especially when you gave them a specific yes/no question, only for them to end up answering such long-winded and roundabout nonsense that doesn't correlate with your topic. Even includes the 'why' package.
1	I don't typically ask yes-no questions and I abhor blacks-and-whites.
1	You’re describing an ISTJ friend of mine to a tee. Simple question is always answered by verbose (tedious) non-responsive word salads full of qualifiers. Except he’s always the one who looks stupid. We mock the piss out of him for it, but he doesn’t ever really answer anyway.
1	I thought this was two INTP talking to each other.
1	This really applies to the teachers in my school / istj classmates. They tend to be really verbose 
0	I've never met a female INTP in my life	I have a working theory that the greatest difference between men and women is the former's predilection towards obsession. That is to say, whilst males and females might be more or less equally gifted in many areas of cognition and ability, it is male obsession which allows them to make more of their abilities - on average, of course. Men are just far more likely to sacrafice and neglect once they find a hobby. This is especially true of the INTP. We are the quintessential nerd. \n\nAll of the male INTPs I know can talk intelligently on many topics- philosophy, psychology, politics, anime, gaming etc - and they'll happily engage in conversation until someone needs a poo. I've never met a woman who can do this. Or rather, I should say I've never met a woman who would want to do this. Even the PhD in Philosophy would, at some point, yield to social convention and get up to say something nice to the host for putting on a spread. \n\nDoes INTPism manifest itself slightly differently in females? Are they as rare as unicorns? \n\n&#x200B;
12	Maybe not unicorns, but dragons perhaps. \n\nWe just stay in our lair with our hoard of obssessions, and will occasionally come out if offered food or an intriguing question/puzzle. If, however, *you* are the puzzle (a smart, witty, person with hidden depths), then we will show great interest. 
17	What does an intelligent conversation about anime sound like?
7	even if you did meet a female intp, i don't think she would have jumped in your conversations like "hey, I wanna join in". unless she knew you for some time\n\nmaybe it's because as women, we aren't used to vocalizing our opinions much. because "women don't go around arguing with everyone" \n\nI can finally let go and talk about whatever the heck i want once i'm with my friends. i do however start conversations with strangers from time to time. but most likely than not, i find that they were bothered by what i said (maybe i said something offensive? idk) \n\nor sometimes it gets awkward all of a sudden after i talk. and for the life of me, i can't figure out what it is 🙄 \n\nso yeah, you have a greater chance of conversing with a female entp than an intp.\n
5	Don't worry, you'll meet them when you get to college :)
7	Women are socially punished for dedicating obsessive amounts of time and energy to our intellectual interests. Traditional gender roles (and often individual expectations) require women to do the majority of domestic labor, including caring for young and aging family members which often come at the cost of dedicated intellectual pursuit. \n\nThis discrimination starts early too--smart, vocal girls are rewarded less than than their male peers for academic or creative excellence and male domination of social and intellectual spaces continues into adulthood and professional fields. Check out the Guerrilla Girls for stats on this in the art world. \n\nYour assumption that smart/INTP women don't exist just because you've never met them is about as valid as assuming the earth is flat because you've never personally seen it from outer space. Or assuming that, throughout history, there have been almost no women capable of scientific breakthroughs/great works of art and literature/political achievements/etc simply because these fields have been dominated by men. You're trying to universalize your personal experience, then explaining it with a worldview that discounts the experience of half the world's population. Good luck with that.
3	Perhaps it's your age that has skewed your experiences to make you think this is true? Gender roles are not as enforced as they used to be and women aren't required to sacrifice their passions in order to fulfill social obligations. On your point about seeing a statistical trend where men are the top competitors in intellectual-based competition I would posit that this has a lot to do with women being historically excluded from these communities and lacking in resources/support to break into them. 
2	Intp woman here aged 55. I generally prefer my own company. I'm not as cold analytical as some of you are in this sub. My biggest thing is a laser view into the heart if unnecessary bs. I have a really hard time at work with all the stupid ways we do things. When I speak up people generally just stare at me. I feel my personality is one you are either really drawn to or want to avoid. I often feel alone in uncomfortable ways while at the same time preferring to be alone. I'm an artist, and I find as mush it even more satisfaction creating something entirely in my head as compared to in real life  the thing I most love to analyze is why people do the things they do.
2	Female INTP here. We're not non-existent unicorns.\nStatistically, there is only 1 INTP female for every 4 INTP males (correct me if I'm wrong). It's a lot harder to come across us, I agree with that, those are facts. But "Men are just far more likely to sacrifice* and neglect once they find a hobby?" "It is male obsession which allows them to make more of their abilities?" Clearly women just care too much about makeup and gossip to dedicate their life to activities that mean the world to them and contribute to intelligent conversations, huh? No. Don't hit me with that bullshit. As someone already said, if you aren't finding any INTP girls who want to join in the conversation, it's because you aren't close friends with one. No way in hell I would jump into someone who I've never even spoken to's conversation, no matter how interesting. Introverted, remember? Doubt you'd find a INTP who'd talk deeply with you after first meeting you. That's more of an ENTP sort of thing, I'd say.
2	As most have said here, the I would prevent me from jumping into anothers conversation if I did not know those in the conversation. Also, topics of intrist differ between the sexes for many reasons. I have four siblings, two brothers and two sisters.  I can say from experience that there are things that I did not get into because I was a girl. For example, I always wanted to skateboard as a child but was pushed away by my brothers, same with video games. I had an interest, but my brothers were born first and as a girl I was expected to play with the other girls and leave my brothers alone. I was interested in the work that my father did on cars with my brothers, but I was always seen as in the way when I showed interest vs when my brothers did.
2	Hmmm female INTP here. I could and have debated for hours and hours with pleasure. Though I might interrupt myself to check in on what the socially appropriate thing to do is intermittently, depending on what the environment is. But that's a totally artificial instinct.  It was engrained through years of growing up with feelers who taught me these things and a society that indoctrinates women to take emotional labor early on. 
1	I'm more interested in learning things from people, and if I'm hooked I'd engage and debate with you.
1	Here's one\nhttps://youtu.be/dmIRdImocD8
1	Hello, INTP female. I love listening to conversations, and if I feel comfortable enough I'll throw in my thoughts. If there is a female INTP around, they're probably not comfortable enough to jump into a conversation, but that's just me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
1	Jesus, dude.
-1	Finding any T female is like finding a unicorn. Women tend to be on the emotional side.
5	How to be the Creative/Problem type for a living?	Dear fellow INTPs, i come to you for help, i am having another professional crisis and i thought you of all my friends, would be the best to put this subject to work, so thank you for considering it, even though i believe it can fit in many more people in here.\n\nMy job is not relevant now, i believe its workable with many more.\n\n As you know, the professional world as we go by is spliting the jobs into more and more categories, and masters, and you can be specialized in anything now.\n\nSo the question is, how do i get to be the creative , thinker, problem solver, strategist, type but as a professional? \n\nNote: it is out there, i have met one, and he is probably an INTP also. He only appears when we are in a contest, or the company needs something specialized in this field of thinking, strategy. Since all we they can afford to pay is ratlabour work on a regular basis..\n\n
2	Certain feilds of work have what you are looking for mostly in software and design. Depends on what you want to do. You could be a UI/UX designer for instance or go into dev ops as a software lead. Theres a lot of options and also dependant on your skills.
1	Communications involves a lot of strategy. So does politics, though I wouldn't describe either of those as professions as such. I've worked in both and I can say I've had to use my full strategic, creative, and problem-solving faculties in order to succeed. 
1	Find someone in a position of power, find ways to show your value in those respects.  If they see it as well, they'll start asking you what you think when shit comes up.  
22	Is it a common thing for female INTP’s to gravitate towards men generally speaking?	Hey fellow INTPS, i’ve noticed that throughout my life (im a senior in high school) that i’ve AWAYS stuck to either hanging out with guys or have found that people I have a very high amount of respect /admiration for are typically all men. I know that being a female INTP isn’t very common and wondered if that had anything to do with that. Anyone else able to relate to this? What’re your thoughts? 
11	As role models dont think it matters at all but the decent ones you met were males ..  friendship wise I would say maybe INTP don't gravitate toward feelings and a lot of females which can make it stuffy do so INTPs might feel more comfortable around males 
9	I’m a female INTP and personally, almost all my friends are female. I tend to have a harder time getting along with guys. But I also am very 50/50 on thinking vs feeling. 
3	NT's tend to roll male and NT's like to get along with other NT's so being attracted to males who are generally more logical might be a pattern. Perhaps you don't get along with females because you haven't come across any female NT's. Or maybe you just like being queen bee; who knows.
3	INTPs gravitate to people they can learn. For you it just happens to be men.\n\nFor me, I've been a boyish girl because I was addicted with games. I also can't relate with females back in high school.
2	It never occurred to me that this could be an INTP thing, but I was the same way in HS and to a certain degree I still am. All of my friends were male, with the notable exception of the enfp BFF I met when we were 12. The only girls I was friends with were more her friends than mine. I’ve been able to get along with other women fairly easily, but never formed any real friendships with them (just the 1.) I think being around women requires more emotional energy, and the more of us there are in the room the more it compounds! \nAlso, I’ve noticed I behave differently in a group of women than I do with men. It’s like I subtly begin to mimic them. It’s uncomfortable to look back on once the affect wears off. 
2	I think that it stems more from the fact that many INTJ/INTP traits are traditionally more "masculine."
2	I don't know if there's some sort of commonality between isfp and intp, but as the former, I've always had more male than female friends because they are easier to relate to, they're generally more interesting to me, and they're generally more open minded (in my experience, which might say more about me than it does the girls/women in my life).  As I've gotten older, the importance of relating to other women has become apparent and I've had to adjust a lot of my behaviors to try and get on that empathetic/sympathetic level.  Some days it's easier than others, but it's always a rather draining, if essentially beneficial, experience.
2	I'm a female INTP. I have a huge amount of respect and affection for the cool females I meet. But yeah , sometimes it really can be hard to maintain relationships if they're feelers because I get the sense that we just don't get each other. I always feel like I'm letting them down because I'm not more of a feeler and just don't relate to that. In the past with guys, I feel like it can be less of a high-pressure situation where I can just relax and be myself. 
2	Most of my friends are male intps or intjs. I've never really gotten that close to other females. 
2	I was raised by my dad and only have a brother, so I didn't find it odd that I preferred male friends.  
2	probably most of the people who value rationality you've ever met are males. 
2	I'm female INTP and my friends are, a ratio from male to female 8:1. Females try to be nice but I do not play well with them because there is no common ground and most women are feelers, secondarily judgemental. The one female friend I have makes me very extroverted, loud, goofy, we have a lot of fun but don't often spend time together. Also the natural appearance of INTP female from what I've witnessed is appreciated by men for minimalism, practicality. That same appearance offends females for some reason especially if the female clearly spends time on looking nice.
7	Most women operate solely on emotion, and don't know the what it means to think logically. \n\nAn INTPs nightmare.
4	never met a gay intp 
2	Personally speaking, I have a very close group of  mostly guy friends that hang out often. Out of the bunch of us there’s only about three girls total (including me) and we’re all fairly tomboy-ish. 
1	Maybe, but not all men generally, but really only  certain men with similar interests and way of seeing the world. I think probably it's more a factor of gravitating towards other NT's or other introverts for me personally... male or female. I find I don't really care that much about gender, but I'm happy to find someone I can relate to and discuss ideas with. 
1	I've always had mostly female friends up until the last couple years. Generally I just find women more understanding. I'm emotionally stunted sure but I think that's why people who are not afraid of expression emotions are such a good compliment to me. It can sometimes be taxing pretending to care about others personal business but the friendships I find have been much more rewarding.
1	I think my natural personality is more like a guy's . I'm pretty blunt and say whatever I feel once I'm comfortable with someone except I'm also shy as fck around the opposite sex especially if they're above average in looks so ultimately I have more female friends 😂 
1	Been wondering about this too. All my close friends have been male. I suspect it may have something to do with the Empathizing–Systemizing theory of sex differences ([https://www.pnas.org/content/115/48/12152](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/48/12152)). I don't know if this will apply in your case.
1	Yes, but it’s probably because most of my interests tend to be things that men are more into on average. 
1	I am a man and I've generally gravitated towards women because I find them much more interesting than men, whom I generally loathe. This has caused a quite a problem in my life now that I'm married and I find myself without a lot of my old friends to talk too. Just FYI, you may have issues if you're straight being in a monogamous relationship long-term AND being completely happy. Ha, completely happy INTP. Why do I keep typing.
1	Hi, female INTP here! Most of my friends in high school were girls, but I felt they never really 'got me', you know? Most of them saw me as the one you came to for homework help and didn't talk to me much? Meanwhile, the guys in my school were kind of douchey so yikes! But come college, I had a group of friends who were co-ed (and they happened to be NTs, yay!) so I wouldn't say I would gravitate towards a certain gender. I mean both have their differences, but I wouldn't be biased about it. 
1	Well almost all of my role models are men (but I think it's worth noting that they are somewhat androgynous and are in touch with their feminine side). I guess that makes sense: I'm a female who is often called masculine and is not really feminine for a *typical* girl; but at the same time I'm in touch with own femininity and have those certain mannerisms which are traditionally feminine, no matter who exhibits them. I really hope I've been clear here lol because I'm quite weird in this sense. \n\nAs for friends - it really depends on one's personality, but usually I do have a bit more of female friends than male. But in the general sense I do relate to men more in certain aspects, and in other ones to women (although maybe a bit less).\n\n&#x200B;
1	Yes, most of my friends have always been dudes. I'm just not into girly shit
1	I've always found men easier in general. Then again I do have a fair amount of female friends, but after forcing them to get typified an uncanny number ended up being  INTJ's or some other NT variant. 
1	I feel bad for girls who actually prefer to think instead of mindlessly follow the group
1	Maybe and maybe it's because you gravitate towards other INTPs and similar types where men seem to be over-represented compared to women. 
1	Yeah.\n\nSource: me
1	Female INTP here. I kinda feel that. Back in secondary school, the older I got the more ties I cut with the already little friends I had, mostly the female ones because I was tired of keeping up with their bullshit. I definitely used to hang with the boys more often. We were never super close, but that was fine because that way I didn't have to deal with loads of emotional and adolescent antics. \n\nSame thing during my apprenticeship. I work in a professional field clearly dominated by women, but again I found the interaction with the females in my classes to be very tiring and again, I used to stick to the males and got along with them way better, less hassle with them. I had like two or three female 'friends' during that time but that also went to shit before we even graduated, ha.\n\nPlus, back then I used to hang out in some chat rooms quite a lot, and the older I got I didn't even see the point in talking to females in those chat rooms anymore (not because I was busy seducing guys lmao) because why should I if most of them are annoying, tiring, exhausting even. Didn't know what I could possibly get out of that besides drama. \n\nNowadays I don't even have any real friends, literally none, besides some workmates I can tolerate and sometimes meet up with for breakfast or something. Guess I'm good on social interaction since my profession has fuckloads of that. Would still prefer males probably. In my spare time and in my job. \n\nBut I digress. \n\n
1	It's always been easier for me to connect with men friends. I think one reason is more common interests and a more relaxed interaction. But to be honest I think another reason might be "sexual competition" among women. In the sense... friendships among wonen are too... tense in a way that I don't like. It's like they're competing even with close friends all the time, comparing themselves all the time... it's too stressfull and not worth it. Women are toxic and envious... but then the problem with men friends is that sometimes they come on to you and they're not really your friend. So... it's tough making friends :)
0	That probably is because men are so much better than women.  Ouch, I keep telling myself to stop that. It certainly makes sense that a female INTP would resist the social expectations for women. I wonder if it is an attraction to men as much as a rejection of how we define feminine. 
0	Not me. Most men are complete and total morons.
48	I absolutely loathe academia	I feel like I should preface this by saying that I am a raging nonconformist, probably even compared to other INTPs. So to be fair, I realize my harsh judgment of academic environments isn't reflective of how important and useful they probably are to other people, but I can't help but feel as though school has failed me throughout my entire time as a student, including my time in college.\n\nStarting at around 3rd grade I remember being clueless as to how and why other students had the motivation they did in school. Grading was pointless to me. All I really cared about was advancing to the next grade as it always seemed to be the only thing I needed to do to maintain my contentment in life, so I always put in the minimum effort required. I never thought of receiving a good grade as something intrinsically valuable, so what little motivation I had to excel came in the form of avoiding shame or a conversation with a teacher or parent. I was more than content to be a mediocre student and have more time to pursue my actual interests or do things that I enjoy.\n\nEven up to now in my senior year of college I've found this to be a sustainable strategy for "surviving" school. only now I hate it more than ever. While I have had some awesome, respectable professors, I also find myself surrounded by teachers and professors who are some of the most conceited human beings I've ever come across. I still feel alienated from most fellow students as I can't relate to their obsession with GPA and other academic achievements, which I find pretty arbitrary as it doesn't determine one's overall happiness and isn't a measure of a person's intellectual abilities but more like a measure of a student's willingness to do what they are told and meet the status quo.\n\nOn top of it all I still feel like I was duped into going to college. When I was fresh out of high school I genuinely believed that I was somehow going to live a profoundly shittier life if I didn't go into debt and collect a degree like everyone else around me at the time. Only one student in my graduating class didn't have plans to go to college. He went to trade school to do something he loves and somehow his life choices were considered inferior or weird. I understand every argument in favor of pursuing a degree and it makes perfect sense for a lot of people but I have yet to be convinced that its going to be worth it for me. For me, I have gained almost no new marketable skills nor have I really strengthened the ones I have. Sure, when I graduate I'll have a piece of paper that will make some person at a desk think more highly of me. But I can't shake the thought that maybe I shouldn't have paid for a 4 year ordeal that would kill my excitement for life and drain my spirit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: skool sux lol
17	Academia has failed us because academia does not inherently do what it was designed to do which is educate. We’ve adopted the Prussian education system to create workers, not independent thinkers. Back in Ancient Greece when the “university” was first created, it was focused on developing sound logic, reasoning, creativity, and emotional intelligence in its students. You know, things that are actually important. It’s the reason why the Socratic period, and later on the renaissance produced so many geniuses. But now, we don’t want our kids to be innovative, we want them to be good workers.
17	Throughout my elementary to high school years, I really cared about grades because I somehow *knew* I must get into a decent college to become successful in life, as for why, I didn't care. The things that kept me going had nothing to do with my own interests or skills I wish to develope; instead, I was merely avoiding shame of inadequacy and embarassing conversations with my parents and teachers. I was what you could consider a "good student"; I graduated high school with a 3.75ish GPA while taking honor and AP classes throughout junior and senior years, which did help me get into the best ranking university in my state. However, I was never passionate about the things I learned and worked on; high school was boring and I didn't really care about what I had to learn, and the only thing it did was stroking my own ego and it encouraged my own laziness.\n\n\nAfter enrolling in college, my ego got shattered, and my laziness became an obstacle that I was never able to overcome. Since I was called "smart" instead of "hardworking", I never put in the efforts I should have to my harder college classes, which is why I ended up with what you call an useless degree. Although I enjoyed some of that intellectual masturbation I have had in my liberal arts classes, I have realized they really had zero practical values to help me succeed in life. I still have respect for a lot of my professors and teachers over the years because of their character and efforts; however, I don't think I have learned anything truely useful in school. As far as college goes, only a handful of majors are "useful" on their own, while the rest are just there to fulfill some people's need to acquire a degree. As an English major, I do realize it does have its values, but things like communications skills and critical thinking abilities can be gained elsewhere without having to worry about massive tuitions. \n\nI have a degree from a prestigious university; it is nothing but an expensive piece of paper. I personally think our society should stop attaching stigmas toward people who pursue trades and technical schools, because from there they can gain actual useful skills while saving time and money. Not everyone can get into a profitable major such as engineering and computer science, so a lot of college majors are simply place holders for people who are weeded out. I think the problem with humanities isn't they are useless, because they are the accumalation of our species's wisdom and culture, but they are taught in a way that is useless and unneccesary. As for English, instead of a bunch of literary analysis essays, I wish I could have learned more about things like editing and content writing, which are skills I could actually use to market myself better.\n\nSorry about the long reply.
7	Pretty ordinary train of thought for an INTP, tbh. College is not usually inherently the right choice unless you want the relatively easy track to a STEM career. Most things can be self taught, it's just much tougher without someone guiding you, telling you "you need to know this, this and this", and since INTP's typically lack the drive/self-discipline to do things without some guarantee of value or payoff, this can make self-teaching a nightmare if you don't want to put in the effort and/or have no goal in mind for motivation.  \n\n\nTrade school isn't inferior, especially in the current economy, but manual labor is also considered the "weaker" choice socially because of this weird unspoken expectation that everyone be an intellectual titan in modern society. If you like working with your hands, by all means, you can make it quite comfortably in trades by just disregarding anyone who talks down to you, just be aware that you may be choosing physical exhaustion over mental or emotional at the end of the work day.  \n\n\nIt also doesn't help that economics tends to drift toward individual workhorse specialization for collective progress, whereas INTP's are pretty staunchly individualistically daydreaming polymaths who generally aren't interested in the welfare of the collective public.  \n\n\nI would pick something useful, crank it out in the four years to get it over with, but do other stuff in your down time that you enjoy and is useful, especially if you know full well you won't use what you're studying, then advertise the skillset you chose as a specialization (even if it isn't) in order to achieve the desired level of sustainability for you to continue to diversify your interests. Otherwise you'll just grow up to be down and depressed like the rest of us, and your dreams will wither and rot from neglect.
4	Your post made me so sad that I almost cried. I have sold my sons, now 16 and 13, that what they learn in school means nothing. They will not need to recite the voyage of Charles Darwin as an adult. The point of school is not to learn rote facts, but to learn how to learn, how to distinguish truth from garbage. It also is to develop a love of learning.\n\nReceiving good grades simply means that you have mastered the lessons that were offered. I hope that my sons want to do whatever they do well. I certainly agree that we make too much of grades, and we offer too few means to achieve success, but it is hard to see how anyone could see doing something well as not having intrinsic value.\n\nThe idea of "surviving" college is even more foreign to me. It was in college that I really honed my ability to learn new things.  As a result, I find that I can quickly and easily learn most anything. On top of that, college comes at a critical point in life when the fruits of puberty ripen, and we really start to become who we will be. It is a time of freedom from parental control and exposure to unthinkable people and things. It was in college that I got my legs under me and developed more than a visceral response to the vicissitudes of life. \n\nThere is plenty of evidence that a college degree will pay for itself many times over, but that presupposes that one was a full participant in the process. Anyone who emerges from college remotely like the person who entered it has missed the boat. But I never saw college in economic terms.  For me, college was a place and an opportunity to explore ideas and knowledge that I had never imagined. It also was my opportunity to put my own imprint on knowledge and to learn how to contribute as well as to consume. \n\nIn short, for me college did not "kill my excitement for life and drain my spirit." It instead brought me untold excitement and filled my spirit in new and exciting ways. I do not mean any of this as a criticism. I am just offering you a different way to see things.  It may or may not mean anything to you, and I have been dead wrong so many times that I lost count a decade ago.
4	I feel you, and my experience is also in no way indicative of the usefulness and overall benefit of an education.  STAY IN SCHOOL, KIDS!! [/psa] I've dropped out of college four times now, hoping something would stick long enough for me to tolerate the completely arbitrary bullshit of dealing with professors and their idiosyncrasies but I just can't do it.  I hate it.  I have nightmares of going back to a classroom.  My current job, while it serves its purpose, isn't exactly fulfilling, though, so I'm considering becoming an electrician's apprentice.  I don't particularly want to work with my hands, but it would be an interesting thing to learn.  It's not that I dislike learning.  I actually love it, but on my own terms.
3	i’ve never read a more\nrelatable post than this in my entire life. wow, this is me in a nutshell. i’m currently in my senior year of high school and god do i hate it. not just because of the students here, but because of the academic system. i how people are so prone to think that if you don’t have good graces or excel in an academic setting that you’re either unintelligent or incapable of succeeding. i’ve never gotten good grades and because of this, have always felt bad about myself. i’m finally learning to accept that grades measure intelligence. it makes me so sad to think about how obvious kids my age are to this concept.  
3	The only reason I’ve ever tried in school is to not let down my friends and family. I absolutely hate it, and the only thing I’ve taken out of it is social and sleep disorders.
3	Ditto. I realized the bullshit of the American public school system at about 3rd grade as well and I just flipped a switch and just stopped caring. \n\nI only did my homework for the very few things I cared about in high school, I even broke into my math class room one night and stole the teachers book with the answers in it(I don’t get algebra, it’s too much bullshit to find an answer).  \n\nand after high school  the only school work I did fully on my own because it’s the shit I just flat out get/know without needing to learn is when I went to the police academy then all the main “cop” classes for my administration of justice degree. \n\nBut now I’m in my last semester and I have to take the last of my gen ed bullshit classes that have nothing to do with my degree so I pay people from Reddit to do my homework. 
2	...said Aristotle to Plato. 
2	uhhh its called school caters toward the average at the expense of the extremes\n\nwhich is why i have been doing the bare minimum work for school until honors english 9, where i got an excellent teacher who helped the class collectively explore the abstract concepts behind greek philosophy, shakespeare, and such\n\nalso, im still in 9th grade, but i finished english first semester\n\nim in precalc, but am already familiar with basic multivar calc (partial derivatives, vector fields, and such) because i did my own work at my own spontaneous pacing
2	I despised school right through high school.  Almost didn't graduate and had I not been told that I'd never amount to anything unless I completed high school I probably would not have finished.\n\nI was maybe a C+ student.\n\nI went into the Army after high school and got the GI Bill.  When I got out of t he Army I had convinced myself that school was easy and I could have gotten straight A's if I had wanted.  So when I started college (now this thing that I had built up in my head) I devoted myself to getting straight A's.\n\nI got pretty close (3.85 GPA if I recall).  But man, college was a serious disappointment.  It was high school 2 now with more wasted time!\n\nRehashing the same things, with just enough new stuff to keep you from rejecting it all.\n\nThere is however another side to it.  College seems to be some form of self flagellation that you must endure to get more money. 
2	I was kinda forced to care about my grades in school as my mom would confiscate my videogames, phone and computer if I had any C’s D’s or F’s. I barely graduated from high school.\n\nI also went to college immediately after high school as I had to make a decision but still not know what I wanted to do. My mom told me I had to make a decision quickly or else I’d get kicked out. It also seemed to be what schools pushed on me for as long as I can remember. What followed was me goofing off for five semesters. This last one I did do well at first and did the work, but I think I pushed myself a little too hard and ended up falling behind again.\n\nI plan to learn a trade this time around, particulalry HVAC, but I have certain concerns about automation and if I’d be wasting my time to learn a skill just to learn that they don’t need me because they have machines that can do it now.
2	Yeah, I'm pretty much in the same boat\n\nI'm Indian, and from where I'm from, it's pretty much seen as a no-brainer to go to college. There's a linear path constructed for every Indian baby be it a boy or a girl, rich or poor, whatever. It's basically go to school, graduate college with a STEM degree (major in anything else and you're apparently doomed for homelessness), get a job abroad, marry a girl/guy your parents choose for you and repeat the cycle with your own kids. I was never the sort of guy to place heavy weight on my grades or anything, so I couldn't bring myself to follow the system.\n\nAt this point in my life (I'm a freshman in college), I'm seriously considering dropping out and building myself from the ground up as a programmer. It's way more fulfilling imo. I can learn at my own pace, test my abilities myself, and not have to force myself to complete the bs (fucking assignments, projects, practicals, theses, exams, presentations) that they throw at you in uni\n\n\n\n
2	I am addressing your issue about the grading in school. I sometimes think about it as well when I was still in school. But after thinking more about it, it could be because I don't like taking tests. I don't like the nervous energy and the tension around the exam time. Until now, I still don't like it.\n\nUnlike other INTPs I noticed here, I am the overachiever INTP. I was the teacher's pet, class president and first rank student. \n\nLooking back, there were several factors to it. \n\nOne: because I am female and female more prone to worry.\n\nSecond: Because the way my parents raised me. Note: I wasn't raised in the US.\n\nEven before entering kindergarten, when I was 3~4 years old, my mom gave me a book, with pretty cover. And after she came back from office, she taught me how to write numbers and alphabets. And it was fun for me. It was great time of our bonding. Then she gave me homework, like 2 pages of writing A for the next day. When I did it, I was praised and I felt happy. So, since early age, there was certain expectation from me. With my dad, it was even more fun. When he watched 7PM news, he would let me mimic how the news anchor tell the news. And when I asked who Bill Clinton was. He gave me the solid answer, president of the united states. Then I asked again what united states was. He was ok with me and my stupid questions and never showed that I disturbed him while he watched the news. \n\nEven after I entered elementary schools. Study time was still basically TV off, my and my siblings were in living room and my mother/father would sit around. Sometimes I asked them questions about things I didn't know and they helped me. But 6 years doing that then it became habit.\n\nSince study is a habit at our house, naturally I would have good results after test. So it was never my parents "telling" me to get good grades without supporting actions for that. The perception I have is good efforts when study, good results after test. The main point is always on the effort. \n\nThere was 1 time when I rebeled because I hate physics. It was probably during junior high. And I yelled at my mom because it was so stupid and I was so stupid not understanding that. Patiently she told me to try again and again. And I was succeed. Math, chemistry and physics soon become my favorite subjects. I completed all my practice books ahead of time during junior high and senior high. It was easy for me to enter to the state of flow doing those questions. It was very exhilarating to know that you stick to it and in the end you succeed.\n\nLooking back, from all outputs I got from school, it was not the grade or the knowledge that I value most.\n\nThey were:\n1) Giving my best effort in everything, and to always challenge my limit.\n2) Learn that failure is ok, I just need to try again. Try better.\n3) Grit and persistence.\n\nAll these are important soft-skills for life. But it is quite hard to translate this into a subject in school.\n\nWatch Randy Pausch - The Last Lecture. Read Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Read Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance by Angela Duckworth.\n\nEspecially on the grit and persistence. We would not have airplane, had the Wright brothers gave up, or electricity or computers.\n\nIt was funny really that intrinsically, my parents knew about these things when they are not even a\n psychologist.

0	You are beginning to wake up. The system is rigged against us, and it starts the second we start school. I felt it in preschool, and I just ignored it after awhile. College's purpose is to force people to start off our adult lives with crippling debt, and force us to adopt a liberal mindset, or you won't graduate. 
-1	academia is a leftist organ. and its shit.. \nthats gonna change soon
23	Do y'all also somehow manage to offend everyone around you without realizing it?	Ok...so obviously I don't have many friends as it is, what with being an INTP and all, but even when I make the effort to go out and make friends, after a point I inadvertently end up doing something that seriously pisses them off, to the point that they don't even want to see my face again. So I'm left with a sum total of zero friends and back to square one...\n\nIs this an INTP thing or am I just the god of pissing people off?
14	I used to piss everyone off all the time but I learned how to be tactful and now I piss most people off some of the time. Progress.
5	People take litterly everything out of context and look for ways to be insulted in everything said at them so they might get their 5 mins of internet fame and a go fund me cause my feelings were hurt
6	Not sure, but I inadvertently offend people all the time.  Case in point, I query someone about their religious faith and employ Socratic method type challenges to why one believes in god in the first place and BOOM, sour looks and appalled expressions result.  Yikes.  Or I want to discuss something more meaningful that how the local NFL team performed and instead want to pursue some verbal thought experiment and I'm suddenly flying solo in the conversation.  Glassy eyed responses sometimes, offended reactions others, and occasionally a genuine conversation.  Rarely might be a better word that occasionally.  I have to severely limit what I discuss to avoid driving even friendly acquaintances away.  The fact that I enjoy what I'm thinking more than what most people are saying doesn't help, either...
3	I accidentally offend people all the time. It's like I have this unconscious superpower to guess what someone would be personally offended by. And say exactly that at the worst possible time :)
4	We observe. We report. It offends. 
3	I wonder if you piss people off without realizing it or get pleasure from doing so. I did not begin to change until I realized that I liked to piss people off.  Usually not because I was angry at them, but because it was my form of amusement and I enjoyed pointing out others' inconsistencies. In fact, until I was 20, I said things before I realized that I was going to. I think that with time and effort, you can develop the ability to think before you talk and to resist the temptation to say things that want to be said.\n\nFor me, I knew I could never change my mind's need to make plays on words or clever comments, but I was able to redirect them to build people up and support them instead of tearing them down. And once I did that, it became second nature, and all of a sudden, people enjoyed talking to me.  I still slip up from time to time, but for the most part, I get as much pleasure from supporting people as I did from attacking them. It is strangely rewarding to tell people "yes you can."
2	Get better friends. Stop talking about politics (of any kind).
2	I find that if I don't keep a close watch on what I say all the time, I'll end up saying something that offends someone (even someone in particular or some group of people.)  I'm not sure if I'm better off just not talking much at all or to talk more but have a 0.1% chance of saying something outright offensive.
1	I'm always saying something. Even when I'm trying not to. Idk. I'll try again next time. 
1	I know how to piss people off, but don't do it on purpose... especially at work.  In personal life, I'm perfectly polite, and if I have to say something that they dont want to hear, I'm very tactful about it.  I don't really make much of an effort to keep any friendship alive, but if I see someone I'm cool with, I say whats up or whatever....\n\nThis has resulted in no one having a problem with me, and everyone enjoying my presence... I'm invited to lots of things, even though I don't go... I don't make shitty excuses, just say i'm busy with something else.  If it's an important event (like a surprise birthday party, or a funeral or whatever, I'll be there)... \n\nPeople that try to push me around, or speak down to me... they stay on the shit list, and if I can say something that offends them, I will, but still tactfully, so it looks like an accident to anyone else around lol.
1	I'm always called too apathetic, aggressive or pathologically defensive. Which, yeah. I am. Being actively harassed most of your formative years will do that.
1	I realize it, I just learned to stop giving a fuck. Sorry my space is endless, and intruded on your safe space. 
1	Yup.
1	Not talking = not pissing anyone off
1	I grew up with a ton of feeling type people. Especially as a "lady", I think I might be some kind of a blunt anomaly. My mother and two older sister's embarrassment with my behavior is kind of an ongoing theme. But it's like, my dudes, get some thicker skin. 
1	Yes.\n\n\nSee, we can answer yes-or-no questions just fine... oh wait. Wrong person. Carry on.
1	I used to get really anxious about offending people, and yet I still managed to offend people on the regular. As I've gotten older I give less fucks about it. They can deal with it.
1	My favorite is when you make one statement and it offends 2 people for 2 different reasons.\n\nFor example go to a feminist and a redneck and say “We need to import more muslims because they’ll take womens rights away”
1	Yes because I'm an insensitive prick who doesn't give a shit to people's opinion of me.
1	I do the same exact thing.\n\nOne friend, who I dont talk to incredibly often, gets offended by what I say sometimes, jokes like using the word "retarded" or something because its offensive, but I really dont care what she thinks, especially since she says stuff herself that can be offensive in the same way and will even intentionally annoy me or other friends even when we tell her to stop and Express legitimate anger. \n\nAnother one of my friends, one of my best friends, is an ENFP and she is very intrigued by the way I think but she also takes every single thing I say to heart. Me and other friends, including her, make fun of each other and make jokes about each other; a lot of friend groups do it to show they aren't serious (or at least completely serious) and it's all fun and games; we are one of those groups. But about once every other month or so she gets super picky with something I say and I dont know why she feels so strongly about it. I will literally tell her that I'm not completely serious and I still value her as a friend, etc and I'm not trying to offend or upset her and she will make claims as to how I tLk to her differently thN anyone else which I still disagree with but she thinks I fail to see it. I personally think I've been doing better in the past month or so but it's hard to gauge with someone who will sound very irritated with me and still tell me they aren't mad or annoyed. The only reason I dont censor myself is because honesty is what I value more than anything. If I'm completely honest with you, I trust you and am closer with you than anyone else. If you're not honest with me, that's bad communication skills imo and it makes it hard for me to trust you. I dont care if what you say annoys me, if you're honest you'll get better results, plain and simple
11	Highest level of admiration = acceptance	Have you ever met some that you connected to so much without any physical attraction and even though you find some of what they do revolting you still accept them as they are.\n\nLove might be appropriate is describe such relationships but with all the emphasis on romantic love I find myself avoiding using the term..and recently started using the term 'acceptance'\n\nWhat do you think guys?
3	I think I understand what you mean, but I think that the word "connect" is at the heart of it. What you describe has happened to me only once, but my closest friend is a 78 year old man whom I met as a client. Something about both of us just clicked, and the times I have spent having a drink with him are some of my fondest memories. He is the head of an investment adviser firm with $1 billion of assets under management. He generally is as conservative as I am liberal. Although he is highly intelligent, he argues that Trump is a good president and disputes human causation of global warming. Those things add up to someone I would avoid, but they simply do not matter in our relationship. We can argue about those things, but it is always playful and gentle. \n\nI do not think that any word other than love would describe my feelings for him. Both of us are romantically focused on women, so it is not love like that. But it is a level of caring and acceptance beyond friendship. I think that you can safely use the word love, but you probably do not need a word. Acceptance is a big part of it, and I would think validation as well. We rarely get validation from people so unlike us, and when we do, it is special.\n\nWhatever it is, enjoy it, and do whatever you have to to maintain it.
2	No one is perfect. Everyone has their flaws and its up to you to decide how to really appreciate a person. How many flaws you are willing to overlook is really up to you but yes I've met people I feel connected to straight off the bat. You can still appreciate someone for who they are non-romantically; its not just a, "I love them or I don't scenario".
2	attraction breeds intimacy = vulnerability. acceptance is a secondary concept
1	Eh. So cancer patients who accept it admire cancer ?\n\nSeems the 2 are different thing to me
1	I did.
1	Yes, I've even made couple of threads about a somewhat similar thing. Sometimes I call such thing platonic crushes (not crushes in a traditional sense of the word where a physical/sexual attraction is involved). As you've said, "love" is an appropriate word to describe this, but it's a very pure form of that feeling, which mainly stems from admiration and connection. And as vasubandu mentioned here, "it is a level of caring and acceptance beyond friendship".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are those thread that I've mentioned if you're interested (yes I've asked the same thing on several forums to get input from a bigger amount of different people):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/aiolxj/intense\_nonsexual\_crushes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/aiolxj/intense_nonsexual_crushes/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/aiygd1/curious\_intp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/aiygd1/curious_intp/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/aknyp0/curious\_intp\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/aknyp0/curious_intp_here/)

6	Me whenever i meet someone my age:	
43	Felt like this belongs here	
2	\nWhat is being let go?
2	Never let it go. Ever.
2	You ... Felt .... It belonged here? Fake INTP confirmed.\n\nPS. Just kidding.
7	Wow.... Found a forum about my personality type!	[www.16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTook that and found out about myself, fits me to a T but I am 45 and have overcome many of my negative traits. 
3	You should take some more tests first; that one can be unreliable
3	I take it that you mean you were identified as INTP. There are some here who treat INTP as an exclusive club membership in which has to be earned. They are the same ones who will tell you that you are a pretender, an INTP wannabe. Personally, I quit taking those tests after I found this place.  My reaction was "I have people! I have found my people!" It still is.  All of them, including board of the exclusive club. After half a lifetime thinking that I was stuck being a one-off, I found this place where I feel right at home. The way I see it, if this place fits, then you are INTP and you belong here. Welcome.
1	You should try the humanmetrics one, and maybe idrlabs , those are a little bit better :) but you should also learn about cognitives functions ;) \n\nWelcome mate :) 
1	Obvious troll is obvious.
1	As much as i wanted to drop a nasty and/or tasteless joke that only i would understand... you're 45 so yeah. Welcome home, i guess??
1	Snap really I'm 45 too. I didn't really read too much into it until I saw a local ENTJ on a dating site and in true INTP style I did as much research as I could into why we were supposed to match.\n\nI found Quora most helpful reading that others did exactly like me writing out replies. re-writing them multiple times and then deleting them.
1	Quit the excitement and hand me, the ENTP manager of this sub, the membership fee. 
433	Big if True	
48	No one needs to hear from me? Sounds perfect.
27	Are we supposed to befriend other INTPs? I mostly want to be alone and yet.. I get lonely.
23	Yep.
20	Just getting a phone call or text from someone stresses me out.  Isolation is always what I've preferred.  It would be nice to find someone who I can actually relate to though.  I've always generally had 1 or 2 good friends.  But the majority of my 20s were spent in isolation.\n\n&#x200B;
6	It's not like i love isolation.. It's more like I'm too lazy to talk or make friends
5	I just turn on all the random notifications to keep my notifications center alive.
4	That's too much, man.
4	Feels good man
3	‘All my friends are dead/push me to the edge’
3	I wouldn't call it ruined, I just never grew the relationships in the first place
3	Sounds about right.
3	Yep. Not one person here has disagreed. 
2	Ouch 
2	They finally gave up
2	Why not troll on facebook and get notifications that way?
2	How tf is it that i can relate to 85% of the things in here, you fkrs are retarded like me and i love you all
1	Well it's either this or having a panic induced mental breakdown every time my phone beeps. I'm fine with this. 
1	Im trying to read the text on the phone case but i cant make out the letters
1	Sometimes this shit is all too real. \n\nFML...
1	Happened way too many times. I feel called out. Oh lord I think I’ve learnt how to apologise professionally 
1	Hmm this is such a classic conundrum for us. Im still not sure if I have it figured out. But lately I’ve just tried to do what feels right to me. I have some old friends where we all keep in touch on a continuous group chat and get together for a meal once a month or so. I have my husband and son and other family. Also a couple old coworkers that I liked enough to meet up with now and then. Before I became a stay at home parent, I had coworkers to socialize with daily. Most of the time this is enough for me. I have a really hard time getting motivated to cultivate new friendships. I’ve been more isolated since becoming a SAHP. I have tried going to SAHP groups and it’s usually ok, but I feel pretty meh about them and don’t go to one more than once or twice. I’m just trying to follow my gut now.
1	It's hard when I want them to just hate the ever living fuck of me but they are good guys who understand why I'm in isolation. *sigh
1	For a moment I thought it was r/2meirl4meirl, I felt attacked.\nThen I realised this is basically what's really happening.
1	At least i get a notification to remind me of this.
1	#@ notification on discord\nreality: *announcement*
1	Big fax 
1	Big Oof
1	So true it hurts
1	actually im annoyed by notifications. It really pisses me off when i see the light on my phone going off.. especially if i wanna sleep and it just blinks.\n\nSome stupid app notifies me about some trivial unnecessary shit.
1	Omg this is so damn relatable, it's scary 😂
1	Is it just me or are a lot of relationships based on pretending and tolerance. The INTP need for complete, factual presentations and understanding of things can be a social and interpersonal disaster. 
0	Fuck people and their cell phones. They're fucking zombies, programmed by their cell phones, who also have the right to vote for damn sake. Look at the fake-ass bitch in the photo. Do you think her smiles means she's a nice person? Do you think for one second she's not racist against white people? Do you think for one second a person like the smiling bitch in the photo would ever, one time stand for individual human rights? OF COURSE NOT, WTF ARE YOU THINKING? 
6	love 2 cry at medical dramas & b stoic in real medical crises	Does anyone else feel way more emotionally involved in fiction than real life? I love my family, but I get very calm in response to their actual medical issues. My entire family seems to resort to dark humor when things seem particularly dire.
3	Yeah, the only times I really open my self to experiencing emotional stuff is when I'm alone and not likely to be bothered. So yeah reading or watching fiction in my room is the majority of it.
5	An explanation of INTP problem solving?	We use Ti to build a mathematical equation model to represent objects. I.e. we approach objects in terms of "wholes" that unfortunately are subjective. Te types have incomplete models of objects but are objective. \n\nSo we basically have this conglomerate of how changes in variables affect the other variables within the equation of a certain "thing" or object. And have an input and output. Then Fe presents Ti with a goal of perceived value(connotation literal perceive, not perception function. So perhaps evaluated is the better term). Ti will reductively work backwards.\n\nLets say your goal is low amounts of E. If A at a high value implies B then C then D then low E, then A needs to be at a high value to achieve low E. So we have reduced the complexity of the problem from a system of "A, B,C,D, and E" down to a simple relationship of "high A then E" by understanding relationships between each variable. But lets say A is at a low value. There is some reason it is at a low value. We have to "solve" the thing that is causing A to be a low value by making changes to that which produces A. An illustrative example of this is as follows: imagine you have a two objects. A large box and a small box. Now imagine there is a keyhole that can only be unlocked by putting an oval in it, the oval is smaller than the large box and bigger than the small box. To make the key, we have to change the large box by chipping away pieces of it until it can fit, or we add pieces around the small box until it fills up the entirety of the oval.\n\nNow lemee take a short second to explain Ti-Ne and Ne-Ti together. If ne ti perceives a box, Ne might also associate the box with a dishwasher, or a dryer, or a shipping crate Etc etc. They all have the same essence, they are boxes.(Ti will sometimes fuck this up. An example of a fuck up is when you use a hypothetical to prove something but the hypothetical isn't the exact same form as what you are getting at so it doesn't follow perfectly). A hypothetical example I once used: if a person walks out into society and gets punched then it is kinda their fault. My hypothetical for this was "well if an elevator said *50% chance you die if you use this* and you used it and died then people would say it was kinda your fault for using the elevator." The difference that wasn't initially spotted is that ethically speaking an elevator=/=a person.\n\nThe above is also why Ne users rule over their meme domains with an iron fist, crushing all Se users who come within striking distance. Kill on site as we don't want them. Basically Ne doms are constantly associating what happens to other situations with identical underlying structure. Enfp will be utter meme gods for emotional reaction memes and relating them to how they are currently feeling.\n\n\nSo basically Ti-Ne has this equational representation in its mind of the difference between the oval and the box sizes. For the large box it's gonna try to come up with ideas to shave the box, but for the small box it will basically say "equation of oval keyslot minus box dimensions=oval with box cut out of the middle" then Ne will make associations to everything it knows that equals "oval with box cut out."\n\nI do not yet know how Ne presents ideas for chipping away at the large box despite knowing what changes in form need to be made i.e. choice of tool.
7	This  theory of yours is logically sound and it reminds me of a theory that I am working on (and have applied to real world problems in computer science) known as "Idiosyncratic Problem Solvers" which frames (literally) everything as a problem or a solution to a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith this said, you will (and i have seen) be attacked because most INTPs here are extremely shallow and does not understand that INTPs are the most abstract of the personality types and as such it is factually correct to say that we think of things in terms of "mathematical equations." They will be incapable of understand that you are not referring to literal actual mathematical equations (HEY MOM! I'MA COMPUTER!) but instead functional analogues of mathematical equations.\n\nI believe that it would be very valuable for you to continue refining this process. If you are good with software engineering or computer science, attempt to restructure this into an algorithm that can be implemented.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might not realize it, but you have detailed some of the fundamental concepts of machine learning. I am sorry that you have to deal with narrow-minded individuals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\--- edit ---\n\nThere is a large amount of trolls on this board today. Already had to block two of them.
2	Your experience of being INTP is far more concrete and defining than mine is. My being INTP is just a few tendencies and inclinations, all of which can be overridden by circumstances. I am not any one thing or any one way so much that I cannot seamlessly be the opposite. In truth, I find myself adapting to others far more often than I expect them to adapt to me. I also do not tend to simplify relationships and processes in the way you describe for A and E. In my own experience, it often makes more sense to change A, B and C all less drastically to achieve a desired result, and if lose sense of the connection between all of them, I no longer understand the process. Then again, I tend to find the whole Ti and Ne thing to be an attempt to explain horoscopes with logarithms. I certainly might be dead wrong, but there are times when I would rather be wrong and content than right and wanting to crush people. To each his own.
1	Math has nothing to do with typology.
1	Wtf is this post about? I tried following along because I’ve gone down the MBTI rabbit hole more than once, but I don’t understand wtf you’re talking about
0	You are so far down the rabbit hole dude. I donno how many times I gotta say this but people =/= mbti archetypes. You my friend have cookie cutter syndrome and you need to re-evaluate your life choices.
223	Who’s ready for Valentine’s Day?	
42	The picture cracked me up because it reminded of a time  . . . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in Grenoble, France studying abroad from the University of Kansas.  I met a woman who was studying abroad from the College of Charleston, and I was smitten. Smitten, but silent. Petrified. We spent a lot of time together as friends, but I so wanted to kiss her.  We went to dinner one night, and I was looking at her telling myself to just tell how I felt, but I said nothing. When we got back to dorm room after dinner, she asked, "Why were you looking at me funny at dinner?" I denied it. I dodged and weaved, but she persisted, and I finally blurted out, "I want to ask you out, but I don't know how." And I thought to myself that a rip in the universe would appear and swallow me up. If I was lucky, we would just stop being friends.  But she said, "You just did silly. And I feel the same way." We started to kiss, and it was the most amazing thing that ever happened to me.  We now have been married for 31 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is that you do not have to come across as Marlon Brando if that is not who you are. You can even lead with your weakness and admit up front that you are inexperienced and nervous. If the feelings are at all reciprocal, the response will be gentle and welcoming.  So yeah, you have to express your interest, and you can express it as who you are.  If you are already friends then she knows you an introvert. Be authentic, and you can handle the worst that could result.
7	I would rather fold socks.
6	Fuck this shit.
5	Speaking of, this evening, I'm planning to confess to my crush. And this post gave me a bit of hope and also made me die inside just a bit more.
4	I spent all day cleaning for my GF, baking homemade pizza, and planning to have a cocktail ready for her the second she walks in the door. I’m super cheesy and embrace the day to its fullest if I love someone.\n\nThen we’re gonna go grab some beers at our favorite brewery and go to a concert tonight! Very excited.
2	No, don't put that on me, I'm even worse than you.  やめて . 
2	I wish I had a crush to confess to but no one comes to mind tbh. Besides itd a cruel and unusual punishment to have someone date me. 
2	That is me. And fuck it, they won't tell me...
2	Social media was a win for our kind, I just figured it was a numbers game and went on the attach vs waiting. 
5	Well, I'm considering taking up self-harming because I really can't think of anything else to try at this point, and Valentine's Day seems like a pretty appropriate day to start that project.  Does that count as "ready"?

84	But you'll get bad grades for not doing it the way, your teacher was teaching it.
15	I used to think all teachers were incompetent then I realized I was just an asshole. Teachers open the door, you have to go through it. If you're not teaching yourself the material you're not learning, it's essential that you teach yourself the material unless you can instantly memorize and understand everything the teacher is saying
14	I went to a crappy little Christian school.  Calculus wasn't even in the curriculum, and the science textbooks covered young-earth Creationism.

1	All the time. Good teachers are hard to come by, but I think its a good skill to be able to teach yourself and be self-dependent anyways

1	I teach writing at a 2-year college, and my INTPs are usually ‘smart resisters.’ Bright enough, but only want to do it their way. So- that rarely gets an A. Part of getting good grades is conformity- whether we like it or not. Usually not. That being said, conforming is a skill, not a lifestyle, and there are advantages to being able to adapt to the expectations of others. But, most INTPs will see themselves as... well, the dog walking itself in the picture. Irl though, what happens to dogs who think they can walk themselves? You got it— splattsville.
11	Morality	How are you guys on morals? Am I the only one who’s a bit conflicted on morality because trying to differentiate between right and wrong always comes back to existential and metaphysical topics?
2	Could care less\n
2	Correct me if I'm wrong but ethics and morality are not interchangeable. A tl;dr version is that ethics is Fe while morality is Fi. Said functions define what morality and ethics are.
2	I don't really have a very rigid set of personal morals, and my morals are easily influenced by the environment I am in and the people I am with. I don't really think all that much about morals; I simply go with the flows. To me certain moral standards are necessary to keep the society stable and human interactions generally predictable and safe. I don't think morality is something that is divine or predetermined , because it seems to be formed based on human needs. For example, not to murder, steal, and torture are all pragmatically good morals to follow in order to live in a society because humanity is a collective species. I personally adapt to morals that are acceptable to my environment so I could function more easily. As for moral relativism vs moral objectvism,  I never gave it too much thoughts because I find that debate to be irrelevant to what I have to do as a person; if morality is relative, then there is nothing to dig into because there will be no objective truths to it; if morality is objective, I am not able to claim my standards are adhering to universal truth; therefore, I allow myself to set my mind aside for other things. 
4	There is no right and wrong. Look out for yourself and the one's you love. No one else really matters.
1	> trying to differentiate between right and wrong always comes back to existential and metaphysical topics?\n\nGet real. Admit that in the end every topic becomes about the existential and metaphysical. This doesn't phase you when it comes to the vast majority of the daily things you do. Why should philosophizing about morality suddenly be different? \n\nYou choose to stand behind the morals that make sense to you in the context of your current understanding of existence. If this seems hard to you, perhaps you should study existence first before attempting to figure out what to think of it. Once you know what it is that you are actually experiencing, conjuring up a fitting moral framework becomes self-explanatory.\n\nIn the end, either you reject a moral principle or you embrace it. In 99% of cases, pondering the metaphysical implications of your choice is only distraction from actually making a choice.
1	it shouldnt. defines values , understand value systems
1	I'm reading Beyond Good and Evil and I just finished an essay on extra morality and when I say just, I mean I haven't had much time to unpack any of it, but as a person of faith, I find the very idea of being "above morality" completely boggling.  I understand the subjectivity of morality, but without certain absolutes, how do we not descend into violent chaos?  If the idea is to be so enlightened that morality becomes redundant, I'm not sure we're capable of it.  "Do no harm" is hard enough to live up to.
1	I have a strong moral sense.  I know what is right and what is wrong.  It doesn't always align with what every one else thinks, but I can defend my position.\n\nThat's morality for me.\n\nFor most other people it seems like morality is something they wear like a designer outfit.  It's for show and they want you to notice it, also it's usually someone else's idea they are just presenting as theirs.
5	Y'all got conversation haccs?	So, I am so. Frickin. Bored. In so many conversations. They are all so shallow about boring life struggles that aren't even struggles, family gossip and for frick's sake the weather.\n\nThe only fun conversations I have are with my INTP and ENTP friends. \n\nIs there a trick? Can I make people talk about weird abstract stupid philosophical existential crap while making offensive jokes?\n\nPlease help.
11	Sure. In conversations try to find out what you have to learn from the other person. Try to find what makes them tick. People love when others are interested in them, and they love to talk about themselves. But for this to work, you have to really care and really want to find out.\n\nIf you try this, you will find that other people are not as shallow as you thought. In fact, you will find that they are as deep and multidimensional as you are.  Just in different ways and in ways that you did not notice before.  Everyone has something to teach you, and if you go into a conversation thinking that they are shallow and boring, you will never find it.\n\nPerhaps the problem is you and not them. It took a long time and a lot of effort, but I discovered the trouble in my life was me, and once I changed my perspective, everyone else became a lot smarter and more interesting.  Not unlike what happened to my parents after I went to college.
2	I like to ask very unexpected followup questions to the usual small talk to get people out of their small talk zone
2	Usually not. I found certain people who like to here me talk but dont have views of their own, and other times I stay quiet and make bad timed inappropriate jokes. 
2	 Just ask weird stuff and see what people respond with. "Hey man do you think people will live on the moon one day?"\n\n You'd be surprised how many people are just as bored as you are with pleasantries and everyday bullshit. Many people are happy to find an open minded person that can chat about tonnes of interesting topics in depth.\n\n Worst case scenario someone thinks you are weird and stops sharing their mundane stuff with you. \n\n 
2	My siblings, because they were raised and forced to deal my with existential crap while making offensive jokes. \n\nSports teams. Locker room talk has zero filter, and you can find brilliant people that play sports. \n\nFraternities. This is a dying breed, because universities are terrified of large groups of men with a similar mindset. Don't mistake fraternities for sororities. Sororities train women to take advantage of, steal, cheat, and do whatever they want to get what they want. \n\nFraternities teach men that large groups of men can pretty much do anything they put their minds to.
2	Agreed.  My modus operandi is to bait a conversation with leading questions on insightful topics (hominid evolution, quantum field theory, opinions on Vivaldi vs. Beethoven, etc.) and see who bites.  Glazed eyed responses from my intended conversation partner are a likely sign that I need to move on, as are any references on their part to the score in a recent game, any described disagreement with their spouse, or any commentary on how things are worse now than in the 'good old days'.  \n\nI'd love to surround myself with clever conversationalists who appreciate that a debate is not a fight, around people who enjoy moral conundrums and revel in engaging with a devil's advocate to test currently held theories and assumptions about the world around us.  Those clever conversationalists are too few...
1	call me when you find the answer
1	Short of gradually steering conversations through the practiced use of follow-up questions, I don't know any good shortcuts. Unfortunately, society thrives on the short-lived, so getting a good, deep conversation out of people is incredibly tedious.
1	Yes, a couple fingers of bourbon.  You get to hold something while drinking something that makes inane conversation a little bit more tolerable.  Note: this is not an acceptable work practice but works wonders at get togethers with the in-laws.\n\nI'm not even one of you but I adore the intp and entp boards.  I have no real hacks except challenge yourself and practice using your Fe/empathy/whatever you want to call it.  It'll get easier eventually, right?  Right??
1	I don't know about pulling them into deeper conversations but the best way to maintain sanity during shallow conversations for me is to process information and then self amuse by distorting the scenarios. I think taking something boring and making it idiosyncratic and funny enough to perk your mood is a really useful ‘skill’.
1	I can tell you what not to do from experience lol. I like to ask questions somewhere along the lines of "If you could only eat one food in whatever preparation for 10 years, what food would you choose?". This is to do two things, if they say something logical like lettuce, chicken, or beef, I will stop asking questions and have a real conversation. If they say something illogical like hamburgers or just don't answer I prefer to annoy them with more of these types of questions until they leave. 
1	i love talking about the weather, no emotions, no need no use the brain (for the non-intp person whom im talking)  \n\n\nPolitics? Economy? Phenomenology? 
92	It really do be like that sometimes....	
25	Must maintain rapport...calculating appropriate emotional response...Result: mirroring.\n\n“Oh god Helen! Please don’t go! You are my life!!”
15	When the guard started clapping I lost it haha
11	Can't say for sure but may have done something similar...\nMy mental probability calculator tells me I most likely did. Often.
4	Gotta try and give em what they want
2	When I was in there, although I told everyone I didn’t want to see them for a few months (I saw the bright side as a giant vacation from everyone I knew), a couple people showed up anyway, thinking I’d have a “change of heart” (whatever tf that is) but some choices are left up to the prisoners (like 2 or 3 total) and whether or not to see a visitor is one of them!  Ah, mediocre times.
1	I've probably done that aswell, at some point
10	I tingle all over when I listen to nostalgic music...not INTP?	I place a a lot of emotional value into nostalgic things it seems. I've been listening to an hour long Zelda music compilation and a variation of Zelda's Lullaby came on, and my scalp tingled uncontrollably, as if having a mental orgasm. Since I put a lot of value into "Nostalgia" but don't give much of a crap about the goings on outside my circle, does that mean I have high emotional intelligence, or i'm simply appreciating good music? These mental orgasms happen to me often while listening to high value music and doesn't necessarily have to be nostalgic. Also for the record, I've taken a few personality tests and I was tested an INTP in all but one, the exception being INTJ.
5	I find certain music profoundly moving. I'm not sure it necessarily equates to strong emotional intelligence, but I think it means I'm capable of connecting with the soul of humanity.\n\nThe ability to compose brilliant music to me is the most impressive skill. Like, I'm into all the arts, but to be able to move people through music to me is godlike. 
4	This is because Si is our third (child) cognitive function. The third cognitive function is also the "memory" function and as such our long term memory is some among the the best and highest of all of the types.\n\nAdditionally, Fi is the last function in our cognitive stack which gives us access to our Super Ego.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe short of this is that all INTPs are prone to nostalgia and reminiscing. Additionally, Since Si mediates how we felt in the past (as opposed to how we feel in the moment), hearing a song can jog positive memories and give you  a dump of dopamine, trigger release of norepinephrine(stress hormone) in some cases, and Oxytocin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis cocktail along with a few other neurotransmitters is what gives you that tense of euphoria (mental orgasm).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: You are a properly functioning INTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you've never played the associated game, the following songs will trigger that feeling of nostalgia:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDThbiDrDOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDThbiDrDOc)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-wez5eZwWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-wez5eZwWA)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u\_VHsD2aa7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_VHsD2aa7s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhy3G7-2fcY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhy3G7-2fcY)\n\nINTPs unironically like vaporwave and synthwave.
3	I don't think there's much of a correlation between the personality type and the ability to respond emotionally to or at least appreciate music. \n\nI'm an INTP whose one of the most favourite things in this life is beautifully written musical compositions. They can make me very emotional, up to the point that I start crying. Or they can make me feel pure joy; that's why I make my own music as well. \n\nApparently I'm just quite sensitive to sounds in general.\n\nA bit unrelated probably, but even the tone of person's voice can evoke a strong emotional response in my case, sometimes even more than words do.
2	Happens the same with me (only with very specific songs and not always)
1	Early 2000 punk rock. Not only does it bring back good nostalgic vibes but it recharges my social battery if I hear it while I'm out sometimes. Usually specific songs from my chemical romance or Avril Lavigne.
1	Being INTP doesn't mean you're utterly unresponsive to things that evoke emotion.
1	Weird, I've also been listening to similar stuff lately. Namely [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox2D-EJoB0w).
1	I'm not emotional at all - but music I absolutely connect with.  I think it's really good that you can get that out of music - you are one of few who understands it that way.  Some friends of mine just view all music as noise and would rather listen to political talk shows than any form of music.  THAT I cannot understand.  \n\nI love music, especially live music... my fav band is Phish and I've seen them many times, and hopefully many more...  They have a couple songs that are very moving.  Trey, lead guitar/singer, lost his sister during his youth and wrote a song called "miss you" that makes me very emotional... he sings it to his sister but anyone who has lost anyone can relate.  I don't know how he holds it together while he sings it... Just the opening chords get me emotional (and I swear, I'm a robot the rest of the time).  I love the song, but kinda sucks when they do it live cuz I start tearing up - but their shows are like an emotional roller coaster anyways... psychedelics enhance it significantly.\n\nJust for you - I paid the emotional cost and found a link... don't know if it's really a good version of the song cuz I'm at work and can't preview the whole thing or ppl will think something is wrong with me!\n\n[Phish - Miss You](https://youtu.be/n9WY_zLIJPE)\n\nAnother song I really like is usually pretty short, and has no words - but it doesn't need words. Puts me on another plane... \n\n[Phish - What's the use](https://youtu.be/f2Zae9WXsqs?t=70)\n\n...don't worry about what you are - just enjoy the music!
1	INTP are 4th function Fe Principles. Music is "nostalgic" in ... Principle. Please someone else figure this out besides just me. 
3	A few thoughts for those of us who are depressed (and the one who isn't)	Like a lot of you, I have fought depression all my life. The past year has really changed things, which would be much better news if I were not 54 years old.  Since depression seems to be a common theme, I thought I would share a few things.\n\n1.   esKetamine\n\n   Ketamine is a drug originally developed as a veterinary anesthetic and then used in people. It was discovered to have disassociative effects and became a popular street drug, usually called "Special K." People noticed that it seemed to alleviate their depression symptoms, which led to formal research.  The evidence was quite strong, and "Ketamine Clinics" opened all across the country.  They have doctors and use Ketamine off label. It is administered by IV in a dose low enough not to cause the psychotic effects.\n\nA Johnson and Johnson pharmaceutical company developed a nasal spray alternative with an isomer of Ketamine called esKetamine.  The initial studies were very positive, and the FDA gave it breakthrough status, meaning that it would be processed with the highest priority. Last September, Jansen submitted an application to the FDA for approval, and tow days ago, the responsible committed recommended FDA approval on a 14-2 vote. Final approval is now a formality, and is expected by March 4, 2019.\n\nesKetamine works differently than any other antidepressant.  It states taking effect within hours in many cases.  Many expect that it will completely rewrite the treatment of depression.  You can Google it.\n\n   I have no idea how much esKetamine will cost.  However, Jansen has a study on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) that appears to be nationwide.  It can be found at [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03829579](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03829579).  I sent an email and received a voice mail with a case number and phone number to call.  I have not yet reached them yet, but if there is a free alternative, that might help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Transcrainial Magnetic Stimulation.  \n\nTMS uses a magnetic coil to create a magnetic field that stimulates the left and/or right frontal cortex of the brain. Unlike ECT, it has no serious side effects.  Treatment consists of a session lasting 15-20 minutes every weekday over 30-40  days. It is very expensive and only viable with insurance for most people.  However, most insurance does cover it with a history of no results over several antidepressants. About 60% of people get a benefit with 40% reporting remission, and those numbers largely holding after a year.\n\nNormally, the effects of TMS start to be evident after 3 weeks.  My case was very different. After the first treatment, most of my depression was gone, and after the second, I was free of depression. I am now in my fourth week of treatment, and still completely free of depression.  Again, my reaction is an outlier, but many people get relief when nothing else worked.\n\nTMS treatment is based on the finding that people with depression as a group have less activity in the left frontal cortex than the right, while happy people as a group have more activity in the right. Most TMS treatment is to the left frontal lobe only and is designed to stimulate activity. \n\nThe treatment itself feels like a bunch of strong static shocks above the left temple.  Some people find it very uncomfortable, but I have never had problems with it. If you have tried everything without results and have insurance, you might want to look into this.  It will require preapproval and a psychiatrist.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.  Dialectical Behavior Therapy.\n\nAlthough I have been in therapy for ten years, I never heard of DBT until I read an article in Huff Post about it.  [https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/how-to-help-someone-who-is-suicidal/](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/how-to-help-someone-who-is-suicidal/). As that article explains, DBT was designed to treat suicidal ideation, and it has been proven more effective than any other modality. Strange that I have not heard about it because it was developed at the University of Washington here in Seattle.  Seattle is the center of the DBT world.\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy is built around mindfulness, which means a balance between rational thinking mind and emotion mind, a state that it calls wise mind.  DBT teaches skills to deal with a number of things, including emotional dysregulation.   If you think that you do not have emotions or control them, then you have emotional dysregulation. I say that from personal experience.\n\nThe DBT program lasts a year and consists of one hour of therapy weekly and two hours of class. When I first looked into it, I almost decided against trying because I do not do group anything. I am not a member of anything except the bar association and then only because I have to. The idea of sitting around listening to other people sounds like torture. As it turns out, I was wrong. Classes are more class than group therapy, and the group therapy parts have been very helpful. I have had cognitive behavioral therapy and some other kind, and DBT is completely different. I chafe at some of the skills, but when I do the exercises, I invariably find that I benefit.  DBT has radically altered my life for the better.\n\nPeople in most areas can find a DBT therapist.  As an observation, most therapists that actually use DBT do not use anything else.  Therapists who list DBT as one of 12 approaches they use are highly unlikely to offer DBT.  DBT was developed by Marsha Linehan at the University of Washington, and many DBT therapists will identify training under Linehan. There are now some competing models (with the usual politics), but I do not think that it matters. However, if treatment does not include an hour of therapy and a two hour class every week, it is not DBT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this might provide some resources for others who have struggled as I have.  Between the TMS and the DBT, I feel better now than I ever remember in my life. I never expected to feel anything like the way I do. I thought about suicide almost daily since kindergarten and was in the process of killing myself when DBT intervened.  I no longer have suicidal thoughts, and for the first time in memory, I do not wish I were dead. We can get not just just better but actually well. And well is better than depressed any day.
2	Wow, I work my arse off each day and I hate my job. It makes my time a lot more valuable.
1	lil pump ESKETIT
1	I've had TMS, and while it was partly effective for my chronic depression, it caused muscle soreness in the entire right side of my body that hasn't gone away in over a year. Also, its effect was mostly to make me *feel* less depressed, while still having the motivation, concentration, and other problems that come with it. Additionally, I still have to take antidepressants at a lower dose (I'm working on discontinuing).\n\nPsychiatrists won't admit this, but the way ECT works is to scramble the information storage and processing structures of the brain, permanently erasing memory and personality information. This is most evident in patients who have had prolonged ECT treatment and elderly ECT patients. Antidepressants and most other psychiatric drugs work on basically the same principle. Their effect is to disrupt and impair brain function so that the person cannot be depressed, psychotic, etc. Besides that, they have many side effects, some of which can be permanent. They should only be used as a last resort. Antipsychotics in particular cause brain shrinkage and should only be used for moderate to severe psychosis that the person can't deal with themselves. (Instead of being prescribed for depression etc. as they currently are.)\n\nBased on that I'm guessing that TMS is basically just "ECT-lite" and still causes brain damage. There's even a chance it could be worse than ECT, since not enough research has been done and these kinds of things are covered up regardless.\n\nGiven all that plus the cost, I would not recommend TMS unless you have a severe and prolonged case of depression that doesn't respond to medication.\n\nNote that term "chemical imbalance" is a myth and marketing gimmick. No psychiatrist or neurologist knows the exact functional mechanism that causes depression (assuming there is one, which is dubious); they only have guesses and correlations, most of which are effects rather than causes. Furthermore, most cases of depression are mild to moderate and last 6~12 months, so it's better to ride them out than take drugs. Better than that is to actively think through one's depression and deal with its root cause (which is always at least partially environmental). This again is impaired by antidepressants.\n\n---\n\nKetamine, psychedelics, MDMA, cannabis, and others seem promising. The way they work is to alter one's thought process and make the subconscious more visible, giving more insight into the mind and mental illness and hopefully pointing toward solutions. Therefore it's important to actively think about your mental illness and other problems when using these drugs. Their purpose is not just to relax and be entertained by the pretty colors.\n\nThis is also why some people find meditation helpful. Some forms of it can give insight into one's mental processes and other issues. (Note that the form of meditation where you clear your conscious mind and "be aware of the present moment" or "don't judge, let go of your thoughts/emotions", etc. was created by and for Feelers and is harmful to Thinkers (one described it as "mental suicide"). As a Feeler myself, I haven't found that form useful. Clearing the conscious mind might help some people by making their subconscious (intuition) more active (exercise also helps with this).\n\n---\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy is mostly effective on Feelers. Even as a Feeler I found it was mostly a waste of time and money. Some of the exercises were helpful for my panic attacks and social anxiety, but these can be found in books. (I'm aware that CBT and DBT aren't the same but I'm guessing they're similar enough for what I said to apply.)\n\nSuicidal ideation is INF type. (Most of the people who talk about suicide are INF. Certainly INFs talk about suicide more than any other type.) It's caused by the mind operating in "INF mode" (feeling trapped for example). It can be treated by avoiding INF people and influences and rejecting their philosophies such as nihilism and existentialism. (Absurdism is ENTJ so probably okay but not ideal for INTPs). For that matter, bipolar, mania, and depression are all INF, I believe, and can be treated similarly. Anxiety is ENF.
1	Coincidentally I only found out about DBT a month or so ago too I'm 45 in the UK. I found a practice in London.\n\nI don't really want to do a years course rather a few units, but maybe I should. Like you I remember the thoughts starting early. Telling my father I wished I was dead. 'Don't say that' was the response I got.\n\nI read some case studies that have helped to a degree, but self validation is probably the biggest single issue I'm aware of. \n\nAnyway thanks for sharing.
1	I've found that living an active, engaged, balanced life tends to keep these things in check (this will look different for different people).  Usually when i'm slipping, its usually because i'm slipping back into isolation, or to focused on one aspect of life (as we tend to do).  Living that kind of life tends to be hard for types like us (which is probably why we're more suceptible to depression)
4	Did you use recreational drug during high school?	Alcohol, cigarettes, vaping, weed, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Drugs\*\*
4	Nah.\n\nI drink a lot of caffeine, but that doesn't really count IMO.
4	no
2	only way to get thru it
2	Yes. It's all we have to deal with what everyone else has done to this world.
2	No and I still haven't used any drugs. I'm against drugs, including pharma drugs. Sometimes I drink a beer, but not too often. It's bad for your liver.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	No.
2	Last couple years of high school all I did drink alcohol... that's it.\n\nAfter that, during college, lots of weed, little alcohol.\n\nAfter college, got married... lots of weed, little alcohol.\n\nGot a divorce... lots of weed, lots of alcohol\n\nThen I quit giving a fuck - lots of weed, lots of vaping, little alcohol... side of mushrooms, LSD, and N20.  Still on this stage until vital organs begin to give up... 
1	Yeah
1	I had a family of Irish extroverts who let me drink at a young age under supervision so I'd know how to handle myself when I went out with my experimenting friends. But since I barely went out that was the extent of my drinking until I made a few actual friends who did that stuff in senior year.\n\nThats when I also started smoking pot but it made me socially anxious everywhere so id only do it when I was by myself or only with my best friend if I did it at all. \n\nFor me personally. Alcohol is better bc its liquid courage and makes me almost like a temporary extrovert for a lil bit till I just want to go home.
1	A little :)
1	In highschool you have obligations and family expectations towards yourself. Its when you get to college when you start to realise that non of it its gonna fill you, and that is when drugs do their job, in orther to clean your mind out of all the bullshit you were thought before. \n\nThen, adter spending 2 years stoned and drunk, you need to stop and start life from scratch
1	I grew up in a trailer park and ended up being around a lot of people my age that smoked weed so naturally I did to from 13-19 (midway through you could say I had an opioid addiction) then quit for 6 years and now I smoke casually. \n\nIf you want to know more I’d be happy to share to be honest.\nIn hindsight, I wish that I hadn’t done any of it mostly because my brain hadn’t fully developed and I’m curious if I would be a better me. 
1	I’ve snorted smarties, does that count?
9	If intps had a questlog	
4	Funny cause my quest trackers in games usually look like this, as well as my browser, at any given time. Feels good to have lists that big. Too bad none of it will ever get done. Feels bad.
3	I wish real life had achievments.  I’d do a lot more
2	My strategy in games is always to accept every available quest before really completing any of them, just in case they have overlapping requirements. I absolutely loathe when you spend hours collecting drops from a mob for a quest, only to accept a different quest that requires defeating that same mob.
2	Yes. I take everything and then forget those that didn't actually go with what i have to do. After completion, i find that i could've done this and that, and i might even resort to restarting from a saved point or if progress isn't that much... from the beginning.
1	this is why i stopped open world RPG and play story based RPG insted. i remember my skyrim run where i got quest from school of magic, thief guild, vampire shit, etc. i dont know which one should i finish because everytime i do one they open another 3 like wtf
3	Looking for a more balanced perspective on my neurotic need for approval/fear of rejection	Got it
3	There is a psychological concept called "catastrophizing". Look it up. Basically, it's not a healthy way to think of problems like this. Better take it with a little bit of apathy I think.\n\nBut as far as feeling anxious because somebody doesn't like you - I can totally relate. I don't think you can necesarily rationalize it fully though. Perhaps it's just because we usually have low intuition when it comes to other people's feelings so we are extra attentive to it in an effort to overcome that weakness (consciously or unconsciously). I also think INTP's are the easiest type to guilt-trip, you wouldn't think so, but it seems to be true.\n\nEither way, this TA probably doesn't hate you nearly as much as you think and it probably doesn't really matter even if he does. You can't go through life expecting to please EVERYONE and still be true to yourself. \n\nBeing true to yourself is more important in my opinion.
2	Yo - fuck what those TA's think... if they are annoyed with students they should have chosen a different job.  Don't be obnoxious, but ask all the questions you want... if he keeps putting off that vibe, just sincerely apologize ONE TIME before your next question.  Something like "I'm very sorry if I'm being a pain, but I'm a little slow today - what is the blah blah blah"  if he keeps acting annoyed, just chalk that up to *his* weird personality.\n\nIf you're in college - you're paying thousands per semester.  Make sure you get all the information you've paid for... don't worry about annoying your teachers or TAs... but also - don't be an asshole and ask 10 questions in a row, if you need that much help - you need it individually. 
2	seems legit.  so prove ur worth in time with the optional direct confrontation
1	Or could your reasoning be an attempt to distract from the dissonance of you not viewing yourself as a person whose ideas trigger criticism, and still seeing the opposite of this happen? Maybe this makes you afraid that your words are causing distress in others without you being aware of it, which in turn makes you feel less in control? Well that's of course bullshit. The real answer is that you don't feel secure enough about your ideas to not feel threatened by aggressive opposition.
1	Anyone following the Khashoggi case?	I know we're good at spotting logic holes, inconsistencies, etc and was wondering if anyone else has been following what's gone on with the whole Jamal Khashoggi situation..?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Jamal_Khashoggi\n\nI was drawn in from the beginning when Saudi Arabia was denying everything.....and little by little facts started leaking out that forced them to keep changing their story.  It seems clear to me they'll do whatever it takes to shield the "Crown Prince" from any responsibility...but I think they're not used to dealing with a free press who's able to choose what to publish (vs saudi-state controlled media) - so when this started getting international media attention they panicked and have been repeatedly painting themselves into corners.\n\nThey'll have to choose between admitting that the crown prince is crazy and orders people to be  murdered or that he has so little control over his closest people that they managed to do this right under his nose without his knowledge.  The Trump response is also puzzling, though I suspect if he sits back and lets Congress do the dirty work he can tell MBS his hands were tied.
2	It seems fairly cut and dry so far.  Saudis had a plan to kill him, for obvious reasons.  Instead of silencing things, it opened a whole can of worms.  Trump is “friendly” with the Saudis with business dealings, so he’ll back them up as much as possible.  Congress sucks trumps dick, so they don’t act.  National inquierer is tapped by someone (Saudi, trump, republican) to hush things with WaPo.  Dick pics ensue.  And the game goes on...  at the end of the, it’s a bunch of rich men doing what they can to further their agenda and protect what they have. Unfortunately at the expense of everything/everyone else. It makes me sad

1	This situation seems too cut and dry to make sense. There is a large part of this case that is not being made public and as such, I will refrain for forming any conclusions or judgements until everything is made public. 
1	He fine, still alive in a safe place
1	Mis type or simply a well developed Fe?	So, in most occasions I can see how I'm an INTP, however when it comes to emotions and feelings, I can't identify aswell. I'm generally pretty emotionally aware and typically understand my own emotions. I would also say this description of the ESFJ describes me well: \n\n> When the FeSi gets good vibes, feelings, or a sense of something that sparks their interest from another person or group of people, they build on that expression and mirror it back to the person or group.\n\n> Because FeSi’s are so in tune with people around them and aware of their external world, they can easily be distracted from a solo activity by the smallest interaction with others in their near vicinity. A person passing by their room in the hall, strangers sitting near them in a restaurant, a friend watching TV next to them; FeSi’s are hyper aware of these people. They naturally and unconsciously acknowledge the presence of people around them, without any effort. When an FeSi hears someone talking, their ears naturally perk up to listen. When they’re with another person, they’re constantly aware of the other person’s position, body language, tone of voice, choice of words, and facial expressions.\n\nI'm not assertive at all unless I'm very comfortable, but am annoyingly aware of other people and tend to subconciously mirror their actions, but I'm unsure if these are just typical traits for all types. \n\nIs this simply some self-doubt, and can some other INTPs vouch for this? Or maybe I lean more towards INFP? 
4	I'm very aware of others emotions and body language. I can sense even the *tiniest* shifts in emotion if I care about you enough to pay attention. I did grow up around feelers, though. It made me **have** to be aware of others emotions. I myself also *understand* and can identify the emotions I'm feeling. But I don't express them and bury them - I ignore them. But in *general* I'm not very emotional and do not really.... *think* of others emotions or how I'm effecting them. \n\n\nEdit: INFP is possible. INFP are SUPER sensitive to the emotions of others and actually care about what people are feeling. If other's emotions effect you a lot, I'd say probably INFP. 
2	You're relying on the descriptions. Don't.\n\n
1	Based on the way you structured your question/post, and how you describe yourself, socially, I'd say INFP is more likely than INTP.
1	Hang out in the INFP subreddit for a while and ask if you see yourself there. If you don't then you're not. The idea that INTPs feel fewer emotions or feel emotions less forcefully is a pubescent myth, which happens to align with the membership here. What you describe is not at all inconsistent with being INTP. It just suggests a different point in maturity. In the end, where you find your people is where you belong.
1	[https://csjoseph.life/2018/04/22/what-are-the-four-sides-of-the-mind/](https://csjoseph.life/2018/04/22/what-are-the-four-sides-of-the-mind/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a theory on the way each type can manifest other type behaviours, perhaps this might enlighten you?\n\nI am somewhat uncertain about particular aspects of the theory like the superego, but from personal experience I do believe his take on the Subconscious is true.
239	So true.	
28	One of my closest friends is an INTP but it sucks cuz it doesnt work, since we both just stay home all day. The once a month we do hang out, it is glorious tho.
15	Or in groups absolutely no larger than 3
11	My dream is to somehow retire early and move to a rural area to buy myself a giant house and set up all the utilities, then I can live like a true hermit with all the modern benefits. 
4	This is why we have the internet.
5	i support this message
3	yes... you mean reddit.
2	Is there a deadline to when we must unite? How many people will we be joining, must it be in the same neighborhood or area? Will we be using Discord? I want the details, so I can throw them all out and do my own thing. 
2	This is why the internet has changed the world so much.  Introverts get to socialize and collaborate without having to actually ever even see each other.
0	Just no.
13	Perhaps we should look at our lives as our careers, rather than our careers as our lives	I find it so easy to get caught up in my career: is it right, if not then what else should I do, etc etc etc to the point that I completely ignore every other aspect of my life.\n\nLately I've begun to look at my *life* as my life's work. Immediately, my "career" has been demoted to its rightful place as nothing *necessarily* more than the way in which I earn the most income for the least amount of time spent possible; likewise, other aspects of my life that have been lacking (basically everything else) suddenly gained much more importance.\n\nFood for thought. Hopefully this helps someone.
13	At the age of 54, I have seen the importance of my career wane and the importance of my wife and boys grow. I honestly think that there are two alternate trajectories for INTPs. From the time until we become fully self aware until our late 20's or early 30's, we think that we have everything figured out. As we grow into our 40's, we realize the our careers and our pristine thinking are not changing the world or making our lives better. As we look around, we see others who are all feely or prefer sensing to thinking, and they all seem happy. It is hard not to feel left out.  It is equally hard not to question the validity of our view of reality. I think that sometime in our 40's we tend to either double down on our beliefs or we decide to reconsider things.  I have no idea what the percentages are. I at first took the double down approach and became more and more miserable. A strange strong of coincidences changed that, and I discovered that much of my thinking was wrong. I discovered that I am just as emotional as anyone else, but I was processing emotions through thinking. It took a prolonged deliberate effort to change that. For the first time in my life, I am content, and quite often happy. For the longest time, I thought that happiness was frivolous, but it isn't. I say these things because this subreddit skews young. It is in large part an echo chamber of the angst and questions that plagued me when I was younger. I do not claim to be right or to have any wisdom to share, just my own experiences to do with what you please. Connecting with people is hard for INTPs, but it is essential to any meaningful life.  I do not regret my younger years because they benefited me in many ways. But I now see them as a stage or a phase that I went through, not as the answer to life.
2	Yeah. Pretty much everything is work.\n\nPs: Except for genetics and caste. Both can give humongous advantage/leverage from infant to death. 
1	\nBesides sleeping, is there anything else in your life that you dedicate 40 hours a week to? Unless you have kids, probably not. It's important to have a career that brings you meaning. \n\nPerhaps you agree. Why is 'necessarily' in italics?
1	Nice, I like it.
1	Yeah I know that for real. I can't see myself living for a career anyways because there's just so many things I want to try or do. Being tied down to one thing is definitely not me, it might end up being me but it won't be my life.
2	what do you think is the purpose of your life?	I am curious about your conclusions on this issue as INTPs and also about the process of logical deduction that led to it.
12	to perpetuate the chemical imbalance in my cranium that leads to independent muscle spasms that are elongated by shoving food and drink through my system. Otherwise, how would all these bacteria thrive within me?
7	Nothing. There is no purpose. The idea of a purpose is arbitrary and made up by humans. It's an illusion.\n\nI do have things I that I value and strive to accomplish, but that's a little different.
4	For me it is to learn - to gain knowledge. I want to learn about everything, to be able to explain why things are the way they are now and to discover/to find the answers for things we haven’t been able to explain yet.\nI can sit all day just listen to you talking about something I don’t know.\n\nIf money is no problem, I would just want to study my entire life. You know the satisfying feeling when things start to make sense to you.
4	To learn, attain as much knowledge humanly possible; to revolutionize, create something out of nothing, create innovations that further push humanity to greater achievements. I want to discover the undiscovered; solve the unsolvable. I want to find alternate solutions to seemingly impossible feats.
3	haven't found it yet. might never will.\nmight just say fuck-it-all and do whatever until the beat stops kickin'.
2	Breed.\n\nIDK if thats achievable.\n\nThe logical deduction came when I learnt about the evolution theory.
2	Achieve the most dopamine rushes by accomplishing a good amount of health wealth love and happiness,,, or just have that chemical inject in me until I explode 
1	To live.
1	Read love travel\n...if possible educate people
1	helping other people live their lives better/more efficiently.\n\nand in process gaining insights about myself.
1	Who cares about my life? The purpose of life is to spread your genes
1	A self-imposed purpose to help out the community once I have the education and economic power to do so. Maybe start a business & donate to charity. Maybe start a charity of my own. But I can't do squat until I succeed in the area of money and education, which is basically the only reason I care about school.
1	It is clear that we're evolved beings who've grasped that we are the result of countless species who preceded the evolution of hominids and that we're cousins to every other life form on this planet, that we are made entirely of elements fused in stars and supernova, and that we are in the unique position among our octillion cousins to be aware of our collective circumstance.  Our purposes are self generated and clearly not imposed by any grander purpose or design.  Carl Sagan said "if we seek a cosmic purpose, let us find a worthy goal."  I agree.  The purpose of my life is to alleviate suffering and improve the well-being of sentient beings and attempt to influence the future to better accommodate and achieve those ends.  
1	I study physics and a lot of stuff(I'm pretty smart), but at the end of the day, why? What motivates me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think my purpose in life. Is to go outside once every month and flex knowledge on the social nerds. Study for another month and then do it again. Its a very important role in life.
1	To continue to live and make more life.\n\nThat's all it is\n
1	Purpose is an abstract/construct we ascribe meaning to; a better word for what you're attempting to ask is "nature," and in that sense, it depends on when aspect you are referencing. \nAs an individual organism, life is perpetuated by the spread of genetic material.\nAs a species, it is perpetuated by the expansion of the community (unless said organisms are solitary).\nAs a ecosystem, it is perpetuated by survival of the fittest.\nAs an abstract, it is simply to continue through the dimension we inhabit as long as possible, where it is possible.\n\nOn a philosophical level, however, it is whatever your inherent philosophy dictates - whether it be predicated on Christianity, Buddhism, or nihilism. That aspect is up to you, really.\n\nNow, depending on your definition of life, this question can take a completely different route. One could argue that stars and planets, or even the universe itself, is alive, just not in a traditional aspect of the notation of the word "life".
1	To survive until i die
1	Procrastination. Think about it and you will probably figure out what I mean. Also, I don't mean in the sense of something like a project. Think bigger. 
1	There is no purpose to life. It can be whatever you want it to be, whether it be being the richest person on Earth or just being happy.
1	Live laugh and love and let live
4	thoughts on weed and how it effects you? i’m not a fed i swear	for those who’ve used it, what are your thoughts? \n\nat a glance i feel it makes me more motivated. yes there are different highs and strains, but in general i typically feel more motivated to bring ideas into reality.\n\ni will say coming down can be a complete bitch and a half. Too many times have i had a high wear off and a wave of tiredness hits. i think that may just be a side effect but it could be other unlikely scenarios depending on how you view it. When a high wears off all i want to do is sleep. it may be from weed, however this may be due to me not sleeping much at night too. Usually I can stay disciplined enough to finish important tasks for the day before hitting a cat nap at 4-8pm on days i don’t work.\n\n\nother thought provoking (for me atleast lol) points\n\n\nis it relaxing/calming?\n\n\nwhat’s your mind state like on it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat thoughts do you have about your experience with weed? 
5	I love weed, not for productive reasons, but for watching a movie, gaming or sleeping. to combat the tiredness I only smoke a few hours before I intend to go to sleep, otherwise I will feel uncomfortable for the rest of the day and a bit out of it.
4	Sounds like something a fed would say
3	Socially anxious and hungry.\n\nZoned out / less motivated. \nCan be fun withfriends , but overall not something I think is good to indulge in 
3	I love it way more than drinking.  Since I started smoking my drinking has gone to basically 0. Plus I know it's not really good for you to smoke anything but my body feels much better after I stopped  drinking, lost some weight and I don't feel as heavy if that makes since.  \n\n\n\nI always smoke a little before going on a first date or meeting up with someone I've never met before only because I feel like it opens me up a bit more to be who I really am not the usual quiet reserved me you met at first.\n\n\n\n But you're correct the different strains will hit you much differently and cause different highs and whether you get tired and what most people call being glued to the couch and others can give you the energy to get up and do things.  It's also  not for everyone for some people it can cause sever anxiety.  
3	Id rather be alone when I'm high, I always get really nervous if I'm around people. It could be with my friends or with people I just met but I'm always really anxious and lose my voice kinda. Like I'll just stop talking. \n\nBut if I'm by myself I feel so comfortable and I can think about crazy ideas or play video games and watch movies. Almost like it brings out my full on introvert mode.
3	 It forces my brain to live in the moment.\n\n I'm normally daydreaming, thinking about stuff (past events and future possibilities). And im not really "present" until something demands full attention, then I zone out again. \n\n Weed snaps me out of that. I become aware of everything around me. I can hear every noise, feel my body, breathing and heartbeat. I notice more and realise things my normal mind state would not have picked up. \n\n Its like a paranoid state but enjoyable and without the fear. Of course, you are risking crossing over into actual paranoia if you are not mindful.\n 
2	If you have to let us know you’re not planning on arresting us, then you’re probably too innocent for weed.  Not a bad thing!\n\nEver heard of kombucha?  It’s a fermented tea drink that is totally legal, but can give some a slight, brief, euphoria.  For best results, buy it already prepared, from refrigerated case.  consume on empty stomach, about 8oz at a time.
2	I use it at night a couple hours before going to bed. It helps me relax and let go of the stress of the day, and think about the problems I'm working on in a more creative and optimistic mindset. Often I come up with some pretty good ideas that end up being useful. I also ponder some really random stuff too, of course, which can be fun. And it helps me fall asleep.
2	I don’t like the taste.\n\nI’m already lazy, I don’t need weed to procrastinate. 
1	Never done it because I never felt like I needed it.\n\nEveryone was always "haha bro you'd be great to smoke with" so it gave me the impression that it's a crutch for people who can't think deeply.
-2	Weed is for people who are too young to drink. It makes you act like a child. Beer makes you act like a man.

9	What Each Myers-Briggs Type Does When They Have A Crush	
7	I feel attacked
3	TLDR;\n\nTo all my intp brothas. Stop crushin and start flirtin. Don’t think about it and just do it. Happy valentines day!
2	Seems accurate (intj)
2	Scarily accurate
2	Sorta accurate. When I find a subject I like I study that subject, lets just say when it comes to crushes. I study A LOT. She has no idea I exist, I've only talked with her 2 times(both were extremely awkward).\n\nList of things I know about her:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAddress,\n\nSchool,\n\nPrevious places she lived.\n\nParents Names and Jobs,\n\nFrequently visited places,\n\nThings she likes,\n\nand plenty more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sad thing, I also know what boy she likes, and previous boys she's liked. She seems to like the extroverted sporty types. But I spend my time plotting the perfect time and place to talk to her.
9	Crying in front of people	So today I had to give a speech about someone who meant something in my life and towards the end I started crying in front of 30+ people. It was really awkward (for me at least) and I was kind of mad at myself for being irrational yet at the same time it was oddly satisfying. It’s so rare for me to cry, especially in front of people but I guess I should get used to it. Anyways, how do you guys feel about crying in front of people?
12	Ever since I started shaving with a Gellete^TM razor, I've noticed that I no longer cry on public and am, overall, less of a pussy.
2	The only times i cry in front of other people are: when i'm with people i am very close with or when i am drunk and a sudden repressed emotion surfaces.
1	Crying in front of people is not a problem.  It just shows that you care about something or someone.  I’ve done it several times in my life.  Don’t be ashamed, don’t be afraid, don’t hide your emotions.  Do as you feel, being true to yourself.
1	Thanks to being forced to take estrogen I do it all the time, but I don't actually feel anything.
1	When I was younger I had a hard to talking to authority figures and coming to them with problems. I really hated disappointing people and telling adults to their face really did not help
1	I've only had 2 moments where I cried in public. The first was in elementary school and I didn't want anyone to see me so I tried to hold back my tears. I did not enjoy it at all and didn't want others to know I was sad.\n\nThe second time was with my family after experiencing my first loss of a loved one. I didn't think about crying at all, we even went to McDonalds for some reason and I just kept crying. I didn't care and I still don't care that others saw me cry.
1	Better than crying alone. Most of the time when I have cried in front of people, they either cried too or comforted me.  Either way, there is nothing wrong with expressing strong emotions by crying.
1	Ain't nothing wrong with it. We have emotions and we can't control them, sometimes we can't even control the reaction to them. Embrace it -- you are human after all. 
0	Weak
3	Do you think that	You might be here to do something noble... but it probably is something like stopping someone from being hit by a car that's the great grandfather of the guy that's going to make a difference?
3	Nah... I am here to tinker around with my stuff for the short time I have.
1	Who’s defining “noble”?
1	No, I don't think in those terms.  I fully realize that there are downstream consequences to what I do today, but one ties oneself in knots with superficial moral conundrums like would you save Hitler's grandfather if you had the chance in the early 1,800's?  Such questions are ridiculous to me.  Saving an individual is worthwhile and 'noble' in and of itself, regardless the unseen downstream consequence.  
0	I am the car.
633	Trying to socialize at an event like:

7	Hey John, What’s Your Name Again?
8	Haha so true. \n\nThe one that pisses me off the most:\n\nMan: Hey Arcturix, how are you?\n\nMe: Great thanks Man, yourself? (Me trying)\n\nMan: Yeah, good thanks, you?\n\nYou've just asked me how I am TWICE. You're obviously not interested, don't expect a conversation from me again. \n\nHaha... Life. 
5	I recently "dated" s.o. and spilled my autism all over the place, trying to make everything subliminal between us conscious. It was hilarious and desasterous\n\nFuck I just want to feel human connection 
4	I generally tell a shit load of jokes. Either they're well received or not. Really depends on the person. There's a slight difference in the types of weird things I come up with in a conversation with different types of people. Generally people who just get confused or react negatively are people I don't wanna deal with. If there's loud music I'm more likely to be quieter.
3	The trick is to let them do the talking, and just listen.

8	What is something you are working to improve about yourself?	I'm 22M and the past few years have been years of growth and a lot of figuring myself out. I'm wondering where you are all at age-wise and what you are currently working towards in terms of personal growth! \n\nI'm currently learning how to develop habits and stick to them. It's something I've struggled with for years but I see progress!
5	54. I am still working on connecting with people. I have come so far from what I was, and yet have so far to go.
5	Paying attention when I'm outside, and trying to read body language
5	21 years old, and the past few years ive been trying to improve myself in terms of procrastinating and rediscovery.  im trying to read everyday and practice the eletric guitar. trying to start a punk band is my main objective now
3	21yo here. Gonna graduate college in a few months and am working to improve my resume to get into good companies. Other than that I'm trying to be more social and friendly coz I've seen that most people can't get through my thick awkward phase. I also wanna go to the gym but like the bed is just too comfy. I'm working on the last one :p
3	23 years old male here. I graduated college in june of last year with an English degree and no passion and work experience. However, because I have a supportive family and no loans, I'm still doing fairly well financially despite working for a mindless minimum wage job right now. Although I am not doing well professionally, I have grown a lot as a person. After cycles of shame and self doubts about my place in life, I have realized no one important in my life is actually judging me, and just because I'm not where I want to be right now doesn't mean I'm already a failure. I have just realized a lot of my issues come from internalized external pressures that may or may not be there. I'm currently learning how to be truely comfortable under my own skin, and I'm learning to give myself more time and self assurance. I'm becoming more self validating because I have accepted the fact that everyone has their own path and must do what is right according to their own background and conditions in life; I'm learning not to be ashamed of my job because I am an adult, and I'm becoming way more independent because I'm currently covering my own expenses. I'm trying to become less self deprecating and self critical, because the nature of my job doesn't define me, and because I am still very young, the job doesn't confine me either. I will no longer compare myself to others, because doing that will get me nowhere; for now I will focus on doing my job right and be kinder to myself, and with all the experiences I'm accumulating, I will move on to something better when opportunity arises. 
3	I’m giving myself a new rule. I’ve got a lifelong goal of getting my artwork to as many people as possible and if I have an idea on how to get closer to that goal in any way I don’t think about it for 2 months but I do it immediately. I’ll have all the time in the world to think about it while I’m doing it. For example yesterday I thought about buying a drawing tablet but I didn’t have 800 bucks laying around so I thought about flipping items on eBay and selling a few of my possessions that I don’t need. I posted my first sale within the hour of having that thought and I’m currently skimming through eBay to find good items to buy and resell. I recommend ALL of us try this. Make yourself a goal and execute on ANY idea you may have for reaching said goal the minute you have it. If you’re smart about and patient it you’ll reach the goal and learn a few things along the way.
2	Cleaning every day. I got into the habit of cleaning a little bit every day, and life feels so much less cluttered.

8	Hi, wanted to share something	I'm posting this here because it looks like it is the subreddit that I can relate the most... I'm a teenager and I part-time work in some software-related firm, it does not matter that much. Some weeks ago I had a flirt for like 1 month and I broke up with her, because she was too logical. She said it is okay and let's be cool. Today I visited my office after school. My 'boss' was driving me somewhere close to my home, and he knew about my almost girlfriend. I was going to a conference tomorrow and not to school, so he said 'why don't you ask her to come with you?' and handed me some nice amount of money then said, 'and here is your meal after the conference.' I was very happy for his kind of thought but I was not sure about the girl... I still asked her though. She said no, but it is okay, I had the confidence to do so!
6	That's great that you put yourself out there like that. You'll find that as you continue to do what seems hard or impossible because of your "wiring", the next time you have to do so it gets just a bit easier.
3	I'm just repeating what the other guy said. It's great that you went and asked if that's something you're kinda shy to do. I'd say to a step further maybe. If you did not want to ask them out tell your boss so.
3	That's fucking dope rock on
2	What a thoughtful act by your boss.  And a huge congrats to you for asking her. For some reason, we INTPs are terrified of trying to start intimate relationships.  You tried, were rejected, and yet you lived.  Remember that when the next fish comes along.
1	Should have just asked 5 more dollars and pocketed it.

13	New Character	I've found the problem with my life and dont know what to do with it.\n\nI compare it to playing RPGs such as Skyrim.\nWhen I started my first character i did everything and dabbled a bit in all the possible ways of playing. Spreading my points in all the skill trees. Later in the games I run into trouble because I didn't build my character to master any type of play style. So I would start a new character to make a specific playstyle. \n\nI would end up making like 14 new characters till I found the one that suited me.\n\nNow I look at my life right now. I've been doing everything trying to get a foot into every career like trades, military, medical, art, writing, becoming a professor, politics, I even wanted to run a ranch at some point and started learning how. I came to realize that I'm ok at most things but not great at anything. \n\nI often think about how I wish I could start over and focus my skills more from the beginning because now I dont have the opportunities I could've taken and cant figure out what to do from here. Just like my first play through character, I screwed myself over in the long run by trying to do everything. \n\nIt's not too late to direct myself but now I dont know where to go because it could take me 14 trys till I find what suits me and I'm not sure what to pick
6	variety is an advantage. either way I can’t see myself sitting at the same desk for the next 40 years. having our minds mostly do me wonders because of how interesting life is to us, but I’m also having major concerns of not acquiring an expertise. I just hope we really do have our moment and everything will fall into place. 
2	Well it's a matter of which one you enjoyed the best or could see yourself not getting bored of. Rank your skills in order of how much you like them and see which comes out on top of you're not sure.
2	Unlike a skyrim char, us intps benefit from vast experiences that may not be connected until we connect them. Our knowledge refuses to be imprisoned if something you've learned in the past helps you or others, then that bit of "multiclassing" serves you well.
2	what suited you in skyrim? figure out why it suited you and generalize it so that it's useful information for making a decision in your life
2	I would say that life is not a role playing game. It has no rules, and you can never win. \n\nFirst, ask yourself why you have explored everything?  Is it your nature.  It is mine for sure.  I know a decent amount about a lot of things.  I will never be a specialist in anything, but being a specialist would be worse than death. In life, unlike role playing games, there are places for jacks of all trades.  Personally, I am more interested in the connections between things than the things themselves. I am glad that I took the path that I did.  I am not saying it is right for you, but I am saying that it might be, and if it is, you can have a hell of a lot more fun being who you are than trying to be someone else.
2	Well, just try to remember, whatever career you pick, that doesn't mean you can't still pursue your other interests as hobbies. You can still be an amateur artist on the side, etc. Decide which interests make the most sense to pursue as a paid career and which make the most sense as hobbies. \n\nI know what you mean though. I tend towards autodidacticism and am drawn to different fields...but we don't really live in an era where polymathy is common or normal, but one where people are highly specialized even within in their respective fields.

1	"In life, one must choose between boredom and suffering." "Go to your room Meadow!"	AJ Soprano is playing with existentialism. This scene in E207 is hysterical.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjVrYjJTihU\n\n*\n\nI've always had goals.  Many are now unattainable and I barely have the strength to fully acknowledge this reality.  I immerse myself in anything else to avoid thinking about it.\n\nRecently, I was encouraging someone else to "have goals".  It may have been for selfish reasons and I may have failed to realize that he feels similarly to me about "life goals".\n\nHope I get the chance to tell him one day. \n
1	Imo boredom IS the suffering.
10	Th straight "A" student.	I'm curious how many of you are "A" students.
21	Im old now (36) but i finished with an honor role in high school (85%) half assing it all the way. School is easy because its all about just following orders. After school when no one tells you what to do is the real fun.
6	I was a straight A student. That sense of validation used to be very important to me. Coming out of the end of a semester knowing you did perfect was a great feeling. 
3	I've maintained a 4.0 for the past 1.5-2 years I think. I don't pay attention in class, but I still force myself to go to class to at least see if I can subconsciously learn anything while I'm on my phone or daydreaming because basically, the day before my tests, I teach myself everything that everyone else in my classes learned over 3ish weeks. And because I taught myself everything the night before, it's still vivid enough in my brain that I'm able to visualize the page of my notes, and I just read info from the vision. Obviously, I'm really bad at retaining information in the long-term and am probably going to have issues later on for like board tests or whatever, but I mean, this is how I've gotten by my whole life. Oh, and I am a dietetics major, so I'm kind of undershooting in terms of my potential and punching below my weight class; I'm certain if I wanted to be a doctor or lawyer, I would never be able to pull straight A's or possibly even pass like this.\n\nAnd oh, classes that DO assign HW, though rare, I just pay for a Chegg account and copy the answers from there. \n\nBTW, this works a lot better for STEM classes because I am able to regurgitate and understand  everything the next day by finding patterns. For instance, my O-Chem professor said that there are no patterns for the catalysts/conditions of certain reactions, but I beg to differ. For instance, the very first two reactions we ever learned was the hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes. I just need to remember that the reaction needs Ni to proceed. How do I remember this? NiH. I say it like "Nih!" (Think "nah") and I pronounce it in this really weird noise. \n\nBiology classes are a little harder for me to do with with, but I still do.\n\nClasses where we were allowed to use calculators were a walk in the park because I'd just write all my notes/cheat on mine.\n\nIt's humanities courses that this doesn't really work for me, but I finished all of them already with straight A's because I took them online and Googled all the answers during tests lol.
3	Nah, I’m really smart (one of the smartest in school) but I also have ADHD and I just don’t care enough
3	I was an A Student in high school but my grades really fluctuate during college since it’s less important.\n\nI know a lot of INTP’s are math and science oriented but I also did well in history and psychology classes. I didn’t have the best studying techniques but information would just stick with me. My friends would make me feel guilty for getting A’s on tests I only studied an hour for while they got c’s and d’s after pulling all nighters, but it was purely because what we learned what actually interesting and just happened to stick around. \n\n
3	Im a straight D- student. As long as i pass the class i couldn't give more fucks.
4	I'm a straight A student but at times it's annoying because if it there's anything that I'm not prepared for or something I don't really bother about and hence not do my best, people still expect the A, making me feel guilty if that makes sense?
2	I was a B+ student and I didn't even try. I remember half-listening to my physics class while calculating the statistical probabilities of dice rolls.\n\nBasically I listened the first time and did other things when it was being repeated. "Yeah, yeah, I understood the concept the first time. Move on"\n\nHomework was another thing that bugged me and I passed on it often. I found it incredibly boring. I already knew how to do it, so why am I having to repeat it 50 times?
2	Bare minimum all my life.
2	Not at all.  I picked an interest in doing well briefly though. Got a 3.8 as I worked three part-time jobs and started a non-profit.  Once I proved to myself I could do it, I stopped trying.
1	No, because school was boring as fuck. My test averages were probably very close to 90% though. Might have been higher if I cared enough to study, but my time was spent either trying to crunch essays (most people spent a fair amount of time on the essays. The vast majority of my time doing homework was on these essays, because of overthinking them) or doing stuff I enjoyed rather than menial homework.
1	i was a straight a student, duke tip kid and recieved a full scholarship. that i would say is the one trait i dont share of a supposed intp. i worked hard in school up until the last few years of it, and even then it meant a great deal to me to stay with 90 and above in my classes. but i would not say school was hard and i never studied.
1	All A's in high school except English 10
1	I'm still in high school and am strait A in regular high school classes.\n\nThe same cannot be said of my collage classes.
1	I was never an A student. \nIn school I was good, but not the best with 0 effort. \nIn my CS major its harded, I need a tiny bit of studying to pass all classes. I am in my last semester and it worked so far ;) ~2.7 average or something
1	I was an A student up to the start of high school. Now I'm soon leaving high school but I no longer score A's unless I'm interested in the subject. You can say i mostly get B's and C's but given the fact that I don't try enough, it's quite good. But I still mentally carry that identity of being an A student and get slightly disappointed with my lower grades. 
1	I absolutely hated school in high school and would refuse to do anything until exams. Junior year, I was hardly ever even there until they started threatening my mother so I just flat out told them how I felt. They allowed me to basically test out of most credits I needed to graduate, then ended up doing so a few months later. 
1	In school I never did homework, so I want a straight A kid. More in the b & c range. However, I graded with honors and a 4.0... I'm still trying to figure it out myself...
1	It's been interesting reading your responses. I'm out of school now but was an A student except for one B in my senior English class and a couple Bs in college. I would do what was needed to at least get an A-. 
1	I was an honor roll student until 7th grade, at which point the new social rules and puberty turned the world upside down for me. By 11th grade, I had straight F's all except for one class (music). Vice Principal pulled me into his office the end of that year and told me they were sending me to another campus for students who needed extra help. This campus was notorious for being filled with pregnant teenagers and petty criminals, so I said "fuck that" and immediately enrolled in a home school program to finish off my final year.\n\nSo yeah, my education story isn't ideal.
1	I get As, but I work for them. I can not stand feeling behind or not quite right on a subject. I could sit and study for hours.
1	I was making 3% in English if that counts. I’m not trying to brag, but I know that’s pretty good for an INTP.
1	I'm a straight A student, pretty much all my life I'm about to start my bachelor's in biochemistry so I don't think I'll be able to keep a 4.0 for very long. Shits about to fly out the fucking window I'm sure. Lol. But I do try , if you count intense cramming and memorizing information trying, it's not learning. But it does the job fo sho
1	Extremely high average in highschool and now have an extremely high average in a tough university program, so me 
1	I graduated college Magna Cum Lade with a 3.94 GPA. One B in Biochemistry #feelsbadman
1	Overall, I've got 9.75/10 on average last semester, so quite an "A".
1	My last score I got was on general science. I got a 48%, I know everything in that class and did most of the homework, I just never turned it in. I suppose I could try to go to a college if I did turn HW in, I just don't give a flying fortress.
68	I think "having a crush on someone"is more about ourselves than about the other person.	This is likely utter bullshit, but it is still a thought I would like to share. \n\nA "crush" is different from "love" and "lust" because it doesn't require mutual communications and efforts like love does, and it doesn't necessarily require a sexual interest towards a person like "lust" does. A crush is one sided, often intense, yet not intimate. When we have a crush on someone, we tend to idealize that person while being blind to their flaws. Unless you are an absolute narcissist, the person you end up crushing on probably exhibits traits you lack, but value. For example, an introvert might be attracted to an extrovert because the latter exhibits traits the former wishes to develope; as a result the former might have an extremely skewed perception of the latter because he is subconsciously comparing his weak spots to the strong spots of his person of interest. Opposites do not necessarily attract because we all like people who represent our values and interests, but in the same time we are unable to exhibit all of what we personally value ourselves; therefore we seek such values and traits within others, and as a result of that, we might find ourselves having crush on people who are conventionally "incompatible" with us due to differences in interests, lifestyles, and personalities etc. In other words, when we are crushing on someone, we do not necessarily like that person as a whole; instead, we are attracted to particular traits that person exhabits.\nGoing back to the example about the introvert and the extrovert, although the two of them might have very little in common as far as lifestyle and interests goes, the introvert might still have a crush on the extrovert because of his own deficit in traits such as empathy, charisma, and leadership, while the introvert do not necessarily exhabits the traits mentioned above, he could very well value them, and as a result of that, he ends up crushing on the extrovert.
23	“the person you end up crushing on probably exhibits traits you lack, but value.”\n\nBoobs lol.  But nah most of the people I may admire I don’t really crush on.  My crushes tend to be based on looks and demeanor.  Maybe it’s different for other people
8	Damn, not utter bullshit, I think you're 100% right and it's a good thing to know
6	i think you're on to something 👍
6	I totally agree about crushes being more about what you value but may not necessarily have. I think there's a certain degree of admiration in it too.\n\nThe deepest crush I've had (almost to the point of unrequited "love") was on someone who always managed to appear calm and unaffected in any situation, a skill/personality I've always wished I had. \n\nCome to think of it I've never had a crush on someone who was as quiet as me.  In that sense opposites do attract, because you want a personality you lack but respect. It's when your VALUES differ that makes the feelings fade :) \n
3	Nah, I tend to have crushes on other INTPs most. Sorry, I know it's incestuous sounding and probably makes everyone else here uncomfortable, but I mean there are lots of you, so it's not like I'm personally crushing on you. Maybe I should though. You're all probably sexy AF. No, but seriously, I think you've identified one type of crush, but not what would be an essential feature to any crush. 
2	But I haven't really noticed any girls who are similar to me so that automatically means that anyone I crush on seems to have different traits to me. If I meet an attractive xNTP girl then things might be different.
2	I don't think opposites actually attract. I think in most cases where that is the perception--like say a big burly biker and a rather meek accountant, or whatever- there is one glaring misalignment in the relationship, but they actually do align in many, many more ways that are actually substantial. 
1	Yup, :EZ: 
1	Not 100% accurate 
1	Good looking folks appear(impression) more intelligence and smart.\n\n#fact
1	I think that's how it works for Humans 
1	I don't think I develop these any more. At least without attempting to know the person on at least a personal and often intimate level. I so rarely find people who are quite similar to me that I go after it full force. I like people who share my strengths as well as my deficits. I'm relatively extraverted. So the same is true of them. The deficits I have is that i display a lack of tact by choice and often play the role of an instigator. Even though I can be quite tactful when I need/want to be. In seeking these people out, when I find them, I have been through the ringer of several types of mental illness, drug addicts, the violently unstable, and all sorts of dilettantes not fit to handle both personal freedom and the responsibility it requires. They also tend to be slightly to supremely less stable than me in lifestyle because I can't stand to be the crazy one.
1	Personally, I feel that having an extrovert partner completes me, which is in line with your analysis.\n\nBut, once I start getting close to such people I instinctively get rid of them because I can't stand the lack of \*NTPesque traits in them.\n\nIt's because of this dilemma, that I avoid getting into relationships.
1	your crush usually represents your animus or anima 
5	I just wrote a song for the first time! Tell me what you think :_)	[https://vocaroo.com/i/s1g9UdI4VqoF](https://vocaroo.com/i/s1g9UdI4VqoF)
7	Good for you buddy
1	Maybe cut out the tuning the the beginning next time you post a song lol
1	I dig it. Reminds me of some of Car Seat Headrest’s stuff and a bit of Daniel Johnston. I’m partial to experimental lo-fi projects, so naturally I’m going to appreciate the roughness of the recording more than others—but I found this genuinely intriguing and I’d be interested in hearing more. I think you have real potential and I hope you continue to pursue your music.
-1	Ouh ! Can I be your first negative comment ?\n\nIt sucks, dude. Kys.\n
6	Reddit insisting r/crossdressing is similar to r/INTP has me wondering if they know something that I don’t.	“That girl is cute, but she’s a dude so... ...Could I be pretty? What’s it like to be pretty? Could be interesting... maybe.”
12	INTPs are free thinkers. AKA: The world and the people that run it despise us. They don't want us thinking (impossible). They want us destroyed and removed from society. How do you remove someone or a group of people from society? You limit their influence. How can we influence others? By starting a family and raising free thinking children. They don't want us procreating and passing our free thoughts to another generation.

0	Ti question, and what is the difference between Ne and Se?	I think I have a pretty good grasp on a general level of what defines a Ti dominant and what brings them energy, but my understanding of the microprocess of Ti is lacking. I think of my own Ti-Ne in terms of how I approach politics. Each thing is either true or false. If A leads to B and B leads to C and C leads to D, then A leads to D. Then you can define how the input values of A affect the output of D, minimizing the system. In essence, while I understood the mechanisms of A,B,C, and D in order to reach A->D, the primarily important thing becomes how A interacts with D. Ti then manipulates the system and changes it at leverage points so that the system performs the goal that the Ti dom wants it to.\n\nThis is often a very detached, abstract, and solitary activity though and while it can be interesting...it isn't what I LIVE for. Political and emotional analysis can be quite tedious when you have to think of Ne perceptions over and over and over TO BE SURE.\n\nMy questions are: what does Ti look like in the moment when you aren't sitting there in bed thinking. Ti can be used experientially in the moment, such as in a game of call of duty. It is instantaneous and constant evaluations.\n\nBeyond this, we know Ne and Se are stuck within the context that Ti gives it. Ti presents a framework for the problem, a possibility space, and then Ne and Se perceive within the possibility space it has been given. What would this look like though? What is the concept of Ne and Se and what are the forms they take?\n\nGoing back to call of duty(assume capture the flag) is it this: Ti observes it needs to take flag A. Se is observing the current moment, how to position the self relative to the colors and shape of objects to maximize the time they will have before an opponent sees them and the cover they will have, while an INTP using Ne will be paying attention to things like spawn control? Perhaps how a killstreak is influencing the shape of the map and how you can leverage that?\n\nI always have trouble defining what Ne and Se are perceiving and how it fits into the context of Ti. Especially Se.\n\nIf both of them were fixing a car(a Ti system just like every object, but a little more apparent and workable than, say...a block of wood) how might Ne perceive the problem and work through it, and how might the ISTP?\n\nWhy do ISTP and ESTJ gravitate to sports while INTP and ENTJ gravitate to video games? This would imply more intuitive material is available.\n\nWhat would intuitive competitive sports be? Chess? Why? Because knowing how the pieces physically look had almost nothing to do with the game, while the possibility space of each piece is important\n\nWrapping my head around Ti-Se is tough despite knowing what its expression looks like. Ti is simply a subjective mathematical representative equation of an object, so does this mean that Se observations like color intensity are devalued in favor of the physical form of "what is" while for an INTP it is the physical form of "what could be"? Just complete confusion what a representative example of Se and ne would be, despite understanding them as concepts.\n\nEdit: Examples help me A LOT. A lot of definitions say "possibilities" or "sensory stimuli" but don't present an example of what a sensory stimuli is so I don't know what region of my definition of sensory stimuli they are referencing. I.e. they don't account that my definition may be different than theirs.\n\nMy current understanding of the Se and Ne is data gathering while Si and Ni are data sorting. In other words: imagine you listen to a song. Se would say "I want to listen to this song multiple times are different volumes", Ne will say "I want to perceive this song according to different mental pictures/contexts", Si will perceive "the right volume and place for this song", and Ni will perceive the correct meaning and context of the song in terms of possibilities" Se and Ne arive at similar places as do Si and Ni.
2	I like sports and video games
1	One is abstract and concerned about ideas, while the other is about sensory stuff.\n***\nSe and Ne do similar things, as extraverted perceiving function : gathering info in the outside worlds.\n\n* Ne is concerned with PoV/ideas. Thus, it covers a good chunk of "the possible". Unlike Ni, it doesn't stick to one idea, but takes on multiple. Sinceit cares about PoV, it's more interested in people's opinions/minds and how they work.\n* Se is concerned with the physical, concrete. The sensory through the five senses. It doesn't just use to get by, being in the "here and now" is important to them. Se doesn't care about ideas, but what is. \n\nBest way is to look at it as SeNi vs NeSi.
1	I’m an ISTP, I always preferred Domination when I played COD a decade ago. \n\nJust in general I prefer single player open world/adventure games. \n\nSports, I like (real) football, American football, squash, badminton, tennis. Skating, hiking, yoga. 
5	Any INTPs working in the game development industry, what do you do? Any advice for people contemplating going into it?	
5	Game dev here, not for me.\nEveryone always sayin "INTP's should be programmers" no.\nYou should be you regardless of type.\nAs for advice, work hard, make solo projects and try not to procrastinate too much (ha) because it's harder everyday
3	Being at the bottom of the pyramid always sucks.\n\nBetter to start your own pyramid if you have to be in an industry like that.
1	I worked in that industry, though I was on the marketing side, not the development side per se. The people on staff with developer skill sets could seemingly write their own tickets. We cast a global net in order to get people. It strikes me that being a programmer would be a lot better than being a QA tester. But being a concept artist would be better than either (albeit much less lucrative). 
1	i was qa analyst. moved to non gaming to become business analyst
1	I'm a game developer, more precisely a game programmer. I'm still a student, but I have a good amount of programming experience and I'm currently working on a (personal) project that hopefully will be released Q4 2019.\n\nYour question is a little vague, because the game development industry is *huge*. Are you aiming to be an artist? A programmer? A writer/game economist?\n\nFor a general question, I can give you a general answer:\nSpecialize in one single thing, and do it well. The most important thing to do to get hired is to make a great portfolio when you're confident enough about your skillset -- I've spoken to the owners of a few small indie companies, and they all say that they care about the work you know how to do more than the diploma/degree you've gotten (although it's always a plus). No one is gonna teach you how to code a game because you have a degree in computer science.\n\nBeing a game dev has always been my ambition, I haven't completely gotten integrated into the industry but I think that I have enough knowledge to back up everything I've said. \n\nThere's also some academic courses dedicated to game development that you can enroll in (Udemy is more of a self-learner thing since it's online and through videos, but there's also actual academic structures that you might find, but the cost is usually high)
1	I don't work in the video game industry.  I am in the advertising industry and I find myself regretting it to be honest.  Video games are all I actually care about.  I'm wondering how I can get into it now, or it's too late.  
212	So, the other day...	
55	You forgot "Realize you didn't include a pivotal detail or fully flesh out the point you were trying to make originally, but now the topic of conversation has changed and you don't want to be a burden by trying to shoehorn it back in."
14	Context is so important to a lot of my stories
9	You forgot the part where ten minutes later you realize you never finished the story, and nobody even mentioned it.
9	Nah, I go straight to the point.
5	Ohh no is this how i appear tp my husband?? No wonder he gets cranky when i tell a story hahaha!
3	>Apologize\n\nAccurate
3	I would like to hear a story told this way
3	How I explain a conclusion: give a synopsis first, but one that doesn't make sense without context. Give some context, realize it isn't enough. Give more context, then realize you missed important details in the former context, so do that too. Then, realize you forgot to give a basis for the logic, so you give that, and then think that you made the synopsis too vague so give one that's more specific. Finally, feel like an idiot and a genius simultaneously, for not being able to explain your thinking in a clear manner but also for actually being able to arrive at that conclusion that nobody else has had yet.
1	I didn't know this was a intp thing
1	Depends on who I’m telling, and what kinds of story it is. But I never apologize 
1	Lay in bed not sleeping and hash out how you should have told it.
1	i almost piss myself from how accurate this is
1	'Sorry about that, you probably don't care at all.'
1	Huh. No wonder neurotypical people don't get me.
10	When you see INTP/INTP	Arguments online and scratch your head saying, "But.. *Why?*" without reading any of it and keep scrolling onto new context. 
4	Haha. 
3	Did you guys find yourselves skipping half of your first two year college courses? Did you do well or did it seriously affect your future?	
3	I’ll skip some classes if they post all the material online and lectures are essentially being read off of the course website. I actually had one quarter where I took two online courses that met only for administering tests. I only left my dorm twice a week during that time for one in person class. \nI did ok in classes where it was essentially self studying, I think I got onto the honor roll during the quarter where I never went outside. 
3	I didn't skip a class until my second semester, and even then I try to limit myself to less than three skips per class. 
2	I went to so few of my second year Ba Hons lectures and seminars that when I turned up to sit the exams, my name wasn't down; they somehow thought I'd dropped out? I had to take the summer re-sits.\n\n 
1	Currently, the only reason for me to go to class is the the fact that some teachers don’t post homework assignments or quiz dates on whatever platform the school uses for its students. I’m wondering if that trend will stay the same for the rest of my major (some type of engineering, keep switching) for the most part. 
1	I decided to read Law as all my teachers at school said it was something I'd be good at (misconstrued morons). After my first two months I realised I didn't like it - more that I don't appreciate formal education and can't stand rules.\n\nAfter then my attendance started a steady decline to about 50%. I passed first year.\n\nSecond year it dropped further to about 25%. I passed.\n\nThird year, I attended about 1 lecture a week, if that. I failed.\n\nAnd I honestly couldn't care less. Sure it would be nice to have the piece of paper that I'm now indebted 60k for, but that's nay bother.\n\nIronically I've still wound up in that field. It's always about who you know rather than what. So I ended up with a graduate role, and with a graduate salary regardless.
1	Damn... I’ve always been told the same about law, even from a young age. I always thought of it as being super boring looking though. I’m sure it’s lucrative, but I’m sorry you don’t seem to enthusiastic about it :(
1	If you pay for college classes and then skip them, you are an idiot.\n\n
1	I skipped more classes than I attended every semester of college, except the first one when I still had the hangover of high school attendance schedules keeping me in class.\n\nDid I do well?  Well, as they say C's get degrees and I got a lot of B's and B minuses.  The first semester of my sophomore year I got dumped and was deeply suicidal, ended up with a 0.9 GPA that term because I didn't even show up for final exams.  By the second half of my sophomore year I knew not to enroll in any courses that determined more than 10% of one's grade on attendance.  I majored in philosophy so the reading syllabus and heavily graded weight of term papers meant I could maintain a passable GPA without actually showing up much.  I took easy electives.  I ultimately graduated with a 2.7 overall.  I wouldn't say I "did well" by my standards.\n\nDid it seriously affect my future?  Yes absolutely, and no not at all.  It essentially just created one more limitation on my future options, which for any number of reasons besides my undergrad performance, were not nearly as infinite as they might have seemed.  Like I said, I majored in philosophy, so my future was hardly a clearly defined thing.  My low GPA and minimal attendance did heavily discourage me from considering grad school, as most want at least a 3.0, and it's hard to get letters of recommendation from professors who have very good reason to not know who you are.  I wasn't particularly interested in grad school though, so it didn't feel like a great loss.  I finished undergrad back in 2012, so new grads of most liberal arts disciplines were pretty unemployable no matter their GPA.  It was advantageous my degree was awarded by a fairly prestigious institution, I write a good cover letter, and interview well, so I ended up actually having an easier time landing a job than many of my friends who were objectively better students.  Much of the time I spent not attending class was spent drinking and getting stoned with people I still consider very dear friends, so while my lack of attendance certainly affected my future, it's impossible to know what alternate life I'd be living right now if I'd taken better academic advantage of my undergrad career.  All else being equal, I doubt very much that a dutiful attendance history would have transformed my life in any way, but it's also impossible that all else would be equal in my life had I actually shown up to class on the regular.\n\nI had friends whose class skipping habits ultimately forced them to drop out, some of them are doing fine, others, I'll admit, are doing less fine.  I managed to avoid that outcome.  I consider my life pretty awesome nowadays, I'm happily married, own a beautiful home, make more than twice my starting salary with a chill AF work from home job, have a dog, cat, many good friends, a vacation coming up, thinking about starting a family pretty soon, my mental health has literally never been better.  Honestly, I wish I hadn't taken the education I was receiving for granted, because the more I age the more I realize I had the opportunity to personally know and learn from world class scholars of their field.  But squandering that opportunity was also really fucking fun sometimes, and also I was a deeply depressed trainwreck in no real position to take advantage of half of it.\n\nTLDR: Yes; not really; not really.
1	I did the opposite.\n\nI was diligent the first two years, now I'm beginning to skip.
61	Why do I always make up scenarios that never happen in my head?	I just imagined picking a fight with my professor for not acknowledging my efforts. I sometimes imagine picking up a fueled argument with my friends over something and my hands start going all over the place and get myself worked up. I feel genuinely angry. On other occasions I imagine walking with my ex then I might trip over something so I make a genuine face expression to someone next to me (who doesn't exist by the way) as if to say "ooops their". 
17	Honestly, the me in my head would be liked by everyone(or hated by everyone). I do this all the time. With my crush(I have never initiated a convo with her), I have imagined many conversations with her. When somebody does something that gets me annoyed, I think of me responding to it and being outgoing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly think the simulations in my head could be pretty accurate to what would happen, but when I get brave enough to actually do it, I end up embarrassing myself(due to my pro social skills).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I do it so I can either, have fun and think or it's just my brain telling me to talk to the person or that person I am in my scenarios(not socially inept me) is the person I wanna be(at times) so I have fantasies about being that person(myself lol).
18	Because its easier than real world. The real world has more moving parts, and has uncertainty in real time.\n\nDepending on how you use it, it could be a coping mechanism.
6	Ha! ENTP here. I do this. I polled people once and most people said they monologue in their heads, I was shocked.\n\nOne friend replied, “I dialogue, but I’m the one doing most of the talking.”
5	I don't know if that counts, but I always construct conversations in my head. I construct conversations between me and my friends, family, teachers, professors, etc. It's a never ending mental task. Apart of the conversations I also construct the surrounding scenarios and actions. It's like living my entire live inside of my head.
6	To eventually prepare you for an eventual event
4	So is this really an xNTP thing? I do this everyday. With great passion as if I always have a play/skit going on when I’m alone. A lot of people think I’m not normal cos I’ve always been caught acting out of my imagination 😓 is this normal for us? Please tell me I’m/we’re not mentally unstable 😣 
1	I don’t know, but a better question is how do you make up scenarios if they are never in your head in the first place.
1	same
1	Low Fe, High Ne
1	Be careful,  if you think something enough it might become your reality. 
1	Can relate, I even have a consistent idealized self which even has a bit of lore, now.\n\nI make use of it though, put him in bad situations, and see how "he" would react, which is food for thoughts. I can then criticize. I'm trying to be fairly realistic, so it's a thought experiment, and still fun day dreaming.\n\nIt's kinda useful to explore your values,etc ? It's not reliant on external fiction eitheir. It's a shadow I can chase, and I can kinda use it as a way to scout ahead my choices. 
523	This.	
78	At least you listen to their stories. I have sometime just sat there for 15 to 30 mins and not taken in a single word. Drove all my relatives friends and cousins insane. 🙄
27	I have common phrases I cycle through to help avoid that feeling. I understand... That makes sense... I know how that goes... But all my friends have learned to accept it
14	I went to a birthday party and this guy kept trying to make me laugh but I didn't find it funny. Anyway, I was like, "time to pretend to laugh and shake my body a lot since that's what he's doing". People thought I was having an aneurysm or something.
12	"Yeah" must be my most said word in conversation. I'm either not listening because the conversation doesn't interest me but I don't want to seem rude, or I need a moment to process what I'm being told and use "yeah" as a filler when I feel I need to say something to keep the conversation going while I'm thinking of a better response. \n\nThe only people I don't do this with are my immediate family - my dad, mom, and brother. Even my husband who I've known for 10 years I still give the "yeah" treatment (to be fair, I only do when he talks about his work and I don't understand half of the jargon he uses). 
11	I do this but I’m an ENFP 😭
8	3 months ago I was asked to describe myself with a meme/comic, this is what I sent them.
8	This is why I thought I have (and I am still kinda suspicious of having) social anxiety
5	Me: " hum hum..."\n\nRandom people: "right???"\n\nMe: "of course!"\n\nClose friend: " hum hum what?"\n\nMe: "hum hum..... oh.. hummmm... *random fact pops out to save the day*"
11	What is Smung/Smiung
5	The creator of these comics is actually an INTP as well lmao
3	But hear me out. Ever focus so hard on listening to someone's story you forget to actually listen?
3	Sooo...  neurotic, then.
2	Dead on.
2	This is my life
2	Probably you don't really realize how fast you go through these thoughts
2	This is autism. 
2	I’d say “right on” a lot. It’s good to mix up with “yeah”
3	I laughed so hard at this hahahaha
1	Oh my gosh, this is me in the most awkward of conversations. 
4	Do you guys prefer detailed planning over improvising	
4	Depends on the situation
3	Both, depending. \n\nIt's a question I've thought a lot about. \n\n[xNxP chiming in]
2	I usually imagine the goal I want to achieve and then figure out how to get there. Howeber, they are vague steps that I figure out when I get there. Basically, I plan out the big picture but improvise on the details.
2	For fun yes for work no
2	INTPs are extraordinarily good at improvising with everything in life.  That doesn't mean that we don't make plans, it just means we make plans on the spot as information comes in.  J types make plans well in advance because it makes them feel prepared and ready for the task.  P types don't get much benefit from planning in advance and sometimes feel constricted or even stressed when forced to follow things like detailed project plans, itineraries, etc.  If you love project planning and schedules and detailed timelines then you're probably mistyped.
1	Some structure is important, but so is keeping options open.
1	No
1	I can usually improvise detailed plans through Ti and Ne: I use my Ti to break the issue down to its core roots, create logical and detailed solutions to problems at hand, and then use Ne to merge those individual solutions into one. Because of this I can come off as a bit INTJ-ish, but overall I’m much more INTP.
1	What does the P stand for, jackass?
1	Improvising in general because it saves work. I resort to detailed planning when things matter. Stuff like vacation or a big event. No point in wasting serious energy and effort on day to day tasks.
9	Why everyone is good at the school here?	I mean, I'm an INTP too and I find maths and science too hard for me. I can't see motivation in the things I had to study, I only enjoyed History and biology honestly. Anyway, I repeat two grades in my life for the lack of motivation and depression of being lonely and bored in the highschool.\n\n\nAm I retarded? 
8	honestly, i feel the same. you're not alone.
5	I had Cs and Ds in school... Couldnt stand the bullshit like herbal medicine etc...  Religion pissed me off astronomically...\n\nWhy ? Because I didnt give a shit what flavonoids are, I didnt give a shit how PCR works( even though I know now), I didnt give a shit who some biblefag Abraham was...\n\nThough i was good in things like chemistry, physics and math.\n\nAlso I hated writing those 3 paged lab reports so i almost never handed them in. Youd think you dont understand things but thats because you do jackshit for those subjects.\n\nAdd to that that since the age of 12 i havent felt happy even once and that until the age of 20 I was thinking of suicide every day and i had/have no friends. You are probably in a similar situation.\n\nNow i have As and Bs studying informatics and doing nothing( just a bit more than in high school)... learning 2h/ week on average.\n\nWhat people dont tell you is that to have knowledge in some subject you actually need to be interested in it. Also doing sport and sleeping more than 5days/week may help prolong your attention span, having a good attention span during lessons can save you from learning. I Aced some tests without learning just because i had my full attention directed on the prof and nothing else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	and no, you aren't, having this personality type is having the potential because of the way you think, anyway, ever heard of Einstein's fish tree analogy?
3	I feel you. I succeeded in Certain classes With easy A without studying and failed math and physics terribly. Now that i am in university i am just a Pile of cippling selfdoubt Because i Never really learned to study and just absorbed The stuff that intrested me Somehow. Now that i only have to write Papers that require Lot of selfstudying and Research i just can Not do IT. It does Not help i am studying something i am passionated about since i only absorb random Facts and get distraced by unrelated cool stuff while Doing research. \n\nI also blame My mental health for Lack of Focus and me Feeling dumb af tho
3	Your learning style can affect what you are best st in school. There are basically 3. Visual - learning by seeing, auditory - learning by hearing, and movement - learning by moving your body.\n\nPeople genrally have a first and then a second preference. I'm an auditory and then visual learner.\n\nMost people are visual first then they are usually one of the other two. \n\nI've seen people who seem to be auditory only. They never seem to look at anything and hardly move. People who get into a lot of accidents are likely auditory movers. They look last if they look at all. Very dangerous.\n\nSchool caters to visual learners. So if you aren't visual that maybe the issue why school sucked. People who are listener/ visual or visual /listener do best in school because they have good memories for what they see and hear. So likely school was not structured for your learning style. You aren't retarded you were let down by the system that only caters to the "average" person.\n\nI can't spell for shit. My visual memory is only 5 letters long. (it was an exercise in a book) But my auditory memory is legendary at my work and people fear me because in recall everything that is said. (not true, but I'm not admitting to it)\n\nTest here if you'd like to try:\n\nhttps://personalitymax.com/learning-styles/\n
2	You are a shark trying/forced to climb a tree.
2	(Being good at college is only impressive if you have a useful major)
2	I have a 3.8, i guess i’m good at school because i have adhd and adderall is a hell of a drug. When I don’t take my pill, and i have no need to be at school, i have to fight the urge to walk out of school. last year the week before finals i got 3 detentions for leaving in the middle of class 30 minutes early and going home. Why? because we were doing a review that i had already finished and refused to sit in a desk when i could be at home sleeping. I digress, but adderall keeps me focused and gets me to do my work. Adderall isn’t the only factor though. \n\nEveryone holds themselves to certain standards. To me, school is pointless for the most part, and i definitely slack off, but there’s something in my brain that will not let me sit around and do nothing. Ive always been in the ‘advanced classes’ since middle school, and the environment of the other smart kids rubbed off on me i guess. I won’t study for hours (i only study by looking over notes in classes before the test) but if i’m struggling, i’ll seek out help until i understand what’s being taught. My standard i hold for myself does not tolerate me failing. \n\ni sound retarded, but i honestly don’t know why i have a 3.8 GPA. Above were just theories that could be why.
1	am I\*
1	I was an A/B student without trying in school (nothing could have motivated me to try).\n\nI did crappy in College - then fairly crappy at university until my last year (after working for a year and seeing the point of some of the work).\n\nThen when I’ve got into work my skills and way of thinking are valued.
1	Maths is like another language to me and not one that I know 
1	I quit school in 9th grade.  Absolutely hated being there.  18 years later I have zero regrets.
204	"oh"	
33	Me: well you see the reason your sad is because your friend brought you joy which is really just dopamine. You were emotionally attached which is just addiction. You're suffering from withdrawals and this is your brains way of telling you because you lost a source of dopamine. you see, this is the problem with humanity. Everybody is just so dependant on this single fucking chemical and let it dictate their entire lives. Rise up and pursue knowledge!!\n\nHer: what the fuck?
10	Tell me both sides so I can decide who was right
10	Usually, I just say "you know; sometimes shit happens" and that's pretty much all I say. It tends to work. 
8	Plot twist: The ESFP IS Jessica.
7	Please, like anybody would feel comfortable opening up to me
16	Haha can't force yourself to care about insignificant bullshit! That's what I always say!
8	I'm relating at this *so* hard.
4	"What do I dooooooo?!"
5	Showed this to my ESFP girlfriend. We had a good laugh
3	Reeeeeeeee
2	Yes.
2	I swear I would remember Jessica's face, but not her name.
2	I have an ESFP friend.\n\nThey are fun but also a lot of work.
2	REEEEEEE\n\nwait wrong sub
2	I totally relate to the 'not knowing Jessica' part, but you can still care. Some of these comments scare me. Scratch that, people without empathy or sympathy scare me.
2	That’s unfortunate 
1	#time to recommend solutions rather than giving emotional support which is what they’re clearing asking for
1	I'm sorry.  I can't imagine being friends with an ESFP.
20	INTP getting interviewed	
5	That was hilarious
2	He's right; and spotify's stock price is $143 for literally no fucking reason right now. Completely non-sense business model.
1	It really demonstrates the intelligence of TV personalities 
1	Is he punking the anchors?
1	I sense a bitt of ASP along with his intp traits here. Those news anchors have no idea what he’s even saying.
1	Won't you [look](https://imgur.com/a/8WqeGyA) at that face
73	It has probably already been here but idc	
15	"Oh! A guy. Is he being creepy? Nah, please... He probably just thought something bad about your appearance but that's it. Lol. Just walk normal. \n\n"You call that normal? Slow down! He'll think you think he's a rapist or something... But... what if he is? Ugh... Don't think bad about people. But... what if this naivety gets me killed someday? Better safe than sorry? Take your phone just in case! Ok, phone here. 911 pre-dialed? No, no, just the phone close. \n\n"Huh? He's not even behind me now. I guess I was just being paranoic. You silly looney...".
4	This is why I always make an effort to rush in front of girls going in the same direction and make it look like I'm in a hurry. If a girl my age is walking close enough by that we make eye contact, I do the following:\n\n1. Make sure my gait is not in rhythm with hers (honestly not sure why I do this but I think it feels predatory)\n2. Look at the ground and speed up so I can be in front of her and have this situation be over.\n3. Wait till we are at the moment of passing to look at her face.\n4. If eye contact is made... \n5. ABORT.
6	I mean, just keep walking? If she thinks you're tailing her she'll try some evasive maneuvers and then you'll just keep walking. Crossing the road is more suspicious than to keep going where you're going.
3	Follow u/SrGrafo for new comics daily and visit us at r/SrGrafo for a full collection of his comics. cheers!
1	If for whatever reason I find myself walking behind a lonely female stranger I employ these succession of thicc tactics:\n\n1. Keep my normal gait and walk normally with my eyes painted at my phone\n\n\n2. If she starts walking faster, I slow down to hopefully subconsciously reassure her that I’m not a psycho\n\n\n3. If she looks panicked, I cross the street and make a turn; even if that puts me off course
9	Resting Bitch face?	Curious if it's an INTP thing or just me.\n\nI have it really bad when I'm concentrated on anything.(Such as driving or taking a test)
3	Definitely just a human thing that occurs when deeply thinking about something or when heavily concentrated.
3	Absolutely an INTP thing. I have often been told I look like I want to murder someone. My boss once looked at me and gestured with his hands and face to smile, as if he was pulling strings from either side of his lips. 
3	Resting bitch face evolved as a way for attractive females to scare away beta men she wasn’t interested in.
2	ISTP can confirm resting bitch face. Also met an INTJ female who had it as well.\n\nI also don’t like people trying to talk to me when I’m focused on something.
2	I don't, but I wish I did because then people would fuck off, lol
1	I'm really confused about this, do people actually think about facial expressions before making them? Or is ot subconscious? I have to force myself do different expressions, appropriate for the situation, but it gets really exhausting.
1	How do you know you have rbf when driving or taking a test? I have no idea what I look like when I'm doing either of those things
19	Extremely obvious advice	Exercise and socialize.\n\nThat's it. That is literally all you need to turn your life around. You don't even have to put hours into it. I guarantee that if you do not currently exercise or talk to people enough, then doing both for 30 minutes per day will dramatically boost pretty much every single aspect of your life.\n\nNo confidence? Low self-esteem? Poor health? Depression? Anxiety? Overweight? Don't have a job? Don't have friends? Can't get laid? Can't get any work done? Trouble with sleep? Exercising and socializing will help with every single one of those problems and more. Even if you just go out for a 30 minute walk. Even if you just start a conversation with a random stranger online. It's like a magical cure-all potion that everybody underestimates.\n\nMost people don't need this advice and already do more than 30 minutes of both without even trying. But INTP is a special breed and I somehow managed to neglect both for multiple years myself. Just do it.
15	What if I exercise, socialize, and eat nothing but sour cream  - will I still be able to turn my life around?
7	>Do things you hate because you'll feel better\n\nHmm.
4	Because we mofos know exactly what we need to do, but we just don't do it.
3	Diet and exercise up-regulate dopamine receptors, which will make you more motivated in general. That's why I'm cutting carbs and trying to fit exercise into my schedule.
3	what if you're in a wheelchair?
3	Good advice. I’ve always believed in keeping it simple. After all, we’re just animals who like to hunt, fuck, socialize and stay warm.
2	True. \n\nFor the unconvinced (and maybe OP if you didn't argue it that way), typology wise, this basically addresses our core weaknesses in the SF domain, particularly Se and Fe, and to a lesser extent Si and Fi. There's a virtuous circle here, being in shape means you're taken more seriously, which in turns helps with the socializing, which hopefully feeds your Ne and thus Ti.\n\nNow, how to actually do it ? The answer would be "Just do it ™" , but I guess it isn't convincing. This requires some discipline, but once you get to a certain point, it becomes habit (or so I hear). \n\nI think one of the big problem is probably the knowledge, say, how to work out, what exercises, when.bI find tons of programs, but not many explain stuff properly, imho. I'm a bit into bodyweight exercise (turns out push ups are more complex than you think) because of that, I don't want to invest in a gym membership, and now I know enough to say that I don't know shit. You also need some knowledge of nutrition (probably just a matter of tracking your calories. "What is measured progress" and all that, but still)\n\n
2	I prefer to just mosey up and down the street shouting I NEED A JOB! at whoever passes by
2	Actually this is a kind of twisted advice. I myself started socializing and now I'm not INTP anymore, I actually became INFP.
2	No.
2	Too lazy too autistic 
1	> Trouble with sleep? Exercising and socializing will help with every single one of those problems\n\nexercising doesn't help (been doing it for 10 years now), and socializing leaves me too excited to sleep. especially if i have a fun conversation in the evening with someone.
1	> It's like a magical cure-all potion that everybody underestimates.\n\nThat must explain why members of the military have lives with no serious problems whatsoever since they do both.
1	I'm sorry, but there is no magic cure.\n\nExercising and socializing are good for you, if you do neither doing them will certainly improve your quality of life, but it's not going to solve all your problems.\n\nLots of people struggle with comfort zones, I'm one of them. Exercising and socializing does not magically remove your comfort zones. It makes it a little bit easier to step out of the zone, but actual improvement requires effort. You have to actively put yourself into scenarios that you're not comfortable with and slowly expand the comfort zone.\n\nSome exercising and socializing is also not going to stop you from procrastinating. I've been working out for quite some time now, and getting to the gym or going for a walk is not a problem. It however had zero carryover to being productive in other areas. I didn't start finishing songs, I didn't start practicing my instrument more, the periods when I've been doing better with those are periods I put in a lot of active effort and created the routine.\n\nHere's some more extremely obvious advice: Stop trying to cut corners. Stop thinking there is a magic cure. Improvement is incremental, one step at a time. Don't expect your life to turn golden in a month time because you started going for walks and socializing, that bubble with burst and you'll come crashing down. Accumulating good routines over time is what gives results, but it takes time. You can't just turn your life around on the spot, no person has the energy or will power to do that. You start by changing a few habitual patterns, once those are established you change some more. One foot in front of the other, keep on struggling struggler.
1	Ok. I lost 10 Inches off my waist, gained significant muscle mass, and tried to socialize more than normal. My depression is getting worse. Conversations leave me feeling empty. Visiting old friends no longer gives me nostalgia. The world seems like it's closing in and there's no way for me to mental through it. Now what?
1	I have to go to the Gym now due to my age, but I wonder why I didn't do it sooner. Need my tunes though.\n\nNo idea where to put these quotes, but I only came across them recently and they seem relevant to me.\n\nMinds, like bodies, will often fall into a pimpled, ill-conditioned state from mere excess of comfort. - Charles Dickens\n\nThe lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house as a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master. - Khalil Gibran\n\n&#x200B;
12	When someone says the news has *become* really bad	"I have been reading the morning paper. I do it every morning--knowing that I shall find the usual depravities and basenesses and hypocrisies and cruelties that make up civilization, and cause me to put in the rest of the day pleading for the damnation of the human race. I cannot seem to get my prayers answered, yet I do not despair."\n\n-Mark Twain writing to a friend in 1899
5	I think part of what contributes to this is the ease of accessing news from around the world right in the palm of your hand 24/7 these days. The news -has- always been terrible, but larger news volume means a sense of more terribleness, you know?
3	Media has always largely been dominated by monied interests. Clintons legalization of the media monopoly and Obamas passage of a provision legally allowing the government to propagandize citizens (which theyve been doing forever obviously anyways, operation mockingbird and the rise of TV news during the cold war) sealed the deal on it seemingly for good. 
2	Wow, lol, I deleted my Twitter account a few weeks ago precisely with this reasoning. The ugliness and stupidity really does takes it's toll on mental health. 
1	Older guy here. I can’t think of time when there wasn’t something in the news that was stress-inducing. The world isn’t perfect. That being said, some times in history ARE more difficult than others and you could make a pretty good argument that this is one of those times. Today’s problems will eventually pass and, twenty years from now, they’ll be nothing more than questions on “Jeopardy!” But there will be new problems.\n\nNow, can anyone here think of even one news story from 1899 without going to Google or Wikipedia?\n
7	How to get girls as an INTP?	Title mostly says it. I've tried dating apps but I'm not an efficient texter. I am typically very charming in person (when I'm not depressed from bipolar). Any advise?
6	I'm INTP and I've never had a big problem with girls. I've been with an ENFP for about 9 years now, married for 2 or 3.  \n\n\nYou just gotta overcome some of your natural tendencies. Don't be afraid to put yourself in social settings. The second you make real eye contact with her, stop what you're doing and talk to her. Doesn't really matter about what, but a simple and polite "you're very pretty and I would like to take you out on a date." has worked well for me in the past. Don't be too thirsty, and you'll get that date. I've found it's not worth trying to talk over an extrovert at a party, or whatever.  \n\n\nAs for what you talk about on the date- be yourself, and if she likes it, you're golden. INTP's have many interests, you can probably find common interests if you listen to her. LISTEN TO HER. If there's no common interests, move on. Plenty of fish in the sea and all that.  \n\n\nAnd for the love of god, if you're interested, express that physically- she is your love interest, not your debate partner. Touch her, and kiss her, if you want to. She will NOT be attracted to you if you lack the confidence to make those moves.  \n\n\nDon't try to analyze a love interest, either. Just take it at face value- you are attracted to that person, and they're probably attracted to you too.   \n\n\nThis is written from the standpoint of a straight INTP male, turn her's into him's or whatever depending on the situation.
5	Here’s some advice I’ve been given over the course of my life but never use because I’m a fucking dumbass:\n\n1. Use Ti to analyze their personality to see if they’re right for you, watch for their interests, sense of humor, etc. Find something you have a mutual interest in and bring it up in conversation. But don’t be fake, that’s one of the worst things you can do to attract someone.\n\n2. Show your witty and fun loving side, give Ti a rest and let Ne take the wheel for a bit. \n\n3. Try accessing your Fe if you can (I struggle with this quite a bit), if not then do your best to develop it.\n\n4. If you pick up on signs that they may like you back then go for it before it’s too late (found this out the hard way). These signs are usually along the lines of:\n• flirting\n• laughs at every single one of your jokes (especially if the joke wasn’t that funny)\n• a bit touchy-feely \n• confessing their feelings to you (this ones pretty subtle and I’d understand if you miss it)\n• paying very close attention to you in conversation \n• partaking in your interests that weren’t mutual beforehand \nThe list goes on but this should help you out a bit (hopefully)\n\n\nGodspeed, fellow analytical weirdo!\n\n
5	1) If you send more than 20 messages on a dating app without setting a first date, move on. \n\n2) don't let opportunities slide. The perfect moment never comes, so create your own moment. Acknowledge, very brief banter, ask for contact information. Then say something nice, leave, and contact her the next day.\n\n3) don't be desperate. \n\n4) don't be desperate.\n
9	become more social and then you'll get girls
3	Practice. Avoid dating apps
4	1) be attractive.\n2) dont be unattractive.\n3) stop sounding like a desperate moron.\n\nBut you're asking a bunch of intps how to get laid. You already fucked up.
2	1.  Get a good style.  Nice fitting clothes, hair, groom,\n\n2.  Get the ideal body weight.  You don’t even have to exercise, just eat less.\n\n3.  Learn to give off an attractive vibe.  The way you walk, talk, look at people.\n\nSince you say you’re already charming, you probably just need to work on your outside.  doing the things listed will make it exponentially easier to attract and approach girls.  Don’t forget the hard part of actually approaching girls lol
2	Hi! I’m a INFJ girl and I can say I don’t trust dating apps, probably the kind of girl that is into your style isn’t there so you may like to try it old school, I suggest going to a place or activity you really love and try there as we tend to be more open and friendly at that places, be respectful and don’t try to force anything, if after some time (please not too soon, this things take time!)you feel something and you think it may be mutual please talk and be clear about it (so she knows and can give you an appropriate response),  be nice if the answer is a no( we all have been there, is not nice but not the end of the world) and if she agrees then...it’s the time to use all your charm!! \n\nI bet there’s someone out there for you, just look closer.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPd: Extra points if you look clean, fresh breath, with nice casual clothes and personally I’ve fallen so many times for a good smell of lotion.
2	As an INTP? You don't.\n\nYou have to step into the shoes of another type until  the deal is sealed and then you can slowly let your real self out and hope the relationship doesn't collapse.\n\nThis may or may not be personal anecdote.
3	Wait for them to come to you or initiate conversation with as many girls as possible to increase your chances.
1	authenticity
1	meetup.com find some actual groups that interest you and also have female members?
1	Be physically attractive and have social status or money
1	Be true to yourself.\n\nIf she asks you an opinion, say what you feel, not what you think she wants to hear.\n\nDon’t say the thing that you think will make you look cool.\n\nIf she asks what you are doing, and it’s lame, own up to it 100%.\n\nIf she doesn’t like it? That’s fine. There are other women out there who will like the things you do and who you are. Knowing this is incredibly liberating.\n\nThe great thing about Tinder, Bumble, etc... you have lots of options. Work it.\n\nBe yourself, because you don’t want to get into a relationship with a girl where you are pretending to be someone you are not anyways... that is a recipe for your unhappiness, and it’s unsustainable.\n\nBe open to rejection. Hell, court it! When the chemistry is there, you’ll know. If it’s not there, just move on until you find it. Don’t settle.\n\nFinally... a secret: when you are courting rejection, just being yourself and not caring whether she likes it or not... she will like it! It’s called confidence, my friend, and it is the characteristic women prize in a man most.\n\nYou’ve got this.
1	I look at talking to girls like I play chess,first I test her, ask her questions and opinions, check how smart they are, be calculating, don't be to direct or desperate, be yourself, and tease her mentally
1	Weak mental health	So first off, I dealt with depression a few years.\nNow, I thought it's gone. But it probably isn't.\nI get anxiety of small things. \nI had a huge conflict with a very good friend I know from pretty much the very beginning. Now he talked with other people about me (I know as well) and made them cancel friendship with me pretty much for now.\nNow I get anxiety (and I know, this sounds really stupid) that some other people who used to call my mom and insult her would do that again. Also I have fear to get into Whatsapp groups and get insulted. I know these are small things, but I just can't get over it.\nPLEASE help. Everything in my life is summing up right now (I'm 17), [mental] health, sleep disorder. And I know. I went to the doctor already. However, it takes so long to get help, like with my sleep disorder and mental health (depression eventually? I dont know)\nI'm just exhausted right now. There are some things I didnt mention which add up on top\n\nPlease share me your advice, opinion etc. \nI need it right now....thanks in advance
1	I too suffer from depression and anxiety, however I’m one of the worst people to ask for advice and coping methods, typically I just sleep my way through it all. But if I were to give one bit advice, it’d be to find some sort of hobby, something to distract yourself from the pains of everyday life. Personally, I like to play large open-world games such as Skyrim or Breath of the Wild, games with lots of replay value.
1	Well I'm 17 and I'm in a boat in the same waters. Unfortunately I don't have much to offer you
1	Go seek professional help from the professionals.
1	Go to the INFJ subreddit. INTPs don't strike me as good for this stuff. Also, do you have anybody you trust? Anybody you can be honest with? Feelings, etc.? Facing stuff like that by your own seems pretty fucking hard.
1	I am 54, and what you say brings back memories.  Life was so hard in high school and even into college. I was depressed all my life but did not get therapy until I was 45. I wish I had started earlier. First, you need to know that there is nothing wrong with you.  You are normal. It is very hard when friends turn, but I say to find a way forgive and tell them that you still consider them a friend. That has a huge impact on people.  Learn not to care what others think of you.  If you do, then you are giving them power over you. What do you think of yourself? If you do not accept and like yourself, work on it. If you need a safe place to vent or talk, stick around here.  Most of us are or were in your boat, and we will not make fun of you.  For the sleeping thing, my psychiatrist said that the most important thing is to get up at the same time every day.  If you sleep too little, your body will make you tired earlier.  You can make yourself get up, but you cannot make yourself sleep. No naps.  Force yourself through a week, and things will start to right themselves. Read the posts here, and you will see yourself everywhere.  You are not alone, so stick around.
61	Why we are never able to study everything we want.	
4	I’m in my senior year of college and this has never felt so relevant. I have hundreds of paths I could take and I feel that I’ll never settle on one because there are so many things left to do and learn about. Obviously I can maintain a couple of projects but not ALL of them and that is my greatest downfall.

24	Using your superpowers for good.	We’ve used our pattern loving brains our whole lives. Now I think it’s time to not only help ourselves but help others. Come on people! We are widely regarded as the “smartest” of the types and we’re too emotionally stupid to talk to anyone! \n\nBe 100% brutally honest here\n\nWe are scared.\n\nGrowing up we were subconsciously told that our thought process was wrong. That we as people were not “thinking correctly”. Pushed through a compromised educational system made to cater to the simple minded herd mentality. They are too scared to make a kid who is different because that may tarnish their image as a country that produces straight A students. They are coddled with the mindset that individuality and free thinking is the the root of evil when in reality it’s ignorance. They have failed you. \n\nBut it’s not too late.\n\nYou still have yourself. As hard as they tried to pry your free spirit, your critical thinking, and your proclivity towards complicated subjects away from you... it’s still there... mangled and confused but alive. The only way to bring it all back is in an act of self love. Find yourself a hobby that you know you’ll love. Something so deliciously complex and connected that you can’t help but dive into it. Then use what you know is your best quality (your pattern loving mind) and try to find a way to bring value to people using that hobby. That’s how you make money doing what you love, reawaken your dormant intellect and learn a hell of a lot about yourself in the process. It’s the Ti-Si loop used for good! Your Ti is an invaluable tool to figure out what you need to know to master your hobby and provide value to your customer. When you see the results of your hard (and smart) work in the praise of your fanbase then you’ll get that sense of appreciation your Si so desperately needs. That will encourage you to continue using Ti then the cycle continues into infinity. \nTHAT is how you leave this world making it a better place\nTHAT is how you lead a successful happy life as an intp\nTHAT is how you use your superpowers... \nfor good\n
4	We are the personality type that never should have existed. We are born with some of the highest IQs yet barely any of us structure our lives right to ever use it to make a difference. Isaac Newton and Nikola Tesla stuck to rigorous schedules and used their "superpowers" to the potential they are meant for. Nikola Tesla was socially inept, however, and had so much of his work stolen by the more charismatic, street-smart Edison. I could pick up material faster than practically every other kid in elementary school, but did only just as good because I was constantly wasting time staring at the ceiling blankly. I can destroy exams based on specific problem solving like calculus and chemistry but to this day can't write an essay for the life of me. I can write a more eloquent rant on reddit in 15 minutes than I can write a literary analysis within 6 days (probably because I don't start it until the last day). 
3	> We are widely regarded as the “smartest” of the types \n\nIf you say so.\n\n> we’re too emotionally stupid to talk to anyone!\n\nIt's not the emotions, it's assertiveness. See is our PoLR/Blindspot. We have no presence, and in some, case aren't present at all. We're not in the "Here and now", we're in our heads.\n\n> Be 100% brutally honest here\n> We are scared.\n\nLol, talk for yourself.\n\n> They are too scared to make a kid who is different because that may tarnish their image as a country that produces straight A students\n\nThat's having wrong expectations of the school system. Countries put those in place so their population is able to work and not to retarded... It's not here to replace your dad.\n\n> That’s how you make money doing what you love\n\nDo that work if I watch porn ?\n\n> It’s the Ti-Si loop used for good\n\nLMAO, no. The Ti-Si loop, if it exists (I personally think it's actually Ti-Ni) is a bad situation. You need more info, you need Ne. \n\n***\nHave you been practicing what you're preaching Op ? If so, can you show us the results ?\n\nNo ? That's just a BS wannabe motivational speech ?
4	dank memes create intp dreams
2	Thank you. Been thinking a lot about this lately.
2	I’m that way with music. Never pursued it because my passion is making music, not singing and playing it. In other words, I love writing songs (guitar, lyrics) but not anything more. I want to sell my songs and try to make a living as a songwriter (not performer). Idk I’m posting this but your post resonated with me. Thanks.
2	I wouldnt blame the school system for our failings. You are not born lazy. Its either your parents faul or your faul that you couldnt hold up to academic expectations. Nobody gives a fuck about our "creative" streaks if they are disorganized, unrefined etc...\n\nIf you wanna be something get over your fucking laziness and there u go. If youre in university learn at least 4h/week youll probably get As and Bs if youre smart. I have plenty of good Ideas but still I have to learn mainstream, plebean mathematics to actually realize them.

8	What type of humor do INTPs tend to use?	
22	I've observed myself leaning towards two major types. One is dry, sarcastic, harmless mockery of others that allows me to express things I couldn't have in a serious conversation. And the other kind is self-deprecating and sarcastic, and perhaps some observational humour thrown in. 
16	My humor is sarcastic, self-deprecating, dark, twisted and borderline offensive at times.
12	Dry, dark, sarcastic... sometimes the occasional, "that's what she said". That's me, anyway. 
7	Troll
5	Lots of irony
3	Meta humor. That includes recursive jokes, self-reference jokes, and template jokes that mock joke tropes.
3	Dark. 
3	Sarcasm, subtle mocking, teasing, or playing devil's advocate...I tend to find a lot of humor in the surreal or absurd, but often won't really joke out loud about these sorts of things, but will just quietly laugh to myself.  
2	My humor is fucked up. I love key and peele, South Park, it’s always Sunny, etc.
2	Puns are usually safe for the masses, but oh so shameful...
2	For me it's nonsense/surreal humor such as baked beans inside an analog clock, a basketball hoop on a Christ cross, deep fried memes, the E meme (clearly dead now but I loved it), Sbubby logos and software gore. Aside from that, dark humor.
2	I mess with people and see if they get it. Or accents. I’ve got a Saudi English accent that kills. 
2	self-deprecating, and sometimes a bit too edgy/abstract for others.\n\nthat, and lots of puns.
2	Irony, sarcasm, dark humor.
2	Plays on words, absurdist humor, dark humor, edgy humor, deadpan, the creation of alternate characters with their own personalities.
1	I tend to use absolutely no humor in conversations with other people, though sometimes I make dark jokes.
1	I like shiny and glowing jokes.
1	No dead baby jokes?
1	As I get older I'm trying to be more light-hearted. I'm 40. When I was about 24 my favorite comedy was Four Weddings and Funeral. Sarcastic, sardonic, and British humor (i.e. embarrassment). Still a big fan of Hugh Grant (ENTP). He has grown up. At age 50 he got kids, lol. \n
1	I did get massive impact on a self burn\n\nGirl I like: I might be a little tipsy.\nMe: I can tell.\nHer: (offended) how?\nMe: you laugh at my jokes.\nHer: (reverent awe) the rare self-burn!\n\n
1	sarcasm, dark, deadpan, and deprecating (no, not self-deprecating) most of the time. If I'm with less serious friends (jk, we all know ISTPs don't have friends), I do use the occasional "your mother" kind of joke, e.g. more silly humor than anything else. My closest friends have similar senses of humor to me, so we insult each other continually when in jest, while using sarcasm when arguing. We all have a mutual understanding that it is in good spirit, not a serious insult, so the relationship isn't affected. 
1	[This online forum might hold some clues...maybe] (https://www.personalitycafe.com/intp-forum-thinkers/66099-what-makes-intp-laugh.html)
1	Dry, sarcasm, dark n bloody offensive humor out to hurt ppl.
1	I like my humor just how I like my slaves, nice and dark
1	Looks like a resounding,"dry, dark, and sarcastic".
1	I think I like Japanese humor, because of how bizarre, exaggerated, and nonsensical it is.
1	Mine is surreal, inappropriate, and deadpan. Usually focus on perfect delivery, be it timing and/or expression. \n\nAlso make frequent use of word-play and shitty dad jokes.
7	Why live?	I might be stuck in another nihilistic feedback loop, which might be clouding my perception, however I would still like to raise that question. \n\nWhy should I stay alive?\n\nThere is no reason for me to wake up in the morning. Everything is pointless in it's own way. I should study for my exams in university, but I can't, it wouldn't make a difference. Whether I am in university or not does not make a difference. Whether I am alive or not does not make a difference. Everything seems pointless. I do not even care about the people who would be effected by my death anymore. I do not care about the things I would miss when I die now anymore. Children, family, a career, or even something as easily achievable as a new Victorian style dress, things that should excite a human being, they do not mean anything to me. I used to feel that sharp pain, that fear of missing out on something whenever I thought about death, but now it seems like something worth striving for.\n
9	My logic is this:  You have about 80 years to live, and about infinite years to be dead afterwards.  That essentially means that you spend about 0% of all time alive.  Therefore, dying early is pointless, because you have so much time to be dead, and so little time to be alive.\n\nAlso, if you stick around, you may find that things will get better in the near future.  Nothing good will come from giving up, while nothing bad will come from continuing on.\n\n♥
6	How about this spin. Everything matters. If heaven or hell don't exist yet we might be the ones to create them. Literally. Do you even know what you are? What conciousness is? How come there is such a thing as sentience in an apparently all physical and uncaring universe? For real, why? Pleasure and pain might not be distractions, the might be everything. Just sayin'.\n\nOr let's sprinkle a bit of basic logic over this. You're assuming that because you're life is shitty now, and it might just be, it has to be that way tomorrow, and so on. With what uncorruptible evidence? Even more,you might just be doing that to the whole of the human experience. Dunno, typical INTP stuff.\n\nAlso, excercise, get a therapist, eat good food, find decent friends, maybe stop eating gluten, don't use bright lights at night, yadda yadda yadda. We're not brains in a vat, as much as we would like to feel we are.\n\nAnd maybe is my INFP side talking, but I know there's a ton you're not saying. Hard, heart wrenching stuff. It could be a matter of just physical things screwing with your brain, or a mere logical realization/error that haunts you, but I doubt it. I've been there. Bottling things up is slow death by poisoning.
3	The canvas is blank.\n\nYou are suppose to draw beautiful stuffs on the canvas.\n\nInstead you bitch about how blank the canvas is.
2	Here is my logic: if nothing matters, why not have a little fun? \n\nYou are going to die with or without your effort, so why put in the effort? \n\nI, and probably you, like so living complex problems, so why not do it? It makes me feel happy, and if nothing matters there is really no other reasons for doing things. So, I plan to spend my time doing that, it won’t matter, but it will make me happy.
2	Everything is pointless, so why not stay alive?
2	People fill life with stuff exactly because it brings meaning; we live to experience love for certain things.\n\nAsk literally anyone what they love - that's what makes them want to stay alive. That thing keeps us here, and I think it's beautiful, especially because we all choose our own things. Things we love and things we believe in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn another note, do you have any access to a therapy? That would help you immensely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis made me think of one of the most important for me and favourite songs ever; pay attention to the lyrics\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAbPx\_-IJBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAbPx_-IJBI)
1	Because death is spooky. 
1	Stay alive because you are lazy! It's the ultimate. I was very upset last night, and I was like "I just want to die." It was a feeling to exaggerate how bad I felt." And it hit me. BOOM. "Wait long enough and you will die. Guaranteed."  \n\nWhy hurry it along? Just wait for it to come to you. In the mean time I love tootsie rolls. Gosh,  think how many I can eat before the end?\n\nI am planning to live to at least 100. That's a lot of tootsie rolls. Life doesn't have to be complicated and over thought. Mmmm, cheetos. I can eat a lot of Cheetos. Extra aged Gouda (about 9 months). Oh God, that's my favorite cheese. This is why I'm fat. LOL Me and my dogs eating cheetos.\n\nStaying alive, the ultimate form of lazy. I was too lazy to end my life. I just sat back and ate tootsie rolls and cheetos for years waiting for it to come to me.
1	Please get professional mental help. This seems less of a philosophical issue and more of a mental health issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
1	I'm not afraid of dying either, but I'm in no hurry to get there either.\n\nYou need to talk to a therapist. This is depression. You might feel numb because your brain isn't releasing the right chemicals. It can be that simple. You didn't always feel like this. It's not just ennui or nihilist thinking.\n\nI'm susceptible to both but the ultimate conclusion is fuck it. It means something to me and no amount of time will obliterate the feeling I have now. But I don't have depression, so I don't get stuck in the loop.
1	Because at the edge of nihilistic disillusionment is the breakthrough to perceive and problem solve in a new way. Creating utility out of the chaos. (Because life is orderly chaos! It’s a wave and a particle... don’t know if I’m conveying a broader meaning well with these analogies). The answer to what’s the use? Is always well what do you use it for? If the next thought is “shit because I am nothing, I’m a f up, a total waste of potential”... that’s just illogic being a dickhead. You are absolutely nothing, just like bird shit. Which if you didn’t know, is just as divine as puppy breath. (A lot of us don’t know this... too busy labeling our likes and dislikes and categorizing our experiences and outcomes). The “meh” feeling is Anhedonia, which is just the lack of pleasure at the things that used to bring you pleasure. I recommend connecting with a counselor (phd), to wade through the existential crisis with. Because it’s a place they are quite familiar with traveling into and they’re open to unique thinking styles, reading recommendations, or just tend to ask the right kind of questions that we can use to click a piece into place. I live because I’ve experienced the edge and breakthrough enough times to be confident that when I’m in a state of stagnation/depression I’m just experiencing a mixture of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness but I have learned from experience that this is just as transient as pleasure, so rather than stagnate I can do what I’ve done before and do some mind refurbishing. Reorganization of belief systems, approaches, resolutions, connections and create a new purpose out of the mayhem. I tend to like to invite someone in because F it, lets see what I sort with their perspective and input, and test out whether thoughts are distorted or why they keep returning. From experience I learned that I just prefer someone with a phd, rather than MSW, (but did know an MSW that was witty, illuminating and great to communicate with). 
1	Why not?
1	Request to abolish memes	I enjoy all the text posts here, because they provide an insight into how other INTPs think and behave, I find it rather fascinating. I feel like the memes serve as a hinderance for the latter. Let me know if you agree.
6	Honestly I think the good memes are good while the bad memes are bad. If ya know what I mean.
4	It’s not like memes provide an outlet to express how INTPs think and behave or anything. I think OP is right. Us INTPs notoriously need authority figures to tell us how to behave, hence the sticky. \n\nNothing but pretentious deep thinking threads from this point out, boyz 
2	Well, most xNTPs are memelords so you can’t really expect to have a subreddit without the occasional meme. Personally, I don’t mind it but I can see why you’d be annoyed by them.
2	I agree with you.
4	Memes are just as integral on these subreddit as discutions are.
1	Don't agree fully. Memes are great; love laughing at the absurdity of life. But they look like the main part about this sub. Makes me cringe. Could make weekly or monthly meme threads a thing instead. 
1	I'm against censorship, but I'm up for a meme-downvoting agreement
1	Memes are just as valid as a form of expression over text posts. Sometimes a photo can say more in a single image than a long text post can. Maybe you don’t see value in memes but others do. Censorship and policing content is not the way to make the sub better. Let people exert their free will and vote on what they do and do not want to see.
0	I’m alright with the memes tbh. I just found out I was INTP after having spent years making fun of MBTI and being cynical but then I took a test and it’s been something of a revelation so the memes are a new thing for me. \n\nCorrespondingly, memes also provide an extra dimension for the communication of some fairly abstract or niche ideas that I think might be helpful in describing INTP shit. \n\nI dunno if you’re a Star Trek fan or not but there’s this episode of TNG where this species only speak in metaphors and one great Reddit post something to the effect that they always had a hard time imagining a world where people communicate in imagery and metaphors until he went on Reddit and saw all the memes lol. \n\n
0	use RES and filter out things you don't need. there is probably a way to filter out image submissions.
0	No... I love your INTP memes. r/intj doesn’t allow memes and is frequently full of boring career advice questions. Do what you will, but maybe get rid of that guy who just asks people to rate him all the time before abolishing memes. 
2	What improvised study hacks made the difference for you?	
5	I read the stuff I need to study once right before the exam.
3	I recently discovered a way that lets me absorb SO much more info. I pick a chapter and I “teach” a non-existent class about all the information in the chapter. Yes, I talk aloud. Whenever I come to information I don’t thoroughly understand, or a term i’m not familiar with, I just google and write that new information down  on my outline.  I find that it helps me be more confident explaining a concept to someone because i’ve heard myself say it. It’s possible that I learn by hearing and the act of speaking the information. I donno, but I plan to do lots more studying like this. 
2	Information recall. I divide what i need to study into sections and write out the notes for them. Afterwards I try to recall certain sections at random, out loud if possible. After recalling as much as I can I read the notes to see what I missed and leave it and do other things for a bit. Usually I do the recalling with the notes 3 or 4 times and after that I just recall a section or two while taking breaks from the rest of my work without the notes afterwards. It might seem time consuming but its really not, since its divided into sections you dont have to do all of them at once and can space things out through the day whenever you have a few minutes of spare time. Since you already took the time and effort to teach your brain to recall that information, recalling it during a test will be much faster and much easier. And it can also help you remember big amounts of information for a long time by recalling it every once in a while. I have a harder time studying for subjects where I need to learn exact definitions of things since on tests I usually improvise with what I vaguely remember and bullshit my way through and this way of studying helped me a lot. Its a bit of a pain in the ass to make yourself use your breaks to recall boring information but in comparison to spendind 2,3 hours straight just re-reading and ending up mixing up all the information this is way more effective.
1	Study in chunks. 30-45 minutes of studying, then a break of 10 minutes (with an alarm so you go back) doing something completely different.
1	Spaced repetition learning!
5	How do you intentionally study?	I have a hard time studying what I'm assigned to. Especially if I need to take notes or fill something out. I do much better if I care, it seems. Is this an intp thing? \nAlso, anyone have any tips?
7	I'm sorry that I don't have a good answer, but I do know this:  The answer to focus and motivation isn't on reddit.  I've looked everywhere.
2	Find times in which you would normally feel motivated to do shit and just do it then.\n\nOr read a few key points before going to bed, that way your subconscious gets to think about it while you sleep. 
2	I usually just scan over the chapter and terms 10m-1hr before the test. Probably not the best way, but it works for me lol.\n\nStudying languages is a different story though. But since I genuinely love learning languages, actively studying for them isn't such a chore. 
2	why not start caring?  My grades dramatically changed in college when something clicked inside me one day (after a bout of depression), and decided if i'm going to be in college, i might as well maximize my time and do the best that i can (and in turn, learn as much as i can).  Started to sit in front of the class, created my class study notes early, etc...
2	1. Active reading and not passive reading.\n2. Skimming and scanning techniques.\n3. Feynman technique.
2	Depending on what you study, you can find good resources by your learning style. I'm a visual learner, so one thing that really helped me was I would write my notes and pencil in school. Then I come home we write my notes in colorful pen and color code them. I never study him after that because I would always remember them. 
2	If your study material isn’t online I suggest actively moving your laptop/phone/device away from you and studying what’s at hand. Otherwise, I study best with background music, I usually put on a game soundtrack since it’s designed to make you focus. I also parcel out work over a matter of days if I am anticipating a test. 
1	I read the stuff I have to study right before I write my exams.
1	I intentionally don't study...\n\nAt least I'm intentional about it?
1	I don’t, I either know everything already, make educated and calculated guesses, or just bullshit my way through it.

2	You can still be friends with people who you owe money to. In fact, if you owe them it's best to be friendly and remain on their good side IMO. 
2	A true friend will not ask to borrow from you. If they do, and you value the friendship, give it to them as a gift. Old rule: don’t loan money to family or friends. It permanently changes your relationship in a bad way. 
1	No; you don’t know this person. Decide for yourself.

23	Goodbye my good friend	So I had a good friend in high school growing up named Macoy. He and I were extremely different . He was spontaneous and reckless, I was careful and thoughtful. I was analytical and insightful he was simple and efficient. We would always get into some serious shit. Him dragging me along of course. At times it would be bad\n (I almost got stabbed for him once) and other times he would take me hiking and show me a side of me that I’ll never forget. My fascination with the outdoors. It didn’t matter how apprehensive I was about our stupid adventures. He knew I would love it and we’d have a good time. He wasn’t the smartest guy on earth but he did his best and I loved him like a brother.\n\nEventually he enlisted in the navy but still made sure to keep in touch even if he could only write to me a few times a month. He calls me one night and we get to chatting just like old times then he brings something up in an incredibly peculiar way. \n\nMacoy: sooo bruh I’m going to AA now\n\n(He mentioned his drinking habits but never to this extent)\n\nMe: really? Honestly good for you. I kinda wanted to ask about the whole drinking thing. When did you realize you needed help?\n\nMacoy: *in the most nonchalant way possible*\nYknow I blacked out last night and my heart stopped for half a minute.\n\n(I should’ve shown way more concern than I did.)\n\nMe: which dude are you serious?\n\nMacoy: yeah my friend had to get me an ambulance so no more booze.\n\nAt that point I thought I did what I could. He’s going to AA and is a grown man who can deal with his own issues. I told him to give me a call if he felt like picking up the bottle again and that I was always here for him. If I could go back in time I’d smack my older self across the face and tell myself to call him every day to make sure he’s okay. I should’ve reminded him every single day that I’m here and I care about him. I guess he forgot that fact.  That’s probably why they found him hanging from the ceiling yesterday morning. \n\nKnowing that I could’ve done something different hurts like absolute hell. This is probably why I cried when I heard the news. The first time I’ve cried in forever. I can be there for strangers in need on the internet but not for my best friend because I wasn’t in that mindset at the time. It hurts\n\nBut I’m not gonna lay in my own sorrow. That’s the last thing he’d want. I’m a different man from when I last talked with him. I know the value of my words. I need to remain strong and vigilant for people who are at their lowest point. That damn Macoy... teaching me things about myself even from beyond the grave. \n\nIf anyone has something they need to talk about please feel free to shoot me a message. Here, dms whatever. I’ll always be willing to talk with anyone in need. Don’t feel ashamed to ask for help. A lot of us do and usually it’s the exact thing we need. Thanks everyone.
9	That’s some dark shit, but good on you for keeping your head up
4	Been through something similar, you're not alone bud. My only advice is just keep moving forward. 
5	Sorry for your loss, but don't beat yourself up. They have to want to stop and sort themselves out.\n\nYou can lead a horse to water and stroke its throat, but you can't make it drink.
3	Damn.\n
2	I am sorry to hear about that, I know that sounds empty, but I’m sure more people can relate than you know. I have a friend who I know struggles/battles with depression. I spent a lot of time in my life with that person, but had to move on. I hope I never hear that they hurt themselves. Some people fight all the time or try running from something. Possibly why your friend turned to alcohol to medicate, to escape something. It’s so hard cause I think the people that suffer badly (like my friend)with depression need a lifesaver or a motivator most every morning and no one can do that without being dragged down themselves. It must hurt so much to think that you could have done something, but didn’t. Everyone that knew him/loved him feels that to a certain extent. It is a very sad thing.

12	INTP emotions	INTPs aren't emotionally inclined people, but we feel emotions on a much deeper level than other types do. \nWhen it comes to emotions, or when emotion do arise how do you handle it? Like listening to a certain song almost flips that "I need to cry switch" but suppress it. Does that make sense?
10	*HIDE*\nI don't let others see my vulnerable side easily. But when it gets too much for me to hold it on my own, I'd call my friends and let the shit out. Next day I'm better than before.\nAhh yes. That supressing the 'need-to-cry' feeling. Happens all the time. Obviously in my first paragraph, I hate feeling all emotional and feeling human so I bottle it all up till I blow up.\nI imagine my logical self suffocating my emotional side haha.
4	Well, let me tell you something. Emotions are a bitch, but they are also the best we have, literally. Without supportive people around you, facing them can be hard, really hard, but ignoring them has consequences, and they can be dire.\n\nPersonally, I try to be as honest with myself and others as I can, always, emotions included. And who knows where I would be in life if I was able to start doing it sooner. Still have a long way to go.\n\nBut if you're surrounded by people you cannot be your true self around, like fucking crying when you're sad, maybe it's time for a change. You or them, I cannot tell.
4	I'm not sure I agree with the statement, "we feel emotions on a much deeper level than other types do." You're not the first who has written this, either. It makes me think, "How the <bleep> can anyone know how another feels emotions?" Really, I'd say I'm as clueless to the depth another's feelings as I am to their private thoughts at any given moment.\n\nAnyway, I generally don't feel anything strongly... minor ripples in my otherwise calm demeanor. Occasional blips don't last very long - a flash of anger, or momentary elation - but then right back to "equamimity." And when I do exhibit some emotional content, it usually surprises those around me.
3	Hmm. Honestly, there are some days I will sit and navel gaze, wondering if I actually really "like" things, or whether I really "love" the people in my life, or if I am just somehow not capable of feeling certain emotions. But then I stop and realize it's because I'm trying to *feel* with my *head* again, and trying to think through my feelings abstractly as ideas, rather than just *feeling* and  *experiencing* them in the present moment. I believe this is due to the dominant Ti? Getting caught up in meta analysis and thinking about thinking, etc. Which is not how emotions operate at all.  But when I am actually feeling something in the moment, yes I do experience it very deeply and intensely. 
2	We don't feel emotions any deeper than other types. Where does that BS even come from ?\n\nIf anything, we just are experienced at handling it/didn't build a resistance to it.
1	My emotions are released in the gym. I work out hard and I work out alone. Does the job every time <3
1	Define "deeper level". \nAll I see is that people are input output machines that react differently to hormonal stress / produce different hormones. \nI really dont know what deep means.\n\nProbably that out-of-the-brain-stem nostalgia feeling?  Well at least for me... Its been a long time.\n\nWhenever someone connects the words "emotion" and "deep" my brain has an I/O exception. 
1	The last time I allowed myself to really feel my emotions, I became depressed and suicidal. I’m not emotionally capable of handling raw emotions in a healthy manner so I just tend to avoid emotional crap all together. I’ve adopted the attitude of “I’ll deal with it later” and store it away for later after I’ve thought about it. I’m not sure if that’s a function of my depression or if that’s me being an INTP. 
1	When I was younger I'd cry all the time. Everything would make me cry, from missing the bus to handing my school books back in at the end of the year. As I grew older I learned to suppress my emotions, which made people think that I was cold and distant. These days I just try to allow myself to feel something to an appropriate extend. Still, oftentimes my emotions don't really come out until I'm alone and feel save and unwatched.
1	On the "I need to cry switch" I can suppress it long enough to lose an audience. Then I let it run its course.
1	My typical holding pattern is back. I hold back my feelings. \nThey aren't repressed or hidden necessarily, and I feel them when I can, but the experience is uncomfortable. Like vomiting.
1	Don't know about others' emotions, but mine (negative and positive) are very concentrated so to say. Usually I'm quite collected and calm. I can be pretty animated and look like an extrovert when I'm in a good company. Bottled up stuff can indeed burst into anger (i have to keep myself from hitting things or breaking something during such moments), but they are rare and don't last long.\n\nThat "cry switch" can turn on when I'm down and listening to certain music and am in a particular mood, but then it goes back to an off position as quickly as it was set to on.
1	I got a feeling,\nThat you could be feeling,\nA whole lot better then you feel today\nYou say you got a problem,\nwell thats no problem,\nIt's super easy not to feel that way!\n\nWhen you start to get confused because of thoughts in your head,\nDon't feel those feelings!\nHold them in instead\n\nTurn it off, like a light switch\njust go click!\nIt's a cool little Mormon trick!\n\n-The Book of Mormon
1	I’m a very emotionally avoidant person, always ignoring and disregarding my feelings. They don’t matter, if I pay them any mind to them they’ll just hold me back. Everything is bottled up, stored away in the deepest depths of my mind. Very rarely are they exposed to the exterior world, but when they are it can be disastrous. Even the largest and brightest of stars will eventually die. I don’t snap, I explode. Everything that’s been held back is unleashed in one large wave of rage. It strikes like a bomb, and departs like a storm.
1	Oh well, when I sense a random emotional onslaught incoming, I run to my room, lock the door and start listening to songs...for a few hours. Then I'm done,...the emotion has passed and I'm back to being comfortable again. God, I really make efforts to hide my emotions don't I? 
2	College struggle	Hey so I'm 20 F sophomore year of college and I'm having a bit of a mental conflict. I have a pretty hard major (actuarial science) but I actually really enjoy it. The problem is the fact that I live with my older sister who has an easier major (communications) and parties probably about 4-5 times a week and gets mad at me for getting mad at her for constantly waking me up at 2am because of her weekday parties. Being in this environment has been kind of making me feel like crap for not partying and that maybe I shouldnt be wasting my 20s alone studying for probably 4-5 hours a day. I truthfully think I would be pretty content just spending my college days primarily just studying and maybe partying a few nights a month but being around a place where everyone is having so much fun partying makes me feel guilty and boring for not enjoying it as much. Does anyone else ever feel this way?\n\nTLDR: Do you ever feel guilty about not enjoying something that other people enjoy because you feel like you are wrong for not?
3	Ok I’m usually first to tell INTPs to get out there and socialize/be active. But in your case, I think you 100% should not feel guilty. 4-5 nights/week is breakneck. You’re not missing much by only partying a few times a month. Besides, the truly memorable parties only occur about that often (or less) anyway. \n\nPlus, college parties suck. It’s an outright lie that these are supposed to be the best years of your life. You literally have your entire future to party should you wish to. \n\nI too was driven crazy freshman year by my roommates’ social lives and also just wanted to study and do what I was there for. It led to me immediately wanting to live alone. Sleep is absolutely critical, and this living situation is not sustainable at all. 
1	You could join some of your sister's parties. I only feel guilty if I feel missing out has been bad for development or just life energy balance. But you always lose something when you add something. What will you lose?
1	I'm in completely different circumstances, but I can relate to fear of missing out and: \n\n> Do you ever feel guilty about not enjoying something that other people enjoy because you feel like you are wrong for not?

5	INTP seems to be the only personality type that can think logically so yeah Einstein was an INTP.

65	INTP Guide for Life (Warning: this is extremely detailed to the point where you may think that this was made for a robot). This is still ongoing atm. Hopefully this helps whoever wants to read it : )	**People have 4 layers to themselves (even the superhuman geniuses are just humans, at the end of the day). These layers provide the database with which people respond to the world. “They” no longer exists. You're your OWN path. Environment and Genetics can manifest as a personality type, yours is INTP). The body is like a puppet which is controlled by the frontal lobe (which contains the previous 4 layers):** the first layer can be viewed as the universe/soul/consciousness/intent (energy that makes us up). The other layers are our genetic mishaps, genetic predispositions, and environmental influences on the self. Is the intent the same for every person or different? I don’t know yet. Also, is this intent dying off when the person dies? Not sure. Myers briggs personality type (a manifestation of environment and genetics) can dictate how a person generally responds to or reacts to information. It is one tool out of many (not the be all end all). Your personality type is your starting point when you’re born or younger (ex. Level 10 in emotion and level 1 in thinking). As you mature, like levels, you can develop the weaker sides, but you tend to keep the advantage you had when you were born (since you tend to lean more towards that ability). If you really push to be one type of person (of a different personality type), and it becomes a strong habit, you can adapt and give up your original self to change the way you process information (which would just be forcibly managed differently). But, this is going against your own flow of self and will likely lead to issues of mental health, an identity crisis, and more hidden issues and insecurities. It is also very rare for this to happen. Cases where this did are likely to have been mistyped. You can bring up your other processes though. Our functions start from our brains. The first 3 layers can be a manifestation of our frontal lobe. It provides the database through which we respond. Through this knowledge, it should be easier to feel relaxed when faced with larger groups, giving presentations, and having conversations. Look people between the eyes but don’t overdo eye contact depending on the person, so that they aren’t intimidated.\n\n**When speaking to someone I ask the following + I observe their body + I don’t over-help:** (1) How do they make me feel? (2) How would I feel in their exact situation with their values/personality & emotions? (3) What are their intentions and how does our interaction look like from an outer perspective (ex. they/competitively). Also I don’t care if I look embarrassing if it makes me feel right based on my values.(4) Look for specific physiological signs from their shell/body that indicate their mind state, to assist you in 1-3. (5) Not everyone can be helped. Your goal isn’t to save everyone (nor can you). You CAN make a comment to help someone, but it’s not your responsibility. Do what feels right. You also shouldn't put yourself in the scenario to be responsible for ruining someone’s path or self-growth by influencing them too much.\n\n**My personal values & constantly improving bias (religion may or may not be added):** do good when possible for humanity, but don’t bend down for others. You are living your own path; as is everyone else. Chase YOUR OWN ideals. Have 100% confidence in them, but be open to listen to others, holding that idea, then pondering and researching. As much as you aim to unbiased and impartial, your biases WILL affect your own views (even if by a bit). All you aim for is to shave as much bias as possible from them while understanding that you are innately imperfect. In this sense, all views are imperfect. For example, when someone claims you are escaping when they are doing the same through others’ views. In this case, you are unravelling the secrets of yourself and the world.\n\n**Thoughts can be manifested into reality, perception can change, and “you”(your soul/consciousness) is merely your perception of everything you do (a collection of information). “You” are an ego, and your view of the world changes your perception of it.** It also bends how people around you act to accommodate that different perception. When your perception changes (through your life experiences, philosophies, and learning of the world), it’s like becoming an entirely new person. The more you learn, the more your thoughts and perception change; along with the world around you (think of a continual dream that you can control with certain set parameters). Even when you die, it’s merely a change in perception and potentially experiencing stillness (ex. regardless of an afterlife or not). Be cognizant to know your bottom lines so that you won't be coerced to cross certain lines through manipulations of your desire to grow (ex. cults, drugs etc.). You can never do be able to experience everything in the world. Therefore, you can never reach the peak of perception. So, only experiencing the things at least somewhat willing to do (you can go out of your comfort zone, but don't foolishly harm yourself mentally or physically for a "new experience"). Take breaks to digest information and cut-off your ability to new receive information to a low level so that you can process the current info. During this time, minimize over-thinking in day-to-day life, and maximize efficiency, relaxation, and absorbing the overload of information at hand. You’re just a bunch of experiences that are constantly changing and making "you".\n\n**Solutions for an INTP and emotional views (12+ solutions to function better, dealing with insecurities, theory of bottled emotions and transferring those emotions like energy).** *When someone close is making a decision based off of emotion or just stating something without asking, ONLY give them advice based off of logical reasoning when their choice might have SERIOUS repercussions (towards you or them). OR, you can also do this if an emotional person is asking for your logical advice (meaning they likely want your usually logical point of view). Also, for the close people you bring in, you have to trust them not to change from life or your inner self/emotions (DON’T say I don’t...but…), and also aim to bring everyone up with you at the same time instead of having envy/jealousy) (be authentic and honest and don’t be insecure about being misunderstood because it isn’t your issue. Tell them to ask and be honest if they have one). You must be realistic with hope, and look at what you CAN manage to do, and not what others think would be good for you to do, or the infinite amount of things that you can’t do. Maximize your inner INTP. write you thoughts down. Organize them and make your manifesto. be willing to listen to emotions of those you care about even if you don’t give a shit about their emotions, and also explain yourself concisely when needed. Keep close friends of different types; as long as you’ve analyzed for a while that they have good intentions. AVOID friends who only throw emotions at you and don’t reciprocate or who ONLY take. Address all emotions; big or small. Lose the ego but STAND UP FOR YOURSELF for your views and for your people (imagine your ego as a self-awareness that exists outside of you that you can choose to ignore when necessary).  Even in front of those not close to you, hold your value/morals that you created previously (and are still growing). Work deeply to understand the values that others have on an EMOTIONAL level. Let emotional people be emotional, and keep going along your own path. If a person is wrong in what they’re saying, don’t be angry at them, just kindly reword what they’re saying in the correct manner to yourself so they don’t influence your thoughts through programming you. Small talk allows you to profile people, feel out their personality and emotions, and share energy with them (honing your social skills). BE HONEST AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. To do so, do the things that will not be against your values (when possible) so that you have to hide the least things.* You build a view and have sensitivities and your emotions correspond to those views and reactions to those who don’t agree with them; even if they’re based off of insecurities. It’s up to you whether or not you want these views to be delusional or not and how stably they can last long term; along with how close they are to reality. ADDRESS EMOTIONS through your creative outlets (ex. music, art, writing etc.). Forgive others (for self-peace and growth) but don’t forget. Acknowledge their flaws and work around them or ignore them, and grow from your rough experiences with them. Also, HELP others who are in NEED or in their last straw. However, if they use their bad situation to guilt trip you or to get something out of you, then alarm bells should start ringing; they could be a sociopath and/or manipulator.\n\n**End goal vs path**: It’s not about the end goal but the path. The end goal is a bonus. Happiness with the current situation is best while aiming for goals for the path. You will experience & grow.\n\n**Individual Power (IMPACT), I AM and WANT, and being in Society means law compromises:** Our sole existence can cause a butterfly effect that changes humanity in ways people would have otherwise never known. Therefore, if you don’t like work, don’t let this discourage you. Leave some form of impact (even if it's just a book or a drawing) for your own self-peace before passing. Say I" am and I want" with regards to what happens in your life (outside of truly helpless situations where you need to adapt). NOT “I am not” and “I need”. It makes you see things differently. Aim to be happy with the current situation and aim for realistic goals in your path. I AM responsible for my decisions, despite what the world brings (as it is a guest in my own world). This also applies to society. If you accept living in society, even if you disagree with certain aspects of the society, you can’t completely ignore the universal rules because it is moral to be punished if you accept living in this society; unless you want to live with the wolves. Similarly, for smaller regulations or loopholes, those depend on your own world view, circumstances, and if you are willing to undertake the consequences (ex. jay-walking). But, for some universal rules, even if you don’t act on them, you can still have differing viewpoints on them. Similarly, this ONLY applies to laws, NOT to societal views of how things should be done.\n\n**JUST DO IT! (Do vs think) DON’T BE SCARED! BE IN THE MOMENT (activate your Te to be efficient and put all the possibilities aside to address that specific problem). If you don’t put in the work, then it will never be actualized (never will exist). Aim to THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX when approaching these problems (especially in the moment):** *force yourself to do something you don’t want to by looking at the negative outcomes that can come from you not doing that certain thing. In life, it is possible to make no mistakes and still lose. Don’t be discouraged. Accept the consequences and go forth for progress. Hardship sharpens your senses. When you or those you care for are in danger or need help, don’t care about being embarrassed about being wrong or being lazy, just react calmly about the best options available. Turn off your emotions to the max for that period of time and use an outlet to deal with those emotions later when they resurface. DON’T LEAVE TABS OPEN OR FILES HANGING. Read or complete them. STOP BEING FOOLISH. Nothing in your head can compare to the real thing and living it. Every “insignificant” decision you make changes the path of your reality (think of a story-line video game).* When your mind says “meh, I’ll do it later” this is an indication to do it then and there. Compile information up to a certain point, then just go for it. In life, you can’t just live in your head, or nothing will happen. You have to act for them to be realized. Accept that you can lose, but it’s okay. Compare every decision you make and its results to the worst thing that has ever happened to you and use that to push yourself. However, “just do it” means for foolish fears, avoidance, or for reactionary scenarios where calmness is needed. Be smart in what you choose to do (this comes from experience, and following the other pieces of advice for yourself).If you don’t do things now, they’ll only get WORSE later. Be aware when you are in the grip of your childish comfort, move don't be stagnant. Be less critical and more responsible with your wants/goals. Stop being insecure about hurting other people's feelings (only consider friends and family).\n\n**Growth in vulnerability (learn insecurities, embarrassment/awkwardness is just a voice):** allow yourself to be vulnerable to others and to grow from times of pain and hurt from having been vulnerable despite your time spent observing & deciding on the person. Through this vulnerability, learn of your insecurities, and don’t be embarrassed to be too straightforward to close people. Embarrassment/awkwardness is just an environmentally conditioned voice in your head. *As you learn new things, don't hate yourself for not having known, appreciate yourself for now knowing.* Use your theories and apply them in the real world to change and grow as a person.\n\n**Your Shell/Body (understand it, don’t let your shell pull you down in your enjoyment of life, and enjoy it): Even when your shell isn’t the greatest, still seek the opportunities necessary and grow your shell as you seek these opportunities. Waiting until your shell is at its peak is foolish. Also, medical check-ups are IMPORTANT. Don’t push them aside.** In relationships, to ensure long-term success, don’t overreach but don’t under-reach outside of your shell beyond 2 points. When your shell is in peak shape, you can live longer (higher chances), smell better, have more energy to function, and your options for perceptive experiences for your shell become better. It also stops you from experiencing depression or being pulled down by it. When exercising, use pain from the past as a "super power" to lift weights at maximal effort or to push for that extra rep (it can be a great outlet for stress and emotions). Focusing on mind and getting into that "free flowing state" while exercising regularly has tremendous benefits to your every day mentality.\n\n**DON’T go on monologues with random groups of people (unless they’re close and care for you). Even then, DON’T overdo it. Take TIME before talking about ANYTHING. Online, exceptions can be made. Make sure the things you question are USEFUL & RELEVANT:** *you need to not randomly lose yourself and say pointless things in conversations. GO WITH THE FLOW (usually).* online, you can still change the flow of conversation and randomly interrupt. However, be aware that you could be kicked, so only do it where staying doesn’t matter. Use that energy for writing essays in your own works. You can be honest and want to vent, but you don’t need to tell people everything or try to get a reaction out of them. Otherwise, monologues are unproductive and not communicative. You also don’t need to respond to rude or emotional people. They’re not worth your time. They want a reaction. With friends, instead, you need LISTEN and then you MAY vent. Your works are your best bet for telling people how you feel, OR, really close friends. When you don’t do this, and try disproving or hurting others through monologues, this can lead to pointless conflicts and disharmony  (and eventually groups turning on you due to your monologues becoming annoying, unproductive, or potentially calling our their fears/insecurities).\n\nB**e straightforward in person outside of complex conversation, and chaotic and complicated in works and/or folders:**  You don’t need to always be so complicated and chaotic. At times, you can just aim to be straightforward. Allow yourself to be chaotic in your work and in your files. In person, you can be straightforward and simple; unless in a conversation with a complex topic. *Work on communicating complex thoughts in a simple manner.*\n\n**See all the options, be logical, know that nothing is definite, everything is infinite, things can be approached in infinite ways, and aim to understand the “WHY” and to be objective (default Ti mode). FOCUSING is also your strong suit. Ti can be a veil to logically break down potential negative intentions of others. Be aware of them for your safety, but don’t be controlled by them:** You are a natural theorizer. Be efficient with the things you theorize as they are best when they are applicable. To be logical, you need to know that you’re never 100% right, be willing to admit that you're wrong, think a lot in order to fully learn something, be willing to grow, and be willing to see all the options up until it comes time to act. Facts and emotions also SHOULDN’T MIX. Don’t be emotionally invested in logical conversation. Others can be right. Seek to understand. It is necessary to be objective with science and facts. Apply your ability for creating or inventing entirely new systems, models and theories. Also be aware of the complex logical model of the world in your mind. Use your strength and abilities to focus on the things that you need to get done.\n\n**Making a mental note of everything around you before going back into your head (extraverted sensing). Take note to “experience” things at least briefly. To describe that feeling, it's similar to a caffeine rush and hyper-awareness:** analyze the the world around you and BE IN THE MOMENT to profile your surroundings and see “in the moment solutions” and experience the current moment. Then, you can go back to being in your head. Experiencing things allows you to make better conclusions about your theories and grow them as well. *While "in the moment", you may get a bit too engaged in interesting or controversial topics of discussion. In these cases, DON’T TRUST ANY STRANGER with sensitive information (it's possible to accidentally slip). Be willing to listen, be open, and bounce ideas and EXCHANGE ENERGY in conversations. However, don’t be in your head. FOCUS in the moment. BE AWARE of signs they give out. Don’t take gifts/items from others in the moment without FULLY CHECKING and dealing with all unknowns (ex. are they close, are they known to use them as leverage, is it sincere etc.).*\n\n**Adopt real life perspectives of your viewpoints:** As INTPs, we can see the logical implication of scenarios THEORETICALLY and want to be heard to feel good about ourselves. But, our lack of ability to see the real life perspectives (ex. emotional or potential deeper practical layers) is a BIG blind-spot. To make this theoretical POV into an applicable one so that theoretical becomes practical naturally, *we have to CONTINUALLY HONE our senses.* Otherwise, we will remain fools. We will think that we are the main characters and that everyone around us is dumb. *For example, you might say “you should consider this” to someone else regarding an obvious solution to an issue that they're facing (as if they didn’t already consider it). In reality, it's likely that they've considered, yet actively chose to be like that (unless you viewpoint is ground-breaking).* Adopting a real life perspective would make you a more open person than you already are. You need to see the logical and objective long term implications of mistakes while also being able to see the practical applications through your own experiences,  conversations, and practical or critical research.\n\n**You don’t need to have just one identity/character if you can still be authentic and truthful as well as the same person with everyone, and not actively choose to take on that character to compensate for something else:** I have come to realize that the not-one-track-way-of-being is already the real identity of many INTPs. Kind of a meta-identity or a super-identity. You can put on a character a decide that you like it despite being outside of that character. This means that the character you choose cannot fully represent the entire "you". However, through the other points, look for insecurities, in order to make sure that this character isn’t just a way to compensate for something unfulfilled.\n\n**Don’t force your view on others:** Provide proof for your logic, but *be aware that some people will always think differently. You shouldn't tell people what to do. You show them what they can do and then you tell them "the choice is yours".*\n\n**If you work or study indoors, force yourself to go out at least a few times a week and get some fresh air and work on your communication skills:** exhaustion and insomnia can be a results of depression, screens from devices, lying down too much, escaping reality, and avoiding progress. *Staying indoors too much when trying to work on yourself is also counterproductive because you’re slipping through and not working on communication skills.*\n\n**Develop your default mode for certain days (worst case):** When you're feeling down or tired, this would be a bare minimum gay (ex. don't eat over this amount, exercise for 5-10 mins, or at least sleep this amount etc.)
87	Look, I'm sure you mean well, but we INTPs will never read all this. 
27	A lot of good stuff here, but don't forget the importance of brevity.\n\nThis might be better organized as 4-7 separate topical INTP posts with a table of contents. This is 3600 words, \~15 minutes of reading.\n\nI also can't tell if you're hoping to start a dialogue about these topics, or publish a monologue. The wall of text discourages dialogue in most cases.\n\nThe messages you've included here resonate with my healthy experiences as an INTP, its good content, just some cleaner formatting for Reddit consumption.\n\n&#x200B;
18	Omg where are the bullet points?
16	You topic jump from personality typing, to physical, to emotional, back to physical, to social, back to emotional, back to personality typing.\n\nCategorize and summarize your information for better audience retention.
16	Too long, didn't read.
2	I read through everything. (Although i joked about not read it in one of the comment)\n\nIts good and i can trace everything you mentioned to my own mental model of the world.\n\nExcept for the four layers part, i don't where you pluck that from.\n\nEach part need revision though. A lot of folks here probably can't relate to where you are coming for each idea. (I could, except 4 layers).\n\nKudos brother(sister?, from another mother).
2	I object to the implicit suggestion here that living in society in a way that fits in and isn't disruptive is valuable for its own sake.\n\nIf I'm logically sound, that's all the communication skill I need.  If others don't understand, that's on them.  I am 100% not responsible for their sloppy inferences.\n\nFurthermore, your advice to "just do it" is, I think, terrible advice.  Every bad decision I have ever made was made because I didn't take the time necessary to think it through.  Every one.\n\nEmotions don't matter outside the head of the person experiencing them.  My emotions don't matter outside my head; your emotions don't matter outside your head.  It is foolish to try to take other people's emotions into account, because we can't ever actually know how other people feel, or why.  Let your emotions inform your decisions, but leave other people's emotions alone.
2	Thanks for taking the time to share this. I agree with other that formatting and proofing would make this post a bit easier to read. I'm new to this sub and have been amazed at how blunt people are. It's sorta refreshing. I added to this post maybe 5x but couldn't commit to how my voice sounds. If someone is having trouble understanding the "just do it" method here's a perfect example.  Sure I could do more, but this is what you get, and that's better than nothing.
2	I don't like reading, in fact, I've read less than five (non-academic) books throughout my life.\n\nI love knowledge, but I prefer brevity over verbosity.
2	I read it halfway but then I got bored and decided to read the other half later (or maybe just wait for someone else to summarize it)
2	Yeah, you also gotta sell it to us! If we are gonna be using this much brain power and time to go through this, how do we know it's worthy of it and credible information? \n\n\nGet that out of the way first, then a lot more people will read it, especially us analytical types 
1	Damn - thanks for the good read.
1	What have you been eating/drinking ? Though the subject seemed promising, you lost me about 1/3 in. I do like a decent rant and I am more than able to read longer texts, but I didn't see much which made me as an INTP hungry to read all of it, sorry dude
1	I would love to read it, but after scrolling tru erm... maybe not. \n\nMaybe be efficient in your post next time? Bullet points, short sentences and not a chunk of paragraph. \n\nWe INTP have a lot to do. So yea too long, didn’t read.
1	Should be separate post, or at least, formatted.\n\n* This is possible \n\n***\n\nSo are separations
1	This is 10/10 "bare minimum gay" 
1	Thank you friend. 
1	Believe it or not, most of this is instinct and growingly understood with a sense of self. That is to say it comes quite natural, until it doesn’t...
0	doubt ur intp. the focus here is simplyfication. run it over 10 100. times and ull reach symbols. clear definitions. like a basic math problem.  \n\ni suggest u stufy more neuroscience. as some of ur concepts become redundant
3	Gap year	Did any of you take a gap year after high school and if so what are some recommendations to do? Also, do you regret it?
5	I took basically a gap year to focus on myself as a person, if you can consider it one. I dropped out of HS and began going to GED classes. I worked various odd jobs, retail, roofing, electrical. I earned my GED and then I got in contact with a local lab. I began shadowing researchers at the lab, then I started interning at said lab. Being in an academic environment allowed me to realize what I wanted to do, and what I didn’t want to do. I didn’t want to work min wage jobs and I didn’t want to be a laborer. \n\nWorking at the lab allowed me to realize my passion and that was research and medicine. I was all the more excited to start college and I am currently excelling and I have the passion to do well that I never had in HS.\n\nHope this helps!
2	I've taken a very unconventional path through education up to this point, which hasn't reached HS graduation yet, but I plan to take a gap year
2	I didn't have a gap year and it would never have crossed my mind or my parent's, but if I had taken one then maybe I would have matured way more quickly and not wasted 8 years at university within a bubble that doesn't help you become an adult at all. So I'd say unless you are very sure what you want to do in life (profession wise or if you're aiming for an elite school or something)  or have some other circumstances that keep you locked in place, the life experience and perspective you get from a gap year is infinitely more valuable than going to study immediately (if at all).
2	I would say yes but only under specific circumstances. I'd definitely be careful as a gap year can turn into many years quite easily. I took a gap year after highschool due to a death in my family and that gap year turned into 3 years, going on my fourth now due to some crazy shit going down and my life falling apart. Now I'm left with no financial support and the promise of college has faded and earning the money and moving towards that goal is fully on my shoulders. It turned out to be a huge lesson in responsibility and I know I'll come out on top of it. If you have the means and support to attend right now, I'd definitely consider taking that opportunity as you never known what tomorrow might hold and whether or not that opportunity will still exist. I think a gap year can be very positive for self reflection, growth, and figuring out what you want to do. If you decide to do it, have some goals set to complete during the year and try not to invest 100% of your time with friends as they'll leave you in the dust. Ideally, have a job and some source of income and try to save up a bit. It'll definitely come in handy. Additionally, be sure to keep your mind sharp as time away from school can dull the mind and be sure to keep your eyes opened for opportunities that can better you as a person. If you do that, you'll be just fine. Also, you might consider taking some classes at a community college that way you aren't taking $40k/yr in student loans. Two years at community college will get you an associates degree which is marketable for a fourth of the price and you'll be able to transfer to a four year school seamlessly while seriously cutting down on overall debt after you get your bachelor's if you're taking that route. It's all about financial security and preparing yourself for full independence and autonomousity over your own life. Also, definitely don't get any credit cards lol. Sorry for the rant, hope this helped. 
5	How did your pull your act together?	Any 'bounce-back' stories would really help me at the moment...
7	My parents sent me to boarding school when I was 13. I hate it there, cz I feel like I cannot express myself truly. \n\nI got the teen angst going on, I love emo/punk rock music. I hate everyone around me. I wasn’t making any friends cz they don’t like the kind of music I listen to, n I thought they were all lame n boring. \n\nAfter 2 years there, I was quite depressed. Everyone have their own circle of friends to eat and hang out with after class and I’m all alone.\n\nI realised “Shit, this IS my current reality. I’m gna be in this place for my whole teenage life. And if I’m gna be like this throughout, I’m gna have shit teenage memories. \n\nNo, I don’t want this to happen. I want to have awesome teenage memories. I’m gna do crazy things, fun things, there must be something here that i can learn and pick up skills... maybe I can start by being friendly to the people around me..” :)\n\nThat’s when I start to greet my friends in the morning, walking to school positively and trying to be helpful around the campus. \n\nThey realised I have a change of attitude towards things, and positive words spread too. \n\nTL;DR: take a step back, and see if this is the kind of reality you want to be in, what would you do differently? What positive change can you start doing today? :)
4	1. I let pain be my teacher(in a good way). Hedonistic tendency seem to prevent me from looking at the big picture.\n2. I focus on how things transition(the progress/journey) instead of just end results(facts). \n3. I re-anchor my emotion to my self-efficacy in real-time all the time.(using self awareness)\n4. I use kaizen(incremental improvement) instead focusing on too much on end goals.\n5. I don't stress myself when things dont go the way I want it, instead I focus on "what I can do next quickly", and what principle I can absorb from the event.\n6. Certain things follow a sequence. I acknowledge it, and don't fight too much around it.
4	Can't bounce back until you hit rock bottom
2	I just watch Something funny. or listen to music while i do something to occupy my mind.
2	It's important to try to move forward every day or as often as you can. You don't have to make a big positive change in your life. But do your best to get out of bed, go to work/school on time, cook/eat meals regularly, sleep, etc. Life sucks sometimes, but eventually it will suck less. It might even be good, and getting there will feel great.
4	Allow yourself time. If something caused you pain, that will take time to mend. Some things will never mend fully, and the amount of time needed will be different for everyone, but I've learned that it's very important to allow yourself to face whatever it is that's causing you pain. Finding something to occupy your mind is good too, but don't push it too hard, because rushing into new things to get over something bad by repressing it is only going to lead to a worse situation, eventually. 
1	I dunno if this counts as "bounce-back" but I dabbled with mindfulness briefly. Lots of deep breathing and asking yourself how you are right now, in the present moment. (suppresses gag)\n\n*however* from that half-meditative, quasi-bhuddist, mumbo-jumbo, I extracted an integral INTP pillar of comfort/universal truth\n\nTransience. \n\nNothing is permanent.\n\nEven the worst thing that can be imagined or experienced will meet its end.\n\nMay you find the peace you seek, then move on 'coz it's too boring. \n\nSo too is peace impermanent.
1	I review facts and use them to execute good actions.
88	How to combat loneliness and your desire for an SO?	As of late I've being feeling rather hopeless (more so than usual), and have been yearning to simply be understood, as none within my immediate  (or even my outer) circle have ever - in my 25 years of existence - met this "need". I have an exceptionally good set of friends, and family that I know love me pretty much unconditionally. But none of it feels as though it's enough. \n\nIdeally I'd like for this desire to be fulfilled by a romantic partner, but after crunching some (most probably questionable) numbers, I've come to accept that the chances of that ever happening are less than slight; INTx, mostly drawn to / understood by (based on experience) other NT types, and strictly attracted to other females, the sum of which is 0.5 - 1% (adding some leeway).\n\nI am unequivocally doomed. \n\nOn top of it all I'm such a misanthrope, that I'll scarcely go out of my way to meet new people because most of them sorely disappoint. So I've been biding my time with distractions, which sometimes helps, but overall does nothing to sate that lingering want for someone to just "get" it.\n\nBeing a bit of nihilist tw\*t doesn't really help anything. \n\nWhat do you guys do in the face of perpetual loneliness? I'm not quite ready to off myself just yet lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm female (25, UK - if any of you are in or around London, hit me up!). Not that it's too relevant, it's just some of you folk are calling me brother / sir / etc, and because I'm dumb as sh\*t, I can't tell whether it's in jest or if you actually think I have a penis. Either way, let it be known!\n\nEDIT 2.0: I feel like a touch of context here may help some what, as a lot of the comments received (which I'm grateful for) are saying the same things.\n\nI'm not short of distractions or hobbies. My solitary pursuits which I engage in at least once a week are, going to the gym (x5), boxing (x1), Krav Maga (x1), this week I'm starting bouldering (x1), I read substantially, and I go for aimless walks.\n\nI see one of my closest friends almost daily, the other at least once a week (I have friends outside these two that I see as well), I spend time with my family often as well (the kids of which make me momentarily happy).\n\nI have a normal 9 - 5 that keeps me busy as well, though it's not the most challenging work, it suffices, and I mesh really well with the team I'm in. \n\nI'm not socially awkward and do know how to communicate with others; vocally and in writing. Though I may sometimes come off abrupt and blunt, as I don't sugar coat things, and see things objectively in a way that others view as robotic (I'm sure you can all relate!), and though I look to be a tad more sensitive in that regard, it's not something I'm open to changing significantly; if you can't accept basic and logical truths, then it's highly unlikely I'll want to be with you, so it's not something I'm going to hide. \n\nNor am I looking to someone else to make me happy or to fulfill me. I know that's internal and can't be accomplished externally.\n\nI'm no Giselle, but I don't believe I'm ugly either (if you're curious and bothered enough - I've posted a link to my current face / state in comments below (ITS A SEPTUM PIERCING, NOT A BOGEY - STORY OF MY LIFE) nor fat or obese. A few have mentioned this, and though I acknowledge I may not be everyone's cup of tea, some do think me to be worthy of their advances (mostly men - shoot me, please).\n\nI know the above reads as though I have all the answers and that I think I'm perfect and that everyone else is the issue; far from it. I have my flaws, and I have things I need to work on. But for the most part, I have myself and my sh*t together. \n\nI just would really like for someone to understand me on all wavelengths, accept me, and also fancy me as much as I do them.\n\n.... Suppose I'll place my order for a bajillion cats now.\n\n*meow*
33	I hate to not have a solution to this problem, but I am in the same boat as you. This has been on my mind a lot recently.\n\nThis is a good post, let us hope someone wields some form of answer.\n\nBest of luck fellow analyst
17	I bake delicious things, play with my cats, tinker with projects in the basement (financial and energy budget permitting), go for walks in the woods or find old towns within a day's drive to explore (weather permitting), and sometimes wander into antiques or used book stores with no expectation of buying anything.  It helps that I do actually have some good friends and a job that, while exhausting, is nevertheless a good job with some interesting co-workers.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm doomed at relationships at this point, myself.  But that doesn't mean one shouldn't try to make the most of what's left.  I mean, it isn't enough for me, either.  But that doesn't mean you can't do some stuff to make it *less* not-enough.\n\nIn theory, develop some hobbies and interests that are intrinsically social, and do those because you intrinsically like them rather than because you hope to meet someone through them.  In practice, I haven't found that to work, but your mileage will likely vary based on geography.\n\nDon't get too bogged down in MBTI types.  MBTI is a useful enough tool for some things, but it's nowhere near a complete description of everything relevant about any given individual.  I think Bill Nye said something like, everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.  Put your natural curiosity to work and develop an interest in finding out whatever that is -- and if you haven't *got* any natural curiosity, I'm afraid the problem is you.
7	I'm 43 INFJ female and when I found my 47 INTP man that was it. We've been inseparable ever since.\nI looked up the rarity of our types and immediately started calling him my Unicorn.\n\nBoth of us had messed up relationships and kids with other people while waiting to find each other. When you're ready to get married and start a family sometimes you pick from the less than ideal mates that are available at the time. \nBesides MBTI wasn't around so much back in our day. We didn't even know why we were weird or what we were looking for.\n\nWhile I don't reccomend that path, my point is that it's well worth it when you find the Unicorn that gets you. Even if it takes close to 50 years. Hang in there. You'll know it when you meet one.
15	You’re probably not gonna like this but it’s the truth. You are actively looking for an excuse not to try because you don’t want to see how bad you are at it. It’s obvious in your number crunching. Notice how you stoped as soon as you you saw 1%-0.5% not even considering the fact that there are over 7 billion fucking people in this world and 1% is close to around 70 million (guesstimating because my phone calculator doesn’t reach billions and I’m lazy). That means by your logic there are around 70 million people who are compatible with you but you can’t be bothered to look because “people are sorely disappointing”. \n\nBullshit excuse\n\nYou’re smart. If you really want a girl then you have to be brutally honest about yourself and your insecurities. Practice talking to girls every day until you’re used to approaching them. Go at your own pace. Relish the small victories (hey I just got her to smile awww yeah!) Soon enough you’ll get bored of that and take it a step further then eventually bam! You’re a catch! Don’t sell yourself short man! Learn something new about yourself every day! Pay attention! Put some effort into it and you’ll make it happen in time! If you really want it you’ll take the Ls until you’re there. If you can’t give it two seconds of thought because you’re scared to even open your eyes then you didn’t really deserve it anyways. Good luck
6	Wish I knew, friend. Best of luck.
5	This is one of the many other things that led me to split the brain and the mind into 2 separate, but linked concepts.  My primal brain seeks a partner (because it is programed so) and would like some of the feel-good-chemicals.\nMy mind on the other hand acknowledges that love is nothing more than a primal programmed instinct, created by basic chemicals with the sole goal of perpetuating our species. \nEven so i wonder, why would i deny myself such chemicals. Especially since i am a nihilist and i do not believe in any ulimate purpose or meanings, i would like to make my time in this shitshow of a world as pain free as possible. \nBut with this in mind i wonder, could i ever even experience love properly? Its like playing a horror game vs running away from a monster in a dark forest in real life. Sure it gives you the scares, but at the end of the day you know its just a game, you know how it works, thus it can never reach the magnitude of the real thing.\nNow i decided that i do not necesarily want love, i want company. Someone who is able to understand and relate to my views and my logical aproach to everything. Someone who also acknowledges the futility of love and procreation in a meaningless existance. Someone who i can happily share my life with, with the possible feelings of love that may arise being only a nice bonus, for we are both aware of what it is and why it is.\nHowever this is so very unlikely, especially since i do not desire this enough to go and try to meet people. I am not necesarily a misanthrope, but i sure do not enjoy human interaction. I was always more at home with my own mind, observing what is around me.\n\nI do not thing there is any hope for us. (Sidenote, i believe hope is just the human mind refusing the truth in a pathetic attempt to defy reality)
5	>What do you guys do in the face of perpetual loneliness?\n\n30, F. For the past 10 years I have always had a partner, always lived with someone whether family or housemates or partner, always had something or things to occupy my time. Even among them, I felt lonely. Then I tried counseling, yes I paid someone to talk to me, and I felt understood. Then I moved on to exercise, I paid to get to know myself better. Now I am reading, to understand how the greats reached "enlightenment" so I can provide for my needs more independently.\n\nAlso, toys.
4	There is a very interesting talk from a Belgian professor ([https://www.universiteitvanvlaanderen.be/college/waarom-vinden-slimme-vrouwen-geen-nieuw-lief/](https://www.universiteitvanvlaanderen.be/college/waarom-vinden-slimme-vrouwen-geen-nieuw-lief/)) about the partner market sociologically.\n\n1. It's easier to find a partner when you are young because you see people with the same level of education as you.\n2. Your attractiveness = Appearance + Age + Income + Situation (no kid is more attractive for men)\n3. Men are looking for a woman who has a lower income or is less educated. Highly educated boys are very fast out of the dating market.\n\nMy solution: Smart and educated INTP women could reverse the role and become the highly educated part of the couple who takes care of men with lower income or less educated. It would be necessary to find someone open to change. I think most men and women are blocked in the old patriarchal system. What do you think?
5	As one INTP to another, I wanted to stay completely single as to prevent divorce rape/kids being taken. However, my ENFJ fiancé found me on Facebook, messaged me, and practically adopted me into the relationship. From what I know about MBTI and cognitive functions, you're best bet would be to find an ENFJ or an ENTJ and I'll explain why. ENFJ: I only suggest this pairing due to circumstances of my current relationship. She's too nice, can be too affectionate at times but mostly pays attention to my need for space and privacy, absolute sexual compatability, soft spoken, can get caught in the moment if your words aren't well articulated simplistically therefore easy to mold intellect, and they will always make sure you're comfortable. ENTJ: has each corresponding opposite function to match your function stack i.e. Ti->Te Ne->Ni etc. They correlate well through functions to help complete you. For instance, INTP's prefer to receive an enjoyable experience through Si child whereas an ENTJ likes to give an enjoyable experience through Se child. Good luck and I hope this helps.

3	Probably have to conform to society's standards of a female. Stupid maybe but you have to look like a flower to attract bees. 
5	Who says we’re strictly attracted to NT types? My last SO was an FJ and we got along really well, you gotta empathize with different peoples points of view 
2	Attraction, dating, relationships, its all just set of skills.  Its tough break through and learn for some people because of the potential embarrassment involved in learning.  Or they have no idea where or how to start working on it.  But it's very much possible for anyone to become proficient at it.  \n\nInstead of giving into the self-defeating attitude, why not give yourself 3 months of serious study and practice before you pass judgement on yourself?  Aside from the occasional "ask a girl out" moment, i bet you never really worked on it, like you would a video game or whatever other hobby.  \n\nThis feeling will always be with you if you never resolve it, and i don't want you to eventually go the incel route fellow intp\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
2	I'm right there with you brother at age 29. So, I would love an ENTJ woman, I dont know if you like that type of partner but the message still applies. Become bait for what you want to attract. The ENTJ woman is most likely a high earner, ambitious type like a doctor, lawyer, or business woman. Spend your time improving yourself in that direction. For me, the things that would attract an ENTJ are things I should be doing anyway, getting an education, reading more, working out, improving health, style, hygiene and skin care, vocabulary. As INTP's were in a better position than other types in that we can force ourselves to do things if it's the most logical route. \n\nJust become bait for what you want to attract, I know its hard because we dont do anything unless we have to. All you have to do now is convince yourself that you have to!
2	Accept your decision and stick to it. I know rejection hurts the most, I’ve been there. I mostly worry about my career, making my parents happy and trying to make a difference for people by helping them in whatever way I can. There are days when it gets really hard and I have depressive phases but I pull through it somehow with video games and binge eating. It’s all about distractions and the lies you tell yourself,not here to preach of course but things will definitely change if people like us magically gain high self esteem and actually try to connect with people. 
2	For me the best way to combat this feeling is to be happy with who you are, you will have to spend the rest of your life with yourself so better make the best of it, if you don't like yourself, chance are other also won't. \n\nBut don't loose hope, I think the best way to find someone nowadays is to be introduced to someone by a friend or family and avoid stuff like tinder, be very picky on who you even consider and you can also search online be yourself and honest, find someone that can love you for what you are. \n\nIf you are able to also consider long time travel, it seems to me it's always easier to meet people when traveling. 
2	[deleted]
2	Intp here, in the same boat as you but it doesn't really bother me as much after I found a passion that I could pursue with all the willpower I can muster. Something about having a love for something that is always there, eg. Art, music, design, writing.. makes the journey a lot easier. People will come and go, but I've found myself to not notice as much as long as the passions I delve into daily are there waiting for any free time I have. Don't know if this can help you, but it helped me find peace with my solitude and in the end has made me meet people who are closer to me in the way they think than I ever have before.
2	If you're attractive and have developed some charisma or interests you'll have a good chance of meeting somebody. If you're overweight, ugly and difficult you most probably won't find the same level of success. I don't think you've factored that in to your life equation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing female will give you more chance of success and you probably should try internet dating and include the INTP reference if it's that important to you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently ENTJ is an ideal match and ESTJ is also a good match so that brings your chances up higher too.
2	You sound like a very fit person. I bet you didn’t get there overnight. It took awhile to build that cardio fitness, those muscles, and skills. I believe your happiness is the same way. You’re not going to magically get happy. You can start each day by reminding yourself of the things you’re grateful for like your family, and friends, and health, the ability to travel and not be trapped like so many others. You’re trapped in your own head, but you can get out, but it’s not going to happen overnight. You’re going to need to tell yourself that you’re happy just like you tell yourself to go to the gym. \n\nI’m 40 so while I have more years to ponder over these things than you, I’m also single, so I have 15 less years to find “the one”. It crosses my mind, but I choose to live in the here and now. In my 20s I had some really great relationships that all crashed very hard for one reason or another. I also lost a shit ton of money, more than I have these days, and I work a very cushy job. But, it made me a better person. I was so carefree in my 30s. I just didn’t give a fuck. And, I don’t mean that in an angry bad way. I didn’t give a fuck in that I could smile every day, enjoyed people’s company, and helped others out. I just wasn’t concerned about any one person or thing. Water off a duck’s back. I worked, played, climbed mountains, and sailed the harbors. \n\nThen two years ago I met someone I liked. I still didn’t give a fuck but something insidious happened. One day I realized I completely fell for this person. It just got worse every day. I became concerned for this person’s wellbeing, their happiness, and I changed aspects of myself to take care of this person. Alas, I was living a lie. The person would never feel the same way for me but I kept fooling myself, kept ignoring the obvious signs. When it rains it pours. I was going into surgery a few weeks ago and came to the realization that I was just another person, second tier in the grand scheme of things and it threw me for a loop. I’m better now. I remind myself every day how fortunate I am, and you know what?  I really truly feel better every day. This person who would mean the world to me is slowly fading back into the background, and I’ll be back to my I don’t give a fuck self again soon enough. \n\nThis whole magical significant other thing is a conjuring of our own making. We give it power. Is love great?  Absolutely!  But don’t pin your hopes and dreams on finding that which is not in your control. Focus on yourself. \n\nAnd, I’ll probably get a lot of hate and down votes for this, but if you’re really suicidal and want to end it, don’t go out with a whimper and OD or shoot yourself or something like that. Make yourself great and tackle an impossible dream. Scale an icy mountain peak in the winter. You’ve already taken the first step by bouldering. Take up trad climbing next. Sail across the world. Race across the desert. You have the youth, energy, and it looks like money. Challenge yourself physically and mentally and throw everything you’ve got at your impossible goal. You’ll either succeed and experience joys you can’t imagine now, or if you die in the process, at least you’ll go out with a bang and not a whimper. \n\nOh, I have been lost at sea with my mom with waves crashing down on us and the boat ultimately sank. I’ve had guns pointed at me many, many times and shot at too. I’ve also sat through a lightning storm and been struck while on a mountain face. I always thought I’d be brave, but every time I faced death I always realized I wanted to live very very much. Hope you find some peace.
2	Combat it by dating ad nauseum until you find the 1 percent. 300 dates will on average yield 1 to 3 matches based on what you have said. Of course, this is also based on the presupposition that a relationship with someone outside the NT type is doomed to fail. I am not convinced that this is necessarily true. \n\nHuman beings are social creatures, we have made it this far as a species in large part due to our tribalistic tendencies. I dont want the loneliness to go away, it serves as a grim reminder that this life is not meant to be faced alone. The loneliness motivates me to take action. It has been hard but I have felt love before and I will feel it again if I have something to say about it.\n\nDon't give up hope. I haven't and never will. 
4	You're being dramatic. It might take a while, but you'll find a babe. \n\nIn the mean time, if you don't mind, it doesn't matter. Mind over matter.
1	Sounds like you know you need relationships in life especially with a SO, the longer you leave it the harder it is to explain why you have been single so long and the less experience you will have, excuses will only exasperate the problem. 
1	Eww. No.
1	>the sum of which is 0.5 - 1% (adding some leeway). I am unequivocally doomed.\n\nI know this may have been for dramatic effect, but it's not like we have to meet people on a completely random basis. We can engage in communities that are more likely to draw in compatible / like-minded people. And with ways to meet people online that meet our criteria, the odds aren't really that bad, especially if you're only 25.\n\nBut I understand the frustration of waiting to find he relationship you want -- because really, those magic connections aren't predictable or controllable. I feel it too and we just have to keep living and finding out more about ourselves and we will understand more about our path and what we're looking for and how to find it.
1	I had also given up at your age. I had accepted it and had decided I wasn't even going to try. That was 3 years ago. A year later I had met someone (INFJ), online, out of the blue. She has since moved from the USA to the Netherlands, where I live.\n\nI got lucky, though. I didn't have to actively look for a partner, and I think that's the hardest part for most people of our type. But there are websites that help you find someone. I would consider signing up for one (or multiple) of those, if I were you. Unless there's something physically wrong with you, you are almost certainly going to find someone eventually, as long as you look. And regardless, your brain is your best part anyway. There is always hope.
1	Focus on what you like about your life and what you find fun. Loneliness and despair are not good for attracting anyone apart from lonely and desperate people.  \n\nYou really can't look for another to make you happy.  Learn to be happy and the right person will turn up.
1	Get in and stay in a close and unhappy relationship for the rest of your life.

1	I’m a guy and I feel ya. This is what I said today on an ask Reddit post. Kinda sums it up for me: I just had the epiphany at that moment I saw the post and typed it.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/apjph9/comment/eg9vlup?st=JS1JT9YL&sh=80c93338
1	Hi, miss DevelopmentallychallengedDepressive.\n\nPlz be wary of taking MBTI as gospel. It is loads of fun, but spotty science at best.\n\nWith that in mind, why restrict yourself to the NT types? We are often boring AF (no harm intended XD), and, anyway, the perfect pairing for INTPs is supposed to be INFJs from what I've seen. Granted, those are even rarer, but the bigger the whole pie, the better. And who knows who else you can find interesting, here or IRL, but, in general, the N types are supposed to be the most open to experience and maybe the most likely to enjoy your own quirkiness, or your gifts. And to have things you'll appreciate too.\n\nI dunno, though, don't restrict yourself just based on 4 fucking letters for which the scientific consensus is basically "meh". I do keep it in mind, TBH, and I want to meet one of those mythical INFJs one day (who might just be the same as introverted highly sensitive persons, HSP).\n\nBut be wary of digging your own grave in your mind, thinking you'll be forever alone. I'm beginning to learn myself things like that can easily be self-fulfilling prophecies. Take care.
1	    I am a F INTP 21 and I don’t think you should give up hope yet. I’m not attracted to women romantically most of the time but I have a bestfriend who is an INTJ F. \n   INTPs are notorious for being INTJ magnets and I feel like I know why now. We were both going to school for production and met eachother then about 5 years ago. At the very beginning I thought she was an attention whore with bitchy tendencies and she thought I was stuck up with a major case of RBF. That was just for a little while and then we became best friends but we call ourselves platonic soulmates. You know when you just really click with someone and you just know you guys are riding the same vibration and all of that? \n    I feel like we get along so well because we will usually come to the same conclusion about things but get to those conclusions different ways. We are always wanting to hear about how the others mind works about things. We bond through our shared passions and interest. We analyze things together a lot for fun. She is extremely intelligent and I learn a lot from her and love whenever I get to school her things myself. When we get together we are constantly coming up with ideas and theories about things. We are a little in love with eachother and at the end of the day if neither of our relationships ever workout I know that I will live a happy life with her where we just fuck shit up together and love our cats like children until we die. \n   So maybe try and find someone who is passionate about the same things you enjoy? If you meet someone at place centered around that interest you’ve already probably got a lot in common with a lot of the people there. Iv also got an INTP bf But honestly I didn’t use him as my example because I think my Platonic soulmate just gets me a little more and maybe thats because we are both women and have that shared experience together? I value that a lot and I really hope that you can find someone to be yourself with. 
1	I just give up.
1	Learn to be comfortable and content with yourself. This is a tired cliché by now but it's true: If you aren't happy outside of a relationship then you won't be happy in one.\n\nIt's a cruel irony that the thing that will attract a partner is the same thing that makes you okay with not having one. You have to work on yourself and be willing to take life as it comes. When you're happy/content your barriers will come down and you'll naturally attract someone who meshes with you.\n\nPursue activities that interest you. Develop a skill. Join a club. Practice conscientious bettering of yourself. When you engage with the things that make you happy you'll stop worrying about finding a significant other and become much more appealing to any potential significant others in the process.
1	I don't know if it will be relevant (and forgive my poor english, frog eater here) as it's based on my own experience.  \nI think that you can overcome loneliness by chatting with as many people as possible. And I'm not talking about real-life discussion and meeting new people but using apps / internet. When you're chatting with someone, you know pretty fast if the other person is interesting enough or not. From the answer and how the discussion goes you can tell a lot. Why do I talk about it? Because you mentioned there are only 0.5/1% of people matching your criteria. By browsing through a lot of people you will increase your chance to find the other one. And even if it's not a future SO, sometimes you just meet people you get along very well.   \nIt may take a lot of time and not produce results as fast as we want, but sometimes it happens. Met a girl online, we chatted once in a while until we realized we were both attracted to each other since the first words, three years ago.    \nAlso: it looks like my little sister (21),  bisexual and INTP, does love to use apps to get into people. 
1	This is a very common story, and the only thing I can think of that acts as a quick fix, is busying yourself so much that you have no time to think. It’s what is “working” for me. I can’t guarantee that this will reduce the loneliness, but it helps you feel a little more fulfilled. As an INTP myself, I know it’s hard to get started on something by yourself, but forcing yourself to try something new works. About that need to be understood part, meet more people, and find an outlet, something creative that you can do just to get your body doing something 
1	FWIW you don't necessarily need a partner that understands you deeply, just someone who accepts you deeply. After all you're trying to fulfill an emotional need, not an intellectual one, as I'm sure you can find plenty of guy-friends to do that with.\n\nSo really, while still difficult, the statistics aren't as grim as you make them out to be.
1	As a gay intp guy, I relate to this so much. So, so very much. :/
1	I was going to say that 25 and my "quarter-life crisis" was intensely bad, and reassure you that it gets better, and yes, I still want to do that. It does get better, but slowly and inconsistently. I feel like ups and downs go in four to five year cycles for me. I've been noticing this trend since I was fifteen, and it has persisted. I would say though that even though we all probably have midweek crises, midmonth crises, and midyear crises, and possibly this strange four year crisis pattern, one of the worst in most peoples' lives is the quarter life crisis. It was for me and I know it has been for other people I've talked to and add you to the statistics, and yea it's a phenomenon. Someone should do some surveys and find out the statistics, but yea. At 30 now and still uncertain and worried about shit, but definitely have a lot more direction and hope now than I did then. 
1	Life is a skill not a talent. Your giving up with out even trying. Get out be and yourself, be vunerable and grow as a person. Or don't. But you see what that's got you. 
1	Same boat, 26 uk, however I'm self aware enough to know I'm not actually going out and socializing so I feel like that's the main reason,  (because its both boring and anxiety)\nI'll just chill till I come across someone I like A lot.\n\nmaybe go to social hobbies, I've alway wanted to start climbing or something to meet people, but never been im sure you know the feeling
1	Honestly, I do it through strings of mindless and meaningless sex. Not the healthiest way but it works
1	Work on your text game. Here's a good guide: \n\nhttps://www.girlschase.com/content/14-simple-ways-text-girl-and-make-her-want-you\n\nI found love when I stopped looking. Just be your regular awesome self. Befriend a female if you can, or ask a sister/cousin for help.\n\nBe honest about your anxiety or inexperience. \n\nThere are tons of girls out there that are lonely and want exactly what you want. Post an honest profile to tinder in a small search area, see what bites.\n\n Use the text guide to escalate to meeting in person, and try for physical contact with your match. Discuss your sexuality and emotions openly. (Don't be a downer) 
1	[deleted]
1	You said you are about 25ish? One thing I can say is that my needs and attitudes definitely changed a lot after 30. It's around this age you will start to really develop those weaker traits and become more open and interested in other personality types as well. I'm pretty content accepting my partner for who they are, and not needing them to exactly match my way of thinking so much. I'm more interested now in the different things a partner brings to the relationship and how I can learn from their strengths. \n\nBut I know, being INTP is often very weird and lonely in your teens and 20s... I went through most of my life never meeting another one, and believing I was just odd and that I would never find anyone who thought like I did. I suppose we can be prone to nihilism for this reason, which can become all consuming if we are not careful. 
1	This speaks to me on some levels. I'm a 21/INTP/gay female and was thinking just today with a smartphone in my hand of how actually depressing it is to swipe people on tinder and realise that I crush (in the traditional sense, which would make me want pursue a relationship) once a 384985 years. And I hate this. I also crush on people and abstract things in a platonic way; I'm a big weirdo in that regard.\n\nThe funniest thing is that I love people. Especially those are on the same so to say wavelength as I am. And even having some good friends and family, lately I've been understanding more and more how much I crave a relationship. But as you've written in one of the replies here, it's all or nothing for me too - I don't want to embark on a relationship that has only, say, a sexual aspect to it, or if I'm not into the person generally.\n\nConcerning distractions - I have some as well. I actually need them or else my mind would go crazy because of overthinking (it actually does anyway ha h a). I'm very very into music (playing/listening/composing), that's literally one of the most important things in my life. I also draw, and endeared by art and its various forms in general. Love digging up some new information and accumulate some that interests me. What I'm trying to say with all of this is that self-development may be the best distraction from a nagging thought that you don't have a partner right now; heck, it's actually a great way to prepare yourself to provide the best self once you'll meet someone. And it's a nice thing by itself as well; it's also nice to know that you've worked on yourself to mold a better version on yourself. That's quite liberating actually.\n\nSo maybe my advice would be just to immerse yourself in some passion, or thing you thoroughly enjoy. Or maybe try to find one.
1	Okay, um... "Singularly Improbable"? 
1	Hello! As your resident subreddit ENTP, I'm here with facts to tell you that you're doing it wrong.  \nFirst, ENTPs comprise approximately 2% of the female population. INTPs comprise approximately 1% of the population. ENTJ and INTJ both comprise approximately 2 and 1% of the female population, respectively. That gives you around 6% of females. So odds are, you date 20 people, one of them is likely to be an NT. Kwitcherbitchin! I'm personally only compatible long term with INTPs and prefer males, so I'm not saying it's an awesome statistic, but you aren't hopeless.  \n\n\nBefore realizing that MBTI can be a predictor for successful relationship connections of all kinds, I knew that my mental type was 'geeky'. What I have learned since then is that NTs are inexplicably drawn to 'geeky' things. Ergo, you may wish to look into the scientific community, anime fans, comic enthusiasts, trekkies, Renaissance 'reenactments'/faires, and other such mentally stimulated groups, as they are over-represented within these groups. I have met plenty of lesbian and omnisexual individuals in this fashion. The first key is knowing what you're looking for. You do, great! So now where do you find them? In those places listed above. Unconventional, I know, but it works.  \n\n\nNext, how not to feel lonely? You need extroverts. ENTPs are great! We can be flighty at times, but you just put forth a little effort to get our attention and we'll be flitting over your way in no time! Fascinate us and we'll want to spend all kinds of time with you! I have an INTP I call between 0 and 15 times a week. It kinda depends on what's going on, if I have news, extra time, etc. He lives alone on a mountain and doesn't mind the chatter, banter, and updates.  \n\n\nNow, not wanting someone to 'make you happy' is great, as statistically, NT to NT relationships have the lowest satisfaction rating. Honestly, I think it's because we analyze everything and don't gloss over the parts we don't like. Awareness may alter the satisfaction rating, but I digress! People are flawed and highly individual. Value the person you have in all their special snowflakeness when you have them. There is no other 'them'. If you're valuing a person just because they're your person, you're doing it wrong and wasting everyone's time.  \n\n\nOk, hope this helped, gotta actually do some work now, k bai!!!!

1	Approach someone
1	Feelings on poetry?	My encounter with this subreddit so far has proven to me that the image of INTPs as hard scientists without any artistic expression is pretty bunk. That said, what are some of your opinions on this very floaty corner of writing? I enjoy a good portion of the stuff that came out of British and American romanticism but I haven't encountered many in general who think about poetry beyond the image conjured up by 50s beatniks. Maybe it will be easier in this narrower room.
1	I don't like poetry. In school I was forced to interpret the meaning of poems and I always interpreted stuff that made sense or didn't interpret anything at all because nothing made sense. The teacher always blamed me for my "wrong interpretations" and said that some random bs was the correct interpretation. One day I asked the teacher why we interpret poems, like it's obviously pointless and the teacher wasn't even able to answer my question. So to me poems are literarilly one of the most unnecessary things I've ever heard about.
1	I like poetry but I hate reading poetry. Just keeps your poems to yourself -  I will do the same.
1	Never liked poetry. Or English literature where you worship an author/classic novel and try interpret bs. “How he used the colour blue to signify a moody vibe” shut the fuck up you pretentious rat 🐀 
1	I like John Keats. I've written a few poems for self-expression but I'm proud of them. I appreciate poems that are easy to appreciate. I despise the modern poetry scene where supply greatly exceeds demand and every poem that gets into a respected journal has to be about flaunting how uncriticizably messed up your life is. Also hate the use of poetic whitespace and anything that encourages poetry to be catered to or more accessible to snobs.\n\nOverall my interest in poetry is only slight.
1	I have an Intp friend who loves poetry, but i don't. idk if it's type related
1	Idk man I took a poetry class. It kinda fun if you have a big vocabulary. If you find writing exercises those can sometimes be fun. Intp are often seen as the cold logical body of reasoning but I think poetry is a way for us to connect our subconscious which is often overshadowed as our minds are racing so fast it never stops and thinks about why we thought that or underlying meaning. Poetry is cool poets are posers
1	Poetry can be cool sometimes.  I am the other way around from what you describe; I am an INFP who is very math and science-y.
8	Is loneliness a common trait amongst INTPs?	
11	It's a common trait for every human being. But I suppose it is more felt with people in our spectrum.
4	Loneliness and being alone are two very different things. A lot of people are afraid of being alone because the mind is kinda forced to look at itself and that can be scary for people. It’s an amazing thing for introspection but that also means you see the terrible parts of yourself. Maybe you’re a little envious, maybe you’re insecure, maybe you have a negative outlook on life and only being people down. You realize these things way quicker when you’re in solitude because there’s no judgements of others telling you how to feel about yourself. That’s why people hate solitude and desperately need it at the same time. They may actually see their own flaws and need to work it out instead of only having the judgements which you can cherry pick depending on which one you believe. Spend time alone my friends. Be brutally honest with yourselves. Honesty is the fastest path to fixing problems especially your own. Oh and take it easy on yourselves :). You’ll need some serious self love if you wanna do this.
4	I used to get super lonely. Then I moved and made friends and now I wish I was alone... careful what you wish for 🤔
3	Thank you for the kind words. Something I realized about our type is that we LOVE hearing the technical details of everything. It acts as a driving force to do the things we are told will help us. I like to think of certain quotes and how they are interpreted. \n\nYou’ll start realizing people like Ghandi and Michael Jackson’s\n “man in the mirror” pretty much told the same lesson. Make sure you practice the qualities you wish to see from other people. Thats why I try and reduce the net suffering of this world. Lead by example. Improve yourself on your terms (not how others tell you to). \n\nI’m articulate and detailed in this sub because I know these types of people and how understanding something so deeply is how they integrate it into their mindset. Some types like doing something because it makes them feel compassionate. Intps like to do things because we like to explore intricate and complicated processes. So I treat everything like that. A process to be understood. Because of that mindset everything in life is interesting. \nThanks again :)
2	I would say the effects of loneliness are worse because many intps do not take care of themselves well, but overall intp are probably less bothered by it because we live in our heads
1	Im not lonely, I’m alone.  Different things
1	alone but not lonely! having a wild party in my head
1	yes. autism tends to avoid an oversensorial stimulating world. and people who think a lot differently
41	(Define INTP for 400) What is “feeling apprehensive when posting to an online forum?”	
44	My post to discard ratio is about 1:100
18	Thinking of a response, typing it out, deciding my to post, coming up with an idea, Retyping it out, then either posting it after 30 minutes of edits, or discarding it after all that
16	Fear of putting yourself out there and getting no affirmation, as my words are like an extension of me, and I don’t like feeling rejected by the world.\n\nI would cringe very hard at myself when I typed super long thoughtful (to myself maybe) posts but got no response. Or worse, rude rebuff/ retaliations. Thank god for the stories and views function in Instagram/ Facebook/ Whatsapp/ all other social media platforms, so I can post and not feel like a fool for putting myself out there. 
10	I dont feel apprehensive at all. I just proof read It 1000 times.
6	Being hesitant to make a post or comment
5	It’s hard to feel like my words matter or I get caught up in the feeling that my words mean something different to everyone else :/
3	I feel like I can be the most extraverted online. I only get anxious about it if I've said something angry/controversial and then people are getting angry at me in return, and then I wish I hadn't said it.
3	i just don't want to make redundant posts, but i don't mind asking simple questions.
3	Same reason why posts on r/anxiety get a bunch of upvotes yet barely any comments.
3	Oh my god guys.. reading these comments!! It's really insane how similar our minds work. Also, we're probably missing out on some good content because it gets deleted right away after typing. On the other hand, we're probably filtering out a lot of bullshit too. Sooo... try harder but also great job!!
3	Finally, Press These Buttons When You Want Sex	
5	Really stupid idea.\n\nTo me it looks like something a cucks girlfriend or wife would make him get so she doesn’t have to keep rejecting him in person.\n\nThis button has already been invented and its called the cell phone
1	Fun. Might work.
1	This is ridiculous.\n\nIf you can't handle being verbally rejected for sex, and you have to hide your sexual desire for fear of this, then maybe you shouldn't be in a relationship. I wouldn't want to be in one where it's that much of an issue.
1	I feel like this belongs here	
2	New discord server starting out on reddit	Hey guys- Would be great if y’all could check out my mbti and enneagram server!\nhttps://discord.gg/X9tjaFz\n
3	Whats the male/female ratio
442	How chaotic is your mind/thoughts?	
81	I'm in constant denial of one aspect of myself while also in constant denial in attempting changing that.
107	Im optimistically pessimistic and arrogantly humble. Just a clusterfuck of ideas that are constantly contradicting themselves.
45	1 minute I’m the most optimistic person in the world, proud and lucky to be living...\n\nThe next I get a dreaded feeling that this is all for nothing and nothing even matters.
29	Pretty chaotic. One minute I wanna help the world the other I realise I have the potential to be a serial killer. (I don't obviously too much work and I'll obviously leave clues)\n\nSometimes I'm too good for someone and the other times I realise what a shitty person I am, what do people see in me? And it's the second one which makes me overthink stuff but at the same time it makes me realise that humans are nothing but alone. We are the weirdest social animals given how much we think. No one will ever know what you truly are, not even yourself.\n\nIt's almost like I'm always high, except without the happy parts. Constant thoughts on everything. The most frustrating thing is the inability to organise them for others to understand, or sometimes even me. Just like this answer xP\n\nBut I like the way I am. I am pretty anxious on the social part where for some reason I constantly think about how much I'm missing out, I wish I had different kind of friends if I knew something or had more money. It's a little egoistic to say but this chaos in my head really sets me apart and makes me feel better than everyone else.\n\nBut what other thing I don't like is that I don't take an effort in organising my chaotic thoughts. Atleast not the way I should be. I thought of writing a diary but I'm too lazy to write. I know these thoughts, if a certain number of them were contained and followed through I would be really content in life. Not only content some of these stuff would be honestly groundbreaking base for research. This is a stretch tho, I'm pretty sure others are capable of thinking this.\n\nI love learning but don't invest the propper time in it. It's a little hard considering how distracting my environment is. But at the end of the day it's these things which make me feel good about life.\n\nIt's so weird how I can talk about stuff I constantly think about online but literally no one in real life would understand, even if I am texting. I think it's the aspect of me just laying out my thoughts without anyone interrupting. 
17	The problem is that damn Ti-Si loop. We dive deep into a topic with our Ti and it rewards us with Si (this is why it’s so satisfying to figure things out Ti and Si are linked). It’s like drugs. The first hit (your first epiphany when diving deep on a topic) feels amazing and you want more of that so you keep taking more hits (diving even deeper) but the payoff gets worse and worse then viola! \n\nOverthinking.  Chaos. Bad times all around.\n\nI think what we should do is learn when to stop. Like in a casino you wanna leave with the most money so you gotta determine when you’re at your highest point then call it a day. I personally share my findings with reddit to break the Ti-Si loop and it works wonders.  Thoughts?

9	I'm such an extreme person, it's very obnoxious. \n\nI either don't give a shit or I'm heavily invested.\n\n I think I'm inferior to most people yet believe I'm more capable than most. \n\nBelieves that no one wants to bother with yet believes most people aren't really people but NPCs. \n\nWant to be an expert on so many topics yet too lazy to do the work thus making it a waste of whatever time I spent thinking about the topic. \n\nBeing very nice, nonconfrontational and meek to most while in reality am a sarcastic blunt asshole. \n\nWanting to be known as a smartass yet wanting to hide the fact that I am\n\nThere's many more but yeah
7	INTP + ADHD.\nIt's a 4d roller coaster for me. 
4	>Chaotic\n\nChow mein?
5	It's only chaotic when you try to convert the multidimensional thoughts into a serial data stream to convey to others.  It's why analogies work so well - they transfer the hard-to-serialize structures in an efficient and easy to understand manner.
3	That looks about right. 
3	Paranoid
3	That but rolling
2	Yea, but the part of the highway that is straight and goes on forever, with one onramp, no offramps, and one lane.
2	I don't necessarily think that repeating this connotation is healthy. Although it is obviously true at times, I don't think spreading this sort of message helps provide an environment where our personality can flourish. \n\nI understand, as most of us do, that all thoughts can be chaotic, self-destructive, powerful, and dizzying. But in order to escape the sort of disaster that some think of it as, we need to challenge our assumptions and discover that this really isn't the case. I think the assumption pictured above is very popular because it pulls from everyone's negative experiences of their own personality. But continually spreading leads to more negative and chaotic thinking. \n\nIf we start to spread the positive aspects and feats that we are capable we have no idea the kind of community and masterpieces that we can create, together. \n\n
2	Ah I see you also play Cities Skylines. 
1	Yep
1	Used to be so much worse.  It can be helped.
1	Nah.
1	Total chaos and overthinking just make it worst.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then if you don't think/overthink how do you make the right decision? 
1	This is my brain every night as I try to fall asleep and all the weird stuff pops into my head. 
1	I started a new anxiety med a few months back so it's not quite that bad anymore. The intrusive thoughts are gone, at least.
1	yeah usually its a goddamn disaster. Always thinking of every possible outcome and course of action within my understanding of something, and then panicking when them the one outcome I hadn’t prepared for creeps up.
1	Jumping to conclusion on a friend's personality (sorting relationships), distancing myself from friend by assuming they're in the wrong for acting in ways I don't agree with, feeling lonely and misunderstood, realizing that I'm probably overthinking that aspect and people are people, rinse, repeat.
1	Grotesque yet efficient 
1	Ya know, that seems accurate. Let’s go with that. It all makes sense at first you see, all neat and orderly. But then all the thoughts converge into one huge mental clusterfuck of ideas.
1	There are three things.\n\n1. There is this drive to understand everything and put a label on it it order to understand stuff, when really I can’t do that at all. Noke of us can. Nothing is just black and white. Everything has gray areas. I struggle to accept this sometimes. \n\n2. I am multifaceted and I get angry about that fact that I don’t know myself or who I am, and I get even more angry when I feel like I am the only person going through this. Words and nouns aren’t enough to describe me. Sigh \n\n3. I am so stuck in my head that it is hard for me to articulate myself and I get frustrated that I can’t do it, because if I COULD do it, maybe I’d be understood by someone a little better \n\nEven writing this is hard because I am being forced to separate these 3 large parts of myself into different subjects in order for others to understand 
1	Just bad as Brazilian corruption
1	Hey maybe I was talking about the stringed instrument. You never know...
1	I frequently find myself using the ocean as a comparable metaphor (to myself) where the body of water represents my thoughts and the surface being my emotional response- and half the time I'm just trying to stay afloat and the other half I am somewhere in the deep trying to find the surface. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
1	Yes.
1	Yes
1	Most of the time my ideas tend to contradict my beliefs, which tends to obfuscate the poor individual who attempts to have a conversation with me. My anxiety also results in me overthinking things so there's that. 
1	At least i am not the only one.
1	The key is playing with categorization. Just remember categorizations are malleable according to the "interest group".\n\nTaxonomy and grouping is the key.
1	I'm still not totally sure if I'm an INTP, INTJ, or INFJ, but my mind is all over the damn place.\n\nIt's like I have a broken sense of self. I always do my best whenever possible, and I see people making mistakes, missing important bits of info, or saying things that I know dont fully get the point they wanted across, and I get told that I'm doing very well, but I also see that I'm extremely quiet most of the time.\n\nI try to push myself and be more open, confident, direct, and engaging, but it seems like it falls flat. I recently got told I come off intimidating, which freaks me out because I hate the idea of being that kind of scary intimidating person, but I cant help knowing what I know, and always knowing what my and my team's next move should be, or important thing we should be discussing and getting ahead of. It's usually the right thing, and people always seem open to discussions, but I constantly worry that I'm overreaching and making a fool of myself when it doesnt work, even if it's just later finding out that noone else had anything to say and what I thought was a failure was actually just sort of okay. It's like I have no mechanism in me to go "yes, I'm right god damn it". If noone else enthusiastically agrees with me, there was probably a better way to go about the conversation.\n\nBasically, I'm constantly fighting with knowing if I smart and capable and full of life, and having the full ability to engage people and bring out incredible deep ideas and dreams in everyone around me, or if I'm just being pitied and "managed" so that people dont have to hear about the relentless big things I think we should be dealing with, or that they're all just worried I'm going to snap or something.\n\nEven worse, is I constantly want to reach out and tell people "look, I'm just trying to figure out how to be a person, if you could just not get afraid of talking to me for a few minutes, we could have a big deep soul-finding conversation and you could know I have nothing but good intent and great ideas", but I dont do that because it's weird and comes off clingy, and I dont want to look unhinged or anything, but I just have such fast moving, high aspirations that I just get antsy if I'm not constantly pushing myself.\n\nEven now, I realize that this post is *way* too long to be "normal", but I just really need to get out some complex thoughts. I very regularly cant tell if I need to talk to a therapist, or I just need better friends who like talking about the same stuff I want to talk about and need to stop trying to focus so much on work even though its the only major challenge I have right now.
1	You mother fuckers get that life is a skill not a talent, right?
1	I can't really think anymore so, still pretty fucking cluttered. I just have 0 control over it now (thought I had no control before, NOW I know what 0 control is like). I want it to be over so badly
1	Chaotic. Constant battles within yourself. Even when debating with other, you pitch out points then you notice your lacking points so counter your own opinions THEN counter that counter UNTIL you end up debating with yourself, your rival being forgotten.
1	It's actually pretty straightforward. I think. It might be that I'm so used to its chaos that I've gotten really good at further breaking it down into comprehensible bites. On the other hand, this could just be me assuming I think like this because that's how others of this personality think and it would make logical sense that I do too. I could just be finding things that aren't quite related but can be conflated rather easily if you don't think for long enough about it. Like a horoscopes (at least I think that's what they're called) kind of thing. But this, of course could also just be evidence that my mind is in constant chaos and conflict. After all, I can quite often write really long posts about the most minute details. Sometimes I really do wonder if I make it interesting to read or if it's just a drag to get through. Probably the latter, but this could *also* be me having gotten so used to the chaotic mess that is my writing. \n\nSo, yes. No.. Nyos? Nyos.
1	Hey, it’s Spaghetti Junction!
1	Not really. My mind's voice likes to blabber a lot though. When I pull the reins in though, my thoughts are mostly straight forward
1	I’m old for this sub (36). I’ve been meditating for almost 20 years.  These days my mind is not chaotic and my thoughts are well aligned with each other.\n\nI strongly associate racing thoughts with misery, and I can’t recommend enough to fellow intps to tame the beast with meditation.
1	Naaa na na na na na na na, Katamari Damacy
1	INTJ here, and you're not alone...
1	Its constantly screaming at every choice I make.
1	I overanalyze myself so much and it drives me crazy to the point where I dont have time or energy to do anything else.
1	I'm actually struggling right now with the clarity to write an answer to this. I see it as more like this in my mind.\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/x8Cc8RnQ/typewriter-jammed-letter-keys.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/x8Cc8RnQ/typewriter-jammed-letter-keys.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's at this moment you are liable to be called slow by one finger typists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	A hurricane of random memes / thoughts / really weird stuff.
1	Messy, but perfectly kept.
1	It's not really a train wreck it's more of a highway taking 90° turns every 200ft
3	How do you do friends?	Hi there, I am curious about how you people do friends, because I'm not great at them. I will explain how my friendships have developed over the years and am very interested in how you have experienced this.\n\n\nI am a 23 year old male (or so they tell me) and I've never had a big group of friends, which most of you might identify with. Until I was about 9 I mostly played with kids a year or two younger than me, being the "leader" and staging adventures or making up plays. I didn't have a big problem making friends but wasn't very outgoing, I also got mad easily when other kids teased me. \n\n\nThen when I was around 9 I got a best friend. I've always been someone to cling to one other person, in this case a boy with the same name as me who spouted a constant stream of interesting facts. He would be the last actually interesting friend for some time. I also really got into girls (damn them). I'm not bad at talking to people and presenting myself so I've always had girlfriends, to whom I often got closer and shared more of my inner-self than with my friends.\n\nAfter fact-fountain I got a best friend who was a lot more of a do-er, quite extroverted, oldest of 7 others, their house was mainly a place you could do anything but also had to expect to lose your stuff. After that I got a nerdy friend again, sadly this one was more into wargames and punching my shoulder when I'd tease him. And after that the best-friend-spot was taken by another extrovert who wasn't super interesting and called my theatre group my "dance recital", but I gave him shit right back and I knew what he was worth as a friend. So much so that I wasn't surprised when he wound up sleeping with my girlfriend at the time, at least he was honest about it immediately. \n\nThis is, I'm about 16 at this point, where I enter my first friend-group. They were awful. I was adopted by an extrovert but the others were a guy who thought that a girl making eye contact with him meant she wanted his children and another one who came from a broken home and had pedophilic tendencies. They were my friends for about 4 years, we got into weed together and that passed most of the time. Then they accused me of stealing (which I hadn't done) and I decided to end all contact with them after that point. \n\nAnd then, after high school and a year of failing to be motivated by software engineering, I felt lonely. I was always one to think "people, they're a bunch of bastards." but not being around any that I found interesting made me realise I like company. I followed my girlfriend to her study of contemporary art where I met tonnes of open-minded, interesting people with amazing ideas. \n\n\nBut still I find it difficult to want to go meet them. They all seem to genuinely enjoy social interactions, going to parties every week and meeting up. They enjoy social talk which I find painful and uninteresting in most cases. I mostly sit at home or walk outside, I like working on my art and discussing things with my girlfriend. And I like doing that with a few other people, but I can't connect to them. I don't feel like I can actually give myself and open up to them, even when I tell them about myself and listen to them telling about themselves. I don't like the open-endedness of friendships, I never know when to suggest meeting up and forget about them for two weeks.  I honestly would find it easier to have three more relationships than maintain two good friendships. But it does make me sad thinking about how I won't grow old with people, they won't know later how I am now. \n\n\nSo I guess questions I have are how do people who identify with this maintain their friendships/motivate themselves to do so, and what is this difference you experience between friendship and relationship?
3	And a follow up question: Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other 5?
1	This might sound cold but my friends are ranked by how much I trust them (ie how unfiltered I can be around them) as well as how much time I want to spend with them.  Additionally, I usually have different friends available for different activities depending on their interests and personalities.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable around your friends, keep looking out for ones that you can be more of yourself with.
1	I feel pretty much the very same. I have a lot of... well, acquaintances, for lack of a better term - but hardly any real friends. I just don't connect with the vast majority of people I ever meet and I find almost all conversations they strike up to be quite frankly boring and devoid of substance. Tbh I'm almost always much, much more comfortable doing things I like on my own, without being forced to engage in awkward social etiquette with people I truthfully care little about, however harsh that may sound. 
1	I don't "friend" well. I live by what I was taught years ago by my Zen master, just before I was ordained by him, "Be friendly to all, but friend to none." Seems harsh, but it suits me, since I've never had "close" friendships growing up. 
213	Hahaha	
11	So is resting bitch face a common symptom of the INTP?

78	Agree/Disagree?: I don't remember facts, I remember systems	I just had this thought and I was wondering how much of this aspect of myself is INTP related. \n\nBasically, ask me a question about something I was told last week... uhhh... idk. It's a crapshoot if I remember it. \n\nAsk me a question about why something is the way it is, I can tell you easily since that's all about relative interaction and system based decision making. I can apply a logic template to things easily, even if they're not strictly "logical". (IE, the most simple and effective solution) \n\nBasically, most things in life follow their own system/logic and as long as I have visibility on the whole process or a good chunk of it, remembering the way any one thing works is easy. \n\nBut, remembering a single data point in isolation is basically impossible unless I just happen to recall that time that I learned it randomly. \n\nAnyone else feel they work this way? (To be clear, I'm referencing work related things here, but I'm interested in any other insight fellow INTPs can offer. Remembering history works the same way for me. I can't remember what year columbus sailed the ocean blue even with a rhyme since I don't know shit about spanish colonial times. But I'm sure I could remember if I made sure to learn about the country and time period.)
23	The big picture. Pretty elementary to INTP.
10	Problem with sentences and logic is you can only deliver information in piecemeal.\n\nIf you think in system, it is very easy to get misunderstood all the time.\n\nNeed finesse when explaining.
8	To me everything is just a system that I need to figure out. It makes all the SJ's in my life frustrated because they are always looking for concrete results, whereas if I find I can finish a project later because I know how to do it, that in itself is a success
3	Yes. But I remember minutiae too.
3	Absolutely agree. Studying for my qualifying biology exam became much easier once I started studying the "biological systems" instead of trying to memorize random facts about them.
3	Premed student here, 3rd year. While I haven't chosen this field by myself (but that's another story) and I have almost zero interest in biology or anything related to, I somehow manage to be in the first 10-20% of my year. \n\n\nFirst year was hell. It implied a lot of rote memorization - see anatomy and biochemistry. It didn't help that the profs weren't really interested in making it a bit more logical. Somehow, I have managed to be in top 25% of my year back then... I must mention that unlike the stereotypical INTP, I can be hard working. But memorization still doesn't fit me. I struggled a lot with learning and having some other problems unrelated to my studies didn't make things better. I liked cell biology a lot, though. I was lucky enough to sit my exam with a prof who wanted to see your logical reasoning and understanding. He didn't care as much about useless facts. His lectures were some of the most interesting I've attended that year. Medical psychology was pretty interesting, too, probably because I have an interest in everything related to psychology. Information would naturally stick with me, I didn't even try to learn something by heart for this course.\n\n\nSecond year was so and so. Anatomy was still there, but I said fuck it. Bacteriology wasn't really bad - the first semester that was about general concepts was really great... then they hit us with all those species in the second semester. I liked histology and physiology. Histology is based on images and microscopic aspects, which made it a bit more digestible and more straightforward than anatomy. One could argue anatomy is also visual - of course, but it was far more difficult to remember how all those organs are placed since there's variability and where all the arteries go. In histology labs, I could say that I see an acidophilic structure that is organized like this... then I make use of basic ideas from cell biology and deduct what kind of structure is that. And physiology... while this department is known for giving high marks only to few students in our university, I managed to be in top 10% at this subject. A lot of it implied logical paths, based on a couple of facts I had to learn by heart (oh, the pain). I'd say physiology is the key of bodily processes.\n\n\nMy current year... I'm close to the end of my first semester. 2 more exams and I'm done. I hate pharmacology with a passion... guess why? I don't give a flying shit about all those weird commercial names and those substances that are part of the same class, but have slightly different effects. No thanks. Pathology is a breeze, though. I have 2 separate subjects, called morphopatology and physiopatology. They have a deeply rooted base in histology and physiology, respectively. Now here's where my logic can actually shine. Of course, this doesn't mean I wouldn't open my books at all, but things start to come together without heavy memorization. Because A happens, B must follow and it can be reflected by C. Semiology... eh, I don't like talking to patients that much. But again, I can use my logic to correlate findings without being stuck in a scheme. I just don't understand why some people try to fit situations into boxes. I try to think everything with a fresh mind.\n\n\nI can learn facts by heart to a certain degree, but those will be the first to be erased from my memory. I can retain them for an upcoming exam, but nothing more. (Don't think I can fit 10 pages full of random information into my mind, though.)\n\n\nTL;DR: even though I consider medicine to be crap, it gets easier because more and more subjects imply logical reasoning as I'm advancing through my studies.
3	Remembering by systems? No this isn't INTP.\n\nEvery other type has about half its people learn mainly or solely by remembering systems. But what they consider systems, you consider a pile of gibberish and vice versa.\n\nFor example, xSFxs learn by finite state machines and flattening everything to two-dimensional ground. At least their 'systemic' learners do.\n\nSystemic Psychopaths have their own kinds of systems which I won't go into.\n\nContrariwise, there are un-systemic "INTP"s who deal with isolated points. Because they want to make themselves miserable and having a big picture would make them happy.\n\nYou just happen to be an "INTP" systemic thinker, and the "INTP" systems are based on topology and logic. And you lack the emotional disease of wanting to be miserable.
2	Agree\nReminds me of a quote\n\nSmall minds discuss people\nAverage minds discuss events\nBig minds discuss ideas\n
2	# Agree\n\nI think by now most jungians assume that is the natural state of an INTP. It is also the usual definition of introverted thinking to create large conceptual structures that define a model of the world.\n\nBut I don't think we have an issue with remembering or recalling facts by will, I have always "felt" the correct truth or at least a truth that worked in a certain context. What I mean to say is that I wonder if the mind actual maps out conceptual structures through the body, and we INTP have a more connected feeling to this whole-body consciousness.\n\nI suppose in this model, instead of remembering facts as they were, we rather remember our position physically in that moment where we witnessed the fact/detail. Which is why you may say:\n\n>remembering a single data point in isolation is basically impossible unless I just happen to recall that time that I learned it randomly.\n\nHow about trying to systematize that process, and gain conscious control? I have been trying to find literature on this, and have also been trying to develop the process / "feel" for it.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I have pretty decent memory myself... But what use are random facts anyway. I find if I'm motivated by something, learning flows like water. If not, molasses, or rocks. So... If we are passionate about the big picture, being doomed to waste our energy learning seemingly useless factoids seems pretty hellish, unless, of course, we're just interested. I probably can tell you all of League of Legends champions names, their general lore, and their abilities, more than  a hundred characters, without too much difficulty, but I don't give a rats ass about when exactly Columbus "discovered" America. Or, here's a mouthfull: the azole class antifungal fluconazole, and possibly other azoles as well, alters the metabolism of drugs such as atypical antipsychotics and components of cannabis like THC, greatly reducing the rate of clearance, potentiating their effects. Have fun wondering why I learned that.\n\nDo I remember half of what I learned in  chemistry and highschool math? Do I fucking remember the name and ap/ad ratios of all LOL champions abilities? Do I remember the name of the enzyme that whatever-whatevers the fluconazole and ends up causing the issue? Or who the fuck, in what year, wearing underwear or not, discovered those drug interactions? Do I need to? Is Google not a thing? Will somebody quiz me tomorrow?\n\nFuck the education system. That's my point.\n\nOh, and, yeah, totally. Sry for the semi-related rant XD. We love to understand, I would dare say, not just memorize. Those are 2 different things. Learning, meaninful learning, can be pure joy. Rote memorization is hell, for me at least. However good or sticky your memory is might be beside the point. Might.\n\nI dunno. Just my not well thought-out opinions.
1	Your brain can only make a finite number of possible neural connections in which to store data. Mine are filled with abstractions about the system of reality and other trivia that interest me. There’s no way I’m going to waste a bunch of hard drive space by encoding uncompressed analog memories! \n\nAs a result, I would be the worst witness to ever take the stand.
4	Can INTPs hold their liquor?	My close friend who is an INTP can drink a TON of alcohol before it even phases him (By the many stories he's been telling me).\n\nFurther, I knew an INTP from work who swore off drinking on principle (from his family) but admitted to being a fairly [heavyweight](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=heavyweight) drinker.\n\nWhat's your stance on this INTPs? Are you or are you not able to hold your alcohol well?\n\n*Ti-heavy on purpose*
6	Whether or not you can "hold liquor" has nothing to do with your personality but rather multiple biological factors including metabolism, weight, sex, age, rate of consumption, how much food you've eaten, as well as your functional tolerance.\n\nAs far as personality goes, I see alcohol as a tool. It makes me relaxed and more outgoing.
7	I get more social the more I drink, and I’m able to focus solely on one subject after two decent shots of Jaegermeister. I probably should be on some type of medication \n\nBut yes I can drink a good deal before feeling “drunk” more so than my brothers anyway
5	What does it mean to 'hold' alcohol? I can drink a lot. I have never puked from drinking. Yet every time I drink, I say some stupid shit that at that moment seems like a good idea. I don't become an ass, only less of a not-ass. About half of the posts I make on reddit are written drunk. I can't imagine why anyone would spend time sober on social media. On drugs and alcohol, it becomes the perfect playground.
4	Is this seriously an INTP thing?  Well, for whatever it's worth, all alcohol does for me is make me feel apocalyptically miserable, and it doesn't take much to achieve that.  So I basically can't drink, and honstly I'm not even entirely comfortable being near people who are drinking.
3	I can hold it, but when it comes time to drink it I'm in trouble
1	[deleted]
2	I have to drink way more than most people before I start feeling the effects, same with everything else.  It's just hard to bring me out of normality for some reason.  I've never thrown up on alcohol before.  However, one time I had the absolute worst hangover where I was throwing up all day.  It sucked.
2	I can drink about half a bottle of beer before I start feeling it, so no.
2	It depends. Alcohol disinhibits you, but I'm very inhibited so it's balanced. I will still be in control somewhat, not getting into fight or whatever. Never blacked out or anything like that, at worst, I throw up, which is a quick fix, all things considered.\n\nI drink mostly socially, not that often, and I'm not very heavy (60kg~), so I wouldn't say I'm good at it. I handle myself, though, still stoic.
2	As I grew older, yeah. Takes a lot to feel drunk 7-10 standard drinks over 2-3 hours) so inevitably it leads to a terrible hangover the next day.
2	Nope, after a couple drinks I pay my dues.  On the hand, I can consume copious amounts of marijuana and function like its nobodys business !
2	Holding our tongues has never been an issue.
1	depends more on ur diet health and weight. stop drinking. its all bad. do dry fasting instead

1	Hello INTP brothers! Gotta admit, I love your sub, you've got some pretty funny posts.\n\nBut, there seems to be no end to these sorts of posts. Don't get me wrong, acknowledging your faults is the first step towards improving them, but when all you post is this stuff about stereotypical negative INTP traits, all you're doing is accepting them as something you can't change.\n\nThat's not true. You can always improve. Always. A healthy INTP is one of my favorite types to be around. If you feel like that's not you, then you can start working on getting there.\n\nThanks for reading this. 
-3	Why is the r/INTP always so morbid and self hating? I mean I know why but maybe stop perpetuating how pathetic you guys seem to think you are? Do whatever you want and yeah this is funny but day after day it's just posts that reinforce the notion that INTP are helpless pathetic people. I don't think that really helps anyone but again, do what you want.
25	Nihilism doesn't have to lead to pessimism; it simply means life is a multiple choice.	If life doesn't have any inherent meanings, then there is no expectations, nor limitations on what you choose to do and who you wish to become. Although you do have to follow external structures and rules to be able to function in a society because not everyone follows a nihilistic approach to life, you do not have to adhere to any particular path. If morality is meaningless, you just have to play along so you don't end up in jail; if money is meaningless, you just have to do enough to keep yourself alive etc. Instead of chasing after a particular goal, or having to live by certain sets of rules, nihilism simply means everything is arbitrary, and you will always have the freedom to choose what is meaningful to you. If nothing matters in the end, why bother worrying ? Everything you do leads to the same result, which is death; you can get there by being a CEO, or you can get there by being a janitor. The result would be the same, and if nothing is valuable intrinsically, your own criteria for success and failure can also be decided arbitrarily.
3	Nihilism is the follow-through of deterministic naturalism.  \n\n\nI like that you're trying to be optimistic about it, but existentialism is basically just what I call "denihilism", in that you overlook the meaninglessness in an understandable effort to stay away from the cusp of the void.  \n\n\nIf there's no objective standard, then relative standards aren't worth anything. Ironically, if there were an objective standard, only relative standards closely resembling it would be worth anything, so no matter what ideology one believes, there will always be useless beliefs and priorities.
2	So how do I spend the rest of my life? If there is no right choice, what do I do with my time here?
2	In a life threatening situation, nihilism is a way to go. If you live, great. If you don't, then you won't care after you're dead now would you?
1	Spoken like a true INTP lol\n\nSimilar conclusion to this guy\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2QZSsc8ib7M
1	I'm a nihilistic INTP too
1	[deleted]
1	Amen.
1	Nihilism is the obvious outcome to belief in only physical existence. 
1	nihilism leads to passivity and neutrality. u can reach better results with objectivism. the best vision is not a nihilistic one. ur probably missing a restriction per context
1	Exploring the concept of nihilism today, and it puts my mind at ease finally, thanks for sharing! 
1	And yet, what is arbitrary? Do you really choose your own interests, dreams and hopes?\n\nI don't like nihilism very much as a philosophy. Meaning is not something we can make appear out of thin air, or by force of will. What is?\n\nIf you were a newborn blank God floating in the void, what would you do? Would you create your own tastes first? Would you invent pleasure? Pain? Love? Wanking? Furry porn? The laws of nature? People to murder and toy with? What for? Based on what drive? Truly endless, undefined, possibilities appear to me as valuable as having none. A photon with nothing to crash against would never experience time.\n\nSee, we are as anchored to what IS as everybody else. As everything else. Do not attempt to call yourself the absolute master of your destiny, or your goals for that matter, with ease. You may not know what you're losing in the process. Besides, it kinda sounds plain dumb and illogical. Just sayin'...\n\nOr solve the is-ought problem of philosophy. Then please text me the ultimate meaning of life. I fuckin' need that shit. Now.
0	I came to this conclusion some time ago. i realized that as an individual we don’t really matter that much but as an entire species, we are slowly mastering the universe. I just live to enjoy the amazing thing that i get to witness in my lifetime and hope to leave a line of descendant that will continue to contribute to this purpose. I think the future will become less arbitrary, so this period is the best time to be alive. Its great. As far as we are concern, whether we exist after death or not this life is all we had, each second will never come back. We live for ourselves and the people that made our lifetime so fucking enjoyable, thats it. 
5	Please can I have some context? It seems I don’t know you INTPs to the extent that I believed I did...	
11	Thats how mafia works
5	I am no dresser
3	I’ve gotten this recently too
4	I mean women at a young age wear "mens" clothes all the time and it's fine. Then they become ugly and it makes them look butch and unfeminine. Men can do the same and then they become old and ugly and they look like freaks. I'll probably crossdress a bit but it's easier for me as I'm bisexual so don't have to deal with people questioning my sexuality. Just have to stop when it becomes disgusting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook at the league of legends player Sneaky, people love it. 
2	I'm personally not a fan of cross-dressing... my esfp friend likes to though
2	I don’t even know, man. I made a post about this about a month ago and this has still been popping up. 
-4	As an INTP, that is mental illness.

18	Any rush fans in this sub?	Rush is a 41 year old (now retired) three man prog-rock band which in my opinion has some of the best qualities a band could have. Even if you don’t like their sound you cannot deny that they are extremely relatable to pattern loving types like us. In my opinion they had the dream career. Constantly experimenting with new riffs, beats and bass lines to see what sounds good on top of unorthodox time signatures. Then piecing those together with other strange time signatures finding out how to seamlessly transition them. Then playing them for a fantastic fanbase you’ve created and getting showered with praise for doing things you naturally love to do. All with the knowledge that you earn this praise by doing things right instead of posturing and conforming to what is popular in the moment. If you’re a new fan I highly recommend watching “Beyond The Lighted Stage”. Super interesting and inspiring trio.
5	Me! YYZ (-.-- -.-- --..) is a jam.  And I'll definitely check it out, thank you.  And YYZ, for me, fit exactly what you said.  I'm generally into prog anyway, but I haven't gotten into Rush yet, I've been "saving" that for later.  I started out with Pink Floyd and then branched out to Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, Genesis, and King Crimson.
3	have you ever tried listening to radiohead? i enjoy both bands a lot
3	Hell yeah! Especially the later stuff like Moving pictures. Also, fun fact(possibly) , Neil Peart the drummer listed as INTP! 
2	I love pretty much everything from fly by night to moving pictures. They were my favorite band for a long time, and funnily enough the last album I got into was 2112. My favorite album is probably hemispheres, the title track pretty much defines great prog. And of course, la villa strangiato which has some of the coolest transitions and solos in it. But I also like a lot of other prog bands from the 70s as well.
2	The only Rush song I like is “Free Will”.
2	[deleted]
2	I was on the same boat as you were. Kind of a passing appreciation no real interest. Then I just started listening to their less mainstream songs while I was doing something else and slowly realized they were just as good and even better. Highly recommend diving down the rabbit hole. It’s worth it.
2	Shit I thought you were talking about the wrestler
2	Red Barchetta, Farewell to kings, YYZ, Broonsbane/the trees :)\n\n&#x200B;
2	I don't know what it is about Prog Rock that appeals to the INTP mind, but it just does.  Most of us have other kinds of music we listen to, but for some reason Prog Rock is INTP's forte.  The bands drummer Neil Peart is even an INTP.\n\nI have two Rush albums. *Moving Pictures*, their classic 1981 album, and *The Spirit of Radio* which is a greatest hits compilation.  I should really listen to them all.\n\nIf you want to check out something less famous but very similar, the band *Saga* is another Canadian Prog Rock band, their two best albums being *Silent Knight* and *Worlds Apart*.\n\n&#x200B;
2	[deleted]
2	"My minds not up for rent to any god or government"
2	Not sure, but I'll put them on the list. I think you should also check out Curved Air\n\nApparently INTPs are wired for dissonance. For example the opening to New Pollution by Beck has always felt as though it was made for me from the first instant.\n\nSo far my favourite prog rock etc band is Gong.\n\n'Eat That Phone Book Coda' is my favourite feast an album in one song all mixed up. Love the jazz fusion percussion.
2	Rush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart is clearly an INTP. Bass player and vocalist Geddy Lee seems like an ENTJ. This ideal matching of opposite archetypes could explain why Neil & Geddy are 2nd to none when it comes to rock 'n' roll bass & drums. The same fusion of archetypes applies to Neil's lyrics & Geddy's vocals as it does to the bass & drum combination. Alex Lifeson, likely an ISFP? "artist" type, is the artistic glue that hold Rush's hyperactive rhythm section into a coherent musical unit. 
2	I grew up on Rush! Anybody else like Mew? Or the Whitest Boy Alive?
1	Couldn’t agree more Cygnus and la villa get better and better every time I hear them.
1	Yes! One of my absolute favorite things any form of media can do! Break a rule in place of something waaaay better! Fuck yeah! It’s so ballsy I hope to achieve it in my own artwork and have it work so well. Gotta put that noggin to work!
7	#i was ass at school	Who here completely ate shit in school and are still proud of it? Why do you think you bombed? Personally I absolutely abhorred the teachers so much so that one of them drove me away from a subject I knew I liked. I could’ve gotten a perfect score in creative writing and literature since I’m so interested in it but because my teacher was a fat, fake, despicable excuse of a woman who only lived off of base desires and groupthink I sat there in my spiteful little mind and said “fuck you. You’re such an insufferable bitch that I’d rather sit in my own imagination then pay attention to you”. Of course I was a little fixer upper myself but a part of me loves the fact that I didn’t give in. I knew how bullshit school was I just couldn’t pinpoint the exact reason  (Ne) now I can. It is made for the majority of people. The mindless rats that sell their dreams for small desires and public approval. Yes the very idea of school is an admirable thing “let’s teach the future generations so they may learn from our mistakes” but things have gotten so compromised and lazy to meet a quota. “Hey our kids have the highest grades! Everybody knows only smart kids get good grades now give us your money you fuckin ingrates!” #Dstudentpride
7	I adore reading. Made a huge essay, my last year of highschool, on an author and a book I didn't give a fuck about. It was a very big deal, the IB thing, and of course they didn't care about my passion, just what was more likely to net me a better grade with the international scorers. NEVER read the fucking book. Skimmed a few pages. Read a cheapo online summary.\n\nSad thing is, I got the best possible grade. Gave me a fucking medal. I was an otherwise terrible student. Fucki...\n\nWell, whatever. I would still urge us to be mindful of our anger. Not everybody has our gifts, our interests or the opportunities they give us. The school system IS incredibly flawed, but, you know, it fucks everyone over, not just the most vulnerable or "special".\n\nMy dad's a typical ESTJ. We are like water and oil, and the guy has worked night and day in jobs that would make me want to KMS. He doesn't dream big, he can't get into my philosophycal conversations, he has no passions besides work, exercise and Sunday church. And he was my biggest critic when I was in school.\n\nBut you know what, I kinda get where he comes from. He wanted to be a diver, work in the sea, have what for him would have been an adventurous, full of wonder, life. Instead, he studied some numbery pencilpushy crap, and had a family and a boring ass job. Majorly sucky and abusive parents too, as was and is all to common. And I've seen him depressed, and I've seen him totally lose or miss many of the things I hold most valuable, oblivious to them as he could be. Was he a good dad? Nah. Would I be alive if he followed his dreams? Nah. Life's complicated.\n\nBut in the process of understanding his own plights, I have healed a bit as well. Not everybody has a mind that can only see "far and wide", or are "highly sensitive" snowflakes, but everyone is a victim of their environment and their genes.\n\nWho hasn't been fucked by life? From Hitler to Einstein. And there's probably a sad or mediocre life story behind every bad, terribly paid, teacher you ever had. Fact.
4	I'm still an ass.
3	Hated school up to the end. My life has been so much better since I graduated. 
2	I was the same but I did it because of my class(my teachers were amazing only the colleagues sucked), people in my country have no respect  and even though I liked all ten subjects in my school, I stopped giving a shit at some point, and I regret it because I didn't learn a bunch of cool stuff. \n\n I was treated like a dumb person and I actually felt like I was dumb at some point, but I knew I was a lot smarter than they thought because I many times would reach the answers of, for instance, physics exercises through deduction faster than the smartest kids but I wouldn't share it like them, but that was before I stopped giving a shit.  I was and am also very creative more on science subjects, but that doesn't count on my school so it was irrelevant.
2	Hashtag square root of negative 1
2	I tried my best to make sure that a shitty teacher didn’t affect my effort towards my work. \n\nAnd I employed group think when I saw that my opinions could potentially be inflammatory but generally my views were out there. Teachers didn’t hate it so there’s that. Still got top grades. 
2	I’m in second semester of senior year in high school(year 13 for those across the pond). I fuckin suck at school big time, despite the fact that I would consider my favorite activity to be learning. I feel you on the teachers, although thankfully the bad ones were in subjects I already disliked, and for their sake, none of them have really truly made me mad. I’m here hoping college will be a better experience for me. If y’all think I’m going art and have any other options, I’m all ears
2	I was ass at school mainly because I was to lazy to acheive anything above average or below average tbh
1	I fucking despise school and cannot wait for it to end. Maybe it's mistake but my current plan for my early life is to learn survival skills, go camping a lot, and eventually live in the woods long term (not permanently).
5	Hey fellow INTPs! Where are you on Loevinger's 9 Stages of Ego Development?	I'm at stage 5 been there for as long as I can remember. No Really. Most my peers are stuck at stage 4 unfortunately. That's kinda the stage I dislike the most, being at 5 my whole life -__-\n\nHere's the post I use to introduce them to it. It's lite reading I promise: https://www.personalitycafe.com/general-psychology/7451-loevingers-9-stages-ego-development.html
3	Hmm?\n\nHas there been any occurrences were someone surpasses the 9 stages and goes into the hundreds?\n\nI’m asking for a friend...
3	based on the descriptions I just read, I am conscientious (6) or individualistic (7). \n\nI can see myself being in stage 7, but I'm not completely there yet. Maybe in a few years 🤞🏻
2	7.5, but based on the descriptions I have aspects as high as 9, they just aren't very common. They kinda start to blend after 6, it looks like.
2	I also at same stage as you.But thing is that you will know how to develop if you do thing you know you should do.
2	Mostly 7.  8 and 9 are things I aspire to.  I'm 36.
1	Dunno. I can recognize aspect of myself at most stages.\n\nTbh, Ti related stuff is probably at level 8/9, while Fe related stuff at 3/4.\n\nSeems a bit wacky as a theory, anyway. What observations did she base that on ? (Goes for typology too, even though Jung constructed the functions from his observations as a paychiatrist) Seems like there are tons of others similar model doing the same thing.
1	Feeling bad about being weird?	Does any of you experiences it? Feeling bad about yourself when you differ from other people and are deemed weird by society standards? It's nice to be different but only as long as you're accepted. And when you're not, then you're just alone with no one that understands what's on your mind. \n\nI've heard many times people calling me weird, I always laugh at it and pretend to go with it etc. but in reality it makes me sad. At the end I do want to belong and be myself with others without being judged (or fearing judgement). \n\nJust a little rant I guess.
7	I feel bad. Not for me but for them. They go on with their boring lives, content with their mundane jobs till they die. Not even having the thirst for knowledge, nor learning just because of curiosity's sake.\nSo yeah, I feel bad.\n\n\nAt other times I do feel isolated, but hey life's an adventure and we just haven't met our companions yet.\n\n\nI used to hide my strangeness, barring myself from connecting with others for most of my youth in school. But what I learned is that true companions will accept you, weird quirks and all. :)
3	On the contrary, I love it when someone calls me weird :)
1	Believe me; everyone feels weird and every single person on the face of this planet is self-conscious about lots of things. It's just that some do a much better job of hiding it than others.
1	Nah I've met people who aren't considered "weird" and they're always the worst people I've ever met. Super boring, really stupid, no motivations, no plans for the future, just does the same shit as literally everyone else. Most "normal" people legit almost piss me off with how uninteresting they are. 
1	This entire planet is weird as hell .. not to mention the monkeys..if you haven’t gotten the memo on that by now then you simply aren’t paying *any* attention :) 
1	Everyone is weird ... It's not unique. \n\nINTPs often want to wear "weird" as a badge of honor, but, really, being "different" is our ego-trip.
1	Designing Games	Any of you want to design games? I know I do.\n\nI have Unity and made a simple game by following a tutorial the best I cpuld, but haven’t touched it since. I think I could make a game with the Unity engine, but it just seems too open to me and I don’t know what kind of game I want to create. \n\nAside from that, I’ve been toying with creating a tabletop RPG as my favortie part of then are the mechanics and systems they use. Anyone else considered this?
1	I make games with Unity. If you need some inspiration and an extra push to get started, do game jams. Everyone gets a topic or theme, you have a few days to make a game, and then you give each other feedback. It's low pressure, because almost everyone's games are garbage, but you learn a lot and get ideas you might want to expand on later.
1	Nah, I don't like spending my free time on creative projects because I'm not confident enough to show them to others and making a career out of it is something I'm really not interested in considering the current state of the gaming industry lol
1	I considered making a game in UE4 about the four sides of the mind Jung-based theory. I want to make it next summer, unless I decide to make personality music instead.
36	My existential coping mechanism	
2	this reminds me of the kind of people who either try too hard to make friends or try to look like they don't need them. They hang around in solitude, never caring about healing the emptiness inside of them, wishing that their silent cries for help will invoke someone who cares enough to... do it for them instead. Jokes about being autistic too.
2	I don't do this but I see it all the time with other people and just don't what to do...
1	Wubba lubba dub dub biiiatch!
1	This is a test	Testing myself is a habit of mine. Possibly a bad habit but a habit nonetheless. \nCan I commit to this sort of social interaction? Will I find it pointless? Is this a complete waste of time and energy? Or will this be a fix to this girl's complete lack of social interaction? \nSo many questions.\nSo many preconceived ideas.\nBut I'm trying by testing!\nStep one...\n...this post!
2	If it was such a "waste of time and energy", why this post?\n\nAlso, be all the way fucking sure.
1	Yeah, you've already failed. No one will ever care enough to answer to this. Oh, wait...
1	You're a brave one. Congrats!
1	How could you benefit from this social interaction?\n\nHow do you want to benefit?
0	going to socially interact with snowflakes (the literal ones).
8	TiSi Loop Question	Hi! I am here as a friendly INFJ. My boyfriend is an INTP, and so I’ve been subbed here to help me understand him better. Over the past few years I’ve been utterly flummoxed by what I now can call the TiSi loop. He can get in this negative hole and say things that are just frankly untrue but he believes with his whole heart at the time. I will point out contradicting evidence and he always seems to be like “Huh. Really?” \n\nSometimes our normally very happy/loving relationship falls victim to his looping. He eventually comes out of it and seems normal/loving, but I am left remembering the negative comments he made. \n\nMy question is- are you able to look back on your thought process once you’re out of the loop and see that what you said/thought wasn’t fully accurate? Or do you maintain that everything you thought at the time was truth? When I’ve brought certain comments back up to my INTP, he often will say he can’t believe he said that. Just trying to understand how this works! TIA!
10	It helps to think of his thought process as a rabbit hole. He explores it with Ti and when he finds something that rewards his Si he continues to explore deeper. As you may know thinking to hard about something is detrimental to your mood and that causes the thought process to lean toward the more cynical side. The trick is to catch him before he sinks too deep into his own thinking and try to make him feel good. This rewards his Si and leads him away from his toxic thought process. In short I’d say be silly with him when he gets like this. Make goofy faces, try and break his armor, make him laugh. Give him something other than his Ti to rely on for that Si reward system. Good luck! Let me know how it goes! :)\n\nOh and don’t listen to the guy that says he has major depression. That’s kinda spreading a negative vibe.
5	Yeah, the looping can get out of control.\n\nLast month, my wife of 7 years and I were traveling a few hours in the car. She was quietly listening to music as I drove. For me, driving is a perfect discussion space, and like a shower it's mostly auto-pilot; left to my own devices, topics are explored until exhausted or a more distracting topics floats to the surface.\n\nFriends of ours recently announced they were getting divorced, and I had been facilitating my mother-in-law and stepfather-in-law's divorce, so the topic was fresh. The mind floated around topics like reasons people get divorced; differences in personality, finances, children; the value of emotional ties, what makes up emotional connection, chemistry, the 'sunk cost' fallacy.\n\nThis cycle descended, my wife has made it clear she isn't interested in having children of her own. Maybe foster or adoption someday. I grew up the oldest sibling in a large family, I'm good with kids; I'm pretty sure I want kids of my own. This led to considering divorce, it logically makes sense, if I can't start a family with her, to end things sooner than later, to give myself the best chances to find a suitable mate.\n\nDevoid of emotion, the reasoning is sound. Still, the conclusion I came to made me somber, frustrated, and sad.\n\nThe above is an example of one such loop, I brought up my line-of-thinking to my wife, who has returned me to sane thoughts on many occasions. She reminded me how much I prize my autonomy and sleep, how even having a dog is more restrictive than preferred. How I'm such a self-improvement junkie, having a child as some form of external responsibility would hold me to a higher self is a very poor excuse.\n\nI later apologized for bringing up the "D-word" (Divorce); our marriage is very healthy, strong communication, plenty of shared interests, trusting relationship.\n\nINTP's construct a personal mental network of ideas and concepts, I've found it important to identify mental personality pillars. Like climbing anchors, or cave spelunking markers; reference points to know when something strays too far off base. These anchors are meant for you as well; if you truly know a person, they will never stray too far from their core traits.\n\nI've struggled with depression, general anxiety, ADHD, mood instability, it's exceedingly helpful to rely on core tenants that I know represent me. It establishes a baseline, invest in the baseline, work toward stabilizing toward the baseline. Don't overly attach to any line-of-thinking, to me everything is a thought experiment.
3	Yeah, if thinking about it doesn't trigger another loop we can see our previous thoughts as irrational. One of the key traits of an intp is self reflection and especially self doubt, after all. 
2	> are you able to look back on your thought process once you’re out of the loop and see that what you said/thought wasn’t fully accurate?\n\nYes, and it's kind of scary looking back. That I could be 100% convinced of things that in hindsight had many other possible explanations, and it was just Si saying "It is THIS way".  I'm much more careful to not trust my Si now, and after such a close encounter internally, I've come to truly despise the ISFJs way of "thinking". It's sick how it can feel good to think that you are able to "know" so much with so little information, when it's all just bullshit.\n\nwow that was quite a venting, i feel better now ;)\n
0	A few things : \n\n* What you're describing isn't the Ti-Si loop. You're talking about hurtful comments or whatever, which are pretty subjective. What "frankly untrue" thing did he even say and what "evidence" did you provide ?...\n* TiSi loop is not about not being "loving"not being "normal".\n* A "TiSi loop" or whatever isn't something so moody, it's a long term thing\n* The Ti-Si loop is a concept that popped on forums, and I'm not sure of its validity. In fact, **having researched socionics, it may not involve Si at all, but our stronger shadow Ni** The problem is still simply lack of Ne, or new information/perspectives. Si isn't to blame..\n* Are you giving him back his comments word for word with context, or just your impression of it ? When I say something, it's mostly the tip of the Iceberg, and my reasoning don't change that much. So if you reported something to me, even if I don't remember it, I could still say "I could see myself saying that" or something. If he's like me, he should do that too, which leaves only a possible flawed reporting as an explanation.\n\n***\nAnyway, don't bring up a major thing like a Ti-Si loop to explain when you BF said something you didn't like about you. In this case, it doesn't even seem to be him being moody but you.\n
15	INTP-INFP affair / The Muse Meets the Robot	When people seem indecipherable, just let them talk, right? Bits of code will get spewed out in seconds and when it finally fits a pattern, you'll get the whole picture.\n\n*Wrong*. Fi hero doesn't work like that. \n\nI recently had an affair with an INFP and it was one of the most strangely beautiful relationships I ever had. But there were some problems, obviously.  When we met for the first time, it was as if I had this mysterious angelic creature right in front of me, full of deep watery emotions which I hopelessly tried to absorb. I just knew I didn't even scratch the surface. I quickly gave up the seemingly impossible attempt to analyze the girl and decided to simply observe while she shared her inner world, full of subtleties and little secrets. \n\nYou see, it's pretty rare for me as an INTP to get fascinated by people. Behaviour is just so predictable that I end up having this skeptical feeling towards other human beings, not actually permitting myself to "blend in". And suddenly, halfway through the conversation with this INFP, I was pretty convinced she was incarnate art. Her little intricate details broke through predictability but with consistency, like music.\n\nNow the weird part of an INTP-INFP relation: INTPs value booleans, so they don't really give a shit to how they feel; INFPs are ALL about their inner feelings, thus disregarding logic. This creates an abyssal contrast between thought and emotion, and since the world views are given from pollar opposite cognitive functions (and in this case, both intravert), the two types end up not understanding each other at all (they may think they do \[or pretend\], but the perspective is always substantially different).\n\nIt's like a muse meeting a robot, get it? I just found it hilarious in a tragicomical way and instantly predicted it would never truly work. Since we're both Intraverted Sensing Child, it's as if we were almost competing to see who was the one receiving the experience. She also wanted me to express myself, to "show my emotions", which is actually forbidden in the INTP's way of living. It just made her even more worried because of Extraverted Feeling Opposer, which the INFP uses to verify external emotions so they won't feel bad themselves (and when she tried to do it, she found a void and got frightened).\n\nBesides all that, it was pretty awesome. Made me think about how we INTP's should be more in touch with our own emotions, because it can hurt us and everyone around us.\n\nHave any of you INTPs ever venture with your Feeler counterpart?
13	I once dated an ENFP and the beginning was easy, because INTPs can fake having depth for short periods of time.  But once we moved in together, it all fell apart. I suspect that she realized that she was dating a robot or like you say, interacting with a void.\n\nI could literally see the "love for me" leaving her eyes, the longer we would spend time together.  Like she was looking for "something" in me.  And slowly becoming more and more disappointed that it wasnt there.\n\nIt was very sad.  Because I loved her very much.  But just that one quirk of "not showing my emotions"  was enough for her to lose her love for me.\n\nShe said she felt "emotionally uneasy" around me. Obviously because she just couldn't "read me" and that was always unnerving for her.\n\nShe even once told me that it seemed to her like everything out of my mouth was a lie. She couldn't trust anything I said no matter what I was saying.  \n\nObviously this is because when you dont show emotion on your face while speaking, there is an incongruence between speech and facial emotion, which feelers detect as lying.  Even though to us it's just normal.  \n\nBeing an intp in a relationship with a feeler, is very very hard. \n\n\n\n\n
10	I’m a female INTP married to an INFP male.  We have our moments where things are tricky, and he needs regular cuddles and affirmation, but it’ll be 18 years this summer, so I’d say it’s a pretty good match.   :)\n
2	You're just describing Ti vs Fi.
1	3 serious relationships- 2 were ENFP and 1 INFP and I relate hard to this. All 3 fell in love with me, they just took too much of my energy though. In my heart I probably knew that I would eventually be the cause of the breakups. I would often get caught up in the good moments though and trick my mind into the possibilities of just doing the damn thing and committing fully. I figured wow, nobody is gonna love me more than this person. It would never last though. Did a lot of research into narcissism (before I knew of myers briggs) to consider the possibility that I was one. A lot of stuff said that a true narcissist wouldn't ever even consider the fact that they were a narcissist and wouldn't feel bad which I did to a point, like I was trying to not do that again in the future at least. Maybe more of a cognitive conscience decision though. I miss all of them honestly. 
1	This is a fundamental problem how language works. Information are deliveries in piecemeals and not in chucks or by system.\n\nIf you use any human languages you will somewhat have this problem(INTPs probably more)
1	You think you’re totally on the same wavelength and completely understand each other. \n\nUntil you realize you actually don’t understand each other in the slightest. 
1	Feelers are the robots.  Thinking is what separates humans from animals
1	Do you hear your self, your inability to have a normal human function prevents you from having meaningful relationships yet you are too hard headed to do anything about it. That INFP should just run, you are not worthy of such beauty.

1	INTP + Brain damage ... Umbilical cords suck	\nI am more, or less, robot - and or human- than you will ever be ha ha ha\n\nApparently if you die during birth through asphyxiation it can cause some unique changes in one's neurological physiology. \n\nIf it were not for all the "I am not a robot" captcha tests telling me otherwise, I would have ceased my resistance as it was futile.\n\nI do enjoy the taste of peanut butter though.\n\nAnd fur, feels better cold - try it. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\nSharing is nice.
4	Dying can cause some unique changes to your personality.
1	Haircuts also cause brain damage
1	I'm sure psychedelic trips or any life-changing experience/revelation could accomplish the same thing
0	i have no will, no desires, no wants. i have 140 IQ and I find life the most boring thing there is.	What can I do to make life more interesting?
20	Send a hitman after yourself.
9	Find friends that are smarter than you
7	Show us your dick
5	Friends and girls
4	The answer for your question is probably at a place you have not look.\n\nSo you already know what to do.
3	*MEMES*
4	You sound like an asshole tbh. Open yourself up to new experiences and stop acting like you're this elevated God like creature that has experienced everthing there is to experience. Because you haven't. Go camping somewhere beautiful or some shit. Do cocaine with strippers. Try new art. Do something bruh\n\nEDIT: Not trying to be a jerk or anything. Just basically saying that your attitude shapes your experience and your attitude seems like it lacks light.

2	Camel ranching.
2	Stop flooding yourself with dopamine 
2	Learn psychology, nutrition, biology and whatever else you need so you can understand happiness and meaning. Apply knowledge to acquire a happy and meaningful life. Then play an MMO, or fap, or create a cult based based around our Lord and Saviour Elliot Rogers. I don't give a fuck. You do you.

1	I'm waiting for this to show up on r/iamverysmart but I really hope it doesn't.
1	Someone can say /iamverysmart in a bragging way or as  description of feeling separate from people.\n\nHowever, this incel probably has an entirely different reason.\n\n\n\nBut there are ways to determine the reason.
1	Damn you should be my friend.\n\nTry new things. New everything. New games, new activities, new places, new hobbies, new ways of doing things. Meet new ppl
7	18+, Ti-Si Loop	What are your experiences with Ti-Si looping?\nHow did it effect your life?\nWhen did you learn finally that you were stuck in a loop?\nYounger INTP *can* read this, I'd prefer they do not respond because of that weird claim of "I don't have emotions." \nAs a teenager seemed great, as an adult emotions are very real and they can become out of control. Such is life. Discuss.

6	I'm 22 (my tag is old). I stay in my comfort zone. I do little, think about little and there's a sickening comfort in that. My thoughts are constantly of the past and failings. It's very unhealthy to stare at that and I get stressed very easily because of that. Trying new things aggravates the echo chamber of my mind and so I avoid that as much as possible. Making progress, sure, but man is there a way to go till my Ne is poppin. But I'll get there.
3	I think most people (of all types) find they as get older that is easy to fall into the primary tertiary loop, this is because using the auxiliary cognitive function is challenging and uncomfortable, but it is the key to growth and avoiding the ‘loop’, which just means that your ego could use some new information !
2	I would overthink a whole lot. I’d fly down these rabbit holes of information that had an enticing wisdom carrot at the top and nothing but worms and dirt the further down I went. It was detrimental to my emotional intelligence. I’d find myself getting enraged at things that honestly didn’t warrant it. Needless stress and pointless resentment towards even the best of my friends. The trick is to know when to STOP THINKING. I know that’s like asking a fish to stop swimming but the key is to learn how to determine when a rabbit hole is not worth it any more. Sure you’ll know more and that initial epiphany felt really good but now it’s just making you miserable so it’s time to stop. Either get over it or do something about it.
2	I used to get stuck in the Ti-Si loop all the time. And it ruined me for good, gave me anxiety and racing thoughts. What came to my rescue is the deeper I dug, the more I realised how meaningless the situation had been. And how less it had influenced my life externally. I thus turned to Optimistic Nihilism (which was preceded by Nihilism, and it wasn't good). I started with the phrase "Fuck it." At every occasion I found myself stressfully overthinking something. The subjective thoughts of "What would that person think of me if I do this?" turned into an Objective "Is this person important enough that I be overthinking about his opinion of me?". If the second question was a yes, I'd consider thinking about the situation, otherwise, just improvised my actions.
3	Not all of us -18 INTPs say we don't have emotions lol
1	I think the Ti-Si loop isn't a thing, or at least, it is misnamed. The problem is Ni, our strongest shadow function. \n\nThink about it, Si domain isn't about ideas, it's introverted sensory perception, so your own body needs, etc. \n\nThe problem remains the same, lack of Ne. But don't blame Si, it is innocent.\n\nAlso, emotions are hardly relevant here.
10	Spidey-sense??	I may be a complete fucking lunatic but, for some reason I feel like I had this intuitive sense of awareness. Like I just KNOW what’s gonna happen and how it might happen. Maybe it’s just awesome observation and analysis skills. Does anyone else feel like this sometimes?
5	Example?
2	I've gotten this feeling as well. But most of the time  it's just a false a alarm. It probably just stands out more when you are bang on. 
2	Either your strong Ne (you see what's possible), or your even stronger shadow Ni, which has a certain "future" aspect to it.\n\nTalk to INxJ, and see that they think they have a good grasp of the future, that's why INTJs like to plan, and INFJs kinda look for soulmate or whatever (If they don't see a future with that person, it's not worth it. Or so they say) . Also, Ni deals with the implications, the "meaning" of some things. It explains the writing style of Nietzsche, or Jung. Pretty symbolic and iconic.\n\nDon't fall for it, though. It's not a prediction, it's not "the unconscious" or an actual Spidey sense, **it's simply guessing and getting it right once in a while**. We remember the time we got it right, and forget the ones where we didn't, that's a big potential for confirmation bias.
1	Have you checked out r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix? Also, have you experienced any strange phenomena in your life? Something you couldn't possibly fathom?
1	It’s called Ne(extroverted intuition) the intp’s second cognitive function. The second function is called the parent slot which means it’s usually used by the mind to preserve us and keep us safe. Usually when we are in a situation where our first function Ti(introverted thinking) doesn’t have enough time to reach a definite perception then Ne will use subtle context clues to tell you how to deal with it. Ne must work quickly since it’s making up for Ti’s lack of speed so it abandons concrete evidence in favor of context clues to speed things along which is why it may seem like you know something is about to happen but you’re not entirely sure why. This is how I see it but feel free to do your own research on the functions. 
3	What do you guys think	
4	I just think I don't really want to see his blue dick. 
1	Too OP for my taste. He is OP done wrong. Dont like him. Never wanna be him.
1	That the author of that article is probably a bitch.
1	villains are more of an INTJ thing but even then personalities types don’t determine your alignment just how your brain processes information
3	Are INTPs cold?	
44	Actually believe it or not most intps rest at the same body average temperature of 98.6°F or 37°C, just like any other ordinary human. 
3	[deleted]
3	I think it’s only initially. Once we are more comfortable around a person we let Si do it’s thing and let out our curious and experimental side which can be very endearing for some people. 
2	they are hot
2	INTP 4th-function Fe "Principles" are easily exploited by other types, and hence INTP withhold emotional data, since they habitually get nothing but grief from others for expressing it.\n\nPrinciples via Fe are easily exploited, while Principles via Ni or Si, or Data via Fi (ie, the functions of non INTP types) aren't so readily exploited by manipulators.\n\nThe moment an INTP betrays *anything* related to Principles, meaning anything they are passionate about, they'll get the same reaction by other types, which amounts to "oh, now I gotcha!", as if the other type can now punish and/or exploit the INTP for information the INTP has volunteered in good faith.\n\nThe above explains why INTP are 7th function Se "Deception", since INTP quickly realize that any true Principles they relate (via Se) get exploited by other types.  
2	Yes, because fuck emotions
1	Do you want to be?
1	Yes, [literally](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--8yxdDhiU--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/19b1f76lyzrz0jpg.jpg)
1	Not really, I turned the heater on and started to feel better. 
1	My hands and feet are always cold.  Mornings are the worst.  It’s pretty annoying
1	Yes, the dead ones 
1	I feel that the majority of us are very warm with loved ones, but cold with strangers 
13	Do INTPs find love they are looking for? HOW??	Love is like an image, or a concept in my mind that has evolved with me as I age. Its like a picture that I have romanticized and tried to search for it in people that I meet. I find its reflections in some people, who became closest to me and eventually separated, but not in entirety. I just can’t understand how people can decide so quickly with whom to spend their entire lives with.\n\nI am 24, and people around me are getting together, and getting married. It is a sad feeling of being left behind somehow, of being abandoned. And it feels like by the time I’ll realize what I want, it would have been long gone. Am I doing something wrong? \n\nSo dear INTPs and beyond! Have you found someone you love? How did you meet? How was your life before and after them? Did it turn out to be how you thought it would? Can you please tell me how to be to find love? Is there something I can do? 
16	Love is effort
6	The current me doesn't exactly believe in love. I believe in liking someone and just gradually committing more and more time to that person because you like them. Perhaps this is love but it sounds kinda simple (maybe it is that simple).\n\nThe only love that makes sense to me is unconditional love. Such as love between family. I don't really like my family but I love them, if I were to lose any of them I would be deeply hurt. This love for my family exists because we share the same blood. Simple, and I don't try to over think it any more than that to avoid nihilism.\n\nHowever, I do think a lot about love with people outside the family because I do want a "loving" relationship. And so far I believe that love in this way does not really exist.\n\nI'm 20 right now and have never been in a relationship. I'm talking to someone now and have asked them out, they're still deciding tho. I feel the way to find a relationship is trying to go out more. Finding what you like. And eventually finding someone you will want to commit stuff too. Might be the first person or the thirtieth person.\n\nDon't over think the first part. If you find a few things you like about someone just ask them out and maybe you'll find more stuff you like when you spend more personal time with them.
4	I get crushes on people, there are definitely people I like more than others. Generally I view people I'm in relationships with as my best friends who I am also attracted to and they feel the same way back lol. I've never been in "love" and I feel like it would've happened by now if it was going to happen.\n\nI think society makes love into this big thing and so you expect that you'll just know immediately. For some people that might be true but personally my brain doesn't work like that.
6	Well, I'm in the same boat if that's worth anything to a fellow intp.\n\nThe last acquaintance of mine that got hitched didn't invite me. First I heard of it was on normiegram, at that I take no offence. What offends me was that he allowed his 20-something bride to do the "I'm a pretty princess" thing. All the way down to the nauseatingly bedazzled tiara.\n\nBut I digress,\nAs best I can tell, the system's entirely rigged against our kind.
1	ESFJ-INTP duality is the Socionics answer. \n\nhttp://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=The_Dual_Nature_of_Man#The_first_dyad:_ethical-sensory_extravert_.28ESE_:_Fe-Si.29_and_logical-intuitive_introvert_.28LII_:_Ti-Ne.29
1	I can't say I love her (dunno what love is) but I really like her. I met her at a mental health support group. We started talking politics and we have a shared vision for why the world is as it is. We are good at the same things and bad at the same things. We can talk enthusiastically for hours but can also enjoy each other's company. It's too early to tell how this will go but we're both bending over backwards through busy schedules to see eachother. I thought my last favorite gf was "the one" and my doppelganger but this girl's so much further in tune with me and slightly less edgy instead of moreso. I have no clue if she's, "the one" or if that or love exists. I just know we are very much alike. We've both shared some pretty serious secrets and seem surprisingly connected after only a month.
1	I found an INFJ to love and to hold. This can be a very unpopular opinion, but if you have a religion then I would recommend finding someone of the same sort. I read in the KJV that basically blessed are those that can remain faithful alone with Jesus, and I decided that I was not the sort capable of doing that. I had to drop my pride. I found my love through difficult times. \n\nJust my humble opinion through experience. 
1	Go to a bar with action, ie. dancing college girls or young adults.\n\nIn my experience usually a girl will grab you, like free candy, take you to a corner, and start twerking on you and you can't escape or run.  So you try not to let the blood flow down the boardwalk and make a mess of things.  After the ritual is performed, you'll probably have a limp for the rest of the day.  If you can put half a sentence together you are usually good to go and ask for more, act like you like it. If she says yes, you're in the process of finding love.  Your results may vary.  
1	Try finding different love definitions and seeing if any fit you.\n\nYou will be okay. College is full of opportunities and Tinder in well-populated areas. Do not forget you can be very happy in a relationship without a mention of love for a long time. Currently with an INTJ who's amazing and we explain our ideas or thoughts more than feelings. Works awesomely.
1	Most of the time other people find us.\n\nMy husband is an ISTJ.  Over the last decade I've realized he has some special INTP radar.  He keeps making friends with INTPs, I don't even know how he finds them. Just embrace your awesome self and be willing to let someone find you.  
1	Don’t be in too much of a rush to find love. These people you see getting married so early probably don’t even know who THEY are yet. Do yourself a favor. Find out who you are. Learn about yourself. Love yourself first. That way you’re not crawling to other people desperate for love when they can easily use that to manipulate you and make your life hell. \nFirst step to self love is to learn to take it easy. Most likely when you want something that requires effort like love you act like a drill instructor to yourself and that puts you off entirely. Try being gentle and forgiving of your mistakes. Celebrate the small victories as long as they get you even the slightest bit closer to your goal and take solace that one day with some patience you’ll get exactly what you want and more if you practice self love. Good luck my man
1	Met my SO at a church camp. I was the only girl who was capable of showing interest (everyone else was majorly sheltered) and waited 3 months for him to ask me out. He is ENTJ and we get along really well and like to discuss scientific theories and medical discoveries, collect plants, and trying new hobbies. Been together for 3+ years now. It's a successful relationship 👍
14	Being an INTP makes me sad	My whole life i’ve struggled with social interaction and people understanding me the way that i’m able to understand them - which is typically on a deep level. \nI’m a senior in high school and have yet to meet someone like me that get how i work and how my brain functions. it’s depressing and has caused me to isolate myself from almost everything and everyone. does anyone have any advice on how i can push past the loneliness? It’s so painful, i just want a real companionship with someone. does it get better with age? 
4	You don't have bad social skills because you're an INTP, if anything, that you're an INTP because you have bad social skills is closer to the truth.\n\nWork on it and don't blame it on type.
3	Meet someone from the internet.  If INTP's only take up 2-3% of the population, you'll almost never meet someone who is similar to you in person. Also, would you ever say hi or be outgoing towards someone else of your type?
3	Being an INTP doesn't make you sad, desire to be someone/something else makes you sad.
2	It gets better when you get better. Better yourself as a person and you'll feel better (unless it's clinical but even then it'll at least help).
2	Really? I'm too lazy to be sad. 🤗
2	I did not have fun in high school, but then I had a blast in college, not totally sure why. So yes, be patient and it does get better. I think us introverts just need more time to learn social skills because we do not like to socialize as much as extroverts, so it takes more time for us to gain the experience needed to be successful.\n\nYou will have many more opportunities to find like-minded people in college, and I found that as people grow older and more mature they tend to be more patient and appreciative of our ways.
2	It doesn't get better with age, but if you're cognizant enough you can emulate the tendencies of other types and believably project an image of being someone good in social situations (essentially faking it till you make it). I'm not going to lie, it's difficult and will make you miserable at times, for me it has been worth it though. I've gotten to the point to where when I'm around others I can play the role of extrovert with ease and I do frequently get mistyped as an ENTP or ENTJ if I'm on my game.
2	Its really hard to find people who will be able to get on your level of deep conversation/thought process. If you used the 16 personalities test, you can see how the types are categorized. INTJ, INTP, ENTJ, and ENTP are the "Analyst" group and usually get along pretty well. My SO is ENTJ, his brother (who I get along with really well) is INTJ, and my cousin is ENTP. (Only relative I sincerely get along with) \n\nAlthough... if those are the only types you end up spending time with, you may lose a sense of empathy toward other people, emotions won't matter, etc.. You might become a robot! It is important to have the other types in your life to keep you balanced and such.\n\nDon't be sad about your personality, try embracing it and learn to love yourself. If someone takes the time to get to know you, they'll probably appreciate your INTP qualities, so just be yourself. The hardest part is the waiting game. You have to be patient!\n\nGood luck battling loneliness, I know it's difficult. 
3	Become a philosophy major in college. Seriously. I've found my people. If you don't want to do academic philosophy, double major in something more useful (or learn programming while in school/apply to law school after/etc).
1	You need to relate with people in order to be friends, so trying to act like 'the rest' helps you learn about people
1	You can try watching video or reading about INTP role models.(Better if the person is alive)\n\nJust to give you solace that you are alone.(edit: i mean not alone)\n\nNot sure how useful it will be in term of life advices.\n
1	Dude give college a shot. And study abroad or travel. Don't give up on being somewhat normal and you will be okay.

10	Why is it that the commonness of types according to tables you find on the internet is inversely proportional to the subscriber count of the types' subreddits?	To be clear: i have not come to shitpost.\n\nMy guesses for my question would be \n\n1) people become disinterested in their type when they learn that its not rare/ theire not "special"\n\n2) the numbers are bogus, and myers briggs is just something that uses the barnum/forer effect efficiently.
18	Larger groups will feel more like they belong in the real world since they're everywhere and it's more tailored to them (the majority). The less someone feels welcome in the real world the more likely they are to look for places and groups where they do feel welcome and like they belong.\n\nEdit: Pretty sure this isn't a shit post
9	So first, don't waste time with this "bisexualghost" guy. Seems like a troll, smells like a troll...\n\nNow, from a cursory glance at the data, I see most of the pie is taken by the INXXs. So rarity might be a factor by itself. People looking for a clique. That does make sense.\n\nBut there is another possible factor, or at least a more precise way to contextualize the rarity argument. These people all are introverts "I" with high openness to experience "N" (from the five factor model of personality). I don't care about other nuances of MBTI for now, it's crappy science anyway.\n\nSo, people that have a harder time finding others like themselves, or just finding other, more average, people entertaining enough, but are also kind of nonconformists and/or creative. Likely into stuff others aren't, possibly a bit smarter, long form minded or tech savvier than the average Joe. Sounds like the kind of people who would run to the forums of the internet for solace, right? And this ain't 4chan, but it ain't Facebook either.\n\nDoes it make sense? Just a thought. Do swallow a whole salt shaker with it, please.\n\nOh, and may I add. Personally, I don't think the Barnum effect plays such a big part in the MBTI kerfuffle. Sure, there's gotta be a shit ton of people that won't fit squarely on any of those 16 holes, and, sure, the descriptions are mostly positive in nature, but common... Go read some good INTP description, or look at supposed INTP characters/people and tell me, honestly, how many people would fit into that mess XD. Do you? We reek of ADHD, emotional detachment and a bunch of other fun stuff, and, of course, those sweet hai Ay-qeue pointz. None that I've asked in person or seen take a test fitted themselves there. Like 3 ppl tested and counting.
3	hypothetically the rarer types feel more misunderstood in the outernet, so they flock to internet communities to find 'like minded' individuals for a good circle jerk. \nOr, perhaps the communities with large amounts of members have personality traits that are more involved in their own personalities, and so theyd join a community based on that. \nOr, maybe the communities with a lot of members enjoy activities that are easier to facilitate over the internet (as opposed to personalities that have more active, physical interests). 
3	Because the population of internet users is a skewer sample of the world population
2	the rarest groups are considered the "coolest", and plenty of people who have not done the test start referring themselves as members of that group
1	In my opinion the number of N types is overestimated. Also, the test is flawed because it doesnt tell people about functions. Also, Sensing descriptions describe them as some stupid people. I love having step by step descriptions how to, for example, kill a hard boss in game, instead of some general rules

1	Oh hi, me.
1	Yep.
1	I can't tell if this is what someone actually believes or if it's just normal shitposting.
1	Yah. I'm pretty sure my ESTJ parent thinks I'm mentally challenged because of this.
-20	Boy if only INTPs really believed this. It seems a lot of people get extremely anxious when you tell them some scientific truths such as diversity is awful or that race is real and miscegenation generally bad.
339	Does anyone else find that they are a pushover with people who they like, but extremely tough and assertive with people they dislike?	Whenever I am with my friends or someone I respect I will just go along with whatever they say and be too polite and nice to stand up for myself, and they will totally control the situation. But when it is someone I dislike I find that I am anything but a pushover.\n\nRecently one of my work friends started a fight with me. When we were on good terms I would always let him decide the plans and dominate the conversation. But now that we are on bad terms I am highly assertive and strong towards him. When I talk to him my voice drops by an octave and whenever he tries to intimidate me or yells at me I flatly reply "no" and stand my ground, unshaken. Today I even kicked him out of his position and told him "I can do this alone, I do not need your help" and when he did not want to leave I just repeated myself but louder and then he submitted to me.\n\nIt is the same with everyone. I am very timid around people I like because I am too nice to offend them. But if it is someone I am angry at, I have no fear and will become highly aggressive to a point where it is counterproductive and illogical. Does anyone have a similar experience? 
75	The trick is to foster a healthy disdain for all people.
71	I think that's normal for everyone actually
27	I'm kind of in between on this. I can stand my ground with friends and people I'm comfortable around and with people who irritate me. I do give a bit extra slack to a friend, but not much. 
50	I just read this and went: That's me!\n\nYes, I'm exactly like this. Glad to know I'm not the only one. I always thought it was an issue, but I think it's just what happens when you invest your love only to people you care about. I'm not sure how this works because I don't understand myself completely either, but often when people piss me off, I'm a lot more strict with them.
12	The principle of things will get me to fight in a heartbeat.  Otherwise, I go along with people I like.  But I just avoid the people I dislike / don't like.  If I have to be with them, I can like sequester my personality and get through it.  If I'm fighting with someone, I've given them so much rope by that point that it's over - I don't want to see them anymore, and if they force it, I'll fight for sure.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say I'm harder on friends.  Like if a friend says something ill-considered, I point it out immediately.  If someone I dislike does, I ignore it - unless, again, there's a principle involved.
26	I'm more of a pushover with people I don't know well, but more assertive the more I know then. 
11	You've discovered something new about yourself. Great! The next step is to ask: "Can I use this as a space for improvement?" and if so, "How do I improve this?"\n\nThe key to getting better at a great number of things is consistency and incremental increases. That means, try being assertive with someone you like, once a day / every other day / etc., then after a week / two weeks / etc. incrementally raise the frequency.\n\nSoon enough, I guarantee you will see substantial results.\n\nBest of luck, this is something I identify with as well, and am also taking steps to improve. 
5	Yes. When I am with people that I like being around I usually just go with the flow, and in the other case I find myself easily standing my ground about pretty much anything.\n\nI don't quite like it though. As in I really enjoy debating about the logic or purpose of a lot of things, but since that kind of conversation can get pretty heated and be taken personal by the other party, I rather just do it with a stranger so that if it goes awfully wrong, at the very least it is someone that I don't care that ends up hating me for my guts.\n\nIronically I'd love to have a friend that I can discuss something and both understand that even if we fight over a topic, it will be nothing personal and can keep being friends.\n\nHave't found the courage to actually try and engage with my friends like that yet. It's just not worth it losing the only three/four people that usually don't mind talking to me.
2	Yea if it's someone I enjoy, I don't want to constantly be in debate with them.  If it's someone that has really rubbed me wrong, fuck off.\n\nI'm very absolute in this way, if someone has taken a shot at me they're now my mortal enemy.\n\nOne example, I gave a big speech for 200 people, 150 people sent me email thanking me.  One of the people I had met a few times prior wrote me a whole email on everything that went wrong.  Fuck him.
2	I just read the title, haven't read the post... but it all makes sense now 😐🤔
2	I'm a pushover with everyone :) Regardless of how much I like or dislike them... 
2	Fuck same.
2	Im like this. I'm currently working in retail, and I am much more assertive and no nonsense to my customers than I am to my co workers. I'm surprised I'm not fired.....yet..... 
2	Yes, you shift into your ENTJ "Chief" unconscious to handle the situation. Otherwise you are pushover with close friends to serve others through your subconscious as an ESFJ "Supporter". Unconscious gives you maturity. Subconscious gives you happiness. Ego gives growth. Most of the time, you stay in your ego using Ti, thinking deeply, fixing inconsistencies and exploring externally controllable variables with Ne.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZBEuKPPEx0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZBEuKPPEx0)
2	My experience of this is what I would describe as having firm boundaries; I'm pretty easy-going in general, and I'll mostly let things be, but the moment people start treating me poorly, I make it clear what I won't stand for.\n\n I don't necessarily think I'd characterise it as aggressive, but I start drawing clear lines within the situation; particularly being careful only to adopt responsibility for any bad-feeling in a situation when I am actually at fault.\n\nI've learnt to be diplomatic but firm because I live with an alcoholic who has a tendency to lash out on bad days.
3	I think this is the case with everyone. I'm an incredibly kind person, but when people take advantage of that and try to disrespect/humiliate me, I naturally become triggered and rude lol. 
3	Yeah, totally.\n\nI will completely bend over backwards for people I like. It is almost impossible for me to say no, even when I totally should (such as when I am actually incapable of following through on what I'm saying yes to).\n\nHowever, I remember when I was running my first business alone, a service provider of ours was being very aggressive and making power moves trying to talk me into merging with him, pulling rank, pulling status, all these things. I was completely dismissive of him and basically didn't even grant him a phone call to even listen to what he had to say.
1	Absolutely me 
1	Nah, I'm just a fucking pushover period. 
1	No. If I respect someone then I want them to respect me, hence I’m not inclined to act like a little bitch around them
1	This is true of me on a personal level, but I refuse to be jerked around or taken advantage of at work. Friends I work with, friends I willingly see outside of work, I will still call on their shit at work.
1	maybe, let me know if I’m wrong: you are afraid of what might happen if you are assertive in those relationships that you want to keep. You have nothing to lose with the people you dislike.
1	U sound like an aspie
1	I'm like, the opposite. I'm too nice to strangers but willing to push boundaries with people I know.
1	My INTP daughter is like that for sure. Evil jerk to her enemies but a huge softie to her favs. INFJs are very similar. They’re your BFF or worst enemy! 
1	When it comes to my friends i mostly already agree with them. Or they make a good point and we compromise.
1	This! Every body says how nice I am. Then they meet someone I don't get along with and they are like so and so really doesn't know you, they think....  I'm like no you are both right, I believe in the duality of man\n
1	Yes, but you got to learn to not let likeable people control every situation, or you could find yourself doing things you will later regret.
1	I'm the opposite. If I'm not comfortable or familiar with somebody, I'm less likely to "give them a piece of my mind" and engage in conflict. Unless I've been drinking, then I get all pseudo alpha male if somebody gives me crap.
1	I feel attacked!
1	You have my respect and patience until it runs out. You can build both of those back up.
1	I'm the opposite actually
1	I tend to be a pushover with everyone, but I'm enneagram type 9. \n\nI don't think your voice drops an octave. That's really far and if you could do it, it's probably your fry range where it wouldn't be very loud. 
1	A lil bit. There are people I genuinely like that get on my nerves and they bear the brunt of some serious aggression.
1	I'm rarely going to like somebody that needs me to be a yes man...
11	Self awareness and why it’s important	I’ve learned in the past year that it is EXTREMELY important to question why you are the way you are. It will save you mountains of trouble if you’re just honest about yourself.\n\n    I used to get so annoyed when people would freak out in rage. Even if they were completely justified. I would just look at them and think “god what an emotional bitch” and immediately lose respect for that person even if they were a good friend. Then I asked myself why I had that reflexive disgust toward those outbursts. \n\nI realized I was jealous\n\n    I thought of a particular incident when my friend D and I were coming home from a movie and when we arrived there were 5 of our friends at his place just hanging out uninvited. D was not happy about this at all. He felt so disrespected and pushed over that he laid into all of them mercilessly. He was shouting at them like an enraged father. I got really annoyed with the way he was foaming at the mouth so I told him to knock it off. At the time I thought he was being unreasonable and that I was “saving”those 5 friends from his bullying. In reality I was mad because he was so well in touch with his emotions that he could pinpoint when it was okay to freak out like that. \n\n“Why can he scream his fucking head off at people and be justified in the eyes of everyone but when I let the slightest emotion out it’s treated as a nuisance?” \n\nThat was my logic at the time. I was convinced by my own lies that I was right. I didn’t want to admit I was jealous and because of that I almost cut off my entire friend group out of resentment. \n\nTake this as a lesson everyone. Make sure you’re learning everything there is to know about yourself. Be extremely objective. Ask yourself “what would I think of myself if I was an onlooker?” It may hurt to face the truth especially about yourself but believe me it’s worth it.
6	I threw my self into melancholy, envying the emotional people I knew. I flipped back and forth between feeling superior to them and feeling jealous. Then I realized there was one simple answer: whether you're emotional or apathetic it doesn't matter. One isn't superior to the other; there is no right and wrong way too feel. However, there is a right and wrong way to use what you are given :)\n
3	It's annoying to try to read the text placed inside whatever that is since the scrollbar is in the way, so here it is for anyone who wants to read it:\n\n>I used to get so annoyed when people would freak out in rage. Even if they were completely justified. I would just look at them and think “god what an emotional bitch” and immediately lose respect for that person even if they were a good friend.

In reality I was mad because he was so well in touch with his emotions that he could pinpoint when it was okay to freak out like that. \n
2	I made it a policy to analyze precisely why I find anything upsetting enough to feel an actual emotion about it.  Sometimes, that forced me to identify some interesting internal inconsistencies in my worldviews and help me get over it.  Other times, it helped me argue more effectively because I could articulate precisely why and how someone else was acting in bad faith (for example).\n\nSo yes, it's important to understand *why* you feel any feeling, and the process of working that out is sometimes difficult and painful.  But always worth it.  Of course, sometimes the hardest part is just realizing that you're experiencing an emotion in the first place.\n\nIt's not like I have it *all* worked out, I'm probably just too damaged at this point for that.  But it helps.
2	This is the right attitude.\n\nYou will win in life.\n\nGodspeed and peace.\n\nPs: Traceability of the emotion is very important. Don't hate yourself and others based on poor traceability. In addition, its important to distinguish between "Contextual Assholes" and "Real Assholes".

4	Make friends with telepaths
3	It’s especially tough when it’s your parents. Constantly being reminded that they know nothing about you. It sucks but I’ve gotten them to understand.\n\nI try not to associate with these types more than I absolutely have to. Your best bet is to do what serves you best in your opinion rather than try and get through to these idiots.\n\nI’d say be competent at what you do. People will recognize and respect that with time. Also don’t assume that they think you’re stupid like I did. It is NOT a fun spiral to go down.

46	Do you guys have friends that make a point to keep you in their lives, but you don’t know why because you don’t really do the same?	Sorry if this comes across as word vomit(i’m not at organizing my thoughts). I’m in my early 20s, and I’ve started to drift away from a lot of the people I’ve always spent time with for various reasons. I spent most of my teenage years trying my hardest to fight my introversion, so I made a point to be friends with extroverted people that would pull me out of my comfort zone. I succeeded for a long time and made a lot of good friends, but that lifestyle got old as I realized I was a lot happier just being myself and spending my time alone. \n\nBut there’s a select few of these friends that will always text me and say they really miss me or want to hang out and catch up. I know I should be happy that I have people like this in my life, but I guess the confusion comes from the fact that I never really think of these people and try to connect in the same ways. Sometimes I feel like I have to ability to disconnect from friendships too easily, and I guess this must seem jarring to the people on the other side. Maybe the problem is that I have trouble noticing when others genuinely care about me, and I mistakenly think that they actually don’t.
10	I think it's okay pursuing what is the best for you. Also changes in lifestyle from being a teenager to becoming an early adult, makes you change as well, maybe part of the reason you stopped putting some extra effort is that you just don't find them inspiring anymore. \n\nIf you think those friends are valuable, you should try and explain that even if you don't actively initiate catching up with them, you still care for them, and don't want them out of your life.\nI had similar issues with my friends, I used to keep out of touch sometimes for weeks. It had brought me some issues, as they accused me of being too selfish and self-absorbed - which I could understand as a valid point of view for a non-INTP. \nBut in the end, it has helped me realize that with real friends compromising is a thing. Nowadays, they don't get mad when I have my detachment episodes (avoid hanging with them, giving short chat responses etc.,), but also when my isolation bubble is gone, I do try to be the one calling them, and asking how are they feeling and suggest spending some time together. \nUs INTPs, sometimes need those guys to enrich our lives and help us learn and experience things that are outside of our head.
7	The decision to spend time with anyone is up to you, but the friends that strive to keep in touch (even if you are not) within any given timeframe are worth allocating some designated attention in my experience. On the other hand, I have some friends I don't see or come in contact with for a long time, yet when we do cross paths its as if we had talked yesterday in most regards. I often have to remind myself that friendship is not measured by how often contact is made. I believe it is ultimately a deeper connection driven by mutual respect and love. If time or space end a friendship, there is a lack of one or both of these aspects. Either way, all relationships require mutual effort- so if you think they require time and you care enough, you will acknowledge in one way or another.
3	Used to. I’m 52 now, they eventually take the hint 
2	I'm also in my early 20's and pretty much in the same boat as you. Except, I moved schools a lot as a kid, since my mom, (an INTJ) frequently changed jobs because she got bored. So I didn't make too many good friends anyway.\n\nI find that I ignore a lot of texts, and events because I don't want a relationship with people that depends on how frequently we talk, or how much face-time we get. And above all else, I don't want to pretend to feed into other people's BS. This is also true with family.\n\nWhat I have found is to keep people in my life who don't need a lot of friendship maintenance. That way, they know I need my space as much as they need theirs. It's hard to find people like that. But they are totally worth it.
2	Yeah I do and I never really understood why they bother with me.
2	I push people away because they bore me.\n\nI don’t “leave it” until the hint eventually seeps into their brain, I down right tell them that I have no interest in being in their presence no longer.\n\nMy ex friend was my friend for 8 years and I decided that they were too clingy and needed reassurance from me all the F’ing time so I let them “go”\n\nI Haven’t done that with all my old friends.\nI don’t speak to them but I still keep their info as I never know if I will need them one day (Some of them repair things etc) 
1	ENTJ-T rocks!
1	Once told a friend "sorry, i dont value friendship or any emotion for that matter since its illogical, so i wont fight to keep anybody as a friend" we were talking about another friend who i dropped because of his constant negativity, and he took it personally. He ended up saying " thats cool, and i love you as my brother anyways" after learning to value emotions (but still not over logic), i really appreciate that from him.
1	I would say I’m like that with almost all my friends. When I do message them it’s because I’ve got a free moment and I’m consciously reminding myself to nurture the friendship so that they’re not _always_ the one reaching out. \n\nI have noticed, though, that these friends who are always looking to hang out with me? Many of them like to talk about their own problems kind of a lot and then seem bored or barely participate if I bring anything up from my own life. Sometimes that makes me think that my hiding out a lot might be just ... good instincts. 
1	I find I'm much more comfortable keeping colleagues/friendly peers than friends. We don't plan to go out, we don't eat lunch together on our off time. We sing, walk with each other on the bus, and have good talks during class. We pass each other outside of class and greet each other, if there's something to talk about we'll talk, and small chat doesn't take an annoyingly long time.\n\nFriends who take you out and who I enjoy being out with are precious, I want to take care of them. I get to do things I would never have done before because I like to hole up in my room. They can be understanding, but they are also higher maintenance than colleagues. So having more friends like this can weigh you down.\n\nIf you can picture yourself spending a nice afternoon outside with a friend just as much as you can picture them spending a nice evening with you, maybe they're a friend worth keeping.
1	I really do value other people and my friends, the problem is there is so little time and energy in life and work takes most of it, then add in normal chores of being an adult and then try and keep up with your personal goals, there is very little left if anything, as I don't think there is even time for that.
1	In the past I bothered with my friends but they didn't with me for the most part. They were still good friends by doing this, but they didn't realize my needs. Okay let's be honest maybe they weren't that great at the time.
1	Yep. It's super draining.
5	Using Free Time	When I have free time. I feel like I have to actively do something or I’m wasting my time. I sit down to watch a show but even if I want to I feel unproductive and guilty. Anyone been through something like this or is it just me?
9	I feel guilty no matter what I do or don't do during the day
3	I rarely take naps because I feel like I'm wasting precious day light hours. I'm not as well driven as you tho. I'll find "watching TV" as a good use of time. I'm working on myself tho!
2	Definitely need to use my spare time more productively... So that I no longer have spare time to spare.
1	This is why I plan on monetizing one of my favorite things to do. Art. It’s such a technical and fun skill that it doesn’t feel like work at all (maybe sometimes). If you want this feeling to go away then dive deep into a skill you know you’ll get obsessed with and try to position yourself where you’re making money by doing it. You’re definitely smart enough to work that out if you’re willing to put in the effort. If you’re still having trouble I’d listen to Gary Vee. He’s an entrepreneur but his speeches resonate a lot with people like us who want to actually have fun in life (lol). Super inspiring guy. \nGood luck

1	What’s your guys honest opinion on conspiracy’s? Do you believe some of them to an extent, are you open minded to every conspiracy? Do you think you have no time to assume such things?	Me personally; I find them extremely interesting yet I don’t like to pursue the interests to a “personal interest of mine” \n\nI’d like to make them a personal interest of mine but I don’t like the fact that they can seem extremely questionable (obviously since they are conspiracy’s) and they can make you seem fucking crazy lol.\n\nI’d prefer to leave the conspiracy’s to Shane lol.\nBut what about yourselves?
3	There are some real, and many fake. Some real ones produce fake ones to hide their own.\n\n(And some are outright ridiculous...)
3	I’ve gone down plenty of rabbit holes. The photographic evidence of the Boston marathon “hoax” is extremely, eerily and disconcertingly convincing but I still don’t believe it. I have pretty high confidence in the official narrative but if I had any friends who were weird like me, I would spend a few hours taking them through the conspiracy stuff and discussing it to see if they found it as convincing as I do. I’m compelled to research shit like that and have to fight against it because I should be prioritizing more valuable, important. meaningful (or even just “bill-paying”) uses of my (limited) time.\n\nThe other thing I’ve realized is there are very few degrees of separation between what seems like a “neutral” conspiracy (theory) and some really odious beliefs. What is presented at first as a scientifically curious worldview again and again turns out to be motivated reasoning, of some racist. anti-semitic. xenophobic variety.\n\nAnd as I think you alluded, we don’t have enough time to entertain every “nutcase” theory. We don’t even have enough time to seriously investigate every current event we are obligately required to weigh in on, like the whole Evergreen College brouhaha. (Fuck narratives and everyone’s ill-researched hot takes.)\n\nEdit - added word theory in second graf.

7	INTP and (Low) Conscientiousness	It's apparently something akin to fact that INTPs are hopelessly low on conscientiousness, and it's a mould I seem to fit.  Sitting here, becoming ever more despressed at the idea that I'm economically doomed, in addition to the mirriad of other health problems, including 'early' death, that come associated with my low conscientiousness, I'm starting to wonder if this is something that is overstated?   What does it mean to not be motivated in the same way as other, more conscientious people?  Is this just an example of societal norms conflicting with what is otherwise an healthy personality trait in another setting?
8	Why the fatalistic attitude? The Myers–Briggs test is not like testing your blood type, it just indicates the strengths and weaknesses of your personality. Just because you will have a harder time excelling at something, doesn't mean you are doomed in society. Personal development is something everybody can do to become happier with their performance in all aspects of life. Strengths can support what we want to achieve and compensate for weaknesses that we have. If a weakness becomes too hindering, there are ways to train and overcome the obstacles that this weakness puts in our paths. Most likely by harnessing what comes easy to us.\n\nYeah, the world is probably not built by and for INTP people, but introverted people can still have friends for instance, we can build resilience against overwhelming sensations etc. It's just that the challenges to break out of our comfort zones will look different than the ones of other personality types.
7	It's not very helpful to put yourself into a pigeon hole and resign yourself to being a certain way forever with no chance of changing.  \n\nI'm an intp and in the past few years I've changed from a depressed, anxious mess to a calm and much happier person.  \n\nYour thoughts matter, they create your reality so be very careful with what you allow on a daily basis and what you label yourself as.  The whole mbti thing can be very confining. \n\nI wish you the best. 
1	I actually have a weird mix of lack of conscientiousness and conscientiousness. First of all, mess bothers me, and I mostly only tolerate stuff left on my chests of drawers. My music keyboard used to be a place to throw jackets and stuff. I can't stand a messy floor or a messy car, though. I generally go around like a P type, though, and only have one destination if any on the agenda. \n\nThe only good news is that conscientiousness increases as you get older, and I'm old enough now to tell you that it's actually true. 
1	We just develop conscientiousness backwards from the average Joe. We have to learn it while it comes more naturally to others.  Being aware of your lack of it is step one, you are moving in the right direction.

2	The joy of smelling things? (srs)	My newest hobby is buying novelty spices and just spending time smelling them. The aroma of spices and herbs in particular seems to generate exciting abstract impressions in my mind. Every smell is halfway between an emotion and a sensory experience. I find that most spices give me a vague sense of nostalgia, as if I'm remembering something that doesn't exist. I will study this more.
1	Did your nose get better ? And did it help with other stuff, like tasting food ?
1	Who doesn't like smelling things
1	Can I suggest picking up whisky tasting? I personally enjoy how you can use 4 senses with whisky collecting. Color, nose, palate, and finish. My mind goes haywire (in a good way) when I'm putting all my effort to pick up notes in whiskys. It's very mentally stimulating for me.

1	I had a 65% recent and 56% overall after 8000 battles in WoT, which is pretty good. \n\nThe game devs were crap, the userbase was crap, and trying anyone you tried to teach so they would stop being crap would fight you. \n\nWinning the game wasn't fun and I stopped playing it two years ago.\n\nBeamNG and the preceeding RoR are pretty fun because you can modify the content and do some engineering. \n\nGmod had a pretty good playerbase of builders until the steampipe update. No one came back to the game except Rp kids. 
1	I was in a top 25 guild in WoW during Wrath. It was PVE content. Other than that, nope! 
1	Was GE / level 7 faceit when I played csgo.\nNow d3 in League
1	same exact thought process i have. Not suprised
1	Briefly held rankings in Scramble with Friends (mobile app) and Tekken (PSP). Shortly after I was annoyed by strategies of other ranked players and went on with life. Fuck it I did good enough for myself lol
1	I'm not a huge gamer, I mainly just play SW Battlefront 2, GTA 5, Minecraft, Halo, occasionally a Battle Royale game, and used to play League of Legends, but just for a few months.\n\nI've recognized in most video games I may reach like the top 25% or so in skills. Like I'll beat most regular people, but anyone somewhat competitive usually beats me.\n\nI've wondered if it's due to me overanalyzing instead of just performing the action as fast as possible 
1	Speaking very generally (as should always be the case with MBTI, right?), I think INTP gamers will generally do well in games that are about figuring out systems and efficiencies. Fine tuning builds and learning counters, etc. At least for me personally, I'm in my 30s and still choose gaming over TV as my relaxation activity. TV is passive, and therefore boring to me. Gaming gives me systems to play with and figure out, which is more satisfying.\n\nI was gladiator in WoW season 3, even tho i was super undergeared and still only had the season 1 shoulders. (I was probably semi-carried, honestly). Before that, I was a C-List WoW celebrity because of these goofy pvp videos I made. Seemed like everyone was making videos for meta race-class combos with maxed out gear. I made videos for my weird race-class combo and shitty gear, which gave my videos a fresh feel because I always felt like the underdog in each fight.\n\nSwitched to Starcraft 2. Had never seriously played an RTS and was losing 1v1 vs the computer, and in a few months went from that to ranking into diamond in solo queue.\n\nI've backed away from competitive gaming as I got older, but I'm super into a pve loot grinder game called Warframe that's massively complex.\n\nRecently, I had an interesting experience with my gaming group of friends from my WoW days. We went from WoW to Starcraft to League to Overwatch to PUBG. I was happy with WoW, Starcraft, League, got frustrated with Overwatch, and quickly grew to hate PUBG.\n\nIt led me to realize we had all been playing the same games, but for different reasons. One of the guys just liked the competition, no matter what form (ENTP, he thinks). One of us liked improving on the mechanical skills. For them, moving to PUBG was great. The first guy got epic battles that had impact, the other guy got a game where mechanical skill was supreme.\n\nHowever, there was nothing in PUBG for me. For me, I need a game that requires me to figure things out. PUBG didn't have that.\n\nThat's when I realized that I play games not for the competition and not for the skill, but for the ability to slam puzzle pieces together until I can see the entire big picture. Competition is often a byproduct, because it forces you to challenge your big picture against what someone else thinks the big picture is, but the competition is not the goal.\n\nDid not expect this to be such a long post, sorry. I'm just using this as an excuse to procrastinate from work right now.\n\nTLDR: yes.
1	Ha cool stuff. And yeah I think pubj is boring with no incentive to do well. Personally, Overwatch seems very low skill cap compared to other games. The reason I love WoW or what it used to be, is bc of what you said. In a n arena, both teams have to not only out mechanic eitheother, but sit and develop strats between every game for different teams and competitions. So strat is extremely important, which can alter in THOUSDANDS of different ways between target swapping and talent choices on top of positioning. The big picture just feels so satisfying in my head. Before mbti, I didn’t understand why I could form strats so well. Arena is just a big picture type battle with dynamic strats that can be adapted to between and during games.
1	I have a hard time taking competition seriously. I try to win, but I tend to judge success in a match more off how much weird stuff happens and less off whether I actually won. All my friends think I'm a troll, but I don't mean to be.
0	I used to have top percentage rankings on Mario Kart Wii online. But I'm enfp so yeah.
5	Is the need for civil debate an INTP trait or nah?	I love having group discussions about any topic where everyone can share a different opinion peacefully while still challenging and learning from one another. I can extract a deep analytical discussion from just about anything; I’m always thinking about what’s below the surface of an issue. I’m energized by super lively back and forths with ppl who have thought about something just as deeply as I have. I love being asked questions about what I think about something; anytime I can turn the wheels of my mind and speak my piece I’m excited to do so. \n\nUnfortunately my closest friends either don’t get the same rush as me from spirited discussion/debate or they resent me b/c they know I do and purposely avoid having analytical discussions w me. I don’t argue I’m always tactful and polite. nothing drains me more and makes me feel more worthless than meeting w ppl and having my ideas ignored or not being asked thoughtful questions or ppl not fully engaging in conversations. I find most my friends feel uncomfortable having “above the neck conversations” with me b/c either A) it’s annoys them or B) they think I’m a Know it All \n\nI just want to learn and conversation is a great way to learn. I feel so lonely not having many peers in my life to mentally spar with. I seem to be resented for this trait and not appreciated. \n\nIs this an INTP trait or nah?
7	I don't really like debate. I prefer discussion. \n\nHowever, I am an enneagram type 9 and debates register as conflict. If I'm interested in a topic, I want to know what you know and what you think, though. 
3	It seems to be a pretty common INTP trait, at least stereotypically. I know I feel the same way about feeling deprived of an "intellectual equal". Most people just assume I'm trying to cause trouble and tell me to stop arguing all the time, and they don't understand when I say, "I'm not arguing, I'm discussing."  \n\n\nI have one friend who's smart, but hates discussing things that he believes he's right about (ENTJ) and another who isn't always available, but if I can drag her out of her shell on a topic she's fun to engage (INTJ), another who doesn't mind discussing stuff but has different focuses from me (another ENTJ, also my best friend), and a friend who prefers listening to me moreso than challenging my beliefs (ISTP), which is fine from a friendship standpoint, but not very stimulating.  \n\n\nMost everyone else hates when I get into a debate-y mood and will either try to shut me down or get visibly grumpy with me, or just flat out struggles to keep up, which feels less rewarding because I'm just dominating the debate and not really getting to learn anything new.
2	In my personal experience, most definitely. Exploring different depths of a debate and unraveling contradictions is my soul (sole haha :)) purpose in life.
2	Civil debate is INTP and INTJ+ENTP. It's strictly anti-Feeler so if your friends don't like it then there's a good chance they are Feeler scum you should violently expel from your life as they are no more than cockroaches.\n\nJoyful debate is an ENTJ and INTJ+ENTP trait. It's strictly anti-Feeler so if your friends don't do it then there's a good chance they are Feeler scum you should violently expel from your life as they are no more than cockroaches.\n\nAs you can't really imagine joyful debate, you are INTP.\n\n> I find most my friends feel uncomfortable having “above the neck conversations” with me b/c either A) it’s annoys them or B) they think I’m a Know it All\n\nObsession with heads (figureheads, maiden heads, talking heads, head & shoulders) is xSFx. *ALL* of them without exception obsess over them, and use the word "head". Sometimes up to a half dozen times in a single sentence. In contrast, NTs rarely if ever use the word head in any form.\n\nKnow it all is archetype S110 babysitter / the countess / psychotherapist. Slaves dominate on the ENFx subreddits.\n\nIn other words, most of your friends are Feeler scum cockroaches that deserve to die.\n\nYou strike me as INTJ+ENTP more than INTP though. Probably you're INTP in one way, at the level of talking to strangers and using language, and INTJ+ENTP at the level of subgroups and heavy interactions. Almost certainly because dealing with scumbag cockroach incels injects entropy into your life pushing you rightwards to INTJ+ENTP.\n\nNote, I'm not a know-it-all teacher's pet like Hermione fucking Granger. I'm omniscient like God.
2	It usually takes my friends a while to realize I don't actually have a stance on the issue being debated, and I am only pointing out fallacies or additional context to help both sides break out of a loop of passion-filled nonsense and see the true complexity of the issue.
1	Yes, but civil as in civil war
2	Has anyone ever just randomly felt like breaking up with someone?	Has anyone ever just randomly felt like breaking up with someone? I just had a thought that maybe I'm not happy, although I can't identify a reason not to be happy, and I am really not sure if I am unhappy to begin with but I definitely got an urge to just end things with this guy.\n\nI will say that another guy I used to fuck around with sent me a text this morning too. I don't think that really had an impact but the naysayers may say otherwise.
5	Usually by the time you start to question whether or not you’re happy; you’re usually already unhappy. Listen to your intuition. Stray thoughts had to of come from somewhere.
5	Yeah. Then I remember I'm not in a relationship.
3	All the time.  This is why my relationships all last 1-6 months.
2	Why female INTPs get to be popular with the guys? 
2	No, especially considering I’ve never been in a relationship. But I’m only 16, just like half the people on this subreddit. My brain isn’t fully developed yet so I might not even be an INTP!
2	Bold of you to assume I've ever been in a relationship.
1	My realisation that my ex was an emotionally manipulative asshole was pretty random ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
2	Surface tension - this is my struggle...	
2	Why you shot me at the heart dude.
2	Alex Jones is a WWE character (like Hulk Hogan)	I've never seen more than 5 consecutive minutes of either medium, but I'm pretty sure it's an exact fit.

At the core of almost every 9/11 "truther" I listened to, was the following:\n\n*  the people responsible for 9/11 were rich, powerful, white men (probably straight and cisgender) (NOT muslims)\n\n*  people have to protect themselves from the police\n*  don't have unnecessary war

3	[Discussion] Early-childhood domestic abuse and their effects on the brain development	Note: I recommend watching the video. It's very entertaining and has some cool facts.  \nI've watched this video \[[Link](https://youtu.be/brVOYtNMmKk)\] recently and I could confirm that it's very real. As a child I had lots of domestic violence for being noisy or doing something inappropriate. As far as I am concerned one of the main effects is that I cannot **trust** people that easily, I have harder time developing relationships and friendships - although I am getting better - but I've always felt that it isn't one of my best skills. It feels very frustrating to know that your early-childhood could affect your life this much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: How was your childhood environment, and do you think it has affected you in a negative way, if so then how?** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	I was raised by abusive and neglectful parents. The abuse wasn't just physical, it was psychological as well. I'm quite confident that several papers about me would go a long way in the psychological world. In addition to the bullshit from my childhood, I also have PTSD  from multiple deployments while in the Army. I'm in counseling and working on being able to accept myself for who I am. I do have reservations about certain aspects though, such as why in the hell the world believes it necessary to pour over feelings and make them the focal point of the therapy. In my humble opinion the focus should be on the thought process and personal model of the world each person has. Or at the very least offered as a form of therapy because all this touchy feely bullshit is not for me.
3	My early environment had the outward appearance of "comfort and health."  The dark things that occurred were not acknowledged.  Because I noticed, I got called "crazy".  This has made me doubt myself.  Recently, this has been changing and I'm maybe going too far in the other extreme.\n\nAdditional points:\n\n*  some people are more biologically predisposed to be impacted by environment (positive or negative)\n\n*  children tend to pick up the energy of their environment.  if the environment is scary, trying to hide it from your child will not have the result you're hoping for.  I suggest using age appropriate language to acknowledge the existence of sad/scary stuff and reaffirm your love for the child.\n
1	My childhood environment was very positive I think and effected my siblings likewise, but for me it caused me to be this weird bipolar esque mess in all my thoughts. My parents were very supportive especially my mother, even now she always tries to tell me how attractive I am to boost my confidence, but then my siblings basically tormented me especially my older brother. I was a middle child so my older brother and younger sister would team up and fuck with me. Now I have this dissaray where I think I'm genius and fucking gorgeous and that I'm destined for greatness while also believing I don't deserve happiness and that trying in any aspect of my life is a waste of energy. I feel like the biggest contributing factor to this was my own overactive mind though. Very early I realized my own mortality and was a very anxious child. Thinking of all possibilities of all situations and realizing that even if the odds are very low for something to go wrong its also possible and I could be the one who's unlucky and flies out of their seat in a roller coaster or something. I'd constantly stay up at night petrified at the idea of afterlife. I didn't want to go to heaven based on the Christian teaching but I believed wholeheartedly cause I was raised to. I'll cut it off now and just say I think I was given everything I needed to develope as a child, but due to my anxiety and overthinking turning me overly apathetic I'm a lazy piece of shit anyways and will probably go nowhere in life.
1	What was Apple designers thinking with this?.... WHERE'S THE LOGIC?	I wanna vent. Fixed old iphone that I haven't touched in ages.. Don't remember passcode (I would probably be able to get in by now if it didn't lock itself out every damn time). Anyways I hope most of you can relate with why anyone would be pissed with this scenario. You HAVE finger print.. you HAVE access to the icloud account, BUT you still can't do anything about it? You can only go so deep into "security" before it literally becomes a handicap in of itself. What made the designers think "Oh 4 digits ought to be highest priority"... You got a finger print and other means of authentication... Do you not see where this is stupid?\n\nWe have means of proving identities in multiple ways!.. You can forget your Gmail password but then you can always use an alternate way to get back in. Maybe there is just something about keeping hands off any phone remotely that they're overly paranoid about that could lead to vulnerabilities and so decided to sandbox in a sense everything on the phone? And apparently backing up and syncing are 2 different things? For anybody who didn't know better about all these little yet significant details, pretty shitty about it. Sure at the end of the day I should have fixed it sooner and when I remembered, but I was way too irritated over a phone protector still being unable to do its damn job when this happened. BLAH... I mean it wouldn't hurt to create a closed off automated-non-human way of authenticating location you can send your phone to validate credentials which I know would just make it more vulnerable. To just lose all your photos and memories because of 4 stupid digits.. That's just not a valid option. Nope. I mean if there was a disclaimer upon setting up "touch id" when asking if you would like a passcode saying: "If you set this passcode, touch id would not work if you restart your phone to get on" maybe I would have thought more carefully about what I was doing... Unless they did in fact, but I really don't recall.
5	I understand you want to rant, but Apple didn't do this to upset you or because of bad design, it's a security feature, they actually designed it this way for good reason.\n\nI'm sorry, but it's you that is being a bit dumb, I understand you are frustrated, but it's not as simple as you make it out to be.\n\n\nTouch ID doesn't replace your passcode, it's designed to make it quicker and easier to access your phone. This is important because a strong passcode forms the foundation of your iOS device’s cryptographic protection. Apple actually use this passcode as part of the crypto key used to protect your device.\n\nApple use a "Secure enclave" which stores your important data, it doesn't have a picture of your fingerprint, instead it's a mathematical representation of your finger print. It needs this passcode to unlock that data, without it,  it can't access your fingerprint data, as it wouldn't make sense. This ensures your fingerprint data is kept save and even if someone could break into the phone, they wouldn't be able to extract your fingerprint from it. Apple was very careful about doing this, because they made fingerprint access to phones mainstream, they were very cautious of how they introduced this, knowing people wouldn't want to give up this data to Apple or want it stored in the cloud etc.\n\nIf you really wanna read how it works, Apple have a white paper on there website. Honestly you can bash Apple as much as you like, they certainly deserve some criticism, but they did a great job with the security and design with TouchID, it was way ahead of anything else on the market at the time and Apple still does a great job with security here.\n\nBut honestly this is not a dumb move by Apple, it's by some very smart design. If you forgot a four digit code, that's on you for setting it to something so random that you don't remember. \n

10	Yo, does using sun glasses in public or when talking to someone, make you feel more comfortable/confident?	Kinda want to try using sunglasses.
17	Idk but you sound pretty unconfident if you can't even decide whether to put on sunglasses or not.
8	I kinda think it's rude to talk to someone (who isn't a close acquaintance) with sunglasses on. \n\nSo I always make a point of removing them when I'm talking to someone.
2	Yes
2	No. And unless it’s a sunny day outside I don’t suggest wearing sunglasses if they are not needed.\n\nBecause it makes you look like a dick.\n\nEdit; lol! Master Roshi must be a dick then!
1	Sunglasses and Advil 
1	Sunglasses = no eye contact so yeah.
1	It makes me feel uncomfortable when other people do so I apply that and just don't do it to people. 
5	Percentage wise: How accurate would typing a person be based on their posts, comments and personal descriptions on their Reddit?	Let’s assume they post decently often and it’s about 12 posts a week or they have a large amount of posts from the past due to being on Reddit for quite a while.\n\nI’d say at MOST it would be about 35%.\n\nAlso, what would YOU type me as based on my types of posts, comments and personal description etc.\n\nI guess it’ll be a fun experiment. I’ll try some of the users here.\n
4	id say 70. but u have to understand profules are contextual. u asses a profile in that specific context. u cant assume how it happens outside

3	I've used Reddit a while and at two points in my life (unemployed) I've used Facebook. \n\nMuch of my Facebook history is me, probably inebriated, posting nonsense and finding it funny that people will find the posts very bizarre. Almost zero INTP showing but random articles and rarely a serious opinion/conversation.\n\nMy Reddit posts kinda lean INTP but I don't think it would be evident. I have this ADHD kinda thing going on that would throw people off.
3	6%. \n\nI think typing people based on their internet presence is absolutely ridiculous. 
3	It can definitely depend. For instance I had a fairly long day today, so my responses are probably more basic and shorter
1	Fi nightmares vs Ti nightmares	**Fi-dom**: Will I  find someone who will love me and accept me for who I am :'( ?\n\n**Ti-dom**: Are the number of primes finite or infinite ?
1	Comment threads checks out
1	Euclid proved thousands of years ago that there are infinitely many primes. Nightmare over.
1	Don't you want similar things to? It's just that Fi doms are more focused on creating their subjective ideal reality and want to be supported in that, and whereas Ti dom may be more focused on cracking the code of reality, and would want to be supported in that as well no matter how crazy it gets in that little head. 
4	"You tremble, carcass? You would tremble a lot more if you knew where I was taking you."	"You tremble, carcass? You would tremble a lot more if you knew where I was taking you."  \n\nQuoted by Nietzsche in *The Gay Science* and the moto behind his concept of "fearlessness" - it was pronounced by Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne (1611-1675) in the midst of battle. The French general, realising that his body was quivering, started talking to his "carcass", as if to a servant.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Excuse my French, but why was this hot?
2	Anxious about the future?	Hey, All!\n\nI'm wondering about how you cope with anxiety. I've always been anxious about never completing enough in my life. No matter how many goals I set or how many tasks I complete, I still get anxious about not completing the rest of my goals. I think half the problem, for me, is having so many things I want to do, but not enough motivation to do them, especially since I graduated from college.\n\nHow do you get out of anxious, unmotivated funks? Any ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!
3	I get those same emotions, but I try to always try to repeat a mantra that nothing matters and my happiness and fulfillment is no more important than whether or not I take a shit now or later. It's usually just, "you don't matter," or something like that on repeat in my head, but you can never avoid feeling the anxiety. It'll still happen it's just being able to tell yourself that you don't really care. I mean I only care with my emotions not my logic and I try to avoid emotions for most decisions so it's only right. But even if your anxiety ruins your life there's no reason for you or anybody to actually care at all. I mean we’re nothing and the universe provides us no sympathy after all.
3	Your anxiety is self induced.  You set goals for yourself, you don’t work towards them, so you get anxiety.  You can try to reduce your goals to one or two things.  If you can’t even achieve that, you really need to take a hard look at yourself.  How badly do you want to reach those goals?  What are you willing to sacrifice?  If you’re not willing to sacrifice your time and luxuries, you don’t want it bad enough.  \n\nI have the same problem.  I try to resolve it by simplifying my life to remove distractions and stressors.  There was a point where I got rid of my tv, smartphone, internet at home.  I’ve added them back in and they’ve become distractions again.  I need another reset.
422	You literally gotta hit some people with the obvious for them to actually realise it...🤓	
55	And then you get Creutzfeld-Jakobs disease

3	The hunger problem naturally will occur in a different scenario than the population problem, I.e., New York has a population problem but not a hunger problem. Central Africa has a hunger problem but doesn’t contribute much to the degrading of the ecosystem so canibalism is moot. 
4	Neither of those are actually problems. The world should be able to support a few billion more people no problem, and we already have more food than everyone could ever possibly eat. It’s just that we throw most of it away. The problem we face is greed.

1	plot twist: gibby uses stop sign to kill and eat spencer
1	Here are my main issues with this:\n1) there isn't a lack of food. It is merely too expensive to distribute.\n2) how do you deside who lives and who dies? Is it unhealthy people? If so you might be stunting humanity from progressing as they might be intelegent people. Also fat is not a good source of food, it tastes bad and it's unhealthy, making more people unhealthy and killing more people. Muscle is what is needed to provide a good source of food. So do we eat healthy people? Healthy people are needed for manual labor so it would be dumb and it would be difficult for unhealthy people to "man handle" healthy people making the possibility of this happening too small. Do we eat dumb people? Simply put, no, we need them to do the simple shit so that intelegent people can further human progress.\n3) over population isn't an issue its just that some places are densely populated such as city's ect.\n4) eating humans could potentially lead to a plethera of unknown diseases and further any known diseases.
3	INTP paradox of motivation	If you give an ENTP a box of sand, their Ne will come up with possibilities for it and their Ti will be used in service to Ne to understand how to create it. The aux function is confined to the dominant function in this way, and Xe(Te, Fe, Ne, Se) functions want to be expressed externally. For INTP this means that playing with the sand they would need some goal and then Ti would define the parameters of the goal, using Ne to then perceive possibilities for how one would produce that in the external world.\n\nThe problem is that since Ti is the dominant function, INTPs, and all introverts, will find little motivation to actually materialize the thing. They are satisfied with knowing they could do it/make it if the time or need came.\n\nTi requires a goal to operate and define the essence of what is to be done. Ti, like any judging function is developing knowledge of objects, to manipulate them fundamentally, and the self(to manipulate the self).\n\nManipulating objects is good for reaching a goal that requires external objects. Anxiety will be reduced as you can control over the future production of your needs, which you can know by listening to your emotions. Food, water, shelter, relationships would be initial oned that are well known. But happiness is the goal behind all of these, and as you gain control over these external needs the yield of external goals will go down. Externals goals being abstract representations of your values and needs. You become less focused on the produce of the work and more on the process of doing your dominant function. Ti requires a goal to operate, but its goal is to perform Ti. Performing the dominant brings you excitement. The problem for INTP and ISTP is that this is a paradox...I need an external goal to perform Ti in the first place, but the only intrinsic goal in the timeless context(after we can sufficient control over reality) is to enjoy the process of using Ti. To enjoy Ti I need a goal...but the goal is to use Ti.\n\nThen the problem becomes defining a valid external goal, but the problem is that if yield has gone down from external goals, then there is no reason to desire any goal. Your needs are met. I tend to turn towards competition that utilizes Ti as a sort of pseudo motivation, because it has meaning in serving your team(an Fe goal). There is also "helping others" through achieving their goals, but this too will pass as we reach higher levels of ability to manipulate reality(especially as VR is developed).\n\nThen I ask myself, what if nobody existed, to which I would say....idk what a valid goal would be anymore. Hell even when I used to play call of duty, a meaningless game, I would greatly enjoy myself, but I also was trying to work towards goal. Being top of the leaderboard, maintaining some KDA. But in hindsight I can't help but think that these were motivated not by me, but by the desire for respect and admiration from peers.\n\nDiving into goal meaninglessness would be delving into the paradox of needing a goal to use Ti yet the goal being to use Ti(as using Ti brings happiness). This sounds like it'd lead to INTP and ISTP being perpetually in existential crisis. The problem being not having a problem and Ti eating away at itself forever to find some external goal that would motivate it to do anything at all(analyze and orient oneself towards a goal).\n\nI do think that diving into your feelings is THE way to understand goals that exist for you, but I fear they are quite temporary. Anxiety over food can be solved in the future, anxiety over shelter can be solved, etc etc projected onto approaching infinite manipulation of external objects in the future. When external desires fade you start to lean on enjoying the process of what you are doing(using your functions), it just seems like Ti intrinsically has to set a goal, an external desire, to operate. I set goals for myself from my feelings, but it is hard to buck the underlying "why am I doing anything at all."
6	Over-analysis leads to nihilism. Yes you can always question why you're doing something, but let's be honest that gets depressing and pretty fucking boring. Why not just jump into the game knowing that because there are no rules to goal setting, you can set your own?\n\nThe solution to existential crises is easy: think less and do more. \n\nI'd highly recommend reading some Nietzsche if you keep running down the nihilism path. He's got some pretty sound logic about why it sucks and what some better alternatives are.

3	INTPs who are in the entertainment industry	Can you think of any? I am genuinely curious. 
5	Keanu Reeves isn't INTP, but he seems like it and plays as them in some movies. He's very relatable introvert/thought wise 
3	Kristen Stewart if you watch her interviews, Jesse Eisenberg, Ashley Olsen, Ellen Page
2	Apparently M.I.A., Mark Mothersborough and Aphex Twin are musicians?\n\nAsia Carrerra is an INTP...ahem...actress 
2	maybe Bill Nye?  Although he strikes me as more of an ENTP\n\nTina Fey is apparently INTP as well as Meryl Streep, and Kristen Stewart \n\nIt appears all the entertainer INTPs lean female
1	https://www.idrlabs.com/intp.php\n\nThis is a good list although I'm not quite sure how accurate it is.
1	Probably a bunch of cinematographers.
1	Jonathon Stewart maybe
0	Aubrey plaza is pretty INTP. Love her
0	Fake science admirers *rant*	This is an issue I believe to be stemming from shows like Joe Rogan's: It is hosted by an idiot who is talking to scientists he can't really understand and then it is transmitted to dumb youth who often don't understand the information and in the end, all they can grasp is a materialistic sense of progress.\n\n"Wouldn't AI be cool"\n\n"Wouldn't going to Mars be cool"\n\n"That would be cool"\n\n"coooooolll"\n\n"Wouldn't having space diamonds and space gold be cooool"\n\n"Wouldn't being able to fly be cooool"\n\n"Wouldn't us getting free advanced things from these discoveries be coooool"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only thing these simpletons want is for things to be cool and potentially immediately beneficial to their lives in magnificent ways. I'm sick of talking to self proclaimed "science enthusiasts" that are no more than glorified equivalents of Comicbook Guy.
2	>The only thing these simpletons want is for things to be cool and potentially immediately beneficial to their lives in magnificent ways\n\nThen call me a simpleton.\n\nScience is but a servant to humanity. Who reserves admiration for their lowly servant?\n\nBtw, if I stopped you in the street and asked you to tell me how your cellphone works, could you truthfully tell me?
2	What field are you researching in? \n\nI only ask because I’m about halfway through my MSc and happen to love the Joe Rogan Podcast. He never claims that he has any scientific knowledge and is really deferent to his guests. \n\nSure, he probably does find things beyond his comprehension ‘cool’, but fortunately for us, he actually has a platform to indulge that curiosity for everyone’s benefit. Just remember here that you don’t have to pay Joe a penny to listen to his show. \n\nTake away what you will, but don’t trash popularising science. Who knows, maybe some undecided kid who listens to Joe Rogan decides to go to college to do medicine, or astro-physics, or evolutionary psychology cos he heard someone on the podcast talking about a topic he’d not even considered, but thinks ‘that’s cool’ enough to go into the field and actually contribute to the knowledge pool.\n\nThat is, instead of listening to it and thinking ‘HAH, mere mortals and their poor comprehension of science. That’s not *real* science, only a real scientist publishes in obscure journals that these peons have never even heard of’. Which is ultimately no less of a neckbeard attitude than the neckbeard attitude you’re raging against. 
1	Not too much of a problem in his case, the constrast is clear since you can see the interviewed know a lot more than him. And he doesn't pretend he knows, so what's the problwm ?\n\nAre you gatekeeping, Op ?\n\nI'm more annoyed by the crowd that like science when it is on their side. Be it the conservative talking "science" when it's transright, but ignoribg it when it's climate warming, and vice versa with democrats on the same topic, with the added bonus of false knowledge : "98% of scientists believe in climate warming". Thoses idiots don't understand shit, science isn't about belief. They are just as bas as the denying crowd.
1	I never saw it as something worth getting so stressed and annoyed about. If anything it’s a form of flattery. Why do you think joe has those guests? He’s hopelessly interested in it but recognizes that he isn’t exactly wired to dive deep into it so he at least makes an effort to understand it. Which is endearing in its own right. In my mind he’s basically saying “you guys are so smart I couldn’t possibly do what you do”

20	I can't empathize with others.	Alright, so, a few days ago I took one of those 16 personality tests, and I was marked as INTP. So, I figure if I posted this here, I would get some like minded responses perhaps? I'm trying to actually talk to people/start a discussion about this, but, I'm not getting any responses elsewhere, haha.\n\n(Disclaimer: I am 16 and I have Aspergers, ADHD, and general Anxiety and possibly some other undiagnosed shit, if that may help.)\n\nI'm posting this here out of a feeling that I could find some people who relate. It's pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. I have extreme difficulties empathizing with anyone/mirroring their emotions. When someone tells me something really bad that has happened, I don't know how to empathize with them. I just say 'Oh, that sucks'. When my granpda died and my mom told me, I just said 'Oh, that's awful' and my mom called me 'cold-hearted' for not having an emotional response. I obviously didn't WANT my grandpa to be dad, but I just couldn't cry about it or give the 'correct' emotional response. When someone tells me something exciting, I don't get the 'OH!! WOAH!! THANK YOU!!" response, and I don't even know how to fake it. All I know how to do is say 'Thanks.", but that just sounds so cold. Like, when I see those videos of people getting over the top gifs and they are jumping around and cheering, I just don't understand. How long am I supposed to do that? What exactly am I supposed to say? Etc. When someone starts crying around me about something I am obviously SUPPOSED to feel sad about, I just can't do it or muster up an appropriate response. I just stare and feel awkward and I don't know how to reciprocate.\n\nI suspected this was just me having teen angst and all that, but, this has been a constant variable in my life long before I was at the teenager part of my life. I have vivid memories of me as a young elementary school kid not knowing how to 'correctly' display or reciprocate emotions and me not understanding how to empathize with other people. I don't view other people as.. humans that can really do anything. If something doesn't directly affect me and my life, I don't know how to address it and I don't care about it or have any empathy to the situation. I view others as roadblocks, if anything. (As bad as that sounds.) even people that are supposed to be really close to me. I UNDERSTAND how people feel, but I just can't empathize or sympathize with them or understand how I am supposed to respond.\n\nThis isn't to say I don't feel emotions at all. I get angry a lot and I feel.. bad? Like a sense of unease and sadness. I just don't know how to show it or do it like everyone else does, and this has been a problem for my entire life. A recent example came with this thing we did at school where everyone was talking about extreme issues in their lives and suicide and depression, and the majority of the audience started hugging and crying and I just couldn't do it. I could understand why they were so sad, but I just didn't FEEL it. I obviously cried as a child, but for the past atleast 4-5 years, crying has been a beyond rare event and only sorta happens when something really bad happens specifically to me. (And even then, like I said, it's really rare) I hope this doesn't come off as edgy because I'm not trying to be, I'm just describing.\n\nAnyways, thanks and much appreciated if you want to respond. :)
13	 Your outward emotional response is different than your internal emotions.  This does not mean that you are heartless.  It means that the people around you have difficulty reading subtle emotional cues.  \n\nImagine you made a finely detailed piece of art and showed it to someone who had poor vision.  They may say "I just see lines and whatever."  Is the problem with your art, or how they're receiving it?\n\nNow, it's your job to help the person properly see your art.
19	You’ll probably start to figure yourself out in your late 20s.\n\nSeems common with INTPs.\n\nEdit: Don’t every try and solve your issues using drugs. It’ll work at first - but then it won’t. And you’ll have more problems.
5	For starters, trust your emotions. Don’t feel forced to give an emotional response. If you’re not there to feel for your grandfather, you’re not there. Don’t let anyone guilt you for not being there. You are keeping yourself safe. And maybe there’s something that feels unsafe about it to you. But you gotta feel safe to do what’s right with you to be more empathetic.
4	I find it is similar for me. I am very good at reading people and will often detect subtle facial expressions or predict  future actions even when extroverted, "people people" cannot. \n\nI can almost always tell when someone is nervous, when someone is preoccupied, when someone is irritated at me, when someone is attracted to me, when someone is lying to me, when someone is contemptful of me. \n\nBut although I know their emotions, I do not truly empathize or sympathize because their emotional state has no affect on me. I do not "feel" their emotions, I am simply aware of them.  I am terrible at providing emotional support or letting people vent because I really do not care that much and lose interest.
3	This may or may not be reassuring: I'm a 30 y/o woman and I relate with *a lot* of this.\n\n>Like, when I see those videos of people getting over the top gifs and they are jumping around and cheering, I just don't understand.  How long am I supposed to do that? What exactly am I supposed to say? \n\nSo relatable. I think this is hard because other people also don't *know* how to do it, they just do it. It comes as naturally to them as internalizing the emotions comes to us. The problem is this doesn't present the "correct" response to people and so they misread you as being unfeeling when in fact, you're feeling in your own way but just not outwardly expressing.\n\nI don't know if I was always like this because it was only pointed out to me in college (otherwise I wouldn't have know how people perceive my reactions as non-reaction). I imagine it's why I had a hard time making friends in high school. High school is all about fitting in and behaving as expected. In adult life I've found people who appreciate me for my intellect and curiosity, even if they have a hard time understanding me on an emotional level.\n\n> I don't view other people as.. humans that can really do anything.\n\nThis part I don't relate to. I'm not sure what you mean. Like do you just not feel for/with them, or do you really think they are worthless?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, you're not alone and you're not wrong for not being as expressive as other people want you to be. It could help to try to explain that you just process emotions differently and just because they can't see it on your face doesn't mean you aren't feeling it. One of the craziest things about humans is that we still can't accurately describe emotions to each other. Using the exact same example: my grandpa passed recently and I didn't cry much. I feel the grief sort of like a cobweb enveloping my brain and slowing all my processes. My mom might feel it more as somebody squeezing her heart with a vice. She might cry a lot, while I will just sit and stare. Neither is the "right" way to feel, people are just going more readily see her way.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I think you will find a lot of company here. The idea that INTPs do not experience emotions is just flat wrong. We are just as emotional as anyone else, but we process emotions intellectually. I started doing that as a defense to how I thought the world was treating me. Maybe if you started by accepting that you do feel those emotions, it would be a start.\n\nBe very wary of the Aspergers diagnosis. You will know if you have ADHD and anxiety.  But Aspergers is just a label that people put on you because of how you were acting at the moment. If you are like me, then you learned to route your emotions through your mind, and you have numbed yourself.\n\nI really did not begin to change until I was 20, and the change was halting. I realized that I did not connect with anyone, and if you are not connected, then you will not feel any emotions. Learning to connect with people has been a long journey, but well worth it. I am now 54 and connected to my wife and my two sons. I still am not as connected as I would like to be with other people, but I am still working on it.\n\nFor me, it was important to realize that this process was not a rejection of who and what I was.  It was just growth. I am reading a book right now called *The Happiness Hypothesis* by Jonathan Haidt. It has grabbed me like nothing I ever read before.  It really set me on firm ground.\n\nI also found that connecting to people here was a huge help. I understand the people here, and many of them sort of understand me. So it was less effort to connect to them, and I realized that I really care about people that I only know here.\n\nYou sound sad and a bit lonely.  You don't have to be. Stop believing that your mind has all the answers and experience life.
3	To preface this, I have all of the listed things that you have. I also have Bipolar II (You should look into speaking with a therapist that specializes with Bipolar disorder to see if you have that).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe truth is you can fully emphasize; probably more so than the average person. You have problems with "sympathy." Crying and losing your shit when a loved one dies is something that is mediated by our sympathetic nervous system ( which primarily controls flight or fright). The issue with individuals with aspergers is that unlike neurotypical individuals, we have to manually process incoming information.\n\nWe are bombarded with body language that the vast majority of individuals are able to filter out and automatically respond to. But as INTPs, our Ne is activated and set into overdrive when we are reading body language and contextualizing emotional events. When my father died, I did not cry or even feel like crying because my Ne inner monologue was something like  "father was constantly in pain, constantly suffering and unhappy. I am sad that I won't be able to have conversations anymore, but objectively this was inevitable. I have prepared for this moment for two years and as such the 'pain' of losing my father was diffuse across 2 years."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you get older, probably within another 10 years, you will learn how to "fake" Se in order to outwardly show the alligator tears that are expected of you. But until then, the best way for you to show others that you care about significant events like this one is to return to your "safeplace": whichever place makes you feel the most comfortable and refuse to interact unless you absolutely have to. Of course, as a 16 year old this will be difficult because you are expected to be places where you don't want to be but the only way you can show that something bothers you significantly is to retreat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe TL;DR is that as a neuroatypical individual who is also INTP, your empathy is so strong that it often comes across as a complete lack of empathy. This is exacerbated by the fact that most people, even highly educated people, constantly confuse sympathy with empathy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to cause problems for you, but I recommend you confront your mother about how she made you feel by calling you cold-hearted. Shitty statements like that can affect you for decades at a subconscious level only to come crashing out during a therapy session.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI super relate to these struggles because at around the age of 16 i stopped crying all together save for those moments when I am alone and I can't help but let the rivers flow. It does not mean that you are not empathic, it does not mean that you are not a good person, it does not mean that you are cold hearted. What it does mean is that unlike most people, in the face of adversity, you are able to keep a cool, level head which is often exactly what is needed to de-escalate a situation.
2	Ucchh, unless you're a sociopath, yes, you can. And if you were a sociopath you wouldn't even be feeling bad about this.\n\nErgo, yes, you can empathize.\n\nTo expand, your Ne and Se may be under-activated. You need to get out of your situation both physically and mentally in order to spark new ideas, experiences, and contacts.\n\nI literally realized yesterday that my life from like, 4 years old to 16 were really...gray. And the reason is because I was around mostly the same people for like 12 years straight. It wasn't until I left home, then left my state, then my country that my memories became progressively "brighter". I really did have to keep moving in order to slow down and smell the roses. \n\nIn all, you need more Ne/Se experiences in order to empathize fully with people. GET OUT. Go explore.
1	It's totally normal, but it is going to cause you some problems.  In me it caused a tendency towards solipsism, and a disregard for other's emotions that has lost me a lot of friends, or prevented me from making them. \n\nI didn't actually have emotions until I had a kid, and I didn't have a kid until I was 41.  \n\nI mean...  I had emotions, but they were small things.  Nothing like the crazy terror/love that I've felt afterwards.  \n\nSo... my advice... is make it to 41, and have a kid. 
1	I felt the same way about my grandparents funeral. No tears no real surprise honestly. You should never feel obligated to fake an emotion you’re not feeling in the moment. If you really want to start developing your emotional intelligence then strive to learn something new about yourself every day. MBTI is a great place to start. I recommend learning the cognitive functions and how they work. It’s a little involved but in my experience they’ve been crucial to learning about myself and have helped me tremendously in terms of confidence and general ease of life. Oh and learn to love yourself. Be more forgiving of the way you are and relish in any victories you may have. No matter how small. Good luck :)
1	It's okay.\nYou're not alone.\nYou'll improve later on.
1	You only felt a sense of sadness? Or am I reading that sentence wrong? Have you felt so sad that it made you cry? So much that you can't take it anymore and your body shuts down. Or so much that it resembles physical pain? Like a sting in your chest? Like losing a pet or loved one, or being rejected by someone is usually the hardest on me.\n\n\nWhat about joy? A warmth in your chest that makes your body want to explode and dance almost? Like I felt first time watching my favorite movie. Or when a new game is coming out, or when going on a date with someone. \n\n\nEmpathy is a tricky word that seem to mean multiple things that in my opinion should be split into multiple new words.  In one sense it's the ability to accurately read the emotions from other people. Some are bad at it for different reasons. Some might have the skill well developed if they paid attention, but are uncomfortable with much eye contact and don't pick up on all the signs for that reason alone. Does that mean they have low empathy? Maybe practically, but not really. While others overdo it, picking up on small signs and apply loads of non-existing emotions that aren't even there. People often think I'm sad or angry, when I'm just neutral. These are the types that will often be hailed as people with great empathy. Which is only true to a degree.\n\n\nAnother common part of the definition of having high empathy is the ability to react appropriately. But this will depends on your society. It will also vary between people. I don't like people touching me, especially not when I'm sad. But in western society that's apparently a technique to comfort people. So... Maybe if I was in certain East-Asian cultures I would have a higher empathy? That doesn't make any sense. We need better concepts and words here.\n\n\nA third aspect  is the ability to feel the same emotions that others are showing. For example feeling sadness yourself when you see others cry. Which is also complicated. It involves the first ability, to accurately read the emotions from others. I'm not very good at that myself when it comes to nuances. Yet I always burst into tears when watching shows like "Got Talent" because I feel the happiness from others intensely when it's made obvious enough. So in one sense I have extremely high empathy, even though I'm bad at picking up the signs. Also, how much you relate to the reason a person is feeling as matters. For example if a billionaire is truly devastated that they lost 1 million... I can accept that they genuinely feel bad, and I understand it to a degree. But it's so out of my world that I my brain doesn't relate at all and I feel no empathy for them. Even if they're crying and showing all the signs that I might otherwise feel tons of empathy for. (Do billionaires do this? Maybe it was a bad example, what about someone who loses a)\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these nuances? Where do you fit in here?
0	ADHD is a made up disease so don't go around feeling bad for yourself.  It was invented to shame young boys for being... young boys in the government prison, I mean schools.  \n\nI don't mirror emotions because I find it incredibly manipulative.  You cannot possibly share an emotion with someone, so I don't insult peoples intelligence by pretending I am.  \n\nI also don't like to use people as emotional toxic waste dumping grounds.  I try to present a fairly consistent state forward to the world, despite how I feel.  If I am really happy or really upset I will let it out sometimes, but I try not to let the slight variations in my state be used like a weapon to control other people.  
3	Please Help Me	I'm 13 years old and live in Australia, and I'm having some issues in life that I think might be derived from my personality traits, so I'm hoping that there's an adult on here who's gone through a similar situation and has a solution for me.\n\nFor context, my dad is an INTJ that can relate to me in many ways, and my mother is an ISFJ who I love, but struggles to relate to me sometimes. I've spent most of my life trying to get into a prestigious selective school in the city, and it's important to note that this was my choice and my parents weren't pressuring me, merely supporting me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year the exam to get into the school I'm aiming for is happening, and because of that my exam prep has gone up in intensity a lot. At first I was fine with this, but over time it's started to feel like too much work and I don't feel as though I have enough free time nowadays. I wanted to approach my mother about this, and explain to her how I felt as though I couldn't keep up with all the work and was questioning whether or not this was the best choice for me.\n\nToday after school I walked over to my mother and said "I don't want to go to **insert prestigious school** I want to stay at **Insert current school" (**At the moment I go to a catholic school, and while by no means is it a bad school, my education won't be extended here.)\n\nI hadn't though about how I should actually be phrasing it, and because of that she misinterpreted it as "I don't care about my education anymore." We had a long discussion about it, and it eventually ended with her saying "I don't think you understand how this is going to impact your life, and we'll talk about this more when your father get's home (he's currently on a work trip in America.)\n\nHow can I explain to my mother how I feel about this and how can I deal with the amount of work I'm doing?\n\n&#x200B;
5	You're in a really tough situation.\n\nI went to a selective school in Australia, I wouldn't say that the education I got was any better than if I had gone to a state/private school. That said, I was never one to do well in a formal education setting.\n\nI say this to set my position and to make it easier for you to understand where I'm coming from.\n\nFirst up (and in no particular order), there's a few things you might want to consider:\n\nWill you be happy if you don't go to the selective school?\nHow much prolonged stress can you take?\nIf you don't get into the selective school, what's your backup?\nIf you go to the selective school (and your friends don't), you'll have to make new friends.\nUnless you live in a crappy part of your city, the education you get at a non-selective school will give you the access to the same opportunities.\n\nIf you decide that you want to stay at your Catholic school, you can extend your education with private tutelage.\n\nWherever you go to school, you have to be happy. If you aren't, you won't apply yourself and you won't reach whatever goal you have. Trust me on this. I'm an INTP too, and I know when I'm not happy I shutdown and won't apply myself to anything.\n\nSomething else you might want to consider is this: it's better to be a top student in a middling school than an average student in a great school. I'm not 100% on if things are still this way, but they used to base your UAI (or whatever the fuck they call it these days) on a bell curve. The grades of top students at middling schools were pushed higher because of the rest of the student body. On the other hand, if you're at a school where everyone is getting 80 - 100% on everything, well, someone's going to be pushed towards the lower end of that bell curve.\n\nJust a bit about me: I had no goals do I had no reason to apply myself. I'm intelligent, but have no direction. Well, that's not true. I don't care about work, my goal (I detest the word, and concept for that matter) is self-actualisation. My IQ would easily get me into Mensa (it gives me pleasure that SJWs would "reeeeeee!" at the thought of IQ determining intelligence, haha). I'm a bit drunk and not really sure where I was going with this...\n\nAnyway, the biggest thing is this: you have to be happy with whatever choices you make. You're parents aren't going to live your life for you. In fact, no one can do that but you. Figure out what you want and chase it. If that means no selective school, so be it. Take a few days to think about it, when your dad gets home from his trip, sit both your parents down and say to them "mum & dad, this is what I want from my life and this is how you can help support me to achieve my goal". Good luck 😉\n\nOh, and one last thing. It's ok to change your plans on the fly. Life is for living, not for planning. If all you are doing is planning for this and working towards that, are you really living your life? You have to make time for fun. Seriously. You can't be waiting to have fun or waiting to live, that's a wasted opportunity. In the end, it all boils down to something Yoda said: Do or do not; there is no try. It's the same with fun.\n\nAnyway, good luck and let us know what happens after your dad gets home and you talk to him 
1	I've been in this situation as well. but i didn't really pressure myself lol\ni's say it was a less than normal effort on my part. but i still got in.\n\nit's better if you just take the exam and see how things go. without any pressure.\neven if you don't get in, you'd be still happy that you tried. \n\nbut i assume the school you're talking about would be more strict than usual. \nif that's the case i wouldn't recommend going to such school. \n\nmy school was like this too. i was supposed to stay there for 3 years, but i switched it after 2 years. \nthey thought more hours in school/ homeworks/projects or stricter teachers were what we needed. but all it did was make me more depressed, antisocial, friendless. (maybe that's how i turned out as Intp. idk 😂)\n\nbtw, I live in the middle east, so I don't really know how education system works in Australia/America/Europe etc.
1	I can't forget my ex (sorry for my english )	my GF broke up with me last weeks, she was my first love and we dated for 3 years . Didnt even have a fight .she even bought me a ps4 last month.  i love her a lot.Right now , i can't sleep , or eat. We used to do everything , even bath together .

So I go to the gym everyday , and stop drinking alcohol ,but i'm still can't. i dont know how to forget her. pls help\n\n Sorry for any spelling mistakes. English is not my first language. 
6	Sorry to hear that man.  You’re addicted to her like a drug.  Now that you can’t get the drug, your body is going through withdrawls.  You’ve doing the right thing, avoid alcohol and drugs.  Keep exercising, keep finding ways to improve yourself.  Start studying how to become more attractive and improve your social skills.  You just have to give it time, everyone’s gone through what you’re going through at some point in their lives.\n\nThe only shortcut I know, and this isn’t easy, is to move away for at least a few months.  Start a new life, have no reminders of her.  
2	i’m sorry friend - these things just take time. my worst heartache took several years to get over. you are in the worst of it right now. i promise it gets better!  hugs. 
2	It will get better over time, but the best thing that will make the biggest impact is finding a new girl. Or rebound sex/ONS. The more attractive and fun she is the better. Though I would personally wait a few weeks longer. 3 years is a while.\n\nA less emotional way, is to realize the not so obvious truth that your time with her would end eventually anyway. That's how this world works. And most people have multiple relationships in their life. She is not yours, it was just your turn with her.
1	You never really get over your first.\n\n
18	Motivation-less idiot and a master procrastinator. Help me.	I'm currently in my last year of high school but I still have zero motivation to study. I've always tried to plan my day to study but ended up procrastinating. I believe this is a serious problem. My grades are terrible. \n\nHigh achieving INTP's I beg you to give me advice on how to overcome this. What makes you work harder? 
22	Stop providing yourself with dopamine when you dont deserve it. (Excessive gaming, television watching, use of social media, binging YouTube, consuming addictive materials, jerking off etc...)\n\nWork = reward.  \n\nIf you constantly trigger the reward center of your  brain without actually doing any work, its like sending a message that says "merely EXISTING is work, so heres a bonus".\n\nThis will make it very difficult for you to justify doing real work, because it will feel like extra... after all, if you can get a reward without work, why work?\n\nYou need to teach your brain that work equals reward on a subconscious level. So if you want something, first you need to DO something. Even if its as simple as "before i check my phone, i need to work out"  or  "before i play PUBG, i need to finish X amount of this homework."
9	Competition helps me with my procrastination 
8	Eh, the secret is I don't. I always work at 100 or zero, there's no in between. When I'm in school I'll give my tasks 100% effort, trying my best to make things work, but once I get home I just kinda stop caring. My off time is my off time and I spend it doing whatever I want. The only reason I'm not failing my classes this year compared to the last couple years is that I don't have a lot of homework, and I use my study hall class to get what little I do have done.\n\nIdk if this makes sense to you at all, but maybe try using any time in which you typically feel productive to get done what you need done.
6	HUGE LIFE CHANGE FOR ME.\n\nI'm only 19 years old, so I am only a year or two ahead of you. Keep that in mind as you're reading this.\n\nMy senior year, I had everything going for me. 4.0GPA I naturally didn't have to work for. Full ride to uni. Girlfriend of two years headed to same School as I. Even involved in sports. However, I pretty much had it all taken from me, no fault of my own. I began having 2-3 seizures a day, got pulled out of school in November, GPA dropped to 3.2, I had a neurosurgery, broke up with my girlfriend, attempted suicide, and ended up in a psych hospital.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was the best thing that ever happened to me. I pretty much said fuck it, I only have one life, and found my passion in the midst of it. I told myself to forget about pleasing others and fulfilling their standards, and fulfill my "True Purpose" if you will. I went to a young men's discipleship program for eight months, graduated in April of 2018, have been working my ass off ever since, and $15,000 later, just started a coffee shop ministry, that provides tuition to the aforementioned discipleship program to suicidal teens and addicts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you find the purpose, then you will find the passion. Say "fuck it." Drop everything. Forget about impressing others, and you will create a legacy that lives far longer than you will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, all those people who told you, "Wow, you're like the smartest kid I know." will turn into, "What happened to him/her?" or condescendingly, "It's good that you're happy." Use these comments as fuel. Also, look up Albert Einstein's testimony. That could be you.
3	There are plenty of reasons why you might have zero motivation to study. I take it that none of your studies has captured your imagination. People make the mistake of thinking that they cure procrastination overnight. Procrastination is a habit that you developed over many years, and life does not let you make huge changes overnight.\n\nFor me, procrastination was partly  the result of my brain always wanting to take things to the extreme, the big picture. Small steps seemed to inconsequential to care about, and I could never finish the big plans. I had to tech myself that the small steps are the important ones and to reduce things to what I could and would do. Whenever I made a list, it had way more than I could do. But I felt like I should be able to.\n\nConsider thinking about what would make you happy. Many people feel obligated to aim for futures that they really don't want. If you find your passion, then decide to make it happen. And cut yourself some slack. You are not a failure because you have not lived up to the expectations of others. Nothing you can do at your age will really fuck up the rest of your life. Tell yourself, "I am OK," and then keep repeating it until the voices in your head stop arguing. \n\nYou are an introspective person, which is good but also comes at a cost. Know that you will be unfairly critical of yourself, and don't believe your own criticisms.  You will do great.
9	"High achieving INTPs"\n\n\n..... lol
2	Best advice I can give is to reduce the time u spend on ur phone.
1	Nothing will help. You’re fucked. Only possible way to get anything done is to work toward your interests. Basically, if you don’t have the motivation to do it. It won’t get done. Better off just realizing that instead of working against yourself out of some idea that you have free will.
1	Just stop procrastinating lmao
1	Grab a really diligent person to study with. It motivates me when others are being productive and the mood just gets me too.
1	This sounds like me. A similar thing happened to me in my last year of high school.\n\nYou don't sound INTP or NT as I can tell. You sound ENF.
6	Quote from writer who was in Siberian gulags.	"Friendship is not born in conditions of need or trouble. Literary fairy tales tell of ‘difficult’ conditions which are an essential element in forming any friendship, but such conditions are simply not difficult enough. If tragedy and need brought people together and gave birth to their friendship, then the need was not extreme and the tragedy not great. Tragedy is not deep and sharp if it can be shared with friends. Only real need can determine one’s spiritual and physical strength and set the limits of one’s physical endurance and moral courage.”\n\n-Varlan Shalamov\n\nThis is relevant when someone says they "had Major Depression" but got through it by ___________________  (happy music, tv shows, a good meal with a friend, inspiring Youtuber, etc).\n\nYou know what I mean.  \n\nGatekeeping?   Consider yourself lucky that you don't measure the length of your suffering in decades.\n
4	I read the Kolyma Tales by Shalamov. Truly chilling and incredible that anyone could survive those conditions, let alone not lose the will to live. 
2	I think he is wrong. Adversity happens, but it is not necessary for friendship. The fact that some people suffer for decades does not diminish the depth or value of my friendships with people who share no adversity with me.
1	diet	 I am unable to diet and I do not know why, and it is very annoying to think that I have been trying for more than a year without getting it. 
2	"Dieting" is a vague goal. You need a reason for the diet change and variables to control
1	What is there to try? You do less when you are dieting than when you are not dieting. How can you fail at doing less?
1	Dieting doesn’t work anyway, its more important to make lifestyle changes and exercise\n\nWhen you diet, your body goes “uh oh, food is scarce, better hang on to every last ounce of energy and ratchet up the eating drive in this idiot to go find food”.\n\nI think fasting is the best way to “diet”.  I do a 24 hour fast once every week to give my digestive system a break.\n\nThe first meal is the WORST, but after you go long eough and your body just accepts it, its not too bad.
1	Lately, I've been thinking about food as being communicative to your body. Certain foods say pack on the fat and others tell your body not to. So it's possible to lose weight by switching what you eat and not so much the amount of it. I don't count calories, so what might actually be happening is that the switch to more fibrous foods is resulting in eating less calories while still feeling full. \n\nThere was a time when I unintentionally became a vegetarian, because I decided to stop eating fast food. I was eating a lot of Amy's frozen food. What happened was I went from my usual thin 140 to a freaky thin less than 130. I thought at the time I might be gaining weight from eating too much too. I used to have 3 or 4 little Starbucks Frappucinos (in the glass bottles) everyday, and I would eat an entire Amy's frozen pizza, which was about 900 calories. So it seems like for me that meat communicates to my body to be heavier. \n\nOne last point. If you're overweight, you should not be drinking calories of any kind. Drink water, black coffee or tea (maybe a little cream in it), or even herbal tea without sugar (more flavor than water and no calories). Sugar (and its no calorie replacements), especially sugary drinks, work like the pornography of food. It desensitizes your taste buds, so that you need everything to be super sweet. If you avoid all the sweetness, your taste buds will adjust to where lightly sweet things are good and super sweet things are an overload.

4	This meme was brought to you by Ben Shapiro.
5	Looking for INTP chat groups/frequently active forums	I stumbled across this page on reddit after taking a few tests about 2.5 months ago, and have never related to any other person who’s mind works in the same way mine does before, until then. Reading posts on this sub has been one of the many highlights in my day just for the sole purpose of relating so much to a group. Anyways—\n\nTL;DR:\nIm looking for any sort of INTP chat groups or something in the nature because I think it’d be interesting to share thoughts and go off tangent together
10	When I found this place, I shouted out loud, "I have people! I found my people!" It was a blessing and a revelation. I have not found another like it. Best of luck, but you can hang out here.
2	Same. Following this. I'm new here but find most the sub chatter on sad or meme threads.
2	I hide all my chat groups like a good squirrel with their nuts; if you’re into things like OP’s post send me a dm about what kind of conversations you like having and I will direct you to where you wanna go. 
3	Do you willfully ignore social or work obligations?	
4	If I can't dissuade them from happening, I'll explore every plausible excuse to not show up.  If all else fails, I'm the last to arrive and the first to leave.\n\nBetter if I have time to mentally prepare, something cute to wear, and a shot of bourbon beforehand.
6	Not opposed to social work but it’s just busy work in my mind. Most charitable orgs are corrupt af so in my mind, why should I expend energy that otherwise fails at accomplishing anything. Sure you help someone immediately and it may be gratifying but then next week you needa go back. Where does it end? 
2	Sometimes I get so caught up in my train of thought that I'll forget that the outside world even exist. This poses a problem when it comes to getting anything done and I always end up doing things suuuper last minute. 😅\n\n(That's just me tho :P)
8	I'm sorry but this man is just beautiful	
9	I don’t know if I agree with everything he believes but I trust him to do what he genuinely thinks is right and I also trust him to have willing and open dialogue with acceptance that he could possibly be wrong. That’s about as good as it can get in a politician.
2	I don't agree with a lot of his ideas but damn do I respect this guy. 
2	They've tried all his ideas before.  Over a hundred million people died as a direct result
10	Anything that has become something can become anything	What have you been becoming?
5	I have been becoming a thoughtful, loving person. I got tired of the never ending narrative in my head and the fact that no one but me wanted to hear it. So I took a good hard look at the story IO was telling myself and decided to quit believing it. I started over and was careful about what I accepted for my new story.  And I realized that I had lost my way. \n\nMy world is no longer black and white. It is not only 50 shades of gray, but also every color in the spectrum. I understand how essential my emotional experiences are, and I bask in them instead of instead of denying them. I have discovered that there is another level to being INTP after 26. Part of me feels like I missed out on so much by being stuck in my mind, but most of me is too busy living to care.

1	To make a dent in population, we would have to eat a lot of people. I mean each survivor would have to eat 3 or 4 other people. Given how fat people are these day, that could not be healthy. And then there would be fewer people, so a lot of the survivors would have to be eaten.  It takes a long time to grow a new person, and it seems like we would be down to the last few survivors before long.

9	Why?
8	How about a dual?
6	I was in exactly you spot a few months ago.  Well, may be farther because I had take all the necessary steps.  I bought some charcoal and lighter, and had set up some metal colanders in my car so that I could start the briquettes and have a nice concentration of carbon monoxide in a few hours.  I was just waiting for my family to go to sleep when I got an email. There was an article in Huffington Post about suicide recently, and it talked a lot about a woman named Ursula Whiteside. Before I finally decided to kill myself, I was looking for a dialectical behavior therapist, and I came across her website.  She happens to be here in Seattle. DBT therapists in Seattle were all full, and I told her that I needed someone because i was struggling. \n\nAs I waited for my wife and kids to go to sleep, I received an email from her. She did not have a referral for me, but she started giving me orders.  She said to put ice water in a large bowl and put my face in it for 30 seconds, then wait 30 seconds and repeat for 10 minutes. She said that I had to promise her not to kill myself for 48 hours. I had no idea what to do. But she was very clear about her instructions, so I sent her an email giving her 48 hours and did the ice thing. She continued stay in touch with me by email every few hours for almost a week until she found a therapist for me. She kept making me give her 48 more hours. It was a very strange experience. I have no question that she saved my life. All that and she had no idea who I was.\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy is a variant of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that was developed by Marsha Linehan at the University of Washington. It is now the most studied approach to therapy and has an amazing record for suicide in particular. In addition to an hour of therapy each week, I have 2 hours of class.  It has really made a difference. I have been depressed for 45 years, and nothing else has ever worked.\n\nShe also suggested that I look into Transcrainial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), which uses a magnetic field to stimulate parts of the brain. She said to also consider Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT), but after looking into it I wanted nothing to do with its memory loss side effects.  TMS has virtually no side effects. TMS is a daily treatment 5 days a week for 30-35 days.  It is expensive and a pain to get insurance.  It helps about 60 percent of the people who get it, some a lot and some a little. It takes 3 weeks to begin having an effect.\n\nI had a bizarre reaction. After the first session, I was a bit confused, and after a few hours, I realized that it was because the constant negative narration in my head was gone. That evening, the thought suicide crossed my mind, but it was just not interesting enough to think about.  After the second treatment the next day, I could not find any sign of depression in me.  The voice in my head was different. Four weeks later, I am still free of depression.\n\nI always thought that if I could get rid of my depression, I would be happy, but it does not work that way.  The opposite of depression is not happiness, but the capacity for happiness.  My psychiatrist said that sometimes I would be upset or sad because I should be. But my reactions will be appropriate to the situation and transient. I have had many happy moments, but I have a lot of learning to do.\n\nI am sharing all this for a few reasons.  I have been suicidal since kindergarten.  Literally for 49 years, I have contemplated suicide every day of my life. I am alive because I promised my future wife not to kill myself in 1984, and that promise bound me. I have had an amazing experience, but I can tell you from personal experience that you can get better, and not just better, but you can eliminate suicidal thinking. And when you do, you will be glad. I never thought I would be saying that. \n\nThe other thing is that not many people have heard of DBT. You should be able to find someone in your area who uses DBT.  It is completely different from any other treatment I have ever had. Among other things, because it is focused on suicide, it has none of the moralizing that others can have.\n\nSo please believe me that it is possible to become not just better, but well. There is a way out.  So please look into your options and give it a real try before you give up. Until this happened to me, I knew with certainty that it would never get better. I knew that I would be that way forever. If I can do it, then you can too.\n\nI hope this helps.  Thinking positive thoughts for you.
4	No.

If, I really wanted your money, I would just go ahead and try to pickpocket your wallet.\n4. Somebody in this world would grieve over your death.\n5. This world needs your personality type.

1	Same.
1	No because\n1) We'll die anyway.\n2) I don wanna be in jail \n3) I like turtles 
8	Incompetent with physical activities like sports and dancing	I've always been pretty bad with anything needing physical coordination. Any kind of sport (basketball, volleyball, badminton) or any kind of dancing (especially partner dances) seems so difficult. It's like everyone else has some innate aptitude, knows what they're doing, or can at least learn quickly. Whereas I'm just clumsily flailing about with a short memory span and slow reaction speed. It feels bad when I'm holding everyone back when I mess up.\n\nIf I expand it further, I never got good with personal activities either like playing music or fitness because I'm not consistent or driven to continue learning/practicing.\n\nI want to get better so I can "fit in," or have some kind of hobby of my own that I'm competent in, but I'm not competent in anything. 
5	There’s not much more than just practice. Learning, not intelligence, is the INTP superpower anyway. 
3	Those activities involving gross-motor eye-hand-coordination use certain skills.  Some people do have more innate access to these skills.  If you try doing them, and feel bad, do you think that's gonna make you happy, in the long run?\n\nIf you keep going partner dancing, and feel like you are ruining it for others, will be that a fertile environemtn in which to learn?\n\nIf the people you were doing these activities with made it clear that they weren't bothered, then, you would be able to learn.  Do you have that sort of community?\n\n\nI'm sure you've tried a large variety of activities, but maybe you should keep looking.
3	Two things: I say you can feel free to poke fun at your lack of skills. People can enjoy someone willing to laugh at theirself. But also if you like sciences then picking up a lot of scientific info on sports can help you understand what would may work best for you. I majored in biomechanics, and loved using that knowledge as a collegiate track athlete.\n\nI consider myself a lucky INTP (in a way) since I grew up poor and had no choice but to go outside and play everyday. I was good at football as well but I did not relate very well to the average athlete/coach, and would subsequently often end up on the back-burner on bigger sports teams. Being social keeps you in the mind of others. Overall I came closest to conclude individual or small team sports are the best, since you don't get drowned out by others and their emotions so often.
1	Although some people have better motor skills than others, no one was born a dancer. Anyone who wants to be good at it must practice. Practice takes time and perseverance.  A lot of us, myself included, find practice boring and difficult.  So many things come easily to us that we think everything should. Ask one of your great dancer friends if they had to learn how to dance and practice.  And then enjoy learning something that you have to do one step at a time like everyone else. It was so hard for me to realize that I was not special in everything, but once I did, other people became a lot less obnoxious.
1	You can pick up a musical instrument
1	“I'm not consistent or driven to continue learning/practicing” \n\nthis is the source of your problem
3	Looking for people to collab with! (Game Dev)	Hi!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been doing a lot of thinking (go figure), because I've been trying to come up with a way to get a good stream of income while doing stuff I love, but by also keeping the projects small so that I follow through and actually complete them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\na Little about myself: I'm a self taught programmer, I've been programming for about 5ish years or so. I'm by no means an expert but I can pretty much build anything I come up with. I've developed software that I've been selling and it's been going quite well, but coming up with software that's not already been made is quite a task in itself never mind coding it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I came up with is to start making some of those Hyper-Casual mobile games (Like the ones Ketchapp makes/publishes). It just makes a lot of sense to me because they're quite easy to make and to come up with so before I'll be able to lose interest in making it it will most likely already be published. The plan is to pump out at least 2 of them a month (just an estimate for now). Of course most wont be successful, but It's more just to throw stuff out there and see what sticks, because once one sticks, the money starts rolling in quite aggressively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm looking for people to hopefully join me in this venture and grow with me, if this sounds like something you're interested in then feel free to give your input below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n\- 2D Artist.\n\n\- Possibly another C# programmer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do decide that you want to be apart of this make sure you have at least somewhat motivation to follow through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you and have a nice day!
5	Good luck, homie. I've been trying to get partnerships like this going for the past ten years. Turned out that:\n\n1) good workers didn't like to work for free\n2) family and friends never worked out well\n3) five out of ten will disappoint you\n4) four out of ten will abandon you\n5) the tenth will betray you\n\nI hope you have more success than I did down that path. I've moved on for the most part. Maybe it was just my problem all along, who knows.\n\nI really just wanted a partner so we could motivate each-other, brainstorm, and hold each-other accountable for our work ethic and quality.\n\nAgain, good luck!
1	Best of luck!!! I am so excited for you. I am also an entrepreneur who has envisioned using this forum to find people to work with.
68	I’m supposed to be having a good time	Any of you ever get invited to go out to and after 5 shots you find yourself thinking about how the bar operates, the circuitry that makes the lighting work, or the fact that all these people are just dancing on a giant rock in the middle of the Milky Way?\n\nI don’t belong here lol (send help)
34	>Any of you ever get invited to go out\n\n\nabsolutelynotmeirl
16	Realised that the only reason I was so popular when I was younger was because everyone I knew was on drugs. And discussing quantum physics (after noticing the TV set rather than the stoner movie mutely playing) at a house party is not just ok, it's 'cool', when the people there are all speeding off their faces and eating acid. \n\nUntil everyone went off to rehab / prison / got actual jobs / families etc, I didn't even know I was an introvert...
14	That always happens to me when I am in church..
6	Are you me?\n\nThe amount of bars with exposed sprinkler and HVAC systems is nearly equivalent to those with proper ceilings. 
9	Well, I don’t drink and I certainly don’t go out when my friends ask me to go out (I’m in my bedroom all the time apart from the 3 days I’m in college which is 7 hours a day) but I do question what’s going on inside each individuals head and if they are putting on an act just like myself and IF they are what percentage of them is actually true to themselves, what percentage is faked and what percentage is influenced by other people!\n\nMaybe that guy over near the pool table is on the phone getting news about his daughters car crash, maybe that bald guy sitting alone is actually dying, maybe that dart board that is on the wall was found in a dead mans car!\n\nI cannot simply know what I wanna know but I can always make a guess and have the possibility of it actually being correct.
5	This is why I can't smoke weed with people.
3	I need zero shots to think like that. I think that way often. 
3	Show up late, really late. Don't even worry if your friends are even still around. Don't drink, or maybe have just one or two beers to loosen up, and then hit on the drunk girls stumbling out of the bar/club really late at night. 
3	Pick one person.  It is best to look for another introvert, someone who seems awkward or who is on the edge of the group. Listen to what they say, and then approach them, say "I noticed your comment about XXX. That was interesting." Resolve to learn something from that person.  Everyone has something to teach us. And get to know the person. Actually try to figure out what makes them tick.  Same thing you were doing with the circuitry, but far more challenging.  Focus on them, not you.  Doing this over and over will make you very adept at social situations and take your mind off the circuits.  In addition, you will find is enjoyable in a terrifying way.
2	U do belong there but u need a lot more than 5 shots
0	You do belong there. What you are not there to do is be like everyone else. Feel the music. Do a dance for yourself. Feel your own body. Observe the weirdness of the social rituals all the others are doing, but don't see that as you not having a place there. You do you. Drink what you feel like. Talk or not talk to whom you feel like. Be you. You'll be fine.
10	Any Advice for Accessing and Integrating The ENTJ Shadow for Productivity?	I have found that when I get angry or stressed, I become super aggressive, quick witted, more direct, and stop considering others’ feeling altogether. It’s like all my logical thoughts are pushed quickly out my mouth by adrenaline. I get the ultimate feeling of focus and drive. My dad says the shift is pretty scary and jarring, as normally I sound more like Jordan Peterson, but under stress I sound like Ben Shapiro. \n\nI think this part of me is the ENTJ shadow, and I’m very interested in calling on it voluntarily to get work done. I’ve found that sometimes loud, angry music can bring it out in a limited capacity, and so can some motivational videos. If I think about how other people have treated me poorly or how much my friends suffer, I can enter that mode for quite a while, but this method is not as consistent as music or motivational videos. \n\nAny other INTP’s here who have similar experiences, or have some useful advice after experimenting with integrating the shadow? 
11	>I have found that when I get angry or stressed, I become super aggressive, quick witted, more direct, and stop considering others’ feeling altogether.\n\nThat is known as an Fe Explosion. To access your ENTJ shadow you must develop your Fe. Highly developed Fe suppresses your consideration of the Fe of others (This is why ENFJs are unrepentant dicks at times)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best way to access your ENTJ shadow while working is to vocalize (to yourself) your displeasure of someone else's fuckups. When you get a shit email, open you word processing tool of choice and type a response telling the idiot who sent you that email that they are a stupid cunt, etc point by point. Make sure to delete this word doc. Never save it and never put yourself into a position where it is possible for you to accidentally send it to anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not 100% correct but consider your Fe your "intelligence." The higher your Fe, the more intelligent you are. Think of Fe within this context as your willingness to transcribe your Ne and (Ni / Ti) to Te to communicate your idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have problems telling when your Ne, or Si are activated try this exercise:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStart thinking of a process. Eventually you will get to a point where you start worrying about what can go wrong (your vision and awareness of the world, Se, completely dissolves) that is Ne being activated. When Ne is activated, you will naturally from time to time start thinking about things you've found funny in the past: That is Si being activated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo improve your Fe, suppress your Si. This is hard because we are Se polar meaning we cannot automatically activate Se to "interrupt" Si. So you need to struggle with Ne for a bit. Fe fucks with Si because to properly express Fe, you are required to suppress past experiences of how people with strong Fe made you feel. We are halfway there because Fi is our last function so we don't have to worry about how we feel in the moment fucking things up but we do have to worry about how a specific stimulus made us felt in the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce your Fe is developed, you can use Fe together with Si to simulate Se.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink of Se as the willingness to give someone a good experience AND our grasp of the effects of the real, physical world. Both of those are the practically the same thing at different resolutions because we require a grasp of the physical world and others in it in order to give those others a good experience. Naturally, the knowledge of how to give people a good experience comes coupled with the knowledge of how to give others a bad experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople don't mention this much but our Ni is just as strong as our Ti but it cannot operate when Ne is being used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you now know how to activate Te and use it in a semi constructive way, Ni is always on and does not need to be activated, you know from above how to simulate Se, Fi can be left on autopilot. Be careful of your Fi because if it becomes too stimulated, it activates your ISFP superego and **things done with your ISFP superego cannot be undone**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may be a jumbled mess but I think i covered everything. The TL;DR is to learn how to develop your Fe by learning to not care what others think by "proving" that in a particular context, what others think is objectively stupid.
3	Ik what you mean lol. If someone has done something annoying and pointless around me or in a discussion with me for the 100000th time after I’ve told them not to... I flash on them REALLY hard. Especially if it’s someone who constantly raises their voice at the slightest hint of an idea that doesn’t agree with them. It’s suprising to even myself at how the words flow out of my mouth to destroy the person. This is pretty rare but when it happens its unmistakable. Apart from that, the only entj ethic i can catch is if I’m incredibly interested in something. If it’s not interesting, it won’t happen.
3	When I let that happen over a year ago, I lashed out at some workplace VIPs. I didn't say anything wrong but I made it clear that I could not be trusted around super-emotional people for the foreseeable future. I did an extreme amount of reading definitions of words so that no one could question my 360-degree logic when I argued. I shocked several people and made my research branch director cry.\n\nFurthermore, my gf at the time passively criticized my displays of affection, so I peeled away her perspective and logic so that I could 'feel' or understand where she came from. I felt shocked at her perspective, dismissed it, and dumped her when she wouldn't give me time to process all of the crap we stirred up emotionally together. I was not wrong per say in either context (I even bounced all of my thoughts with the most objective people in my life), but I burned huge bridges and it immediately affected me occupationally. Wound up single and essentially working by myself for half a year.\n\nIf you have it come out of you at will, I caution that it is truly a devil. It is hard to consistently stay ready for good decision-making or get back into your natural framework of life. Good luck. I admire anyone who can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne: couple words for accuracy. You know how we do.
2	EXACTLY... the shower reflection of an argument that already happened is like completely obsolete when pushed to an extreme. I’m usually proud of these flashes honestly bc they get the job done. They usually somehow find a way to make the other person know that they are the ones in the wrong even though I’m the one blasting them. I think it really hits home though, probably just because INTPs are usually chill and quiet. We are also known to think before we say things, so those around us know that we aren’t just spewing like sensory feeling judging types tend to do. If we get pushed to the point of flashing on someone, they know that we mean every word that we just said and that it was not just spur of the moment but a bunch of pent up contemplated thoughts.
1	i relate, but being angry at people is not what ENTJs are...\n\nThough, going by actual strengths, your shadow is INTJ. (I'm refering to socionics and the concept of dimensionality of function). Of thoses, NiTe are natural to you, while Fi and Se are part of your Super-ego block. Ie, function you're uncomfortable with/conscious of. Our use of Fi lacks drive, and more importantly, our lack of Se means we're not present enough, making us wimps/doormats in the eyes of others.\n\nYou can access the NiTe easily, you actually do it all the time without realizing it. The Se is the one where you can make most progress, still, for productivity, you shouls focus on SiFe ? Fe, because it's easy to do something when you're not alone, as for Si, it's a bit the causes of havits, etc. So I guess that's the one you should ideally work on.\n\n*** \n"What is measured progress" Time yourself when doing stuff, and when you get good data, you can make informed decisions.\n

6	Dichotomies vs Functions, what do you guys think?	There has been some dramas on r/MBTI due to the differences in opinions about dichotomy typing versus function typing. I personally think functions make more sense because they are more descriptive and if understood correctly, can prevent a lot of confusions. For example, tests such as the one on 16 personalities.com focus entirely on dichotomy, which to me is problematic. On a question about winning in a debate versus not hurting people's feelings, the "T" answer is obviously the former while the "F" answer must be the latter; however I really don't think it is all that simple, because more passive thinkers such as INTPs might be less assertive and/or have a relatively developed Fe, which make them not overly argumentive. \n\nTo me dichotomies can be more dogmatic, because unlike functions, it is less balanced; as a result, people could become confused about their true type, and that is when you hear questions like "am I too emotional to be INTP" and "I am I too rational to be INFP". Therefore, I think functions typing is a better way to go because it shows everyone is both a sensor and an intuitive, and everyone is both a thinker and a feeler, more importantly the E vs I scale is more about how you process things than your social aptitude. I also find function typing to offer far better explanations for how and why people act and think the way they do, and instead of throwing all thinkers and feelers in the same blankets like dichotomies do, I do think there is a huge difference between Ti vs Te users, and between Fi vs Fe users, because they tend to focus on different aspects when making decisions and interacting with the world. Dichotomies seem to also be more guilty of S vs N bias; it is more likely to paint sensors as people who cannot have abstract thoughts and paint intuitives as people who don't deal with realities. To me functions make sense because they balance each other out; for example, Ti-Fe means a logical person who is focused on being internally structured and consistent, but externally passive so he doesn't completely tilt towards one way or another, while Te-Fi means a person who needs external structure and consistency  and internal harmony and conviction so his energy and focus are applied both inwardly and outwardly.  \n\nFunction typing is also better for self improvement. For INTPs, our problem with social awkwardness and lack of emotional awareness can be mediated by developing Fe, and this type of "solution" isn't offered by dichotomies, which puts people in very generalized boxes.
3	It’s not even real drama so much as widespread misinformation. People are randomly saying “I believe this/that” when they have a miniscule understanding of the origin and purpose of cognitive type theory. \n\nFor an entire year after learning I’m INTP, I had no idea WTF people were talking about with “Dominant Ti” and “Inferior Fe”, etc. It sounded like bunk, so I just ignored it. \n\nI had zero interest in type *theory*, so I never bothered to investigate. The *only* thing I was interested in was finding and talking to like-minded people. \n\nIt’d be nice if new visitors could be hotrouted to understanding that MBTI is just a mass commercialization of Carl Jung’s original theories on cognitive attitudes. \n\nFurthermore, there’s no *use* for MBTI dichotomies. Okay, I’m introverted. *So what*? I’m intuitive. *So what*? There’s no direction nor path of development whatsoever. It really does become horscope-like when the system does not deliver any sort of meaningful value for improving your life and better understanding self and others. \n\nCognitive stacks give us mathematically symmetric, discrete, and *defined* models for interaction, understanding, and development. It’s a complete system for actual societal duties different cognitions have, and how different people should make equal efforts to understand one another and accommodate each others’ needs. “Te consumes Ti” not only makes sense, but is also perfectly symmetric. “INTP + INFJ = Golden Pair!” is just the product of glorified anecdotes present as science. \n\nMBTI is largely responsible for the pseudoscience criticisms and comparisons to horoscopes. On the plus side, it has generated exposure and interest at least for those willing to investigate the subject more deeply. 
1	Its literally so fking easy to just guess what the fk the quizz is actually asking and what functions you have, its weird people get upset about it. \n\nMbti is not a syndrome, its a symptom. Like darwinism. Evolution doesnt say whats superior, the superior determines evolution, same goes for mbti, its 100% perceptive, 0% diagnosis. 
1	Functions are more precise, that is all. The dichotomies are a simplification of the functions, anyway.\n\nI think I might have been part of that drama.\n\nOh, and in my opinion, you can't really work on that Fe. You can homewer, work on your Se, ie, being present and observing (with important subset being bodylanguage, presentation, powergames, etc) They say 80% of sucess is showing up, and us INTPs stay at home. That's our problem. Our Fe is weak, but it's fine.
1	I guess I see MBTI as a descriptive system broadly casts people into coherent groups who tend to see commonality with each other.  I do not see how it can contribute to self improvement because it has no ideal. Nothing is better than anything else. 
1	Which fictional INTP character do you think best represents us?	INTPs are rare in the fictional world and even rarer as main characters. What INTP characters have you found in books, movies, TV shows, games, etc. that really shows our type accurately and not as an evil heartless robot? I personally like Von Hohenheim from Fullmetal Alchemist (not to be confused with the real life alchemist Paracelsus 😂)
5	I'm letting you know that L from Deathnote is basically the MAXIMUM amount of exaggeration to represent an INTP. \n\n\nI heard that Smaug from The Hobbit can fit the description though. Totally didn't get it from another website.  \n\n\n Edit: Migi from Parasyte \n\nGLaDOS from Portal

4	INTP anger	Are INTP's more prone to anger than others? is our emotion stronger aswell?
21	It is not that we are more prone to anger, it is that more things are required to make an INTP angry. Usually we can just ignore unpleasant things to an extent. But it takes a truly despicable person or a truly significant event to make us "angry".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a result, our displays of anger are almost always mediated by our SuperEgo (Fi is our last function so our feelings activate our superego). This means that every time we are actually angry ( not just simply annoyed but ANGRY), we are SUPER angry.  This is a trait that we share with ISTPs
9	Anger is an emotion that is very easy to express and detect, so people who are prone to surpress/neglect feelings (like intp) often feel and act on anger more so than on other emotions. \n\nWouldn't say intps feel more anger than others, but they might get more overwhelmed by it than someone who's more in tune to their "inner works". 
2	Nah, usually INTPs are super chill and don't get worked up over much unless it's really bad, like a breach of core principles. Of course, anyone can be angry about anything since it's really all down to personal experience and how that experience was dealt and not type.
1	I found that I developed a deep seated hostility towards the world and people, and I certainly was more prone to anger than I like to remember. I think we have the same emotions as other people, but process them differently.

2	Journal entry	Do you connect?\n\n\n\nI came here wanting to make a difference. To throw my love into everything around me. And I thought everyone else was going for the same thing. They were all because they loved everything. And everything loved them. How could you not love something that you trusted that love from, so strongly? And your trust was broken because that love was never reciprocated. So where were you wrong in loving? Or who were you wrong in allowing you to love them? And who should you throw that love to? Because you’ve been wrong about where you could find that love. And you’ve walked away, again and again, disappointed. And forgetting to choose who to throw that love to. Just because they’re giving you cheap love (attention and abuse), doesn’t mean you have to give so much love. You don’t have to accept. And comply. You can move it. And you can move yourself. \n\n\nThey perceive you’re being vulnerable. They think you’re showing weakness, as yourself. They think you’re weak. They don’t want to ask if you’re weak because they know you’ll react with strength. And they’ll have to accept their weakness if they ask. Because they know you’re strong.
2	What? If you give your lover only when others reciprocate, then, it hardly seems like love. A lot of people here make themselves vulnerable. Most of the time, others respond with kindness. Sometimes not. But what others think or say matters only if you let it. You seem to have a combative perspective.  There is enough of that elsewhere in life.  This is a safe place. We have a shared experience. Try giving freely of yourself without demanding anything in return, and I suspect that you will find there is nothing to fight.
1	True love is not conditional upon reciprocation.\n\nThat said, we are only human. Sometimes, (temporarily) severing a bond and loving someone from afar is basic self-preservation.\n\nTo love is not wrong. Because to love is to hurt, and pain is not wrong.\n\nLove is pure and essential. There is no "cheap love". Only love that is combined with harmful impurities.

In fact, if I know what I'm doing, and my boss is willing to piss off and leave me alone for a few hours, I can even enjoy it. \n\nMy problem lies with understanding what is to be done. I need every detail explained to me. This though, is not because I'm indecsive or unable to make common sense decisions, but rather I just get very nervous about the prospect of doing it wrong. \n\nYour thoughts please....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
6	Reading David Graeber's books on bureaucracy and "bullshit jobs" might take the edge off a little, even if you don't agree with everything he says.

So when I had a question or needed her time, I would send her an email asking if she could fit me into her schedule so we could talk about X thing I had questions. She loved me so much when I was having some problems at home she invited me to come stay in her spare bedroom. (I did not take her up on it.)\n\nI think you can get on this lady's good side.
2	Get the fuck off this sub	I haven't visited this sub in a long time, but still I darkly remember seeing posts like this one every once in a while and thinking: "This guy doesn't know what he's talking about". Guess what? These guys knew what they were talking about. I used to visit this sub daily and read the posts of other people who were having problems with their emotions too. I convinced myself that I was incapable of feeling on the same level as other people are and that somehow I'm more rational than most people. Well, turns out thinking that people can be divided into only 16 catagories is pretty irrational. There wasn't a point where I was like: "This sub and the whole personality type stuff is stupid and I need to quit it". I just started going out a bit more and although it was super uncomfortable at first I learned to enjoy partys and stuff like that. Once you learn to let yourself go a little and quit worrying about how much you don't fit in, you start to fit in a little more. I have no clue where exactly I'm going with this, but I want you to take away one thing from this. Is this sub and the whole concept of personality types getting you anywhere and if not, you might wanna change a thing or two.\nI also know there are people who don't take all of this too seriously and I soncerely apologize to the. This post is mainly addressed to those of you who, like me, have ended up taking all of this a bit too seriously.\nI'm gonna go get downvoted into oblivion now, goodbye!
11	>I have no clue where exactly I'm going\n\nInsane?\n\nIf you are careless enough to let MBTI define your life, quitting /r/INTP will not achieve much. You have to understand that this same problem will be welcoming you where ever  you go for the rest of your life. It's the price of having no identity.  Whatever you end up doing, you will try to make it a part of your being. For people like you, examining what they choose to surround themselves with is more important than it is for others. Choose with care.\n\n
5	Sub isn’t the problem it’s the people. People need to combine their theoretical knowledge of mbti with their practical knowledge of it. Without any form of application the information is useless. Have a +1 tho friend for gettin out der.
5	I use mbti to better understand how other people may think. Since I was a kid, I’ve tried putting myself in every person’s shoes I’ve ever met. I try to think of everything I know about the person and justify how they act based on what I know about their life story mixed with their natural abilities (i now know them as preferred cognitive functions). It’s helped me treat people better and has also frustrated me at times bc I didn’t know how people could be so illogical about so many things even after looking at my arguments from their perspectives. Mbti taught me a lot about social constructs and beliefs. I personally use the INTP sub to understand myself better and to read logical viewpoints on different subject matters. Just bc its common in our type to have certain socially awkward characteristics or other little faults doesn’t mean they are set in stone. I personally don’t have any issues with connecting with anyone that I choose to connect with. I got rid of most of the weaknesses inherant to INTPs before I even knew what an INTP was. Just bc you interpretted the sub in a way that made you feel like you would always have whatever issues you had bc you’re an INTP, doesn’t mean everyone else does. 
3	Hey, that dumb post again.\n\n* You can divide stuff in any number of categories. I could separate all of humanity in 2, 4, 6, 9 categories if I wanted too. It's perfectly rational. The only thing that matters is how thoses categories are defined.\n* This sub isn't defined by people with anxiety, even of the dumb memes about it are popular.\n* It's not because you failed to use it properly that everyone will.\n\n\n
3	Most just come here to discuss with similar minded people...
3	Of course describing people only by personality traits or cognitive functions is irrational. It is not exact but has some great use pragmatically. Or, yes, you can find out solely on your own which may involve a ton of effort and time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree with the point about too many sad posts etc. But if I gave the personality stuff a real chance ten years ago I would have avoided some hard lessons. We just have to encourage the sub's culture from memes and sadness to discussions and opinions more. 
3	Sounds like a YOU problem if YOU took your personality test as a a code to live by.

2	I think a lot of the depression and asking What is the meaning of my life? comes from youth, not MBTI.  I do feel for you guys and I can definitely relate.  My advice is to learn to laugh at your shortcomings and own them.  If you are dissatisfied with your life, fix one problem at a time and learn to like yourself.
2	It’s not the theory that’s the problem. It’s defeatism and nursing of bruised egos that leads people to wallow in self-pity over their natural weaknesses, rather than being invigorated to overcome them.

1	As far as reddits where toxic ideas fester in an echo chamber ruining people's lives go, this sub is a decent one. Yes there's those sharing their similar unhealthy experiences but there's also those giving healthy and helpful advice.\n\nIf anyone is focusing on the bad stuff they aren't in a position to seek or see the good stuff since, as I've said, it's there. I do agree that going out and observing and experiencing life is necessary but also this sub is very helpful when you take in the helpful information.

211	Sudden urge to cry when someone's rude to me	I don't know if this is just me, but whenever someone has been rude to me for some reason, when I'm having an argument and disagreement, or when I'm being corrected and talked down, I feel this sudden urge to cry. Immediately there comes a lump in my throat and my eyes start to water.\n\nI just want to know if this is some kind of disease? Because I'm bound to be working soon and this will really be an inconvenience.\n\nTIA\n\nEdit: \nfacts about me\n- I don't feel basic emotions as a human being. Or if I do, I neglect it. Which makes the crying urge a lot strange and confusing\n- It feels like a reflex\n- During finals week when I'm super stressed out, I have never cried.
48	I've had that as a kid but grew out of it. Maybe it's a lower self esteem than before? Or maybe you're taking it too personally?
103	Intp’s for the most part want to be competent in everything they do. Being talked down to means you weren’t competent in some way. Which triggers an emotional reaction. I’ve been there before. I just try to shake off the tears and do better next time.
84	I have this too. I'm pretty sure it's just hyper-sensitivity. Your emotions are hyper sensitive. 
27	we don’t like to be criticized and we don’t understand or know what to do with emotions very well\n\nmy solution is to be formidable enough to where i can whoop a mf if i have to, but i’m in the south i don’t ever encounter the rude 
21	This is your Fe, perceiving your conversation partners feelings, telling your Fi, your lowest ordered cognitive function, that someone hurt your feelings.\nI think the best way to develop this is to constantly expose yourself to your emotions all the time and learn how to deal with them nice and slow.\nIt's a wild ride, but you can learn to embrace your ENTJ side.\n\nMeditation really helps with this practice, you can attentively open up your heart to yourself and let what needs to be let out.
15	I also have a sudden rush of emotions (which I try my best to keep contained):\n- happy tears when someone applauds me\n- mad face when someone says something that I disagree with\n- helpless tears when someone berates me\n\nOP, do you only experience the third one or the first two as well?
13	I have some neurological disorders, including ADHD. Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria occurs because my executive function is damaged and my brain typically cannot properly prioritize or regulate strong emotions. \n\nMy mother said all you had to do was look at me with an angry face when I was a toddler and I'd burst into tears. Sensitivity SUCKS.  How am I supposed to achieve world domination when I'm busy crying? Bah.
7	I’ve had this forever. Still trying to find the cause. My best lead is the book ‘The Highly Sensitive Person’, by Elaine Aron, which states that some people are just born that way, and it has its special use in society. Second best lead is ‘Running on Empty’ by Jonice Webb. It’s all about childhood emotional neglect. When a child falls down, for example, he looks to his parents to gage the gravity of the situation. If the parent reacts positively, the child learns to adjust his emotional reaction to the situation. Without that emotional feedback from parents, he never learns to regulate his emotions, thus relies on his own internal parent, who tends to be super judgey (paraphrasing). It is what it is.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
7	I have this too, but never thought it could be an Intp thing.\nit's not just when others are rude, but also when i feel like what i'm saying doesn't worth anything to them. it's like outright saying you're stupid. \n...ok, that's very Intp :/ 
7	I used to be this way when I was a kid.  Later on, I changed to lashing out at people who are rude at me.  Nowadays, I'll pretend I have a knife in my hand ready to stab them as I stare them in the eyes with murderous intent, and usually they get the message.
7	You cannot tie everything to MBTI. Chopping up 7 billion people into 16 personalities is quite a task. Even though we share personalities, there are still differences between us. \n\nIt could be just a "reflex like emotion". What I mean by that is, even though it doesn't emotionally impact you, you still "cry". 
20	hm, I get an urge to stab. 
6	Hey, I do this too. Particularly if someone is criticizing me in a specific tone of voice. Because I’m already criticizing myself, thank you very much. I realized that if I steer my emotional reaction more toward stubborn anger than helplessness or sorrow or whatever, it will suppress the tears. It’s definitely not more productive, but it is way less embarrassing.
5	For me it was when people would team up with an unjust rule structure.\n\nOne time a kid was making fun of me for no reason and I just started crying, becaues I knew if I hit him I would get in trouble, if I said anything back he'd go tell on me and get me in trouble, etc.  
4	I do this too. It’s a result of my father being abusive alcoholic. I’m 42 now and it still happens on occasion if someone is attacking me without context and I feel helpless temporarily.  Kids default mode is to listen while getting yelled at and responding isn’t really an option.  I can fight it off now but I still feel helpless for a moment
5	I'm a dude and I have this feeling too. I always think it's because I'm an HSP (I do sone extensive research over the last couple of years to try and figure out why I'm feeling all these feelings that most other people don't feel and having a way of thinking unlike most other people) and I can't control my feelings. Although in private, I usually have thoughts about cursing the person out and letting them see what I want to say to them. But somehow I mainly turn into sensitive ass person, and I want to grow some balls, but my inner being is not really allowing me to.
5	Someone was rude to me today and I cried lol, the rage just comes up, and then I circulate, and then I try to resolve. But in the moment I just put the lady in her place because she was out hand and left. 
4	Cry out loud. Get offended. Teach these insensitive fools a lesson!
3	Its normal.\n\nProbably need to work on yourself.\n\nBut I don't know your full situation.\n\nNor do I have the full qualification to evaluate you.\n\nHope everything goes well. Peace.
3	Probably not just you, and definitely not me
3	I have this too and I hate it. It doesn't even have to be the stress involved with getting yelled at, absolutely any intense emotion can trigger it for me. It's almost like the emotion becomes overwhelming and for whatever reason my natural response is to cry.\n\nAs far as I can tell it's normal. The only way I've been able to better control it is to push my thresholds for intense emotions. Rather than avoiding situations I know will be emotionally intense I force myself to engage with such situations and then try to understand what exactly I'm feeling.\n\nLike yes I'm feeling ready to cry as I know a resolve is building in a piece of music at a symphony, but what else is going on? The hair on my neck and thighs is standing on end, my breathing is shallow, my skin is tingling like a low volt shock, I have the sensation of an endorphin high, and I feel like a sea of colors inside. At which point I'm like yeah, of course I'm about ready to cry, that is a lot going on. But if I lean into it and really just accept it and experience it it's less jarring and less startling the next time because I anticipate it. 
3	Happens to me a lot. Whenever I think I gave a good answer but the other person completely disagrees and you can't argue with them, especially if there is something on the line (I.e. A class Test in school) 
3	I was like that when I was younger teen to early adulthood.  I highly recommend studying the laws of "respect" - through your own observation - and come to your own understanding that "respect" is a feeling and phenomenon that governs all species of social animals and their interactions.\n\nLook at monkeys socializing, look at lions, birds, etc... every animal species has frameworks of respect.  The big animal gets it, the little one gets less food.  The human being is a social animal, with emotions, in the end of the day, no amount of being an intp edgelord will deny this fact.\n\nAnyway, after studying and becoming a lot more aware of "respect" and how it works, I became more capable of dealing with these types of situations (mainly by defending my ground, and overreacting, making myself appear "bigger", as animals should when being disrespected).  I know this is a somewhat offhand solution and advice I'm offering, but that's my personal anecdote - because I kind of ignored this subject growing up but thinking back, all the other kids around me growing up seemed to care NOTHING ELSE except respect lol.  good luck out there.\n\nI suppose I should mention that I work in a blue collar type field sometimes dealing with construction, so me opening my arms wide, overreacting, saying "HEY C'MON" is more acceptable?  Also in this field there's a lot more disrespect being thrown around lol
3	I go straight to anger which can be at times very intense for the recipient. Usually when I feel I was taken advantage of or was seriously wronged. I  come across as very calm and easy going most all of the rest of the time.
2	This happens all the time to me, when people are rude or when they talk about feelings and point out what I failed to do, or what we both failed to do. I think is more like I feel the urge to cry when I don't feel in control of the situation, if I feel like I'm being exposed and my "intelligence" won't help me get the upper hand this time.
2	I get this whenever I have been alone for a while and haven't confronted any of my emotions (cause I don't need to when no one is around), kind of like a reflex. I have used this as an indication that it is time to self reflect in the past. I now self reflect once every two weeks and it doesn't happen anymore ╮( ˘ ､ ˘ )╭
2	This used to happen to me a lot few years back. Over the years, I just developed more confidence mostly by suffering through such interactions. I think the answer is to think objectivity and meditation helped a lot with that: being aware but not reacting. 
1	You think negatively about what you are doing. Someone else thinks negatively about what you are doing. You already feel like you can't answer back because you know you did something wrong so anything they are saying is just pouring it on. Every word further is just painful. \n\nSolutions:\n\n1. Stop thinking that you are doing everything wrong because it's not done perfectly.\n\n2. Be a masochist\n\n3. ~~Don't take anything seriously so you can avoid the pain of needing to feel like you're doing the thing you're doing well and then get called out for not caring about anything and then go into a spiral because you can't be your true self because it's too painful so you just live in mediocrity which is in itself painful.~~
1	I have a sudden urge to cry whenever I see a Haka performed.  I'm not Māori or a Kiwi, I don't even watch rugby.\n\nDifferent things provoke an emotional response in people.  It just means you are human.  
1	I perceive that acting out rudely is an emotional response. If someone is rude, they have a personal reason behind this impatient emotion. If I perceive the person doesn't like me, kudos to me for making them feel insecure without trying - though it's not in my agenda to make people feel any kind of negative emotion. If they are correct, then kudos to them for having the right answer.\n\nI don't usually care enough to bring up a right answer if I perceive the people surrounding me don't want my opinions.  If someone is rude and I have a lump in my throat, it's probably because I'm stuck in a situation I can't get out of -  cornered for the moment...and the lump is just me feeling sorry for my stuck situation.\n\nIf I'm around someone I really want to impress and I get challenged in a rude way then, yeah I'll probably feel a lump of embarassment.\n\nThe only time I have sudden urges to cry are at the start of menstrual cycles  and not always every month.\n\nWonderful poetry, art, music, movies evoke emotions, but it's rare to find the good ones!\n\n&#x200B;
1	One of the most profound things I’ve learned from meditation is that you do not have to let your emotions dictate your life. If you are feeling something negative, focus on it, embrace it and even articulate what it is that you’re feeling and watch it slip away. Sadness and anger are fleeting emotions that cannot survive for long if you’re completely aware that you’re feeling them.  \n\nNext time this happens, take a second to just recognize what you’re feeling. 
1	I used to have this problem, then I stop caring about the other person or the activity they’re criticizing me abt 
1	It’s definitely not a disease, in fact it’s incredibly common. You’re just feeling emotions :)
1	I get this when people yell at me. I also learned to take constructive criticism. 
1	It might be genetic, do any of your family members also cry easily?
1	oh god op you're reminding me of the time i didn't win player of the year on my football team and i couldn't hold back the tears. cringe. it has helped to bring my self perception out of the clouds.
1	yes mate, you ain't alone.
1	That shit ain't stopping me.
1	You’re framing this in physical terms (my eyes water, there’s a lump in my throat) as if it’s some sort of biological phenomenon you’re studying. I see that as a problem because what’s important here isn’t what happens physically, but how you feel and what you think :)\n\nFor example, I don’t see anything like “they hurt my feelings” or “they don’t care about me”. it’s totally absent, but that should be the main focus here! :D open up to how you feel and express it to yourself, and to us. how do these things make you feel, and what do they make you think?
1	Considered thinking about it from another perspective / shifting the focus? \n\nSure, not everyone graduates kidhood with an A+ in Emotions 101, esp’ in the case of INTPs, but through exposing myself to those kinds of  situations, I learned that it’s not necessarily about whether you cry. It’s what you do afterwards that people ultimately remember and that will determine whether in twenty years you’re still fighting the urge to cry every time someone ‘berates’ you. You can turn anything on it’s head and make good of it – just depending how you go about dealing with it.\n\nBecause I eff up better than I do just about anything, I learned to capitalise on this early, I guess. \n\nCongrats on the job, when you get it. Hope you give yourself, your colleagues and the job a chance.  
1	I usually just deflect it with sarcasm. Not really something I would recommend durring a debate.  But it works pretty well for me. 
1	Take what people say with a grain of salt. Most are just as uncomfortable in their own skin as we are. 
1	The way I dealt with this is to basically get myself to cry when I am home. I am less likely to feel like crying elsewhere as a result.\n\nThe way I would make myself cry is more or less pointing out all of the things that I have put effort into and got no results for (particularly when it's because of other people). In other words, reminding myself that I have been involved in a number of futile efforts. Nothing kills me more than the knowledge of these occurrences. The more I address it however, the more accepting I am of failure and criticism.
1	Be certain that you are regularly eating enough high quality protein and take a good multi-vitamin each day.
1	I don't cry. I kinda wish I could. My eyes don't water but I either feel physically similarly to you or have numbed myself with drugs (almost always the latter). \n\nThat isn't a disease. Those are emotions.
1	i relate. its there. happened as a kid so much still be thre. idk why. \n\nif i had to guess it must be something critical to my psychology. \n\nwish someone could break it down
0	Error 404 feelings not found
0	I don't. I like when I can be rude, aka, the diect no BS approach, and attempts at insulting me unfaze me. \n\nAlt options : \n\n* Maybe female vs male thing ? Which are you ?\n* Maybe an age thing.\n* Possible mistypes. INFP are a common mistype here. This thread is a food examplez they are out in force today. (See a good chunk of all the unflaired people, and all people with INxP label)\n* Overemphasis : If you cry once a year and the rest cries once a month, you're still stoic relative to them

9	(INTP) Inferiority amongst friend groups?	every friend i hang out with i feel inferior to amongst girls when with them, i've worked recently at being confident and less in my head when with people (being a severe introvert) and its been going damn well, making lots of new friends and girls etc. The only way i seem to connect with girls is through knowing them for a while and seeing them more than once. the club scene i just cant do. i'm so in my head and overthink even when drunk in clubs and typical extroverted settings. \n\ni'm 20 years old and haven't had a serous relationship or had sex yet. i know its not important but im struggling to not let it get me down. My other friend groups put subconscious pressure on me to sort this out but i really cant seem to\n\ni dunno what im asking for i know im just suppose to work on myself and ill attract what  need and whatever im just so fucking tired. My closest frind are in in long time relationships bla bla i just feel lonely or something but i cant understand it because im not very emotionally savvy.\n\nany words are appreciated\n\nThanks
8	You’re doing fine! Especially if you’ve been making an effort and seeing some social benefits from it; meeting more people in general. \n\nRealize that as an INTP, you not only need physical attraction, you will likely need intellectual attraction AND a level of trust other types don’t seem to need as much. It takes time to develop a relationship like that, and it sounds like you’re on the right track. \n\nDon’t compare yourself to others (I know, easier said than done). Every type has their own approach to life. You’ll find INTx’s often take their time before jumping in and letting someone into their inner world. Don’t rush it. When it happens with the right person, it’s worth it. \n\nP.S. I had an INTJ friend in a similar position. He was shy, happy in his own head, and wanted a relationship but wasn’t the type to follow the crowd... he finally had his first real relationship at 23. They’re getting married next month and she’s an amazing match. They’re both so quiet and introverted, I don’t know how they found each other, but they’re perfect together!
2	Yeah I understand where your coming from man (intp here)  I had a few flings when I was younger but it was difficult they would have a attraction with me (and I wanted/needed to explore these things)  but It was short lived and for some reason or another I couldn't bring myself to even talk to them. To be quite honest with you I must have ghosted around 5 or 6 different girls, it has taken a while but I have found a girl who I can truly be with (I'm 22 now)  she's a INTJ and it's crazy how similar but different we are on different subjects.\n\nAt the end of the day bro there is someone for everyone even if you don't believe it, but sometimes it just takes time to find them.\n\n(I don't even know if I answered the question but look to the brighter side you got someome to look for)  
2	I feel like I am considered inferior by some people because I dont adhere to standard social dynamics. But I actually see myself as superior and a much more complicated person than many. I know it sounds a bit narcissistic but for me it feels like a type of confidence different than what normal people consider "confidence". It does not stem from social validation but more from the personal qualities I personally believe I posses.
1	Here’s a video for you. If you’re serious about inproving your situation inside-out, it’s well worth the 30 minutes:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aE9QSuSxIMY\n\nIgnore that the context is a guy selling his PUA coaching services, and focus on the content. 
1	Same here. I forget to use my internal logical skills and just do my best under social pressure. Especially when I have to follow directions...
7	How is my favourite kinda people doing???	I’m doing quite fine myself. I just got a new 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray player and I cannot wait to get “Spider-man: into the spider verse” on 4K!\n\nI’ve been also finishing up Dragon Ball Z (I’m on EP 203) \n\nAnd uh, I am supposed to make an art portfolio for my ART class and still haven’t even though I’ve 1 month left...soooo, yeah...pretty boring...😐\n\n\n
3	Ummm... Hi?
3	Playing ps4 attack on titans :]
3	Not that bad. I beat my highscore in Galaga and I've been refining my arts with some intermediate difficulty 2D graphics programming in C++.
2	Awesome man, I’m excited for you! Seems like more 4k content is being put out. 
122	Intp and crushes	How do you react when you have a crush?\n\nAs for me, I'll start studying their behaviour silently and will do tons of researches about my crush's personality, the way he thinks and all that. So basically I'll try to dissect their brain without them even knowing it. \n\nThen I started to imagine conversations with them in my head without actually initiating it irl bc I'm too shy for that. And I'll be excited everytime my crush talks lol\n\nHowever at the end, my feelings will end up getting unrequited because I might have accidentally acted too cold to the person I like yikes.
56	Completely fucked. I idealize, over analyze, and become quite mentally obessed with a person of my interest, yet not being able initiate shit. I end up acting awkward, anxious, and overly sensitive around the person while knowing it isn't helpful. 
67	Similar. Over analyze flirting to death. Convince myself my analysis has proven low probability they are actually interested. Stop talking to them.  Learn five years later they liked me, but were convinced that I hated them and found them boring. 
30	>I might have accidentally acted too cold to the person I like\n\nThat sums it up nicely
20	I do the same, work up the courage to talk to them...\n\nThen I realize I’m ultra ugly so that’s cool.
17	I do my research, stalk their LinkedIn, look for any red flags and then do nothing. 
14	I decided to break this habbit 2 years ago and just take a leap of faith. We've been dating ever since.  I asked her out a few weeks before i usually would have, thus i didin't have time to fuck myself over.\n\nWe worked together at a job i hated to i figure i could always quit of shit got too bad. 
10	sounds like obsession rather than just a crush
11	Go out of my way to treat them no differently from anyone else, and hate myself just a little bit more when no one else is around.
10	I too study them before hand, I try to learn as much as possible from a distance. When I'm in private with my crush I've been told I'm a completely different person (silly, dorky, playful, charming) but when in the presence of others I often get told I'm too serious or cold.
22	The key is to communicate only with memes.  Memes can convey all the emotions that your INTP self simply can't.  A smart, sarcastic, and relevant meme is a sure way to draw attention away from my cold and emotionless expressions.
9	I try to analyze it till I get over it 
4	Same here. Every serious relationship I've had began with them frustratedly asking "So, are you going to ask me out or not?" 
6	the three stages : stalking,obsessing,letting go
6	Before I truely was myself and let my guard down I became aloof so any rejection was more of a joke. \nMost crushes I had never knew. \n
6	I'm the opposite. I analyse almost everyone I meet, so if I find someone I don't feel the need to analyse, where we click without me having to try, then I feel like I can just relax and open up with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...still gonna analyse them later though. Just because I don't need to doesn't mean I won't.
6	I don't do anything, until I do, then I never talk to the person ever again, hope this stops happening, please
3	I have literally never had one, and it seems weird to me that other people do.
4	Say nope and reduce contact until crush goes away
4	I usually don’t realize it’s a crush at first glance. More like a series of fascinating idea exchanges, then the attraction is obvious, then, maybe, things get sweaty and naked. 
3	Not too sure of whether I've had a crush or not, but I have been infatuated with people before. Usually I analyze them very intensely and make more of an effort to contact them than I would anybody else. I show a little more of myself than I would otherwise  cause I want them to see me and think I'm interesting. I try to be funny, converse and connect with them on their hobbies/interests, and dress a little nicer on days I know I'll see them. Maybe try to compliment them... usually only if they're a girl though. Otherwise, I will as an act of support if they seem down on themselves. \n\nBut, I'm still very distant from people, so even though I would do this, contact between me and the person would still be pretty minimal. They'd probably just think I happen to be a little more comfortable around them since I shy away from everyone else. I've never admitted to any sort of feelings for anybody. There's nothing I'd do with these people. I'm very fond of them, but I don't actually want to date them or anything. So, no initiation.\n\nHowever, trying to do all this and trying to be interesting also makes me very anxious (well, moreso than I already am). I stress out about the conversation flowing properly so they can stay interested in me and I end up choking. And more than just choke. I had trouble stringing together the actual information they gave me, so  I'd misunderstand  them  a lot. And it was so hard to move on to something new. I would draw a complete blank after one topic was exhausted.\n\n The last time I was infatuated with someone, I had to bring a rubix cube with me when we saw each other because at some point I'd choke and not know how to proceed, and needed to get rid of the nervous energy--it was either fiddle with something or else I'd start crying. Sometimes I would anyway. 👈🏼😎👈🏼 I had hoped the rubix cube would serve a dual purpose and respark conversation and give us a new topic, but I think that just put out ‘don't talk to me’ vibes, because it never did. 
4	I analyze/deduce their every expression, everything they say to me and the tone they say it in, their reactions/tone when they speak to other girls, their body language ("omg they put their arm on the back of my chair"). \n\nAnd the usual stalking of their photos and feeling sorry for them for having a stalker. \n\nOf course when I'm with him I act nonchalant/awkward as helllllllll and barely initiate conversation. What's even sadder is that I was very capable of talking to him like a warm, friendly human being when I first met him. As soon as I started to develop feelings for him I turned into an awkward turtle. \n\nI've always had this problem of not being able to talk like a normal adult with my crushes, but if it's some guy I have no feelings for I can blab on forever. \n
3	Exactamente. And don't forget about all the time I spend wondering if I'm just an obsessed weirdo. And then probably act like it too.
3	Stay away from them as much as possible. I'm not attractive so they're never interested. I get uncomfortable and act weird which makes them unconfortable.\n\nBetter for everybody when I ignore my crushes. What's even worse is if I feel my crush is signalling interest in me. I can detect the signals but my analytical side tries to tell me why it's not real. Then I turn into a confused anxious mess.
3	I just get super awkward and generally never make a move :) In those rare occasions when I do make a move it's so awkward... might as well not have... I am not good at it :) If the other person makes a move, again, I get really awkward. So... yeah :)
3	Ay, exactly the same I did for 4 years during my first big crush as a teenager. Good thing I didn't end up with her though, would have been a disaster...
3	I let nature or the crush make the first move for me. I don't say hi all on my own, because I always assume that if we've never talked and know absolutely nothing about each other, I'm uninvited. Just to be safe. So I rarely talk to girls irl. If we do talk, I make sure my questions are open-ended and I compliment her personality. I usually go off whatever subject yields good chemistry.\n\nIn my only few [long-distance] relationships, I've been viewed as "the one" for my commitment and innocence. The problem is in the real world, I don't know the socially acceptable, non-clingy way to convey these traits.
4	I just go and talk to her, if it works cool, if not thats also cool
1	How do I react when I have a crush? \n\nHum - I *have* had experience with that. \n\nWell, my first crush never knew.\n\nNeither did my second - though one day she did say that we would always be good friends, and nothing more, which has made me wonder if she knew more than I thought.\n\nMy third - in a misguided effort to not let her know, while I was stalking her, I left hints that I had a crush on a random innocent bystander. No clue if anyone actually noticed either though.\n\nSince then, I have managed to avoided any IRL crushes. Mainly just anime.\n\nGotta agree with what someone said in the comments (sorry I am too lazy to find your name again and mention it - just read the comments people, there really a re not that many) that there are three stages to a crush: the last two were obsessive stalking, followed by nothing at all. Paraphrasing much. Horrible memory. Forgive me. My point: eh....idk...I just got tired of writing this.
1	I’m not really one to have crushes in the traditional sense. I tend to stay in long-term relationships and I’ve never once initiated. Attraction for me isn’t really immediate and I’ll connect with someone over shared interests and build a rapport organically. I have an equal, if not greater appreciation for platonic connections so people will typically interpret my casual interest in them as a person as romantic interest. I’m completely oblivious to whether or not someone is romantically and/or physically attracted to me. I won’t realize a person is into me until they’re kissing me. And while it always catches me off guard, if I’m comfortable enough with the idea of being with them I’ll reciprocate and go along with it. That has been the story of absolutely every relationship I’ve been in. Luckily it’s worked out, even if the other person’s strong emotions are somewhat foreign to me.\n\nIn the rare cases I have had crushes, it’s invariably been on someone who I have an existing connection with who is straight. I’ve never been immediately infatuated with someone. My feelings for them develop gradually, but I know I have no chance with them because they’re categorically not attracted to me. And because it’s hopeless I’ll just suppress it. I still care about them in a platonic sense, and I don’t want it to jeopardize our friendship. I’ll acknowledge it and let it pass, and cherish what I already have with them.
1	I always realize all of a sudden that i have a Crush. It happens With a big "fuck" and the realisation that love is a Feeling hard to controle. Than i Start to Analyze What IT is that Made me Fall for Them. And Then i Tell Them. Because i can  Not handle Those Feelings and Want Them off My chest
1	I also imagine mock conversations to practice interracting and check my authenticity in a safe and controlled manner. Then I move forward with no plan. \nThen if I do something that makes me embarrassed, I analyze it obsessively and talk to myself while try I g to figure out where and why I tripped so as not to do it again.
-5	INTPs are not cold by accident, they are so deliberately. While you may be NT, you are no INTP. You're either INTJ+ENTP or an ENF who deserves to die.\n\nawkwardness is an ENF value, they positively value it and think it's wonderful. They also think it's justification for loserdom. They love being losers and actively aim for it.\n\nINTPs know there's no amount of awkwardness that can't be resolved by the application of liquid nitrogen.
8	Jokes about ending yourself	I've seen jokes about wanting to kill yourself a lot, and always felt like I was someone that didn't get an inside joke. I'm genuinely curious and wondering: what's up with those types of jokes? Is it a way to deal with the reality of low self-esteem? Poking fun at the idea of giving up and failing? Looking forward to people's explanations :D
6	It’s just a part of internet culture. I’m willing to bet you rarely hear these jokes in real life. 
7	From my experience it's always people that are actualy struggling with these thoughts who make these kind of jokes. The most depressed people are often the most cynical
4	Making fun of the worst side of myself makes it seem less significant. Less serious. Easier to cope with. Turning lemons into lemonade and such.
2	I think it's more about allowing yourself to laugh at your own misery. I think that's partly what the saying about how old people realize how important humor in life is. And humor has many shapes and sizes. If anything it's more like high-grade Monty Python culture/material.
2	Comedy's from the unexpected, and you probably don't see too many unstable people.
1	Just a way to death with existential dread 
1	It's a sign that someone is actually suicidal to some degree. They may not know it themselves, but people who are depressed don't say that stuff unless they're absolute idiots.
1	Some folks like to joke about the silly predicament they have gotten themselves in, and how hopelessly they can't change it.\n\nLaughing it out makes it less serious.\n\nNot necessarily they have suicidal thoughts.\n\nThough its hard to figure out the distinction between this two.
1	this is amazing.i'm happy you're happy i hope i can reach this level of positivity someday.
1	I think it's a way to cope with the absurdity of life and death through humor. Death will come whether we like it or not, so why not embrace it with humor?
41	are all INTP's secretly the same person?	
12	Yes. There is a 'friend' group of 16 souls reincarnating on Earth. Our collective purpose is to expose our souls to as many different meta-social contexts as possible, in order to truly learn everything there is to learn about each other. You and I, we are the same soul. The ego-overlap is an inconvenient quirk in the design of this reality, but on the flip side it grants the experiencer a third-party view into his own behavior.
2	Who ever photoshopped that is hilarious. 
1	I won a debate with a friend yesterday. I think. I sent him an article I wrote that was publushed where I'm an intern. First he complemented my writing ability and said it was well researched. Then he wanted to argue about economic issues which were only part of the article. He wanted to limit it to econ because he majored in that. Once I broadened the argument to include geopolitics, types of warfare and the role(s) of the press, he couldn't debate any of the points (wouldn't even acknowledge them) and wanted to get off the phone

1	Why?
3	Burning out trying to date.	Question to the INTPs who are currently in a relationship. Everytime I start dating around guy or girl i always burn out really fast, it takes way to much energy to be actually personable and not a social stone. How did you get over the exhaustion trying to be interesting.
3	I didn't get exhausted by trying to be interesting. I just didn't put up a front. What you see is what you get.\n\nI also used the tool that was designed for us; the internet. Chatting with people online has the advantage that they get to know you before they meet you. You'll probably attract another "weirdo", but that might not be such a bad thing.
3	Bring him or her to a place were you feel most comfortable yourself; even if they are actually uncomfortable themselves. \n\nAs long as you stay on top you shouldn’t burn out as much due to you being in a familiar place.\n\nBut if that cannot be done then you’ll have to resort to the good ol fashioned “training yourself to over come this barrier of mental exhaustion”\n\nMentality is the same as stamina. If You commit to training it to get the best results possible and surpass your previous barriers to form a new level of mental or physical ability you will be able to continue that thing longer without exhaustion.
2	Stay on Tinder and Bumble. Get where you can to find out if the person can stimulate you. Or, you can choose to do cool dates like exploring cultural restaurants or events together for the first couple of dates. Those times should allow for more quieter moments and stay away from exhaustingly long experiences on the first one. OR, you can make sure to keep it short the first few times or have moments for mental timeouts. You can do it.
2	Don't try to be interesting. Be genuinely interested in the other person.
2	Find someone with the same energy level as you, that likes you for who you are.\n\nNever said it’ll be easy 
1	Don’t live with them!  No, I wish I knew too.

2	Oh my god... what a beautiful world!
1	A lot of my friends are actually INTJs and this doesn’t surprise me that you’ve posted something like this... \n\nBut yet...the word “Why” still floats amongst my inner thoughts...
10	How does one start relationships?	As in finding and starting a bf / gf type relationship.\nI've gone on many first dates but I never know how to proceed from there. I know most first dates don't progress further afterwards due to compatibility issues or one side not feeling  it.\nBut I'm not sure how I should be feeling and if I'm giving up too early .\n\nIt's hard for me to feel things, sometimes the feelings hit me like days later. So should I schedule second dates even if I didn't feel much after the first date? \nJust to see how it plays out \n\nFeel free to add your own experience. Just wondering if others are as unskilled at developing relationships as I
5	For starters, I’d say quit internet dating (which begets a skewed perception of reality) and instead ask out people you’re genuinely interested in. 
2	I have a real hard time having feelings for someone I don't know well, or having feelings for someone who seems too eager to get me to like them, (because it seems disingenuous) so online dating is pretty tough.\n\nAziz Ansari's book Modern Romance sheds some light on how people typically behave with online dating and offers done suggestions (based on real research!)\n\nOne thing I remember is one researcher suggests going on at least three dates to determine how you feel about someone. I would suggest telling them this is your intention upfront and explain why ( so you can both be more relaxed and just be yourself instead of trying to do a sales-pitch first date). People really aren't themselves on first dates.\n\nAnother tip I heard elsewhere is to set a time limit for your date. Either schedule something about 2 hours after the date starts (or whatever is a good amount of time to you) or just state that you don't want to spend too long because you're an introvert and will get easily drained/overwhelmed even if you like them a lot.\n\nAfter 3 2-hour dates you can assess how you feel about each other, but try to just have fun and not worry about it until then.
2	Ive noticed that I dont really get strong feelings early on. So if its not a definitive no on the first date you should try to get a second one.  In my opinion the answer to your question is yes. Its perfectly normal just to feel attracted after a couple of dates and thats enough. I find the love on first sight thing utterly impossible. \n\nWhen you eventually get feelings towards someone just say that out loud. What worked for me with my current (and first) gf was that I just confessed my feelings and that I would bail if I had to play games. She was a little taken back, because she wasnt expecting it, but she did appreciate it. However, I did wait for quite a while to confess my feelings, because I wanted to be sure. I think in your case that method regarding timing could probably work as well.
1	> But I'm not sure how I should be feeling and if I'm giving up too early \n\nThis how I feel as well. It's hard for me to get feelings for someone without more exposure to them, so first dates usually don't go great (and I put too much pressure on them).\n\nMaybe see how second dates and further go for some of those first dates. You may have to take things slow, and there will be some people who are either willing to do that, or need that themselves.
1	I guess all the people I have dated started out as an acquaintance/friend/co-worker or whatever so there was little to no pressure to get to know them. I would hate to have a blind date with someone or even talk before ever meeting someone for the first time. The unknown and possibility of the meet being awkward or regretted gives me anxiety. All the people I ended up dating were also extroverted cuz I think they have to do most of the talking lol.

7	What would the world be like if there was only INTPs?	Just a thought experiment. Look forward to seeing your guys thoughts.
9	I was going to say it would be a dystopia. But no. It would be a utopian society. I'm not sure how they would survive though... Maybe if they had really advanced technology they would be fine. They might have a great time just theorizing and being creative and intellectual. It would be like the perfect democracy. Because everyone's opinion will truly hold weight. And they'll be able to have thoughtful discussions without getting offended. They would have perfect equality if they can figure out a way to tame their egos. Also It would take forever to make a definite decision that everyone agrees with on various social matters. But the decisions would be well thought out. It would be a very just world. They'll also need machines to do the administrative work. Because that is necessary too.
7	Basically what we have now. INTPs rarely get along unless they are forced to or on the rare occasions don’t think they are smarter than each other. We would form cliques depending on what the INTPs believe to be true like we have now but nobody would leave their house. Education would be dope tho because we would prioritize the shit out of that. We might actually learn something useful and interesting at the same time. Money would probably be obsolete making everything harder to get but more of a trade like system we had before but through the internet. INTPs would specialize in whatever they wanted to and just trade what they make or do for whatever they need. Life would get really boring really quickly because we wouldn’t have our entertaining extroverts. I imagine our society would look a lot like the Vulcans in Star Trek. Where we prioritize knowledge over everything else. 
3	*beep boop*
3	Similar to what we have now or have had in the past, but not exact.  \n\n\nAlot of the issues INTP's deal with/complain about are based on societal interaction. An INTP born in ancient mesoamerica probably didn't have to worry about needing college for a fulfilling career, being flooded with information from the internet, etc, but he still had military commanders and village chieftains to listen to, still had mysteries about reality he wanted to uncover, etc.  \n\n\nI guess the difference would be that we would feel freer to do what we want, but that by itself might not motivate us to actually work. In fact, we could wind up understanding the universe to incredible depth but just never do anything with the information. We'd probably be content to optimize our farms to near-automation, then spend our free time discussing abstract concepts or making things we like rather than things we need. Our wars would be more large-scale tactical games performed with robots built out of excess materials rather than costly, deadly fights over issues that could have been avoided with rational discussion to begin with.  \n\n\nIt's like a quantum societal state; either we fall apart from laziness and fail or we excel from ingenuity, but not necessarily in the galaxy-spanning civilization meaning of excellence.  \n\n\nThen there's always the possibility that we, being social mimics, would simply adopt the roles that are lacking out of some passive aggressive (read: self-inflicted) peer pressure to progress as a society. But if we never knew those types could exist or were needed, that would become an experiment in and of itself. Perhaps this world was originally all INTP's, but we "devolved" (for lack of a better word) into our current plethora of personalities and types, and eventually our altered selves became more numerous than us and that's why society is how it is.
3	Much much much better place. The world and its actions would all make sense. Nothing important would be wasted. Working hours would probably be cut in half. Pretty much zero laws because we could self govern. No war. Disputes would be settled over Logical debate, and issues that couldn't be resolved this way would be decided by something both could agree on, like a video game match or something. Robots would become more and more used for jobs that we won't do like preparing food, cleaning and construction. \n\nThe current world would be insanely jealous if they had an opportunity to see an INTP world. 
6	It would be close to utopian with a few negatives lol no one would bother anyone, violent/petty crime would plummet, drug use would be rampant and no one would want to work minimum wage jobs. \n\nWe would probably have somewhat operational flying cars, a space program without astronauts and art and science would be the basis of small talk. 
2	Virtual, almost.\nThere would be very little socializing, or in-the-flesh meetings with each other. We're probably gonna figure out how to get everything done from our computer screens. Even mundane stuff like going to class, getting groceries or going to work. Digitalization is gonna be key. Kinda like that one Steven Spielberg movie which came out last year, I forget what it's called now.
2	There will be one intp who thinks "nuking them" is a form of solution.\n\nAnd everyone dies.
2	No offense to anyone but sounds like a world with no personality.
2	To me it depends on when the world became only INTPs. If it happened right now? We could be well on our way to a fluid, connected society. But it would take maybe 50+ years only because INTPs don't want to do the grunt work or finish projects that get started. But, the lack of strong emotions would help us all always push for more understanding and that's the main step. There would still be people who portray as sensors and feelers because of the counter-culture streak in all of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it was INTPs all along? I would imagine some cool stuff that reminded me of Japan. Quiet society, plenty of room for your personal vices, your voice will be heard at work (but makes for longer hours), children literally travel on their own and come back home for dinner. But, still some downsides that would be long write-up too lol.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Civilization as we know it would crumble as no one would feel the need to buy stuff for the heck of it.  Economies would fail and eventually everyone would live in cloisters.  A very simple life of ideas and minimalism.  Sounds good to me.
1	bunch of insecure people around, little communication due to poor interpersonal skills and lots of backstabbing out of said insecurity.\n\nwe would not have wars, but we would have mass assassinations out of pettiness.

14	Ehh..  They're a captive audience, I always practice my social skills with them.
10	Sometimes I get nervous and talk a lot. Especially if I'm high.

8	Exactly the way I like it. 
2	Yep. I always take Lyft. And I’m That Guy, the one who gives the driver 5 stars and a Great Conversation tag if they stay utterly quiet the entire ride. 
2	This was actually my first Lyft ride.
1	I've driven for Uber and also have taken countless rides.  Usually if I'm not in the mood for conversation, I'll try to steer it in the direction of one of my INTP interests like Programming, Magic the Gathering, personality types, etc. and if by the rare chance they're interested, I end up having a good conversation.  Otherwise, no conversation ensues.  Win-Win!
1	As a passenger I pray for these every time and then also behave accordingly in order to ensure that this end result happens.

2	Anyone here have success with meditation	I know this might be hard to believe but I, an INTP, have a problem with absent mindedness and not being present. Any of you try meditation to deal with this? 
1	Yes. It’s absolutely transformative for me when I can discipline myself to do it regularly, but it’s very difficult and takes a great deal of effort. Most of my meditation has been in the Soto Zen style which they call Shikantaza or “just sitting”. \n\n[Shikantaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikantaza) \n
1	       I’ve been doing mindfulness meditation 10 minutes a day for a little over a month, and i’m glad it’s just part of my daily routine now. I usually do it in the middle of the day between school and work, so it puts me in a pretty good mindset to take on the rest of the day. Meditation’s a simple routine you can get into that lets you recognize the thoughts and emotions you go through each day much more in depth.\n       The Ti-Ne qualities of INTP behavior means we’re always taking in information and thinking about it, and not always “living in the moment”. I’ve found that clearing my mind and focusing on the present for a short amount of time each day gives me better ability to channel the main qualities of INTP, instead of that being the default mode my mind’s just constantly in.
1	I've been meditating (infrequently but 'successfully') for 8 years. Maybe look into chakras. They're points in the body you focus on during meditation. \n\nAlso, creating some place in your mind to go to helps. I have a mountain/green plains place I call home.\n\nMindfulness: image your thoughts as cars, clouds, stars. 
1	Meditation can actually make some folks feel more worse sometimes.\n\nBecause it exposes a lot of terrible emotion hidden inside them.\n\nYou might need other measures to fix those emotions, meditation alone might not be sufficient.
1	Yeah, I did a TM (transcendental meditation) course just over a year ago. \n\nWithout getting into detail, because I cba to type it all out, it transformed my life. (Especially during a tough time) 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes after work. \n\nIt was recommended by my Dad and I have since sent a friend and my sister on the same course.\n\nDespite the huge benefits, I haven't kept it up. Knowing what I know...I wish I would. \n
1	Yes. I have done it generally regularly for almost a year. Major difference, but I have needed to increase the time I meditate. I find it has great value in making life feel more real, slowing the cascades of thoughts, staying in touch with my senses and holding back impulses. A lot of fun but the guy in the app I use talks too much before and after sessions lol

1	About Emotions	I suppose sometimes feelings are okay, but does anyone think emotions are just weak?
6	*NT* emotions are weak. We don’t know what to do with them, and they get in the way. That’s true *for us*.\n\nTo apply that logic to all emotions is erroneous. Emotions in Feeler types are powerful. They can see, discern and organize emotions in people in the same way we use patterns, logic, and organization in systems. \n\nThat’s why we feel like social outcasts and they feel like we’re “super smart”. Neither is strictly true, and one is not stronger or weaker than the other. \n\nIt’s the whole “ask a fish to climb a tree” Einstein analogy.
2	I’ll let you in on a little secret: The majority of my reactions aren’t from any emotional stand point. I make a conscious effort to over react just for the sake of it. \n\nExample; When my brother hit me in the head with a metal door draft slicing it open I reacted with anger and started to scare him Yet, I did not feel angered or upset by the event at all. I did it because I’ve convinced myself to be a certain way around certain people when in reality I’m just playing the part I’ve given myself as off meeting them. Either people see me as hot headed, quick witted and easy going, SUPER chill, apathetic, Cold or a mixture of many.\nVery little people know what I’m really like and it’s getting to the point were I’ve lost my sense of dignity due to it. \n\nWhen I meet certain people it depends on how I’m acting in that very moment and that will depend overall what kind of persona they get from me from that point on.\n\nSo, if you get a quick witted and easy going me the first time you meet me then you’ll get a “quick witted and easy going” me for the rest of time.\n\nCertain tutors and friends know me as highly intelligent and dependable YET other tutors or friends know me as stupid and silly.\n\nThe true me is just a tiny sprinkle of each of those traits blended up into water.\nIt’s the people I’m around that will overall decide what colours are brought out of me.\n\nDoesn’t mean I don’t feel emotions lol. It just means I couldn’t be bothered with something I know there is a better and more reliable alternative to. (logic)\nBut I don’t even know myself.\nWho the fuck am I?!?! \nI guess I haven’t become the person I’m meant to be yet. I am only 17 after all.

61	yes to all except running late, i hate people who don't respect time
13	That's funny, all of my closest friends have been either INTJs or INFxs
23	Thought this was gonna make me laugh but it made me sad im honestly really not liking being an intp anymore my life's always been like this i guess im just aware of it now and i hate it. The jokes not funny anymore.
20	Oooh this is so true it hurts 😩
30	*Triggered*
18	Are, ou perpetually running late? I am scared running late which is why I always come 5 minutes early. Even when it's just a 2 minute walk, I'm still 5 minutes early. 
17	This is very true for untrained INTPs, but fret not, it gets better as you age.\n\nINTPs always need strong logic behind their actions. If you are going to do something, it better be something you agree with, something that is efficient with your time and energy. If you are going to say something, it better be factual and true. Our life is a scientific experiment. We always want to make sure we are living the right life, but ensuring your behavior falls within these parameters is incredibly taxing, to the point that the opportunity passes and the action loses interest.\n\nOn top of that, much of life is inherently chaotic and illogical. Participating in society is illogical (I can fulfill my own needs), making friends is illogical (same experiment different results), attracting women is illogical (primarily emotion based), so until I am able to put these into a category that makes sense to me, I will not participate. This helps us feel "right" but this is not the correct way to operate.\n\nEventually, you will get that missing puzzle piece that makes you say "Aha! This criteria makes sense." One of these epiphanies for me was realizing suffering is by design. Suffering isn't caused by society, other people, or even my own actions (or lack thereof). Suffering is innate to nature, even with everything stripped away we will still have to worry about food, water, shelter. Thinking and worrying about suffering is in fact very inefficient, the most efficient behavior is to be comfortable with suffering.
10	I don't proofread them for fun, I proofread them because I'm compelled to scrutinize everything I read or hear.
14	Yeah, but im not lazy so like half of those are wrong
6	I can relate to the INTJ magnet. They seem to seek me out to be proved wrong. 
7	The last one. My friend went on a tirade about that one last semester. She was all like "YOUR ALWAYS ON YOUR PHONE IN CLASS, NEVER PAYING ATTENTION, NEVER STUDYING, AND YOU ALWAYS GET A's AND B's ON THE EXAMS, BUT HERE I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN AND I GET NOTHING" and that's when I realized I shouldn't take classes with that friend again, or she'll always be heated.

2	Like, I feel a little bit naked right now. 
2	wow
2	Currently an emotional mess 
2	Hey now, I'm like always early. It's not because I'm organized or timely though. It's because I'm so bad with time that I overestimate how long it will take for me to do something and I end up accidently being early.
2	"Wise men speak because they have something to say, fools because they have to say something."

15	The question for me is which comes first?  Do I get depressed because nothing is interesting at the moment (episodic/reactive sadness) or is nothing interesting because I’m depressed  (clinical depression)?  They ‘feel’ pretty similar to me. 
4	Sequence them in the head.(as much as possible). One must exist before another.\n\nCounter each *a priori* with some *a posteriori*. \n\nUse the world as your gyroscope so you don't get lost in the black hole.
4	Absence of challenge for us is pain. \*Sherlock theme plays\*
3	I would love to be excited about something. The older you get the more the reality of life weighs on you. I try to ignore it but that shit seeps in around the edges, drips from the ceiling. I can't get away from it. \n\nI could go kayaking this morning, but I'm sitting here on reddit with reality seeping in under my door.
3	This video released an hour ago dismisses the loner genius myth in sherlock and basically shit all over us. enjoy! Edit* forgot to add the link. so here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp3lJeMsEEw&t=0s
2	I've been there. The only way through the fire is to get burned and then find a way to put it out
74	Be Right, Be Amusing, or Be Kind	This is my general rule of interaction. Being right, being amusing, or being kind. You have to choose at least one and preferably more than one. If you can score all three, you hit the golden zone. If you cannot hit any of these, you might want to reassess your communication. 
21	Be right. Be amusing. Be kind...*Or be quiet.* \n\nI'd say that's my general rule. \n\nHence, I tend to be quiet.
10	I love this
10	I'd argue you can be too right
3	Be true,\nBe rational,\nConsider both parties emotions.\n\nI don't want to be right, I want to know and spread the truth.\nI don't want to be kind, I want to make people better for interacting with me. Sometimes the truth hurts.\nIf I consider everyone's emotions I can usually do well by people because the first two come easily.
2	Same tbh, also the chance in which I'm able hit either one of those vary depending on my current stock of mental energy in a certain field (intellectual, social, emotional/ethical)
1	What about interesting? 
1	It's really all that simple
1	I fully agree.  I get more downvotes on my attempts at amusing than anything though, which I find... amusing... so at least someone's getting something out of them.  Win.
1	Dude this is literally Zoroastrianism's slogan. If you didn't know this that's an amazing coincidence.
1	i try to be attentive and amusing. works for smalltalk at least.\n\nbut sometimes you have to put a lid on amusing, and just show that you care.
-13	I don't give a shit about anything other than being factually correct.\n\nBeing right is not a fucking choice, it is the basic requirement. If you cannot be right you should reassess your worthless life.
2	Are you perfectionistic?	And in what sense? In terms of your hobbies, work, relationships? Do you think its an asset or liability?
8	Im a perfectionist. Try it; it’s a great way to justify procrastination, “can’t be perfect so why try?”  \n¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n
4	The is no such thing as perfection
2	I think balance is key in all things. Great to strive for perfection while understanding and accepting you'll never reach it.

27	Someone who has no confidence found comfort in MBTI
27	r/iamverysmart 
13	This “INTP” needs to STFU
14	I don't really care about the tattoo, but that description is cringe worthy. I do not want to be associated with this person. Oh, you're smart? Better tell everyone you see!
11	seems like she's the one who's mistyped :/ \nsounds very Intj to me.\nmy best friend is an Intj as well. she has these kind of thoughts from time to time ;;
9	Eventhough i like myself .When you start using your Ne and Si most probably you keep your mouth shut.
8	their list of achievements seems a little odd to me and a bit overconfident but that's not important here.\ni agree many people mistype as intp and attempt to mold themselves into it. not sure if this is an intp thing or something that happens with all types..
7	That's really crinJ
7	>the courage of getting a tattoo\n\nthe 2000s were a mistake
7	If one day that person is typed as ESFJ, it'd be a "painful" realization
7	I just hope it's satire
5	Someone should tell them MBTI has almost no scientific basis.
7	I thought intjs ruled the world?
3	This isn't something an intp would do imo.
2	i really wanted to see a rant in the comment section of that post about how intps are bad
2	I know it's an overused word, but "cringe" most acurately describes my feelings towards this picture
1	That's why I tell no one about my type, or talk about it outside reddit/youtube comments.
20	Opening a tab on my phone and forgetting what I was googling	Anyways, title unrelated. I have a battle inside,  mbti says i'm probably intp. My logic gates tells me to slow down, research. So I did some on the mbti and it might be bullshit, to be honest I have no idea anymore. No clue on psychology, took the big five test and I like the way it presents scales, but it doesent give the same satisfactory braingasm as having as type.\n\n First time I took the test was almost 10 years ago and I fear I have unconsciously grown in to what I wanted to be. Help me reflect (as much as this sub can be) somewhat objectively 
6	Well... Shit. I can only advise you something probably totally useless but it's the way I am heading for last few months. I was a bit afraid of acting like INTP should, after I knew I am one. So I decided to try the things that are hard for me, not developed for us. Fighting with that made me more open to the world and people. I realized that I truly am INTP but it's not something that strictly describes me and limitates me. Its just some shape of the sandbox that we can develop. Different set of tools, etc. Try to be the best human you can. If you truly are an INTP you will know it anyway, but you will be also better than just that type. 
6	Being INTP is like rolling reeeeally high stats in logic and intuition, but rolling really low in emotion and charisma.\nBut intelligence is an exp booster, like talent, so as you level up you can put points into those other skills and develop yourself really really well.\n\nSo far, the biggest difference between MBTI types that I've noticed is communication style, find some more intuitives and intellectuals to sharpen your mind on, and they'll appreciate your company!
4	And in regards to your title, it happens.  Too many literal and figurative tabs, man.
3	"(the) satisfactory braingasm of having a type" \n\nAhhhh this sums up the base purpose of mbti in my life perfectly.  \n\n \nI seem to have decided on isfp myself, and there's plenty of evidence to support that, despite my having never actually tested as one.  Mostly I just started observing and analyzing my own behavior within my understanding of what the functions are and how they all work together.  One thing I'm currently trying to work out is how one can value what they feel (heart) or think (head) above the other.  Sometimes I think the ensuing warmth or chill a guy gets from a certain feeling gives a false positive on the importance of it (not to diminish it at all, because it's still a valid sensation/experience).  It's an entirely different sort of satisfaction when you reach a certain logical or tangiental epiphany and I suppose that's why strong T preference is seen as cold.  Maybe the individual value comes from a sort of addiction to the satisfaction of one or the other, but truly, that satisfaction boils down to being a feeling, either way.\n\nIdk if this helps or is simply self indulgent on my part but I can't, or won't, consider another type for myself at this point because I'd have to start from the ground up again on how and why I relate.  Like I need this framework to quantify human behavior so it doesn't all look irrational and arbitrary to me and it starts with a complete (or at least fairly fleshed out) understanding of my own behaviors.  Plus, I both think and feel I'm correct in my assessment and when the two reconcile, it's both difficult and potentially pointless to try and convince yourself otherwise (at least that's how it is in my fi-dom world).

2	Proving people wrong.	My mum wouldn’t let me get the vaccine against cervical cancer last year because she read on some mum blog site that kids were being paralysed by it. Unsurprisingly, no one at my school was paralysed (who would have thought?) and some very, very small part of me hopes I get cervical cancer to prove her wrong. \n\nWhat kind of things have you guys done to prove someone wrong?
6	There are almost no lengths I won’t go to to prove someone wrong. Even beyond hopeful thinking into real action. Even little things that take a lifetime to prove. \n\nPart of why as long as I live, I’ll always be committed to having some childish and silly humor is to prove wrong that wisdom takes the form of acting super serious all the time. \n\nI have several of these lifelong “bets” of sorts made to prove people important to me wrong that can only by nature take an entire lifetime to prove. I don’t even explicitly tell them about these “bets”, since it’s unnecessary when my actions will speak for me. 
4	I have done a few silly things to get a "your doing it wrong" reaction from people and just kept doing it. I eat ice cream with chopsticks or when someone tickles my foot, I shake the other foot.
2	1) I’m assuming you’re talking about Thimerosal. Thimerosal is metabolized into ethylmercury (not neurotoxic) and not methylmercury (neurotoxic). Regardless, there’s literally zero way to link your single reported case of neurotoxicity to a vaccine, so that would be pure speculation. Thimerosal has been around for decades and decades and shown to be safe and efficacious.\n2) Very few people in the medical field call the flu vaccine a “joke”.  It’s an educated guess on which influenza strains will be more prevalent during the next flu season and thus some years are more effective than others. The flu can be quickly fatal in the young, the elderly, or anyone immunocompromised so even if it’s a year where the vaccine isn’t as effective, it still saves lives. \n3) Neither vaccines nor “natural infection” automatically confer lifelong immunity. You can see titers fall in both. Booster vaccination is a good thing. And why are you using this as an argument? Even if the immune response to “natural” measles is stronger than the vaccine, that requires you to actually contract a potentially fatal disease.\n4) Vaccines have been shown to dramatically reduce SIDS, so I have no idea where you got that from. And correlation does NOT equal causation. At least a large portion of SIDS is attributable to suffocation due to unsafe environment and improper sleep habits. Generally speaking, the anti-vaccination moms who solely breast feed are mindful (although misguided) about their child’s heath and are probably more likely to pay attention to the importance of keeping an infant on their back when sleeping.\n5) Immunity from breast milk is largely *passive*, i.e. antibodies that will only remain for 6-12 months. A child of a mom that had rubella and who is breast fed is almost certainly not going to have enough *acquired* immunity to prevent them from getting rubella years later. \n6) Really the only thing I agree with you on is that breast feeding is healthier than pure formula fed babies. However, there are many reasons why a mother can’t breast feed.\n7) You clearly don’t know the subject very well. \n\nSource: I’m a physician with tens of thousands of hours of medical training. 
1	I chopped my left hand to prove to someone that I'm not a pussy.\n\nPs: I didn't really chop my left hand, logically that means I'm a pussy.\n
-1	Vaccines are not 100 % safe and there is a government vaccination compensation program, and you can't sue big pharma if you are vaccine injured which is contradictory, which means part of the bill falls on taxpayers, if they are so safe why go through such lengths to not allow these companies to be taken to the courts, in the 80s congress pretty much gave them a free pass hence you have all these vaccines being shoved on us, people typically got no more than 10 vaccines now it's like 70-80 not sure the current number since they are always adding. I didn't get that one because I found it not to be worth it, on their own website-Merck the company who makes them, they themselves admitted that it's effectiveness was no more than 5-10 years at the time, like really, this is an on-going issue with vaccines because they don't provide lifelong immunity like natural exposure to a disease would. You know when you get vaccinated your getting an attenuated virus injected into you along with neurotoxins, and other additives this is fact, and why some are going against them because it sometimes causes illness like sezuries, and other chronic illness. https://www.nvic.org/injury-compensation.aspx

2	Delusional obsessive murderer? Not sure how his character applies to being INTP. 
1	Not that part, necessarily.\n\nI just saw a post talking about how people approach a potential partner - the research online etc. - and saw a link.
1	I thought Joe was fascinating. It was strange to see a portrayal of a stalker weirdo - I binged the show. 
1	I watched it, the theory is he is an INTJ. A psycho one. I wanted to stop watching after the second episode but got hooked to their toxic dynamic, and he is atrocious, calculating but atrocious.

40	Are INTPs prone to conspiracy theories?	I have one other friend that's an INTP, like me, and share a similar interest in conspiracy theories... ETs mostly.  \n\nBoth of us are aware of the differences between science and pseudoscience, but cant seem to prevent ourselves from traveling down the rabbit hole.\n\nDo other INTPs share the same confused fascination as we do?
39	INTPs are just big dumms pretending to be big smart but really the reason we’re dumb is because we’re too smart so we become the big dumb
20	Nope. They're just _less_ prone to take shit at face value compared to the average Joe.
16	What the modern person labels conspiracy theories are usually not theories at all. INTP have the intellect and perception to understand the evidence, motives of actors and causal chains without having sufficient evidence to convict an individual or organization. Other mbti types are too heavily grounded in the here-and-now and concrete evidence to be able to connect the dots.  We also like to play The devil's advocate and think about unconventional things so maybe that's what you're getting at
13	I choose to believe in so-called conspiracy theories in a spirit of subversive fun and intrigue because I find the alternative hypothesis, that things really do happen for such petty and futile reasons, to be too sad to fathom.\n
10	Depends on the legitimacy of the theories. For instance, I don’t believe 9/11 was simply a terrorist act. But I also believe that the moon landing was for real
5	I would say that I am very prone to taking the possibility of a conspiracy theory being true seriously, but I try to evaluate the situation and only actually accept something as likely if it has merit. \n\nFor instance, Flat Earth theory is initially intriguing. I can totally see how some people get brought into this. There are some counter-intuitive things going on with the world being a sphere. My senses tell me that the land is flat and that the sun moves around us. There are some interesting ideas for how gravity would be generated by a constantly accelerating disc. But... It all falls apart when you start to examine the lengths an organization would need to go to in order to keep this secret. \n\nFor instance, with a week's preparation and a couple of hundred dollars, I took [this picture](https://imgur.com/t8RGbLD)(and a couple of hours of video) by launching a high altitude weather balloon. I called it project Icarus and had to trek through some crazy wilderness and cut down two very large trees to get the gopro back, but I sent something to the edge of space with nothing but a relatively small amount of money and four days of research. Imagine what a crowd-sourced campaign and a year could do. \n\nI am interested in what ET theories you have considered as most that I have looked into have violated a few of the thresholds that I see as pretty crucial to be a valid possibility. If you would not mind sharing, I would be interested in your collection.
2	Conspiracy theories infiltrate INTPs Ti with one sided information, and if the INTP isn't wise enough to look at evidence to the contrary, they can find themselves thinking that the conspiracy is perfectly logical.\n\nI find conspiracy theories mostly interesting to see what kind of bubbles people can surround themselves in and still feel sane and grounded. 
4	While I do and have theorized there are quite a few government officials and entities that have conspired against the American people (9/11, lying about Bin Laden's death, etc), I'm personally not prone to broad "conspiracy theorys".
2	when I was younger I was a sucker for them (chemtrails kinda tier, not lizard people and shit). nowadays I can realise that no, there isn’t a secret society of aircraft engineers who work for the illuminati and secretly put <unnamed dangerous chemical> into jet fuel so it gets released into the atmosphere. but as a teen I was such a wannabe contrarian that I’d trick myself into believing that shit
1	From experience I think xNFPs are the most prone to them, for me they're more just a thought to entertain, but I never really believe them
1	When I was in my teens I was really into learning about the theories and all the info. It was simply interesting because I felt there was more than meets the eye about our entire world. I guess I was looking for some sort of answer for existing. After I got into the law of attraction I was less obsessive about conspiracy theories and trying more to make the best out of life. So far so good. 
1	I personally like Illuminati/Mafia-control/Masonic/"Bush-did-9/11" types of conspiracies. They have the most probability to be real.
1	i am very interested in conspiracy theories not ET's though
1	I dont, but maybe
1	I'm a political scientist, a Catholic, and a freemason so either I don't go in for conspiracies or else I do.
1	They are at least prone to look them up, even if they find them to be BS. Just to see if there might be some truth in it and if not it is at least a new opinion and a new angle. Something that can be intresting and other times just hilariously stupid. But also yes, if one is unable to find proof nor disproof that is the case with some conspirations, INTPs can be prone to them, from my own experiences as a INTP. 
1	When I was in middle school I was realy into all kinds of conspiracy theories and even did my own research, but as I grew older I started to realize it's pretty dumb. The more knowledge I had the less prone I was to beliving them, simply becouse of logic.
1	some of them are hard to debunk. like some arguments for the faked moon landing were really hard to disprove for a layman.\n\ni guess that is the reason i put some credibility to them - as long as some of their arguments seem to make sense, i won't completely discredit it.
1	Based on my INTP friends... yes. Yes they do. 
1	Only if there's solid proof.

0	I created these cards and I think they're MADE for INTPs and INFPs	Your own happiness and wellbeing is so important so I created [these cards](https://lswmindcards.com/) to help create little boosts of happiness each day. It just struck me that they are so INFP. Do you agree? Would love to hear what you think about them.
6	>LSW Mind Cards are designed to help you to become more mindful of  your thoughts and feelings and give you the tools needed to take back control of your happiness...\n\nThis is for feeble minds. Cards that we're actually made for INTPs would likely include an interesting philosophical quote with a meme to go along with it.
2	I wish cards could make me content with life, but don't think that would be the case.

1	Y'all are slacking. I have a program for everything. -intj. LoL
1	my brain has been shut down for a while	everywhere I read that Intps think a lot but after something happened in my life, it feels like my brain is shut down. \n\nnot that I don't think about anything. but it's all in my subconscious that I don't have immediate access to.\nlike when there's a discussion happening in school, a topic that I have never thought about, I start to talk and I say things on the spot that seem like it has been thought about before. \nthe only kind of thoughts that I can recall in my mind are mostly in the form of conversations. and I read somewhere that different people have different thought processes.\nso what do you think? is this an Intp thing or just different thinking styles?  \n 
5	Same. The older I grow, the less chattering there is in my mind. I just exist in this limbo between thinking something and not thinking at all. I know something is going on back there. Subtle forms of thoughts are flashing outward from an unseen center, quickly disappearing, never remaining in a cohesive form. I might get 3-5 beginnings of a thought in a second or two. They are like short staccatos of someone yelling loud enough for the noise to enter my field of awareness. As soon as they come, are they gone. It never feels like I'm finishing a thought. I don't know what to make of it.\n\n

29	does anyone else get all excited and tell our facial muscles to get excited but then you realise how much effort it takes and your expression is blank but inside you are excited?	
11	Only an INTP thinks stuff like this...
3	Nope. I'm actually quite facially expressive.
2	Yes!!
1	My VP was telling me he was going to try to make something happen but not to get too excited, because it might not work out.   "Do you have me confused with someone who gets excited?  Have you ever seen me be excited about anything?"
1	I always thought I was smiling based on the amount of effort it feels like it takes to turn the corners of my mouth up. \n\nAfter looking in the mirror, it's not quite enough to form what other human beings would interpret as a friendly smile; it more or less moves the mouth slightly from resting grouch face to a more neutral/blank expression.

7	Abandon academia!	2.5 million academic papers are crapped out every year telling us how our wonderful information-overload society functions.\n\n"What's your source?" is the new "Which Bible verse?". Meaninglessness in the scheme of schemes.\n\nNobody really has any idea what the fuck is going on in the world. We have systems upon systems upon systems too complex for any one person to ever understand. There are no "experts". There are people who carve at knowledge with a scalpel out a chunk too small for the eye to see and try to understand and add further nonsense to it.\n\nScience is a mess. Humanities, let's not even go there.\n\nRead good, well-structured texts and other non-fiction books and perhaps the odd meta-study analyzing studies. Let people do the hard part for you. But academic papers are worthless. They are the price of tenure, not knowledge. \n\nKnowledge is very overrated anyways. Seek wisdom in the form of Ne experience.
10	>Nobody really has any idea what the fuck is going on in the world.\n\nI'm sure some people have some idea on what's going on in the world otherwise we'd be in complete chaos if that was true. That's what the systems, although flawed, are there for.\n\n>Science is a mess. Humanities, let's not even go there.\n\nScience is more of an organized mess. The humanities are studies about human culture and humans are complicated creatures so a lot of the information can be interpreted in many different ways.\n\n>Read good, well-structured texts\n\nWhat makes a text good and well-structured? That just boils down to opinion. We wouldn't really have any fields of science without academic papers. INTPs already do tons of academic research all on their own.\n\n>Knowledge is very overrated anyways.\n\nYou say knowledge is very overrated yet also say nobody really has any idea what is going on in the world? Seems like knowledge and wisdom are two very underrated things if you ask me.
6	Your conclusion may be compelling, but it needs to undergo peer review. 
6	i disagree but if one of my smarter friends agrees ill flip my opinion
3	Well said.
3	I'm not in academia although my wife is an academic researcher.  One of the biggest problems from my perspective is that when someone's experiments or other research **fails**, they rarely publish it (or get to publish it.)  And nobody else knows about their failure and a lot of time and money ends up being spent redoing such research.  Yes, I know, it looks bad when you publish a paper about your failure, but it's still good for humanity.\n\nIf you're in academia and you failed at your latest project despite your best efforts, I urge you to at least blog about it (maybe anonymously if you like) so others will know **what not to do**.  Or maybe I should start a new subreddit for failed experiments.
1	Abandon it for what?  So talent can be exploited more easily by the surveillance economy? Or do you have a trust fund?
1	I've been preaching this for a few years, welcome to the club :))\nThey all said science is amazing, science is about fascinating discoveries, learning and understanding the world. A perfect intp career. \n\nExcept it's not. Nope. Not coming back to a faulty system. Never felt happier in my life. 
1	Knowledge will only get you so far in life but imagination will take you to the stars. We have to use our imagination to create knowledge for others. To abandon science just because you think there’s a overload of information is just irrational thinking. There isn’t enough information out there that is free to the public to use. You sound like you are in college and found out the hard way that it isn’t what you thought it would be. \nSure you can buy a study but you can buy anything in this world. I think the problem stems from the addiction to power that money gives people. College is utterly useless because it was bought out years ago by equity firms. Yes there is a monopoly on education google it. Knowledge and money should be separated but it will never happen because knowledge also equals power. The governments of the world don’t want you to have too much knowledge because if people know how the world actually works there would be riots on every street. So here we are stuck in our own little happy place we’re we turned a blind eye to what rights we give away for our own “freedom and security” . 
1	It sounds like you have a critical misunderstanding of how academia and research in general work, probably because you haven't been trained to read these papers (i.e. you're not a PhD student or above), and so it looks like an insurmountable mess to you. I mean, I don't know how to rock climb and it sure looks like a wild mess to me, but that's probably only because I've never done it before and certainly haven't had years of specialised training in it.\n\nJournal papers on the whole are a mess because they're small footnotes of research. I'm sure many INTPs have random, half-baked thoughts that they've scribbled on paper. You probably have a bunch of incomplete projects, books, and lines of thought laying around. If anyone else were to scrounge through them, your life would look like a pointless and frankly idiotic mess. You certainly wouldn't be impressing anyone. But if that person is someone who's working on the project *with you* or is otherwise focussed on the same things, they can pick up those scraps and make sense of them. They can even contribute to your project based on them. \n\nSo the journal papers aren't for the general public or for people who are simply "interested" in the work, they're for people who are already trained and invested in the projects. There's a lot of information that *doesn't* go into a paper because we assume that the reader has the requisite knowledge of the field. Problems arise when the general public or media read these papers and don't realise just how much they don't know, and so interpret the author's comments in a totally incorrect way. \n\nIf you want to get started with academia, start with review papers. This is precisely what you're starting to figure out for yourself with the whole "meta-study analyzing studies" thing. Review papers are written by the foremost experts in a given sub-sub-sub-etc-field, where they summarise the findings from the field as a whole in the last 50+ years and draw all of the results from individual journal papers into a cohesive narrative that's easier for an untrained person to digest. Not *easy*, but *easier*. Otherwise, pick up any paper and it'll be nonsense to you because you don't have the last 50 years' worth of papers to give you the necessary context. You have to remember that any established academic (and even unestablished ones) can cite papers by author and year in regular conversation, just on-the-fly. If you can't do that, you probably don't know enough to assess a paper in context. 
2	I need help with a breakup.	Hi everyone, I'm new here, so please forgive / gently inform me if posting this breaks any rules. Also please be rational with any criticism which I can only hope will be meant to help rather than to project your own insecurities onto what is a really trying time for me.\n\nI've dated this girl for two years now. I loved her deeply. She wasn't perfect, but I chose to overlook her flaws and by the end of our relationship, I was giving her my all. Sadly, the same couldn't be said for her. She cheated on me with some guy she'd met in a club a month towards the end of us. \n\nIt hurt deeply that she'd done what she did, but I couldn't hold it against her because I'd cheated once too. I opened up to her and told her about my own mistake in the hope that it would let her see her mistake as something that we could get past. An attempt to even things up perhaps.. Needless to say, it didn't work. She told me she'd slept with him again and likely would in the future.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that I'd committed. I'd dropped anything I had with anyone else to be with her shortly after we started dating and I genuinely believed that we were building something together. I thought she loved me the same way and she said and acted like she did.\n\nNow I'd like to believe I'm not a stupid person, but I do make irrational decisions every once in a while. I asked her to give us a month apart during which we'd both think this through and try to figure out if giving things another go was worth it. I asked for this at a point in time when my feelings for her were beginning to seem increasingly one sided, but then again her feelings for me hadn't completely dried up. She came to see me for my birthday (Feb 6th) and she stuck around my place for three days. We went out a few times together, and she told me she still loved me plenty of times, we had sex plenty of times and it felt like there was hope, up until the last night. That was when she told me that she'd actually slept with the guy again (I mentioned this earlier) and it hurt so much that I couldn't be around her at least in that moment. I left for a few hours and came back to find that she'd called him and told him that she'd been at my place for three days. She didn't want us to do anything more intimate than cuddling after that, probably because she didn't want to have to confess anything more to him.\n\nAfter that it was a pretty cold night..it was like she'd closed herself off to me and it hurt. My definition of what love is comes from the Bible, (Yes I'm a Christian, bite me.) Specifically from the book, 1st Corinthians, Chapter 13 (it's a really short chapter but is very concise) Please read it if only for the sake of relevant conversation, and it should explain why I've tried to shrug off all the insults to my ego that this whole situation has caused. \n\nMy question to anyone who has read this far is, should I really wait for her for a month?  I feel like my love is worthless to someone who treats it like she's done. I can't rationalize things clearly because my head is clouded by emotions, that's why I'm posting this here. I could really use the extra perspectives.
6	Break up officially. She's made her choice and it doesn't seem she's apologetic or regretful. Unless you feel like putting a ton of energy into a one sided relationship because she effectively doesn't consider you two together anymore judging by her actions.\n\nMaybe have a discussion about what was wrong and see what you can take from this. However I'd suggest to stop trying/not try to win her back or convince her of something else. You deserve better and she doesn't sound like she was that great in the first place from the little you've described about her. 
4	[Here's a book for you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Tis_Pity_She%27s_a_Whore)\n\n>My question to anyone who has read this far is, should I really wait for her for a month\n\nWTF!? NO you stupid faggot\n\n> I feel like my love is worthless to someone who treats it like she's done.\n\nNo shit Sherlock. Wasting love on a whore who isn't capable of returning it is profligate, and there isn't enough love in the universe as is. Find someone worth it, and who will reflect it back to you in ever-greater intensity creating a positive feedback loop.\n\nActually first learn to love yourself, because you obviously don't.\n\n>I could really use the extra perspectives.\n\n\nShe's a whore and you're better than that. What more perspective could you possibly need?
3	You talk about love verses in Bible, but you forget there are also verses in Bible about adultery. There are also verses in Bible about purity.\n\nI don't know whether she's Christian or not. But to me cheating is always wrong for whatever reason. Cheating is destroying the trust that you have for each other. It is very easy to destroy trust but very hard, almost impossible even to rebuild that once it's destroyed.\n\nSo, you have cheated, and you confessed. Has she forgave you for that? Like literally saying she forgives you and it's time to move on. \n\nI was cheated once, and it broke my heart. I took time to think about it, and decided to forgive and forget. I thought I could do it, but I could not. I became suspicious seeing his messages. Once in a blue moon, I would wonder where he was or whether he was with some other girls. It just drove me crazy. And I decided to quit it. I could not live with thoughts like that swirling in my head. I just know it wasn't healthy. Relationship is a form of investment. You put in effort, time and money into it. But you really need to think whether it is a relationship that is worth it to be invested in. If not, quit it.\n\nI used to think, I want smart boyfriend. I got one but he cheated on me. \nI used to think, I wanted rich and capable boyfriend. I got one but it didn't work also.\n\nIn the end, I change my priority. Loyalty becomes my #1 criteria for a man. \n\nAnd I read lots of asian novels, which mainly have themes where the male character is very cold towards other girls but very very warm, lovable and silly in front of that one girl that he loves. And judging from comments, which mostly commented by females, that is the sexiest and most-wanted type of man.\n\nI am not a man, but I'd say it from female perspective, just break up. \nBecause in the long term you will want a girl who thinks the world of you, who thinks you as her precious and not just an option.\nYou may feel sad for 1~2 weeks. Suck it up. Cry if you need to. Release the emotions. After that, pick the pieces of yourself. And try to be a better man. Life may give you 1 or 2 punches, you may get knocked down. But in the end it's up to you how you want to respond to that. Either be a bitter man or be a better man. I wish you will choose to become a better man and make that girl regret for letting you go.\n\nPeace.
2	Hey there, \n\nFirstly, I understand you're in pain and the fact is, it's no surprise. \n\nHere's what I recommend doing. Look inward, gather your strength and your beliefs and try to learn from this. She cheated, that's something which should make it easier. Cheaters are shitty people, you don't deserve shitty people in your life. You cheated too, don't be a shitty person. You're a Christian, isn't sexual reservation supposed to be a thing? Why aren't you sticking to it, at least roughly speaking? Is that perhaps an issue at all? \n\nLook into Stoicism. You're alone in life. No matter what you do. Try and be mindful about what you're thinking, what you're doing etc. Time will also heal it, but it might take a few months. \n\nAlso, work with that which is true. Don't idealize the relationship. Why did you cheat? Maybe it was much worse than you remember. Maybe this is for the better after all? \n\nEven if it isn't, the fact still remain. \n\nYou're alone and your salvation will only come from within. \n
2	Hey man, sorry to hear you are in pain. Also, happy birthday!!!\n\nThis relationship is obviously over. She clearly has a connection with this guy and doesn’t want two people in her heart, so the kinder thing to do would actually be to let her be. The logic that you cheated before doesn’t apply because *relationships are not checkbooks*. INTPs are extremely prone and insecure to guilt. Serve God, don’t serve your own guilt. Guilt is a tool of the devil. \n\nI’m a Christian as well. Yes, truth may reveal itself differently to different people. However, there is good reason chastity is drawn from Scripture as part of our Lord’s commandments for how Christians should behave in this physical life. \n\nLove others as thyself. What’s often overlooked is the *thyself* part. What good is it to love others as thyself when your love for thyself is lacking?\n\nGod has already forgiven you, so why haven’t you forgiven yourself? Suffering through needless emotional pain in a misguided attempt to absolve yourself of what you did in a time of weakness is unnecessary and self-indulgent. Jesus Christ has paid the price for *all* of our sins, for *all* of our time. Is His blood not good enough for you?
1	You a hot mess holy.   \n\n\nSo first thing's first, if a girl cheats on you esp your gf at the time. Do not go back to that. She's going to cheat on you again.   \n\n\nSecond of all, she was probably thinking about leaving you when she  cheated on you the first time. Don't matter if you Christian or not just don't do it. She cheat on you after the first time have as much sex as you want but don't actually get back together with her again.   \n\n\nThird, do not wait for her if you didn't catch my drift on 1 &2.   \n\n\nLastly, why is this on the INTP sub? You are either a very emotional INTP (highly unlikely) or not an INTP at all or is your soon-to-be exgf INTP?
1	I'm sorry you feel you have to defend yourself as a Christian.  I'm sure you're not a stupid person, but you have blindly believed weird, unnecessary stuff.  If you are interested in knowing why, here is the answer:\n\nEvery single word you have read in a bible is, literally, in every way, a translation of an interpretation...of a translation of an interpretation...\n\nMost of your strongest held beliefs as a Christian were expounded upon over the last hundred years (heaven, hell, Christmas, god's thoughts on gays).  If anyone wants to fight me on this, don't bother.  I didn't go into detail...but we all know I'm right).\n\nKeep reading your bible translations, but learn HOW to do it....if you want to ever have a chance of a fulfilling relationship.\n\nYou can learn from the Holy Post Podcast.  It's full of life-long followers of Jesus, who have personally and academically studied these topics.  \n\nbible:  you're doing it wrong
1	For anyone too lazy to go look up that Bible chapter, here it is.\n\nIf I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.\n\n If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails.\n\n But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.  And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\n\n1 Corinthians 13:1‭-‬5‭, ‬7‭-‬8‭, ‬10‭-‬13 NIV\nhttps://bible.com/bible/111/1co.13.1-13.NIV

10	How do you express the beauty that is in you?	It's one of my only genuine desires before I go. I just want to be able to express that I have some elements of beauty within my perspective. I never know how to express that though. Hell idk what beauty even is in my own eyes.\n\nI just want someone to know that the time people gave me wasn't a waste. That my life was worth giving their time and that they produced something beautiful in myself too even if I wasn't ever able to express it.
11	[deleted]
4	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Beauty is thus subjective. Express yourself however you please and someone is bound to find it appealing. Self-confidence is a vital part in achieving this.
2	Music and writing. I Train these two skills so I can give an accurate depiction of my internal beauty.
4	It's specific to the individual. You have to figure out what you deem beautiful by experiencing things. Figure out what you like/love doing. Then combine them and create anything. As long as you feel good about it within yourself it doesn't matter what others think of it.\n\nEdit: I use "create" loosely. Just do/be.
1	Do you want to or do you think you're supposed to ?\n\nIt's weird to want to express something you can't even define.
1	I create art
1	People will remember you by what you did. Not who you are.\n\n\n**express** using body, speech, music, art, mind.\n\n\nChoose your avenue.
1	You read books .There are different authers saying about the same.
1	Hating myself and art
1	I take photos and posting them to instagram. I go to some interesting place (or boring... it doesnt really matter in the end), take bunch of "random" pictures. I like to experiment with unusuall stuff/styles (long exposure, lensball, color filters, targeted flash, etc...). Then at home pick 1-3 photos i really like and tailor them to my absolute perfect (loooongest part) and then post them to IG in next 1-3 days with bunch of # so i get some random likes.

5	None.\n\nJust context awareness.
1	Hedonism. Legal hedonism.
1	Why do we need to label ourselves to begin with? Putting a label on yourself is basically like going back to the Stone Age with tribalism thinking. Just think for yourself and do what you feel is right. Make mistakes and learn from them. Believe in yourself first then others after. Now I do like philosophy and thinking about the what if’s of the world but just remember that you are never gonna know what to be or what to think. There’s no “right” answer to your question. The worlds not black and white, there are hundreds of colors and thousands of hues. 
7	Intp Conversation Style	What conversation would be the most interesting for you guys?\n\n1.   Would it be more fun to start slow with small talk or be direct at the start?\n\n\n2.    Do you enjoy debating or a conversation in which you learn something?\n\n\n3.  Do you like to learn things about another person in the conversation?\n\n\n4.   Does any of your answers change if this is a conversation at work, with friends, or a so?\n\n\nEdit \nI had time to add my responses\n\n1.  Start slow then move to thought provoking deep conversation \n\n\n2.  I would like to hear about the other persons thoughts or another point of view\n\n3.  Only if friends or SO\n\n4.    1 only friends and SO. At work keep it surfacy.\n        2 no change\n        3 only friends and SO. Most people at work are sensors
5	1) I tend to keep it casual but wish substance. I prefer to jump into deep chat and actually backtrack to small talk after establishing a common interest. \n\n2) both debating and learning can be very enjoyable as long as it's mutually beneficial. \n\n3) learning things about the other person is perhaps the purpose of the conversation much of the time. \n\nI might have interest in the subject but it tends to be the people whom talk about it that really make the topic enjoyable. Therefore getting to know them better is usually the goal. \n\n4) Yes. \n\n1) it can rapidly become a spider web of topics where I bounce around from one topic to the next, briefing over some stuff and jumping into the depths of other things. \n\nIt can be random and very spontaneous when there's no goal in mind. \n\n2) this one dosn't change much. Although understand said friend better I may change how I talk to them so that the conversation goes more smoothly or points are made easier to get across. \n\n3) my friendships strongly rely on me getting to know them depth wise, usually exploring new things they've thought about or done. \n\nRarely does a friendship become stalemated because humans are complex and ever changing. Their minds are simply another thing to understand. 
1	On a night out in a room full of new people (if I survived my suicide attempt), game plan would be for mutual intellectual stimulation. I can’t relax in those situations cause there’s too many variables. \n\nI’ll probably spend the evening trying to scope interesting characters to engage with. If the “puzzle fits” I’ll take lead and speak to them for ages, asking questions to try to understand them (if given enough time, to their very core).\n\nIf I came across another INTP and they were putting on a brave face in such a setting, how I’d engage in the conversation would either seem like a blessing or psychological warfare. \n\nOnce I get the opportunity to understand someone, I see them and they see me, INTP blurs and so does the world, then I feel like anything can be said and happen. Reaching that point of comfort is hard and if I don’t achieve that inside a  super busy environment, I will 10000% melt away. \n\n(I’m still working out who I am. If that’s INTP and you’re reading this, holla)
1	1. I generally start with whatever hook I intend to discuss. I have found that being interesting at the start with something related to the idea you would like to talk about to be the most effective way to start a non-trivial conversation. \n2. I both enjoy debating and learning something from a conversation, but I can generally do both at the same time. Though if I do not know much on a topic, I will not argue from a position of ignorance. I was taught to never argue unless I know I am right. I see a debate as a discussion to learn together, while an argument is an attempt to assert that I am correct. \n3. I always like to learn things about other people. I actually started a weekly poll at work just to see how different people respond to the situation of getting to vote on two choices with minimal information. I put two words or phrases on a white board with a hash mark under one of them. Anyone else can mark which they prefer if they would like, but I give no context on the poll. So, for instance, I might put on the board "Left" and "Right". Then I sit back as people discuss the merits of left handedness vs right handedness and conservatism vs liberalism and right brain vs left brain. I learn a lot about what people project on to simple ideas written on a board and the rest of the office gets to talk about random things.\n4. Not really. I tend to be a bit more open with friends, but after working somewhere for a few years, I kind of get used to the people that I work with to the point that I can be a bit more open with them.
1	1 Direct.  \n2 Both. If I lose the debate, it meant I learned. If I won, then the other did.   \n3 Not if it's pointless details. I don't notice if I'm intended to learn it too.   \n4 Yes, everyone does. My answer will vary due to context, time of the day, mood, or if I'm tired or not...  \n\n\n\n

1	As an excessively logical person, hindsight tells me ruleset sucks in real time interaction.\n\nTrain gut feeling with cues and heuristic.(but anchor with an objective logical framework or models)\n\nUse gut feeling. (More useful to detect inconsistency in patterns realtime)\n\n
1	whats that SO?
1	1. Direct start. Cut through the shash of small talk, it'll grab my attention / interest and engage me. I'll also have an instant respect for your boldness. Make an effort with me, I'll return the favour. Give and take.\n2. Debate is how we learn things. Throwing facts like hand grenades over the communication gap to try one up the other, meanwhile...I'll just remove myself from that arena entirely, and swiftly. Argument over. Problem solved. You get to feel like a winner and I get to go live my life.\n3. It's impossible not to learn things, directly or otherwise, about a person when you interact with them. Working people out, their motives, their fears, their desires, it's how I get to know somebody and (depending on the person / situation) something I enjoy.\n4. Working within the parameters of what makes me me, I adapt to every situation.  \nI  might answer the question 'how are you?' by saying: 'Not drenched this morning.’ which might initiate small talk about the weather. Asked in a  different setting or by a different person, I might answer: 'Keeping busy.' which might politely end the conversation or initiate a      conversation as to what needs doing etc.  \nIf I can't provide an appropriate answer that I feel is authentic, I’ll      counter with a question: 'Thanks for asking. How are you doing?' or 'Has X confirmed that deadline yet?' etc. 
2	A while back I encountered someone here who said the internet killed music. Assuming you're still around, could you say that again after listening to this?	
1	Artists are now better able to market themselves and gain an international following without having to go through companies for the most part which allows for more music to be out. So I disagree with that belief.\n\nHowever I don't know what this video proves. Sounds pretty though.
0	Commercialization "templatized" everything.

6	"Perfect is the enemy of the good"	Is there any INTP that can actually accept this non sense?\n\nEdit: I would prefer to think of the word perfection in this case NOT as a "polishing" or worthless finishing method, but instead of an ideal method and state of mind that can get you from good to the great. \n\nThe context: A hard choice to my carreer.\n\nTwo companies,\n\nOne small company that you earn less, but still have your wings and freedom to challenge yourself, since the word applied is quality, and not quantity. So you can still drive yourself and the company through the great ideal.\n\nOne fortune 500 company that, you know your work will not be as apreciated, since you are one more in this sea of workers trying to lift the company and the sharers that generaly prefer quantity over quality, so the good is more than an ideal achievement, since time runs short in these places.\nStill, this choice adds something good to the table, you get to learn 10 times faster the small stuff, jump meaningless gaps that will save you time in the long run, meet people that have experience in the field that will also bring your game to the next level, you get the point.\n\nThe problem here is, in order to reach that greatness to your work and your company consistently one day, which path would be the more logical to take?\n\n\n

3	It's a convenient one-liner that encourages people to finish projects to a functional, presentable state and then direct their energies elsewhere rather than carrying on polishing it for steeply decreasing return-on-investment. So yeah I can dig it.
1	Why is it nonsense?
1	Good things now were once perfect before. Increasing effectiveness and continuous improvement is important and will always be an option. As long as there is an iota of a chance that something could change for the better it is not perfect. \n\nI would argue that true perfection is an unattainable goal for those with an eye on the future. 
1	The statement above assumes itself as some kind of absolute pattern, and projects itself to every single reality. There is no context to have a fruitful insight.\n\nSo what is the context?\n\n
12	Social media makes the meaning of friendships more superficial.	Disclaimer: my own thought, not many empirical data and statistics involved. If flawed, please correct me if you are interested. \n\nI have just been thinking about this, although social media is making our world more "connected" and people more likely to remain in touch with each other, it is actually making relationships less intimate and more superficial. I don't want to pull statistics out of my ass, but I vaguely remember when I was a freshman in high school, I have learned nowadays people have more friends on average than the people in the past, yet the relationships are not as strong and impactful. It seems to me that social media makes "relationship" building way too easy; you can become "friends" with someone you just met by adding them on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram etc without the need to actually connect with a person before calling them a friend. \n\nSocial media appears to make people feel superficially connected to each other without any efforts to be made. The meaning of "friends" has also changed drastically; friendships no longer carry the connection of strong bond because "friends " are so easier to acquire nowadays. Having three hundred friends on Facebook gives a person a false sense of interpersonal connectivity, yet very few out of the three hundreds friends actually have a meaningful relationship with you. Instead of actually going out, and to connect with people on a higher level, many people are addicted to social media because it is an easier way to remain in touch with each other without the need to face others face to face. Instant gratification, feelings of validation, and the ability to have your thoughts be heard are all upsides of social media, yet it seems relationships between people are becoming cheaper and less intimate, instead of having to meet people face to face, you can simply remain in touch with them through a screen, which to me means you spend more time with the digital representation with people than the people themselves.
3	Now I think about it, that's pretty true.\n\nBut you need to know there is a difference between "close" friends and "superficial" friends. And most people are definitely going to have more superficial friends then close friends, that's how friendships work. \n\nAnd the reason for that is that close relationships take longer to be such a thing. It usually starts out as a superficial friendship that grows into the a close one. \n\nThe thing is, you can't really make close friendships on social media, cuz it will start superficial and won't grow. But if you have close friends, and you don't have alot of chances to speak to then face to face, then social media will do. It at least provides a method of communication anywhere as long as you have an Internet connection. \n\nBut thanks for the insight. \n\n
2	the superficiality is a consequence of the already shallow connections between certain kinds of people. if anything social media reinforces something that already exists, makes it more noticeable,  and would find its own way back in pop culture if it didn't exist in social media 
1	Agreed. Not to make FB the bully, however I decided to delete it.  There truly was a detox stage where I had to figure out how to connect with people and my friends had to learn how to communicate with me. The number of people I am directly connected to severely decreased, however the quality of the relationships I do keep has dramatically increased.  \n\nI wonder how it impacts narcissism, empathy, and the ability to have real, hard conversations with people.  People tend to put the best of themselves and high moments online.  If you connect only online, you are connecting with who they want you to see, not necessarily the real, unfiltered you.  
1	Agreed. I think part of the problem is that, like you say, everyone is creating this idealized image of themselves that they present on Facebook. They create the person they want to be and curate their content on social media to reflect that.   \n\n\nMy hypothesis is that we have a bunch of people that are enamored with this idealized version of a person on Facebook, but that person doesn't actually exist in real life. Filters on snapchat, cool pictures on Facebook that only portray the peak of the experience and not what it took to get there, etc. But if we all do it together we're all creating a collective alternate reality, in a way.
1	Yes but can you get rid of it by following the footsteps of detoxing warriors? \n\nIs it really important to have your relationship so philosophical? Are superficial relationships even just being a spectator of others carefully curated life wrong?\n\nMaybe sometimes you just have to go with the flow.
1	my only friendships online are people who want something. and they vanish once they have what they need, sometimes excusing themselves with lack of time.\n\nthey did have time to get in touch to ask whatever they wanted, though. once they have what they need, even short smalltalk is out of the question.
1	I don't think social media is ultimately to blame for people settling for superficial relationships. Social media empowers people to do so, it provides the means, so it can be responsible for making it more prevalent, but that doesn't mean it's the root cause. If people wanted to create meaningful relationships, they wouldn't settle for the superficial relationships that social media enables them to make. So really, it comes down to what people want. And that's why I think you have it backwards: people want superficial relationships, and they use social media to make that happen. It's not that social media makes people want superficial relationships.
1	Disagree. Social Media, in this sense, hasn't given people any more or less friends. Just because you get added on Facebook doesn't mean you're friends. Friends means what it means. It only becomes superficial when people start defining it the way you do.\n\nI don't throw the term friend around easily. If I'm going to meet someone I'll refer to them as classmate or whatever. I personally would call many of my social media people associates. I'll save the term friends for people I'm actual friends with.\n\nThis is a mainstream thought.
1	Only if you are drifting in it and using it as a coping mechanism.
13	Self Employment and Goals	I’ve realized something. I’m currently working the best job I’ve ever had and I’m still unsatisfied. It took me a while to realize why but I think I’ve got it. I’m working under someone else’s methods.\nIt bothers me like nothing else. I can’t help but think “I am sacrificing the majority of my day, hours I could be spending making something beautiful and building up my own business, for 12 bucks an hour.” I’m currently planning an art sharing website and honing my own skills as an artist. I plan to make this a place that inspires people to go for their dreams and not spend their life losing the rat race. I absolutely can do it. I know I’m smart enough not just because I have this four letter acronym that apparently belonged to Albert Einstein, but because I’ve learned how to utilize it every day. I think you all can achieve what you want. Just be willing to saddle yourself with some burden. As long as it’s for your own goals it should be worth it. \nGood luck out there boyos. :)\n
3	Thanks )! Good luck to you to :) I hope it works out!
3	Tru that, I fired up a company last year and we haven't crashed and burned yet, so it must be going okay. I get to work on my own project while partnering with other companies to solve problems. Managing the company is a hassle but the freedom is great. Def the best, decision I have made so far.
2	"Free Range Humans" -- check it out if you want help exploring the self-employment path! Good, simple step-by-step instructions about how to branch out.
2	The general idea of self-employment and setting your own goals makes me think of asserting yourself in the world, self-establishment, working to make what you want happen. This is a good thing, and so I think that things should be structured in a way where you aren't forced into a situation where you do work you don't want to do; instead, people are empowered to work on whatever they want to work on. The whole school system doesn't even seem to conceive of the notion that people should figure out what they want and be empowered to do so, much less neglect or reject the notion. 
2	Awesome, best of luck!
1	I think an INTP’s best self develops when we ignore formal expectations and make our own way. Early in my career I was fortunate to be given some flexibility and had some courage to do this. Continuing this in every job (after some BS for a little while) has made me much happier and more successful in work.
13	Me as an INTP	*wakes up at 6am* "okay, time to get up" *mind wanders for 2 minutes. * * Gets up and checks time* "how the fuck is it 7:30?"
3	Funny coincidence: that literally happened to me too, this morning. Same exact clock times and everything.
1	same
437	INTP parent irl	
56	I taught my daughter that I celebrate "day after Valentine's day" because all the Valentine's day stuff gets marked down 50-75%
55	I’m in my mid 30s and I still get stuff from my dad on Valentine’s Day. 
26	I've never heard of parents giving to kids for Valentine's. That said I've never had a gift or date on Valentine's either.
12	Smashburger is 🔥
6	Smash? Really? For valentines day? For your own daughter?\n\nSuch a sick joke.
3	I love this!
2	I won't stop, if this was me
2	My kids will love me
2	I know what Im doing when I have kids now
2	Everyone starts as a Loli-con and then ups their game.
1	what is the weird expectation?
14	DAE get a limited Fe takeover when drunk or tired and feel good?	When I get exhausted or drunk Im suddenly very cheerful, outgoing and life is "good", even people WANT to talk with you, anybody here feel like that as well?
3	I do too.\n\nI'm making a bit as I go, it's not official, but in socionics, our last two functions constitute the "Super-Id" block, and are part of the "vital" ring (opposed to the mental ring which has our TiNe)\n\nIn a way, you could say that thoses processes are natural/automatic, and running in the background. We don't use Si and Fe very consciously. And since alcohol only disinhibits you, so arguably, shuts your TiNe off, that's what comes off ? \n\n***\nInterestingly, an INTJ I know starts to do reckless thing when drunk like, a bit Fi moody, and Se ish due to the "try to impress" part. I also know an ENFJ that told me he was fighting when drunk (So, no Fe restraint on that SeTi ?)\n\nAnyway, I think there's some truth here.
3	I get very talkative, but my speech becomes so incoherent that I can barely talk with anyone, even if I try
2	It's a rare state I strive to slip into far more often than I manage to, but yes; I know what you mean.
2	I think you've stumbled upon why a lot of people drink socially
1	I do get an Fe takeover when drunk when with a specific friend. I never become aggressive or reckless when drunk.
1	yes\n\njust goes to show you how subjective our interpretation of how well things are going is
1	yes!! every time I'm extremely tired i get all goofy and can't keep my mouth shut. \nalthough i noticed that it mostly happens when i'm around my friend. \nwhen i get like that and someone looks at me weird, it's just an immediate shutdown and then sleep 😂\n
1	Lol just got the same "switch" at my job. I have enough balls to work in a hotel. Just wanna break out.
-6	I go into Ne-Fe overdrive when drunk. Like now. I feel so good that even if I say "fuck you", I do not feel bad. Fuck your mothers nigger ass cunt, pussy ass bithc. Love and peace.
5	Thoughts on longterm partnership / marriage?	I have shied away from commitment for quite some time.  I tend to bet this may be shared by fellow INTPs.  I recently connected with someone very in depth, but mainly via text.  In person, we did have a very good rapport, but I could see getting annoyed eventually, and reverting back to my need for an absolute ton of alone time.\n\nI find myself now thinking about the potential for something long term.  Not with her (we had too many differences), but with someone else.  I am getting a bit lonely, and do like spending time with people, and I would especially appreciate a travel partner.\n\nI'm just wondering other folks thoughts on the matter, how it has worked out (or not) for you, guidance, wisdom, etc.\n\nThanks!\n\n
11	I really hate modern dating.
5	I see zero difference between living with a significant other for a long time and marriage.
3	r/mgtow
3	I'm scared as fuck of commitment, I get bored of most people really quickly, living with someone for my entire life just sounds tiring
2	I would like a longterm partnership, but I cannot even imagine any plausible scenario under which that could actually occur.\n\nI'll say this, though: loneliness isn't the worst thing that can happen to you, and a relationship with someone incompatible just for the sake of being in a relationship won't make your life better.  Also, you *can't* really know how compatible you are with someone unless you actually test-drive the relationship *in meatspace*.\n\nWe all probably need someone capable of accepting and respecting that we need our alone-times, without getting upset about it.  Have you, y'know, *discussed this with that person*?  If not, that should be your next step.
2	If you go into dating always looking for the Final Commitment, you're going to stress yourself out because there is no perfect match. \n\nInstead think of it as a way to meet interesting people (they may or may not actually be interesting) and to learn more about what you do and don't want in a relationship. After enough dating (it can be 1 relationship or 50, all depends on you), you'll know when the right person comes along. 
1	Maybe another INTX type. I'm an INF and my husband is an INT, and I have found that our biggest issues, biggest fights, and things that have eroded the intimacy in our relationship the most have revolved around the F-T judgment-making. The N connection is great, though, and we share very similar levels of introversion. 
1	It would be cool to have a super close friend such as a partner, but I am not interested in the physical side of a relationship or in having children. It is selfish, but I do not like having responsibility over someone else's feeling or being. 
1	Feel similar.  Had multiple gfs over years but it's been 3 yrs now alone.  Feel need for real connection. But too in my head about it.  I think you might be, too.  We both need to identify less with our thoughts and doubts. To go find  connection.  Life is short.  The sun will supernova.  All of this will be over and gone and forgotten.  Try to enjoy this while it lasts.  Everyone will forget our mistakes anyway. 
1	Marrige is a definetly yes if meet someone that balance you out, understand you, challange you while accepts you and loves you for who you trully are. At least how I feel about my gf. I am a INTP and she is a INFJ.
2	Do any of you guys think arguments between ISTPs and INTPs are kind of hard to win, or at least the INTP seems to have the advantage usually?	I just had a 5 hour convo with an INTP, about various topics: child support, solutions to gun problems,god and religion,rather a women should be president, and no matter what it seems he had a logical answer to every counter, or thing i said in the conversation; they weren’t  always right of course, there’s never right answers to those kind of things, but I’m wondering if it’s a Ne vs Se thing,or could it have something to do with tertiary Si because he used a lot of history to,I obviously use Ti to so my answers are logical like his it just seems kinda different between the 2 of us.
11	We will "argue" things until there are no humans left to listen and then keep contemplating in our head until some poor soul happens to ask us what we think.
6	Ti plus Ne is a wicked combo
5	He's taylor made to do what you engaged in. The only reason you came out with dignity is because he probably likes you, or agreed with you on a lot.\n\nOne on one conversations about different issues is a trap for anyone going up against an INTP.
4	My INFJ friend thinks im stupid.\n\nI just don't argue with her 90% of the time because it just cause stress to her and she *really* can't handle stress.Then she calls herself smarter than me...\n\nI think about it all the time, even when I prove myself right it will cause her to be angry, or something would be said like "that was always the solution, just because your mindset lead to that path doesn't mean you *thought* of the solution", or when she said "you think black and white, that's not an insult" and I explained to her how *anyone* who values their intellect and intuition would absolutely consider that an insult, and that I don't think black and white at all anyways.\n\nI think about it every day and how much I don't say anything, just in order to maintain harmony. It peeves me off because she always has to be "on top" at everything she does to the fact she will just build extensive lies based of her own intuition (Ni Dom after all) and build a mass wall of sudo ignorance that is unbreakable to her eyes.\n\nThere are **SO** many things I know im right at, and the fact like she claims to know my brain on top of it all is just downright stupid.\n\nINFJs act like they read people like an open book, and its like Im Dracula, and the INFJ is reading Frankenstein thinking that thats me.\n\nSorry got into an off topic rant.
2	It's indeed Se vs Ne. Ne is your "Blindspot" function or Point of least resistance (PolR) in socionics, while Se is ours.\n\nYou guys are good at direct observation (Se), but you suck at jongling with multiples ideas (Ne), especially perspectives, You've got one, yours (Ni). Us, on the other hand, just live in that world, and can improvise on the spot idea wise, but we are simply not in tune with our envirornment.
2	smart istps win debates and smart intps win debates. but remember at the end of the day its about the discussion not winning!
1	Wow, yea I wouldn’t bother trying to argue with a FJor FP even for that matter, thats like trying to get a TP or TJ to feel a certain kind of way about an emotional matter and then getting mad when they don’t lol.
4	Any INTP high school seniors taking a ‘gap’ year or two? what are you planning	I’m really torn right now. I can either one, suck it up and go through the college application process literally last minute and then some 4 years down the line risk dropping out into debt, depression or take an embarrassing gap year and work minimum wage until I’m mature enough for school.\n\nI will most likely choose the latter. With my gap year, my plan won’t make sense to most people but I’m going study for the SAT again and ensure I have standard math and writing skills.\n\nWhat are your plans and why aren’t you going to college right out of high school like most people. 
6	Take the gap year, there is no shame in that. I wish I could go back in time and take a gap year instead of getting in a biology degree last minute just because i didn’t know what I like. Take your time, think straight and don’t worry about it right now, I believe you’ll make the right choice!
6	Americans are force fed the idea that college immediately after high school and a then a regular 9-5 job until they turn 65 and are too old to do anything fun anymore are the only appropriate paths for life. \n\nFuck what everyone else does. You know yourself best, you do what makes sense to you.\n\nExplore different jobs. Go see things. You're too young and life is too short to get hung up on college!
4	There is NOTHING embarrassing about taking a gap year! Or a gap FIVE years! School is overrated for the "social" part of things, it's literally to get an education to better your chances of finding work. I think you should eventually try for a degree (or maybe trade school!! Two year degrees and certificates may be what you need instead of a four year!) just because a bachelors is the new diploma, with most of my friends continuing to get their masters...\n\nAlso, check our your local community college classes to get boring prereqs out of the way, for CHEAP! Plus they usually have awesome grants and scholarships, apply to them all because a lot of people don't know about them! And JR colleges are known to be easier than Universities. Do NOT be ashamed, do what is best for YOU. Best of luck to you!! You've got this!
3	It's better to go to a better college in a year than a worse one now
2	I seriously wasted 3 years of my college life because I didn't know what path to go on. Take the gap year, move away from the family, grow up/gain experience, then decide on a path
2	One of the absolute best things I've done in my life is take a year to find out what I really wanted to do and could do\n\nSure it put me a year behind everyone else but your further years will be more satisfying and hopefully less regretful
2	As someone who has mentored many high school students, I can almost gaurauntee you that you won't regret your gap year. I wish I had taken one after burning out by the end of high school. I would have done much better in college. Just make sure you make some goals and have at least some form of a method of accomplishing them. You're doing the right thing by wanting to better your writing skills. I'd suggest reading some books on effective academic writing to help you prepare. Many kids go into college unable to write on a college level, so you're really helping yourself succeed in the future. \n\nAlso, explore your different interests. College gives you some room to figure out what you want to study, but definitely not enough time. I went into college thinking I'd want to be an engineer/scientist, but wasn't sure what kind. I had only 3 semesters to decide. I ended up picking something too broad to even get me good work after. I ultimately learned what I loved after college during my gap year before grad school. If I could go back in time, I'd use a gap year before college to really see what's out there in the world and find my passions. Taking a gap year after college literally transformed me into a much better student, much healthier person, and someone who actually isn't burdened by the brain fog college induces in many students. \n\nIf you can, keep a journal of ideas. Jot them down during the year because it'll really help you find understand what you love so you can do that in college. \n\nA good way to explore interests is to look at free college courses online. See what they have to offer. Speak to college students or grads in different fields. Also, try to see what makes actual money. Just because some field might sound like it's helpful for humanity doesn't mean it'll pay well. Actually, most of the money is in fields that help large corporations become even bigger (even if those jobs aren't very technical). If money is a goal of yours, definitely see what your options are. There's a sweet spot in almost every field where you can make a good living while also being a true benefit to society (if that's something that's important to you). \n\nMake sure to also take breaks. Use this chance to free up your mind from school stress. That'll help a lot because you'll enter college feeling refreshed and ready to conquer. \n\nI'd personally try taking on a single impactful project. It'll be something to write about to explain your gap year on college apps. It can be in anything really, as long as you have care and passion for it and can transmit that through your college apps in the future. \n\nAll the best! 
2	I think getting school over with as soon as possible is the best thing to do. School in general was just a waste of time for me and the only value I got out of it was a degree that made the initial job search easier. Real value is in figuring out how the world around you works in order to make what you want happen, and school approached that in a really retarded way. \n\nBut, on the other hand, you can learn about the world by taking a break from school itself. I guess I'm making the assumption that you need to finish college, but you don't really need to. Really the only thing I have of value to tell you is that learning about the real world is what is valuable, and you learn about the real world by doing things in the real world. School is just a tool to use in order to make what you want happen, for example: making it more likely to succeed in breaking into the computer programming industry by getting a degree.
1	I did one year of Uni straight out of high school and I was like, fuck this. I then took three years off, which I spent working (aka racking up life skills) and travelling. When I went back to uni I was so ready. It didn't bother me too much being a few years older than my classmates. And legit, there are very few other times in your life where you'll be able to take a gap year, so if you're not totally certain what you want out of university, I can't recommend it enough.

11	I had a job interview this week and have another one coming up. I practice smiling and light chuckling before going into an interview.

2	yeah, that is true
2	First time I've seen something in this sub that I 100% identify with that I thought wasn't true of anybody else
2	Thanks for this. I Just finished an interview and this thread helped distract me, for about 10 min, from thinking about all the things I forgot to say and how I "should" have answered some of the questions differently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I think it went well. I'm still going to ruminate over it for the next day or two though. Anyone else have this problem?
1	Is goku like awkward in the 2nd pic? I dont get it.
1	Hmm, when the interviewer asked me why i wanted to join the company, i replied with a “why not?”.  Anyway, 7 years on and i am still here. 
1	How do you find the energy to act differently than how you actually are? That's tough. Sure, maybe during an interview you're more formal. But why change attitude if there's nothing wrong with it. 
1	I swear I was born in the wrong time period. I should be on the battlefield with an axe or halberd or something.

4	How to remove the need to double check?	No matter what it is I always have to double check or have someone else confirm it. Whether it's an original thought/solution, chess/fighting game strategy or programming related. I remember hearing that Si-Ti functions always make it a permanent thought that we're forgetting something. How do you bypass it
12	Triple check
8	Listen to your intuition.
4	How important is it really?\n\nI've found most things in life that I spend time double checking or worrying about aren't really worth that effort. Sometimes you just have to close your eyes and jump out the plane!
2	I've never had this issue, and I actually get pissed off when people ask me if I've "double checked" because it feels really condescending, and I'm way too arrogant to admit the possibility I made a mistake. Just a guess, I have no experience in psychology since I'm in middle school, but maybe your need to double check stems from a lack of self confidence? Maybe you could fix it by taking self confidence courses etc. It probably won't work but it might.
1	Game the system by double checking if you double checked everything and go from there
0	Participate in my Survey	Researching the theory of subtypes.\n[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WMhQAkegNdJ-A3xJcFrW-nFWrr7GmA0hZas0JV9VNgo/edit)
1	The Man Who Wasn't There (2001)	Just seen the movie. Apparently Ed seems to be INTP, don't you think?
8	Inferior Fe aspirations make me like humanity as an abstract humanity, yet not liking people individually. Does anyone else relate?	I have always had this grandiose dream of being able produce things into the world in order to help humanity as a whole, and I have always put great importance on abstract human values such as character, compassion, altruism, perseverance, and kindness, yet down to everyday life, I often find myself bored and tired of people, so I have very few friends, and I'm awful at building and maintaining personal relationships.
4	I can relate, however I have plenty of "friends" and different levels of "friends" Don't give up and dumb it down to the fact that people make you bored and tired. I say the same thing in general but there are people out there that are worth building and maintaining personal relationships with. The hard part is just trying to find them ;). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal situation has left me complacent however. Whether I have 5 friends or 20 doesn't really matter. If I feel satisfied in my social sphere I don't actively look to add more to it. I'm lazy and low maintenance. High maintenance people never make it past perimeter defenses.
1	Haha, yeah. I would say that's Ti rationalizing Fe, though. \n\nFe itself is somewhat automatic for me, and somewhat outside my control (thus, the problem). All the nods, the smiles, etc ? Eitheir none at all from me because I'm in control, or too much in my opinion.
1	Yes, people are quite surprised by how idealistic we can be about people yet also so pessimistic of any of it ever happening
1	Are you me? I literally could have wrote this verbatim when I was 18. \n\nOkay, maybe not - probably in a more unhealthy way with more anger mixed in. \n\nI’ve since been able to reconcile and unite this paradox within me. 
155	Anything but a phone call	
11	I had this phobia of email in college.
11	I prefer phonecalls. let's get the convo over with already, I got places to be. I'll understand better if I can actually hear you, texts are lacking.
5	Literally me. I'd far rather go out of my way and go on hour walks to get there than calling somewhere.\n\nI kinda half-blame shitty parenting on this because when I was like 5 my parents would yell at me to never touch the phone because everyone would be annoyed at me for doing so (and at them as they were my parents) and that no one wants to talk to me on the phone. And now they don't understand why I have phone anxiety as an adult.
3	I'd opt for the walk just because I love the snow.
3	I would honestly rather have a great conversation on the phone than a bunch of meaningless texts throughout the day. BUT, ask me to call a business or something and I freeze and have no idea what to say. 
2	I’m glad I overcame my fear of phone calls. They make things so much easier.
1	ITS SNOWING!!!!!!
1	I do despise phone calls but I despise walking even more. Besides, it is more efficient to just call. 
1	no u
1	I will do literally anything to avoid leaving the house.
1	Yep. That's me.
1	I thought i was alone in this world
1	My phobia of going out is stronger so I'll avoid it until I absolutely cannot then make the dreaded call
1	i feel more comfortable by phone or text. if i may control the conversation. otherwise i need time to control my panic
1	So that just happened.	I hate small talk.  But long, psychological, philosophical conversations are fulfilling for me.  My landlord is also my downstairs neighbor, and friend, and we have these deep conversations.  But, its physically painful for us to engage in small talk.  When weather is extreme, we each hate running into one another.\n\nThe weather was conducive to standing in the yard, amongst the debris (he has a compulsive difficulty using the garbage).  He looks like a crazy homeless person.  But he has a storage shed full of antique luxury cars.  About 20 years ago, he was the real estate lawyer who was responsible for turning a small, run down, blue collar town into a thriving, upscale, art-destination (now overrun with SJW's....).  For fun and relaxation, he sues this town for abusing minor tax codes.\n\nHe also used to hang out in Manhattan with writers and was buddies with Kurt Vonnegut, among other name-droppy names.\n\nI noted I've been learning more about how my brain works, but it's depressing, b/c I can't change it.  \n\nAnd then, in a single block of verbal text, he explained the following: At his age, he's close to death (as he enjoys telling me).   Through lots of couch-Freud-WoodyAllen style analysis, at age 70, he realized he had been going after the wrong type of relationship.  It was a result of not-good early experiences with  family.  His whole family.  His smirky, throat-slicing gesture reminded me he is close to death, and thus, no hope left for him.  (These types of interactions are common and comfortable between us).  As I'm significant younger, I still have a chance to take advantage of my new found knowledge.   And then he said I'm at the top 1% of smart people that he's known.  And then he tried to unlock the garage door with his car clicker.\n\n\nThis confirms why I can't tolerate most people.   I used to think that this the result of me being an intolerant asshole (who's also INFJ, with way too much empathy).  Incorporating this new knowledge into my interactions with humans....\n\n
3	>I noted I've been learning more about how my brain works, but it's depressing, b/c I can't change it. \n\nWhere there's a will there's a way.\n\n>I still have a chance to take advantage of my new found knowledge. \n\nKinda contradicts what you said above. Care to elaborate on your new found knowledge?\n\n>This confirms why I can't tolerate most people. \n\nWhat confirms this? Someone telling you that you're at the top 1% of smart people that they know?
2	Get over yourself, we are all human. The guy knew Kurt V. he didn't say he was him or achieved anything like that.\n\nYeah, he has some classic cars.

23	Your views are not objective.	The problem with the world today and the scientific-objectivity-materialistic supremacy is that  everybody thinks that their views are objective. Further, nobody is aware of their own ignorance. Therefore, everyone from the high scientist down to the redneck believes he has the correct facts and views and any opposing views can be dismissed with a wave of the hand.\n\nWhen you think your views are objective, it becomes impossible to even hear what your opponent is saying because your mind blocks and serves up a rejection without deliberation to protect your worldview.\n\nLiking science does not make you an objective thinker. Being on this forum does not make you an objective thinker. Calling yourself a rational thinker does not make it reality.\n\nThe truth is, nobody is an objective thinker. This is your mind we are discussing. Nobody's mind is an objective world-processing engine. It is by definition a subjective process. You can read all you want and form opinions drawn between the patterns of concepts and relations formed in your mind, BUT YOU HAVE NO OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING. You believe and communicate what you FEEL is objective.\n\nLet us not even discuss those who take their feelings as objective facts.\n\nNow everyone abandon this materialism nonsense please and turn to idealism. Then we can perhaps have something resembling an open-minded discourse.\n
5	I agree with this and therefore this post is an objective fact (obviously).
7	No way to be objective. I’ve shared this thought for a while
3	World is flat- any disagreement is just idealism 
2	I approve. Nicely written as well. 
2	Happy cake day
2	> BUT YOU HAVE NO OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING\n\nI HAVE OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF MATHEMATICS.\n\nchange my mind.
2	There is reality that exists independently of your mind: external reality, external to your mind. That's an obvious truth. People have access to external reality via their senses, so they can form mental models of it which they can use; that's thinking in terms of external reality. Thinking in terms of external reality is objective thinking. Therefore, people can think objectively. This type of thought doesn't place the thinker as an absolutely powerful dictator; instead the thinker is absolutely receptive to what's external to them, so what is external is what ultimately governs it.\n\n> When you think your views are objective, it becomes impossible to even hear what your opponent is saying because your mind blocks and serves up a rejection without deliberation to protect your worldview.\n\nThis isn't someone who is truly thinking objectively. If they were, they would value all types of different views, or perspectives, since they exist externally, and wouldn't instinctively block themselves from seeing another view. The person you're describing is someone who is deluding themselves into believing they are objective, and hiding from that which shatters their illusion.
2	Be careful when using universal quantifiers. I take nothing as an objective fact. Everything and everyone can be, and probably is, wrong. For almost every statement I claim, I assert that I'm probably wrong. I listen to all view points openly. Just because I can breakdown someone else's argument does not mean that my argument is correct. \nIt's also seems like a weird post in that you seem to discredit your own assertions. Your first sentence seems like a belief. You then say that if people would turn to idealism we might have more open minded conversations. I don't really get it. Are you excluding yourself from your argument? 
1	Dope shit yo. Been thinking along these lines the past few days, like exactly about this issue. You had an even broader interpretation though of the zeitgeist as being predominantly materialist in its epistemology/ontology. \n\nInteresting how even in universities, professors of the humanities are often objectivists. I've had many English and Philosophy professors even bemoan how freshman all enter university with a view of cultural relativism, but that these need to be kicked out of them. \n\nRemembering this, perhaps this materialist view is even more common amongst those who perceive themselves as being more educated and elite, as a means of exclusivity and gatekeeping. \n\nHowever, it also seems in vogue amongst the alt-right, as people like Jordan Peterson rail against the failings of what he perceives as a predominantly postmodernist zeitgeist. \n\nWhich paradigm is really predominant right now? Are there clear affiliations between the right-wing and objectivism and the left-wing and idealism? Are there statistically significant correlations between those who play the knowledge elite and objectivism, and teenagers with "it's all relative to how you look at it, man." I don't know! These are some big picture questions upon which I would like to see some sociological, philosophical, or historical studies done. 
1	don't fuck the notion of objective understanding of reality like that. what humanity actually calls objective is the consensus our minds have of how to interpret reality. \n\nin the notion of what is *objetive* reality towards human life. what is real while in the realms of our understanding.\n\nIn the context of some kind of lifeform that isn't human, our understanding of reality (taking science aside for a moment) might be total and complete bullshit, only existing because there is something so flawed in our thought process that we cannot ever spot it on our own. \n\nThe question here is who fucking cares if we are limited now? It is more interesting for human advancement to have a strong structure to work with, a living framework  to interact with, than to accept our capabilities as limited and that's it. Humanity (should) strives for our betterment, for advancement. We will find a way out of our limited bodies some day. some how. cybernetics mixed with bioengineering maybe. who fucking knows. \n\nI don't know our chances of dying in the process. though I highly doubt them.\n\nand for your mention on all those stupid people who proudly and mouthfully claim to be right because "that's just how it is", "it's objective reality, I read it on six books written by authorities on the subject!", " but it's just so fucking obvious you moron"... don't use those people as examples of intelligent people. I've met undergraduates more intelligent than assholes with masters degree who were 'authorities' on their subject.

8	Is it common for INTPs to disagree with other people irl and say they do so?	I've seen a lot of different ways people describe INTPs and one of the common things people say about them is that INTPs prefer to not speak their mind so they won't disrupt the peace, which I found kind of interesting but weird, as in 16personalities.com there's nothing talking about that from what I remember\n\nWould you guys be more like me or would you say those descriptions are accurate?
14	There are a few reasons why I might speak up against someone:\n\n* If someone asks me my opinion, I will give it to them honestly and civilly.\n* If it is a project I am invested in, or have a responsibility or duty to the group, then I will speak up. This can be from friendly suggestions to outright explaining why someone else's idea is a bad idea (in my opinion) and challenging them to defend their idea.\n* If someone is attacking or spreading lies about me or someone I care about, then I will defend them.\n* If someone is mis-educating people I care about or about a topic I care about.\n\nOtherwise, I will generally keep quiet. I am more interested in learning new knowledge, developing my skills, building my projects, than starting conflicts/ending conflicts.
9	16personalities is stupid.
5	Beyond being intp, there's a person. Just as beyond nature there's nurture. \n\nI was *born* intp. I've *learned* to pick my battles. 
4	Because of past experiences, and how people would always get annoyed by my trying to correct a wrong idea, and seeing how at the end they won't change their mind but will think ill of me, and judge me... Now, even if it is killing me inside, I won't give an opinion, or I'd just say something like "yeah, sure" in order to avoid damage to my own public image. Unless I'm talking to someone I really care about, then I'd correct them and explain my point in detail. \nI guess I learned to assess the audience, and then decide whether it is worth it to participate. If I know the whole conversation won't go anywhere then I don't say a word, it kind of saves time and effort.
1	sure u disagree . conflict is the foundation of the universe.  \nthe better the vision, the higher the responsibility
1	I speak my mind on platform like this, but IRL, I keep the peace more often than not. Like, besides family/friend, I keep quiet, and even among them, only to "thoses who can take it."\n\nIt's useless to speak if people aren't listening.\n\nA good example was when in my class, a guy kinda "attacked" me because I didn't faith in God, I didn't answer. In part not to insult other believers, in another part because he's very pissy, and he is gay weed-smoking, cocktail-drinking, tattoed muslim (I kid you not).\n\nIt was simply not worth it.
1	Most of the time, it is best to keep your mouth shut unless it is worth the battle. 
1	I'm an intp and this is true. I usually always disagree with what people say 2/3 of the time.
1	Yes\n\nI'm contrarian.\n\nDon't really know why, but it's a strong urge especially when it comes to emotions. Other times, I only disagree to point out a flaw.
1	I'm very assertive. I take up a lot of space and like to spread out my thoughts in a pile to scatter them and make sense of the bigger picture. I don't give a shit about your feelings: I want the closest thing possible to truth independent of perspective.\n\nI can be insensitive if we disagree, and I'm told I have a lot of power in an argument. My personality has at times been described by people who know me as "fighty" or resistent. \nIt's not that you can't convince me. It's that you must convince me. \nOtherwise I'm simply unconvinced and I have no problem spelling that out. 
119	INTPs are everything	Hi guys ☺,\n\nINFJ here. I just want to tell you all that you are my favorite personality type. People may not necessarily pay attention or notice you first, but know that some people like myself do see you. \n\nI have never been more intrigued, excited, passionate and myself more with any other personality type than INTPs. You make the greatest friends, life partners, partners to duo ranked with on League of Legends 😂, and so much more. \n\nAt first, you give off the weirdest and coldest vibes, but know that INFJs got your back and won't back down from getting to know you better. We just click on many levels and the vast majority of our respective personality types are intellectuals. I can easily discuss with an intp for hours and NEVER get bored. Our connection is just effortless. \n\nI just wanted to let you know that there are some people out there that truly appreciate you for who you are. I hope you all have a nice day!\n\n-from a INFJ 🤗
99	Get out of here you dirty feeler. I don't trust this... ;) 
38	Now if only everyone had their personality type floating above their head...
26	INFJ, basic level: do good things for other people.  Volunteer at a soup kitchen, clean up garbage on the local beach, help out at the animal shelter. \n\nINFJ, intermediate level: spend your life committed to the well being of others.  Work at a non-profit legal firm.  Social workers who help the homeless. Create and run a charity.\n\nINFJ, expert level: write books which lift up the world.  Have a dream for the equality of man, and die too young because of it.  Spend your whole life tending to the needs of the poor, sick, and hungry, while eschewing anything other than the most basic items to live.  \n\nINFJ, God level: let INTPs know how much you love them.\n\nWell played OP, well played.  
18	Can you talk to my boyfriend? He thinks I’m defective because I don’t give him any emotions to feed off of.
12	There needs to be a guide on how to find INFJs. Or maybe an app to make it easier \\o/
23	Eh.. Just remember to beat down their narcissism/ego with a damn 2x4 before their head explodes. You would be doing them a favor in the long run. They are not everything.
11	I’m an INFJ and my significant other is an INTP. This resonates with me so much!! Definitely also had to beat down his defenses 😂
7	> At first, you give off the weirdest and coldest vibes, \n\nMost women say I set off DANGER DANGER! DANGER WILL ROBINSON! Signals when they first meet me and then after awhile they realize oh... he is completely harmless and a great easy going guy. I don't know if that is an INTP thing or a just me thing though.
12	I like the INTJ’s
5	Compliments make me uncomfortable

3	What the deuce??? do ALL INTPS play League of Legends??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDamn. Well I played Teemo, Heimerdinger, Jinx, and Miss Fortune. :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLET ME GUESS.... the one you matched with ALSO played these League characters??? Are we ALL The same??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso. Where can I find INFJ's??
3	INFJs are pretty cool.  I married one, after all.  You keep us connected to the world while we wish y'all were a bit more selfish and lazy.
3	The INTP/INFJ connection is real.  \n\n\nUs to you: perpetual novelty engine who, during difficult times, will not meet emotional explosions in kind.  \nYou to us: emotional and logistical support person, willing to accept our divergent beliefs and social ineptitude.  \n\n\nWe make good friends in many cases.  \n
5	cute, but too nice
2	I'd duo with you. What roles do you play ;)
2	Cute
2	my dad is an infj as well, and we definitely appreciate each other.\nalthough he can be stubborn at times, and has communication issues. even with me.\nthat's my only issue. other than that, it's pretty great :)
2	I love INFJs as my favorite type too, I only know one unfortunately 
2	This warmed my heart. Thank you!
2	I wish I was everything\n\nbut it's too much work
2	And... That’s why I’m married to an INFJ. For some unexplainable reason, she actually likes me just the way I am. INFJs are a true blessing!
2	I never get more compliments than from INFJs. 
2	Every man I've ever been attracted to/dated/slept with has ended up being an INFJ.\n\nYou guys are alright, I guess ;-)\n\n
2	This has to be some sort of scam. 
2	Welp, time to go shopping for an INFJ. know any good stores? 
2	I’m an INTP and my best friend who is an INFJ tells me this all the time lol\nI’m thankful that she’s in my life since I have difficulty with emotions/emotional people and she helps me act like a normal person. And vice versa, if she is too reactive in situations, I help her calm down and rationalize it. We both can relate to each other and help each other where we both are lacking. 
1	What's your name in League of Legends?
1	I am a INTP and my gf that is a INFJ click with me like no one else I've ever met as well as she has a similar yet very diffrent past than me, won't get into it but yes, INTPs and INFJs can go great together for sure.

6	I am INTP but i can relate to others feelings on a very good level. (Although, its hard for me to give emtional support). Its only when my logical mind over-shadows the emotional side and i start being really self centered and rigid, at times arrogant. Who can co-relate?	
5	I am good at 'reading' people *because* my reasoning is not clouded or interrupted by emotion...\n\nI see the logic and reasons behind even the most seemingly illogical or irrational behaviour. I can communicate all this to a person and show: I *do* understand. Being able to empathise, I'm not prone to judging others' based on their behaviour (because I allow for and look to their motives). Hence, I'm forgiving, hard to offend, not prone to feeling resentful and am eager to offer help / comfort / support. *But*, like you said, I struggle to provide emotional support. Because, like others have said, this is 'cognitive empathy'.\n\nIt's the same reason why I am so poor at providing comfort...\n\nWhen I am 'reading' someone else, I have distance. Assessing the situation from within the eye of the storm is not so straight forward, least for me. Some INTPS are more emotionally intelligent than others, and / or become so. I repress emotion because I don't understand how to process, alleviate or manage it. Half the time, I don't even know what the feeling is. When I am asked how I feel, I reply with how I physically feel or with what is going on externally. When I even answer. I'm more likely to show than tell how I feel.\n\nOften, it's my (INFP) friend who 'reads' my answers / behaviour and identifies, explores with me and explains my feelings and the probable *internal* cause(s) to me. Equally, and in turn, when the same mate says how she is feeling, I am eager to explore and can usually identify and explain the probable *external* causes that lead her to feel those particular emotions. She emotionally empathises. I cognitively empathise.\n\nMonster post, but I hope it provides some insight in to the difference between cognitive and emotional empathy.\n\n&#x200B;
3	You're not actually feeling or being emotional. You're just exhibiting your cognitive empathy. Experiencing real emotion or being emotional in general is very hard for us to understand/experience. It is our lowest function stack (Fi).
1	When I was younger.\n\nLess of that today.
11	Low level job matches	I just want to know if anyone knows of entry/low level jobs that would be a good fit for an INTP, which seems unlikely 
3	pizza delivery / IT tech support / uber / lyft / truck driving / front end development/ UI/UX / back end sys admin (junior level). Generally anything that limits your extended human contact and creates a non-boring work environment for you. I find office jobs are a little too boring for me so driving around delivering pizzas suddenly becomes a new adventure every day which helps me stay engaged with my job. These are just some jobs that I've personally worked and seen from other intps posted in this sub. Hope this helps ya.
3	Basically none unless you like coding.  We have a service based economy so basically most jobs will appeal to fjs.
3	Uncommon answer but machine operator, factory worker, order picker, etc.. \n\nSomething that doesn't require much thought in itself, which allows you to be in your own head, music, or podcast.  Also the constant exercise is great. You end up at the end of the day physically tired but not mentally tired.\n\nAlso, these jobs tend to have a gamification to them.  Competing against yourself or other people for numbers, efficiency, etc..  
2	I get really annoyed when I hear people whinging about a "graveyard shift" or saying they've got nothing to do at work. That's my absolute dream job, you ungrateful bastards.\n\nHow can't these weirdos entertain themselves? Read, play online chess, study something, learn something.... and get paid!
2	Any support line. (I mean level one support lines)
2	Technician or mechanical engineering/repair/maintenance, coding, or back-end system administration.\n\nJump on in, the water is fine. \n\nBe ready to learn faster than others.
1	Jobs that are good for one INTP won't necessarily be good for another. You just got to go out and try things and see what works for you as a human, not you as an INTP.
2	Hey! A checklist	
3	Being late is disrespectful as fuck
11	On Awkwardness	There are moments in life where you (or less rarely someone else) make a moment awkward due to misunderstanding a social norm or otherwise transgressing on an accepted stereotype of culture. These moments make everyone involved involuntarily take pause and confront their comfortable position in the world. These moments hurt, just a little bit, on the inside. They reveal where we are most vulnerable and where, as a society, we have small pockets that cause cognitive dissonance. \n\nI love these moments. These are the time that we can see a small sliver of truth in our world. I think we need to embrace these awkward moments. They are not our fault. They are a symptom of a system. A system that we need to learn about in order to be a part of. These moments of awkwardness are the times that we get to see the boundaries of the system and get to figure out how things work (or do not work). These are truly great moments that we should seek out. \n\nPlus, they're funny. 
4	Yeah, I don't know. I don't see it the same way you do. I think most awkward moments are just due to misunderstanding. And understanding more often than not does not signal truth, it signals idiocy.
4	A friend said “wassup” and I responded “nothing much, how are you” and apparently that’s not a suitable response. I don’t get it
2	That's quite poetic

1	Interesting, but how can I use this to create nuclear weapons and defend my personal rogue state 😢
13	Emotional weakness to nostalgia	Just as the title says. Like when I'm watching shows and stuff the most messed up events usually don't make me feel anything. But it's the nostalgia of going through thick and thin with the characters that gives me the feels. Usually when I listen to Anime OSTs, the cause of the feels is the nostalgia of watching the show rather than the show itself being sad. I also tend to feel nostalgic very easily (events from like just weeks ago) and I would randomly reminisce times and feel like shit. It's usually worse when I listen to a song I associate with a past event. With that said, some research shows that this is a trait of tertiary Si of INxPs rather than Fi which I initially mistook it for. Is this indeed a tertiary Si thing? Also it really puzzles me as to why this phenomenon occurs. Is there any logical explanation as to why Si in the tertiary slot would exhibit such behaviours?
2	I recently felt this way when listening to a few songs.\nThe first was the opening theme to Wind Waker. I had finished the game a few months prior, but upon listening to the song I started crying. Hard. I was so surprised. It kept happening as I listened and I couldn't figure out why I was crying. But then I eventually realised I just missed it. Is that nostalgia? \nI'm hyper-sensitive, which makes tears happen a lot. For good and bad.\nIt happened with another song too.. But I forget what it was.
2	I heard on Personality Hacker that one's tertiary function is often used in times of play and relaxation. Tertiary Si-induced nostalgia seems to me (I'm not an INTP) like it really can be a nice, relaxing, time-wasting, and bittersweet feeling - like floating down a river. 
1	I’ve noticed that too. I find that I get the biggest emotional reactions from watching super old YouTube videos like cricken’s left4dead montages or the halo 3 soundtrack. Growing up with something definitely gives you a special kind of bias. You can tell why you liked those sorts of things and how they shaped you now that you know so much more about yourself. I recommend playing an old video game too. Just played Star Wars battlefront 2 on the ps2. Blast from the past man.

6	Dating an extrovert	Female INTP here dating an ESFJ dude for a few months. He thinks he’s an ENFJ but I have good reasons to doubt it. \n\nThose of you who have or are dating extroverts (especially Fe dominant types), how do you handle your SO’s penchant for socialization? He’s constantly browsing social media and responding/reacting to stuff whereas silent browsing on Reddit is the closest thing I do to it. Even when I hang out with his large number of male and female friends, it’s a bit jarring to first of all be in that kind of large group setting as well as having his attention divided so much and rationed among them all. Sometimes the mere fact that he’s so fucking friendly to everyone can get annoying (I tend to impute meaning to being friendly since it requires effort on my part). \n\nAfter having dated an INTJ for 5+ years, I guess I’m not really used to not being the sole object of my SO’s attention in my day to day.  Not saying one is decisively better than the other but I’m looking for a way to frame this better in my head as to not get occasionally annoyed.  I suspect I probably need a sanity check as well ugh
4	The real question here is if you are ok with it? It sounds like you prefer being the sole object of your SO's attention so this may just be a bad fit for you overall. If you aren't really ok with his behavior now, and are looking to justify it; what makes you think it's going to get better? You can change yourself but you're never really going to change him at his core. 
3	Pat em on the head, ESFJs require lots of validation.\n\nOther then that, just let your significant extrovert do all the social heavy lifting for you. It actually is a boon not a difficulty.
3	I really hate people pleasers.  The line between being open with your time to others and outright betraying your close ones is a thin line and they never understand when they’ve crossed it.
1	I’m dating an ESFJ. It’s a huge contrast after experience with an ESFP. \nHe really cares about me and respect my personal space and all that

2	How has MBTI affected you?	While scrolling I thought about how being typed as INTP has changed me. I only discovered MBTI a few months ago and found it kinda interesting about how a theory like that could exist. I decided to learn more and eventually landed here and enjoyed the somewhat similar people and to have the ability to seem to help people without the interaction. This brought me to how it has changed me. \n\nHonestly no actions or things have changed because of “I am an INTP I have to do this” but I don’t think anyone should do that. That’s just stupid. But it has brought a meaning to how I work and it is interesting to see the cognitive functions come into play when you are not thinking about it and the later realizing it such as an underdeveloped Fe or a use of Se etc. \n\nSince being typed how has it changed you?\n\n And how do you think it would change a person that is mistyped that has been living as an “INTP” but is not.\n\nI would also like to state that this sub is not a great place for the unfortunately mistyped as I think the ultra depression/other problems are kinda absorbed into their behavior with decent exposure to this sub’s content. (I am in no way saying the INTP is a depressed type but that is the way it is portrayed here and could easily be seen that way.)
6	It helped me understand myself and other people in general. It is useful to predict behaviours most of the times, giving me amuch needed advantage in interpersonal communication, and it is useful in self-awareness. \n\nAlso, it was a first step in discovering myself via testing, regardless of the subject.\n\n
3	MBTI is just a convenient label for a certain portion of your personality (I'd argue a very small portion at that). I think a lot of people on this sub think it's a concrete fact about their personality, and that they can't exist outside what he MBTI ascribes to the INTP type. I'm more INTP than any other personality type, but being an INTP only makes up a small portion of who I am. 
2	stepping stone to figuring out human design > values attributes, neuroscience concepts. everything u need to function
2	One big social experiment to me. Having a framework to use and apply to real world scenarios is handy. Not feeling like I'm retarded is also good too. MBTI has opened up for me a practicality in dealing with other people / types and helped me improve my social game if anything. 
1	This sub needs more tits say yay 
1	It made me understand some of my problems and realize what I need to work on. Now I am more socialized and happy. I am more efficient in being myself. I know myself better so I don't need to guess. In fact, realizing that I'm an INTP made me work on my missing functions :) 
1	negatively, lol
0	This is what an INTP without a brain looks like...

6	"Deep" thoughts, by me.	I bet you don't even know how a zipper works. Sure, online, you can say you know it all you want, worst case, you google it and sound like a smarty pants, but honestly speaking, we don't know much about how our world works.   \n\n\nThere are plenty of things the average person doesn't understand that are easily understandable. CPUs, cars, lights, phones, tramways, aeroplanes, Keurigs, etc. These are just the things we *can* learn at any point in time. Let alone the things we have yet to truly figure out.   \n\n\nString theory is still just a theory, elementary particles are still theoretical. How so? We talk about them all the time, we have the math, why wouldn't they be real? Well, it's because they are so small that in order to "see" them, the light wavelength would have to be so small that the energy to make it that wavelength would change the properties of the particle we're trying to observe.   \n\n\nMoving on, we have yet to figure out what reality is. We can't even get our own ideas straight because we had to invent philosophy. Then we have social media. People get addicted to it with little resistance, but why? Addiction doesn't work how you might think. Addiction was tested on rats. In studies a single rat was put in a barren cage, two bottles of water to drink from, one just plain water, the other being laced with either cocaine or heroin. The rat would drink the heroin water so much that it died. However, a psychologist noticed something odd, the rats had nothing else to do. He theorized that if the rats had something else, they might stay away. He built "rat park:" toys, other rats, things to climb on, it was a utopia. What changed? No overdose. No addiction. They just stuck with the plain water. A similar test was done on humans: the Vietnam war. 20% of US soldiers became drug junkies: war is like the rat cage. However, when they got home, 95% of them just quit, no rehab, no withdrawal. Being around their family and friends, having their luxuries made them not addicted. Or not dependant on their addiction. Addiction is like a crutch. Americans are getting more introverted. Houses are getting bigger. Lonelier. We go to social media. We get addicted.   \n\n\nWe are humans. We have enough power to destroy the whole world in a day. We don't even need all of the nukes, just a few hundred. We have the power of CRISPR, genetic modification. We engineer our food to save millions, all without making the foods anymore dangerous than regular food, (if you don't count outside influence like pesticide.) We've done so much, yet our mental health is taking a great decline.   \n\n\nHow do we change this? Do you have any theories? Do you disagree? Let me know what you think. 
4	I was really hoping you were going to explain how a zipper worked.
2	you were just kinda jumping around.  what exactly do you want to change?
1	Have you heard of raw milk
1	The issue is individualism and materialism at the core of Western culture.\n\nMaterialism alone doesn't provide one's life with meaning and value. This is psychologically tormenting because our brains are in the business of finding meaning.\n\nWe could get away with it when we had God to provide psychological relief. But now religion has been dismantled by science and what's left hijacked by right wing nut cases, there is no such psychological relief.\n\nWe attempt to alleviate the torment with delusions of grandeur, seeking fame and power and money, because these will give us happiness and meaning. This project, if it even gets off the ground at all, is doomed to fail for all but narcissists (and even they never find happiness). So narcissists prevail and we have a narcissistic culture with less and less empathy and more and more shallow consumerism. And we're destroying the world and our humanity in the process.\n\nSo we say at least our country is the best! And will live on forever! And find our meaning there. But even then, with China rising the West is losing its claim on superiority and global relations are detoriating, making it inappropriate to find our meaning there.\n\nThe last resort to alleviate the torment of materialism is distraction, mindless entertainment, social media, sin industries, which leads to a decline in human cognition. We lose the ability to concentrate on meaningful tasks in favor of instant gratification. So we see the rise of mental illnesses and addiction.\n\nThe solution is to abandon the very core of our worldview and adopt a more holistic eastern view that we are a part of nature, not above it. There's nothing to conquer. Knowledge and progress are good, but they are not biological requirements for healthy mentality. Too much knowledge doesn't bring enlightenment, but confusion.\n\nChange won't happen because it requires everyone to recognize us failing. Humans don't recognize that due to a strong preference for delusion. They only recognize it after the fact. So enjoy the decline. \n\n
1	I liked the psychology bit with heroin and rats compared with social media and how houses are getting bigger and lonelier, just because we aren't busying ourselves with things we can do. \n\nA lot of it has to do with your environment. I think that was the basic premise for both circumstances, i.e. the rats and the soldiers in Vietnam. They both had something to become addicted to while that addictive behavior was close to them within their environment, but just when the environment changes, it disrupts behavioral patterns and patterns of habit that so much are discouraged enough to quit said bad habits. \n\nAtomic Habits - James Clear
1	A monk said to Chao Chou, “I have just entered this monastery. Please teach me.”\nChao Chou said, “Have you eaten your rice gruel?”\nThe monk said, “Yes, I have.”\nChao Chou said, “Wash your bowl.”\nThe monk understood\n\n\n---\n\n(Everything has its sequence)
7	This sub is actually f-ing insane	Man I legit expected to see someone I could actually relate to. Turns out, some people here want to be left alone all the time and would happily cut someone else's head off over a wrongly stated fact.(assuming everything written is not ironic)\n\nGod dammit!\n\n
16	Don’t forget everyone is also diagnosed as autistic. /s
8	It's all about picking the good threads and answers.You can also notice the people that have been here a while with the flairs. (Very roughly)\n\n
12	It's absolutely mad. After reading through this sub over the last few days I've noticed something similar to r/depression and r/introvert. It's not healthy at all, many take the test, thet read about it and it hits them hard and they feel like they've finally been understood. Accepted for who they are, and thats nice. Thats a good thing, you should always seek out to figure out stuff about yourself.\n\nHowever, what's not healthy is justifying being a dick because you're a special type of personality. This sub is an echo chamber of bad habits. It's nice to discuss personality traits. It's interesting and useful but understand that traits can change over a short period of time. Don't decide you are one type and try to live by those rules, dont try to confirm your traits, seek out what is your traits based in how you deal with shit compared to others.\n\nI fell for this as well but after some research on what this test is based on, I've come to realize it's good entertainment and a curiosity but should not be taken as serious as this sub. Get out and explore.\n\nEdit: words
3	I do not personally connect with this sub these days, but I pick and choose the good posts, raise my eyebrows and move on from the really horrible ones, and meme on the ones in between
4	"Bla bla. Bla bla bla.\n\nThis sub is bla.\n\nI hate how everyone bla bla instead of bla."
2	Young INTPs often struggle with the basics of life but many improve in their 30s. 
2	I KNOW. I joined reddit two days ago and I forgot my quora login so I was like, why not post on here? The first comment I got was someone telling my to add paragraphs he said, "paragraphs motherfucker" and the next thing I knew I got into this two hour argument about something so useless, it got personal, political, and low key idiotic. We were using big words, correct grammar, and full sentences. But we were saying absolutely nothing of value, just different ways to insult each other. Like calm down I just got here.
1	You hate to see it
1	yeah, same. maybe i'm not really an intp.
1	It's your first lesson. The bluntness of accuracy/precision.
1	No worries. I would severe your head.\n\nProbably just stab you.\n\n#joke
5	Do you guys ever put anything off just to be more efficient?	What I mean by this is do you ever intentionally not do something until the last minute, as you know you will work more efficiently and waste less time? Or is it just me?\n\nAlso, people have been bothering me to death about not getting something done. Something that I have gotten done in less than a day when I was stressed, but I can’t manage to do more than a small fraction in a week normally. How do I convince them to let me take my time?
1	That's been my whole life. That's why nothing's been done yet
1	I hate that procrastinating makes many things go away because it creates a positive feedback loop to keep doing it. 
1	What's the context for asking people to let you take your time? Work, school, social life, etc?
4	INTP in terms of a more scientifically accepted personality model	Just curious, the MB type indicator isn't without controversy. Is it possible to describe this type in say a range of scores with the Big five test? 
2	Yes.\n\nHigh O\nLow C\nLow E\nLow/Med A\nN is unrelated to mbti scales
2	My Big 5 results from Peterson’s test had similarities. \n\nHigh Openness is the personality domain of Intellect and Creativity- that would constitute as intuitive types. \n\nLow Conscientiousness, unordered and unindustrious- the under-achievers and Einstein’s quote “If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign of?” to speak of orderliness.\n\nLow Extroversion, largely unenthusiastic and unassertive (possibly correlates to the self-doubt that is common in INTP’s) \n\n\nAgreeableness is likely low to moderate, thought subfactored into Politeness  and Compassion, I was scored as “typical”. I assume Fe plays a role.\n\n Neuroticism would be the T/A, though MBTI does not test for that explicitly. 
7	I suck at understanding what part of something people are offended by	Examples:\n\n* Someone tells me a story about how someone else was really weird or an asshole or whatever. During/after the story they ask if I see why it was so weird/offensive. Half the time I don't know for sure and am trying to make an educated guess, but after they explain it more I tend to agree but still not think it was that bad.\n* Sometimes the offensive behavior is happening right in front of me and the whole room is offended and I don't actually know which behavior people took offence to even if I can maybe guess the general label people would put on it.\n* I'm reading a web article or watching a video that social media is up in arms about and often my reaction is "Okay I watched it, it wasn't that great but nothing really stood out to me." For example I watched the controversial Gillette ad and I really didn't understand the reason for backlash until I read what other people had to say about it, after which I did agree that it was pathetic (but I'm not about to join the boycott). I also watched a safety video ad that got pulled because apparently the whole nation thinks it's cringey. I thought it was catchy actually, just ineffective at its required purpose.\n\nI've been actively trying to become more opinionated at things but a lot of things are still out of my scope. One explanation is that I haven't picked up all these principles and guidelines that everyone else has, like I don't understand a situation until I think about it more unless it's a familiar situation from the past that my instincts alert me about. But still it's curious to me that people judge based on these concrete rules like "X with Y is always bad fashion" or "doing X is creepy regardless of the scenario" or "if you think X you're obviously <stereotype>" or "portraying X scenario from Y perspective is always going to be offensive to Z". Rules and comparisons are helpful but not the first thing I jump to.\n\nWell a simpler explanation is that I'm just unethical.\n\nAnyone relate or have an explanation?
4	I think I can relate to what you're saying. I think I've often frustrated friends when I don't take a side. Naturally as an INTP, we're prone to analyzing situations and coming up with whatever conclusion based on the information we were provided. Perhaps that sets us apart from people who tend to see black and white. I'm sure you can agree that we are people who like to profile every shade of grey, and that just doesn't cut it with many people. \n\nAs for you trying to be more opinionated, that's up to you but personally I try to take both sides into consideration and set up a train of logical thought to support each side.  And if I need to share a thought in a conversation, I explain both trains of thought. And then I usually let my impulses and emotions pick a side... if I let me. 
4	You're doing it wrong. Offended is an emotional reaction, it's a lot more raw than what you're thinking. There's no precision. There's no "that part offends me", it's something about the whole.\n\n> For example I watched the controversial Gillette ad and I really didn't understand the reason for backlash until I read what other people had to say about it\n\nWell, that's lack of context. Also, I don't think people were really that angry, just taking the chance to shit on the agenda pushing.\n\n> I've been actively trying to become more opinionated at things but a lot of things are still out of my scope. \n\nWhy ? It won't help you circulate the world better, nor understanding people eitheir. You probably are already opiniated, Ti wise. What you're doing would be Fi or Fe.\n\nThe best idea for you would be to observe more carefully for example, noticing when people get offended instead of noticing 10 minutes later and trying to find out.\n\nThat's Se (being present, here and now, looking at people in the eyes, noticing bodylanguage.) and also Fe (What's the mood ?)
6	Normally whatever lie about themself that person is perpetuating, thats the part that upset them.\n\nFor example, if someone says they care about people and they are a single mom, and you suggest the government stop robbing us through taxes to pay single mothers for their bad choices, and they get angry, then you know they were lying about caring about people because they actually just want to steal from you.
1	People like to be offended at silly things because their lives are often pointless and boring and being offended makes them feel alive. \n\nYou're much better off with your more rational analysis of the situation. Focus your energies on more important things in life than getting offended. 
1	1. Did you reciprocate.\n2. Did you do an ad-hominem attack.\n3. Is it actually a fallacy, and they are having difficultly accepting that fallacy.\n4. Are you walking around naked. (You are doing something against social norm)\n5. Are you an alien born in another galaxy mistaken to be a human?

1	Headspace! Useful for focus?	Well...\nI'm a Intp t type...\nI've been writing my thesis and trying to focus on work since months now but here is the problem! Rabbit hole!\nI always fall down a rabbit hole! \nI have to write one paragraph but I've read content worth hours perfecting each sentence so freakishly that i have absolutely no idea where im going generally.  Ivte been told itm going right but still its too slow!\nMy usual routine is ponder research through rabbit holes the whole week and the day i have discussion few hours before that create a hasty product! \nI wish focus and productivity and optimum use of time came easy.\nHeadspace previously has helped me relax and sleep because my mind used to constantly go round and round thinking leaving me awake until dawn.\nNow I'm wondering if i could use its productivity and focus features to really find that blinkered view in writing and just write and not look for 10 other facts and resources always(I DO NOT NEED THEM).\nHas anyone had luck with it?\nAlso is there any other way to avoid the rabbit hole and continue with task at hand.
2	Last year I worked all-nighters on my thesis - I spent scary amounts of time searching for the exact wording for each section of the thesis, constantly layering new work on old work. But retrospectively I realise I was a lot less aware of an associated issue, that more 'exact' words didn't necessarily make it any easier for someone to understand how I arrived at my conclusions - even making it more difficult to understand my trail of thought. \n\nOf course your rewording could be good your actual context. Just making you aware of the cognitive bias this could create.

1	Yup great way to start meditating! I meditate in silence though. 
0	Hey guys, I honestly believe this belongs here.	
17	Really? A man is raped and you decide its apart of some made up personality shit? You know he can see in the comments thats its crossposted right?
12	Why do you think this belongs here?
4	Imagine being so attracted to a woman that you get another man to buttfuck you.
-1	I'm surprised at the overwhelming support he is getting. I think he mightve been drugged.
9	Ever wished for self-service (humanless) restaurants?	So, I'm sitting in a restaurant and even though the staff is quite friendly, I wish I could go to a restaurant where you don't see any humans (of course, food is cooked by humans, but it is put on a conveyer of some sorts).\nThe only problem I see is that there would still be other people around who came there to eat.
5	sheetz man. Make your sandwich on the screen, pay, wait till they call out your number and youre done
3	I love eating alone in my car. It would be so nice to go into an empty restaurant and not have to see another person.

3	Fast casual.
2	I’m old enough to remember the [Automats.](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-automat-4152992) I really miss them.
2	Japan. 
2	Here in DC we had one! It was called Eatsa, and it was amazing...[until it closed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/10/24/this-robot-restaurant-was-supposed-to-be-the-future-of-dining-until-humanity-struck-back/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.6508e076772b)  (T__T)
2	This is a thing in japan (because of course it is). There's like a large "wall" where you order and pay and then they cook it for you and you pick it up
1	Uber eats exists... also there are some places that are essentially self service, I’ve been to restaurants where you order on screens and sushi comes to you on a conveyor belt or the dishes are just brought to you. It’s pointless to have a restaurant that is completely automated just to serve one person though. If you want privacy but restaurant quality just order to go or for delivery.

24	I care more about creating works that are recognized by many than getting recognized as the one who created them	It seems that the satisfaction you get when an idea you fathered spreads far is strong enough to render irrelevant any additional pleasure you'd gain from getting famous for being its originator.
7	Internal vs external validation
2	What? If your idea spreads far, won't you be famous as its originator?
2	This is exactly what I want! I use a different name and hide my businesses away from my family and friends as much as possible 😂
2	I just think things should be traceable to their true origins as a matter of ethics, nothing egotistical (not majorly anyway). I'd never take credit for someone else's idea(s) and by the same token I'd never let anyone else take credit for mine. \n\nThough the 'true origin' as a locus in the individual is really an illusion, the truer origin goes back beyond that and truly has no beginning, exists outside the individual just as much as inside. Like creation/big bang moment in cosmology.
1	I can relate
1	I feel this way too.
2	What would an INTP with a billion dollars to spare?	
8	I would probably buy lots and lots of drugs, all kinds, lifetime stock, then give it to charity 
4	Move out of my parent's house and buy myself a nice ass one. Buy my parents a nice ass house. Pay off any other debts my parents might have. Pay for my sister's upcoming hip-surgery and for her collage. Pay for my brother's wedding. Pay off my dad's mom's debt. Give my dad's father the money he needs so that he can finally retire. Give my mother's parents the money to move somewhere nicer. Pay for my own education up front cause I still want to know shit even though I'm loaded. Buy myself a nice ass computer. Donate $10,000 to my favorite Twitch streamer.\n\nIdk about the rest because that's a fuckton of money.\n\nEdit: Thought of something else, pay for the trip to Ireland that my parents have wanted to take for probably 20 years now.
3	I would use it to make my girlfriends dreams come true and make her the happiest in the world. I know it sounds cheesy but, having realized how pointless living actually is I don't really have any dreams per say, just to be financially stable and get through this life. 
3	invest so i can get passive income monthly that also makes me no need to work. i can do anything freely now
2	Give $20,000 to every kid at my school, and I’d still have 60 million left. I live somewhere where the school is about 20% white, and the other 80% are Spanish/African Americans, about 2/3 of whom are below the poverty line. My town is kinda broke 
2	Set up an irrevocable trust that gives $20 million a year perpetually to anti-suicide orgs
1	I'd probably fund research in areas i felt were overlooked by the so called normal people. Probably mostly toward prolonging our lifespans, AI for my own private robot army, etc.
1	I'd put it in to some investment and live off of it.
1	Invest some stuff to live off of and then move somewhere secluded, get a few cows, ducks, chickens, dogs, goats, and maybe a few other animals. Then find someone to share it with (keeping the money a secret) then just pet the animals and train then to “speak” on command. 
1	Give it to me.
1	Found a elite private college that has the best faculty and students answering questions that are fundamental to our history and our future existence. A college that is very different then todays educational institutions; almost more of a monastic and militaristic order. The student wouldn't be there for their own betterment, but for something beyond themselves. An order of scholar/warriors to preserve the good and the past(the consciousness and understanding which bring about identity)  through the coming winter. From this institution would come the seeds for the new world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just went into my little world.....
1	thought about this a lot, actually. I’d still work but I’d work for free. 
1	I've always wanted to make a giant maze with puzzles in it and if people get through they get a prize.
3	Found this article and thought that many of you may find it helpful	
1	Its a good article. The sad part is that the system was built to serve the majority. Its not just school but life after school. Its hard to serve those under-repped types when the world literally wasn’t built for us. \n\nSchool is meant to prepare us for the world but even if we correct that, what’s the point? We will just move from somewhere we feel at place to somewhere out of place. 
0	Arguing	Honestly idk if this is just me being a bitch but I love to argue with people who even annoy me the slightest bit because I just think it’s fun. It’s even more amusing to me if they decide to take it all serious and personally (which, I guess, is sort of bitchy on my part) It’s not that I dislike those people a lot, i just like to argue. Do you guys feel the same way? Or am I just blaming my problems on my personality type. Because of you don’t, off to r/Gemini I go...
1	Lol. I like to argue and debate but not because I think it's fun to antagonize people that annoy me. Maybe antagonize isn't the right word. But ya possibly a half and half situation. Half INTP and half bitchy. 😂😂😂
1	both, not either or
1	I enjoy debating/arguing about stuff that I consider myself well informed on and/or passionate about because I find I can fire off my points much more smoothly and rapidly than in normal conversation, where I often have to take long pauses to find the correct wording.\n\nIt's a bit of a flow state I suppose but if something throws me for a loop I tend to shut down and only think of a good response the next day 
1	I like to argue too, but I do it online. Seems like family doesn't like much, while friends do (but are a bit naive and unconvincable). Acquantainces will just talk behind your back if you do, so bad idea.\n\nI also find people getting all angry over it somehwat funny, so I enjoy it but it's not my goal, nor do I fan the flames on purpose. It's funny when they don't realize that debate wise, they are the equivalent of being surrounded at Cannae/checkmated, but still get desperate. They try new angles which I can flunk out easily. The angrier they get, the easier it becomes, and you also can see what they are like deep inside.\n\nThere's a bit of an ego/powertrip aspect to it, tho.
1	This really drives people away from my INTP, and it makes me sad to see. It drives me away from him sometimes. He becomes an island of thoughts in his own head. 
4	INTPs who have been/are in love, how do you show your partner your love?	In what ways do you show your partner your affection? Physically? Verbally?\n\nIt would be helpful if you could give context about the relationship (male/female/long distance or not etc) - not necessary though!
12	Mostly physically. I find when I’m with him in real life, I’m very physically affectionate. 
6	I'm dating an ISFJ right now, I'm very very physically affectionate. She on the other hand needs verbal affirmation so I make sure to give that to her.\n\nI think what's more important is figuring out your partners love language and making sure to supply sufficient amounts of said "language" to her/him. 
2	Physically.
2	If you're looking for advice, I think it'll depend on your partner. I show my wife love with physical touch because that's the kind of person she is. I've dated other women who I showed my love to by doing stuff for them, and others still who liked me to tell them all about my love for them. And then there are the women I would never date who like to be loved with gifts.
2	I'm an INFJ and have been with my INTP for 13 years. He might be trying to show love sometimes on a completely different frequency that I'm not receiving and understanding, but here are the things that I take and receive as expressions of love: \n\n* When he reins in his Ti before a conversation devolves into a heated debate. If he notices that I'm not emotionally or mentally prepared to "go there" with him, and he reins in his Ti for me - I am honestly so touched. It makes me feel like he puts our emotional connection ahead of his desire to win a debate.\n* When he plans ahead and is conscientious. Combatting his tendency for sloth really makes me feel like he cares about us and our future together.\n* When he remembers little things about our past. This might be his Si-induced nostalgia, but whatever, I'll take it.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Female- I’d say I’m fairly talkative with him(istj) but we do go through moments where both of us aren’t keen on speaking, this is usually when either of us are tired or we’re preoccupied. Other than that I’d say I probably show him love by constantly wanting to do activities and make future plans with him (that we’ll both inevitably be to tired to do that day of).  I will say the one circumstance of our relationship that can be different from others is that we’re currently long distance while I’m at school but we’re ~essentially~ three years strong. I also believe heavily that people have specific love languages, I don’t think this is type specific per say.  
1	Wanting to spend your time doing things together
1	Sometimes love has nothing to do with your Jungian type classification. Have you read up on the 5 love languages? Answers will vary from person to persona and intp to intp. For me personally it's -- spending quality time and gift giving with a bitt of touch and acts of service to accompany. Words of affirmation really isn't my thing but I've been in situations in the past where I've had to accommodate my partner's needs.
3	How do you score on the IPIP NEO-PI personality test?	
2	This test is based on the Big Five (O.C.E.A.N.) personality model, but it breaks down each of the five traits into six sub-traits, each with individual scores that factor into the main scores and then gives explanations for what each of them means. I'm wondering how much correlation there is between these results and the MBTI.\n\nI tend to prefer this test because it solves some of the issues I have both the MBTI (I don't buy into the dualism aspect of personality traits and believe they exist on something closer to a bell curve) and the regular OCEAN model (it places value judgements on the five main scores and does a poor job of explaining what each factor means, at least on the other tests I have seen).

1	We are like these MF'ING LIONS - good reminder of who we are are	
4	This Kid reminded me of myself, i think this kid is INTP do you guys think?	
3	Prisoner: "I'm never going to see my kids again "\nINTP: "have you tried parole ?" \n\nHahahahaha 
3	Kid is based. All that's 'wrong' with him is he's a little less mentally enslaved than is expected of a member of this society and he has not found any creative outlet for his abundance of energy. The CIA should get in touch and recruit him.\n\nAm I the only one who finds this beyond fucked-up tho, a 'remedy' based on fear where the kid is all but threatened with ass-rape by violent inmates? Imprisoning someone is fucked up anyway/ It was sad that seeing this kid reminded the guy in the cell that he couldn't see his own kids. Best to just execute them and be done with it.
2	Yeah - probably an INTP.  Always running away and seeking seclusion.  Unfazed by inmates screaming at him and replies with a calm "chill out man..."  He probably actually enjoyed most of his time in there if he got to be left alone.\n\nAt that age too - peers that hate you are worse than inmates "acting" and yelling at you with a cop 3ft away... the kids comments hurt worse, and are filled with hate.  He knows the guys in jail are acting tough, and they still have a respect for some social standards that 14 year olds do not.  It is much worse to have multiple peers ganging up to hate on you compared of someone waaay older telling you what he thinks of you... and screaming about being tired and needing a nap... its just not going to relate to him.\n\nYou can really tell that he just doesn't give a fuck in jail... most kids are in there crying before they even meet a prisoner - this kid is stone cold.  They are screaming at him and he's being a calm smart ass back to them.  I know everyone thinks thats how you get assraped in jail... but I'm pretty sure that's how you get respect.  Because even those hard asses in there know that if they were that age they would be crying like a baby.\n\nAnd he kicked the shit out of the kid on the bus... but the kid on the bus was bothering him, and telling him to die and burn in a hole...??? I would have kicked the shit out of that kid too... hopefully it damages his psyche and makes him think twice about talking shit like that to a quiet kid on a bus.  This kid isn't going around looking for fights... but I think it's more like he's just not taking anyone's shit.  I kinda like this kid.\n\nI think, though, that some LSD would help him... would calm him down and give him some perspective.  He'll remember the times he acted up and realize sometimes he was just being an asshole... it could make him a much more well rounded person... and might turn him on to art a little bit.\n\nHe kind of reminds me of myself at that age... I was even more quiet, could sit for hours to work on some puzzle or project... and didn't take shit from anyone.  And if I got mad, was ruthless and violent.  He could still turn out ok ;-)
1	He's not even trolling them, but he is making them all look like idiots.
1	Yeah these is just an intp that does not care about nothing in his life.
1	You close but no cigar. Kid is actually more INTJ than INTP. Nevertheless had a laugh. “Did you try parole?”
0	Austism.

0	Downvoting of shitposts	Why don't you guys downvote the shitposts on this sub? I tried creating multiple accounts; one in each browser because I decided fuck a specific post in particular. That didn't work because I suspect downvotes and upvotes are bound to ip addresses ofc.
9	[deleted]
2	What is it like being this assblasted by something you read online? Do you feel in charge? Link to the post?
70	I hate politics because they're driven by passion instead of logic.	Whenever I try to debate politics with most people, I find myself in the same predicament. The other person isn't interested in debating at all. They just want to insult and be offended. They don't know what they're talking about, and yet, they have an opinion and will defend it to the death. They aren't interested in learning. Most of the time, these opinions are based on tradition from a region or a family.\n\nHow do you handle this? I almost always find myself at the business end of an argumentum ad hominem fallacy. Either that or they try to change my words to mean something I didn't say and then start arguing a tangent that can't be refuted. Basic dirty tricks. I don't want to win. I just want to learn. How does one keep the discussion constructive?
14	Humans have limited memory. They have a finite number of topics that they care about and construct their would view around them. Attempting to reprogram them is futile. 
20	Politics are tiresome.  Debate Philisophy.\n\nDon't argue in terms of Trump vs Clinton or whatever it is, argue in terms of the abstract principles.  
7	[deleted]
11	Politics makes perfect sense when you realize that it's literally a religion.
7	Same problem, and I have no fucking clue...
6	Generally, it seems keeping one's opinions to themselves and asking questions instead is a more beneficial approach, especially when it comes to religion or politics. Topics that are super wrapped up in identity are difficult for most people to be disagreed with about, since they don't understand it as 'my views may be wrong' but rather 'i may be wrong.' The former is much easier for people to deal with existentially, whereas the latter is likely to make them defensive as they feel their entire being is under attack. \n\nAnother tactic is to decide on something you both agree on; if none of your axioms are in alignment, then it's literally impossible to debate with someone. 
3	I love politics but just as something to observe. Finding patterns in politics of a time and a place and comparing it to different ones is interesting to me.\n\nI hate how it affects people, though. People become so assured that they are in the right that they double down on it when it is suggested there is a mere chance they might be wrong. They become paranoid and say and do embarassing things.\n\nI can deal with being wrong and don't think my will should be imposed on others. A lot of people don't share these notions and are ready to designate somebody as evil just because they disagree with them (examples: religious right or socjus left).\n\nPeople get too passionate about it and it quickly devolves into a competition of who can deceive both themselves and others more. 
3	Then comes party loyalty.  It is part of their personal identity.  People hand over their critical thinking to someone else and become partisan parrots.   Whatever the party’s big issue is becomes their big issue.  Why?  Because someone else says so.
3	Simple don't have debates with stupid people. Also passion is great and should be fostered and channeled into the more abstract disciplines where logic is irrelevant (i.e. the arts). 
5	Most people are too stupid and/or too sensitive to talk about politics with. Just save it
2	Anther question. Do you think maybe INTPs are just better at disassociating from our emotions in times when we need to use logic? I am a very emotional person, and I'm ok with that, but I do think that I shut my emotions off when trying to think critically. Do you guys do the same? Maybe that's the real problem: I expect people to remove their emotions like I do, but they can't.
2	If you find this you either point it out or move on. You're not going to learn from those not willing to discuss their point.\n\nThe simple answer is find someone else. The more complicated answer is to ask questions instead of making statements. And I don't mean the questions which have a direct motivation for persuasion. Ask their standpoint and break it down with them. If they combat this they aren't usually worth debating with anyway. \n\nOdds are you'll find a point where your two viewpoints diverge on a more fundamental and philosophical level. Like maybe he believes in Divine Command morality, and remains unshaken from it, or they believe in God through Plato's Theory of Forms and how morality derives from that. Or maybe they are a proud Machiavellian or Utilitarian.\n\nThe trick here, if you get here, is to agree to disagree. You're not going to overturn centuries worth of reasoning and debate in one political conversation.\n\nAnd really, what is logic in politics anyway? Won't everyone just vote for their personal interests anyway? 
2	I view politics in terms of patterns, philosophy and debate. Sometimes though it's driven by way too much passion to make sense, which is kind of just another data point to account for. One that annoys me the most is in the US politics where hard-line leftwing people are called 'liberals'. What kind of an oxymoronic joke is that? Labels that don't make sense is so fucking annoying. It's like having this spelling things one way and saying a word another way. Fuck inconsistencies 
2	I tend to view political attitudes as extensions of people's underlying personalities. \n\nLet's look at fairness perception. Some people think the world is generally fair (people get what they deserve). Others think the world is apathetic or unfair (shit happens). The former group tends to judge people more harshly and is less charitable, but they also tend to work harder. The latter tends to be the opposite. This is cooked into personality to a significant degree. \n\nYou can probably see how this one attitudinal dimension can regulate how someone perceives all sorts of political issues. It's hard to argue rationally if you're up against how someone is hardwired. So, the trick is to recognize these dimensions in other people and match your appeals to their personality and subsequent moral frameworks.
2	I love politics. I find it to be the most powerful realm of a belief system around. The law bends to political will and so, the political will must be sound but who decides that? For those interested, you could read up on jurisprudence where the study of morality, politics and law meld together. \n\nAnd i am a liberal. Are most INTPs not liberal? \n\nEdit: The study of morality, politics and paw would be a fascinating discourse but it’s not been invented yet. 
2	>How do you handle this?\n\nI don't debate politics with those kinds of people.
2	When politics is practiced properly it becomes some sort of philosophical/ethical debate. That's why I enjoy it, the theatrics of modern politics is all just an elaborate show to keep us from real politics. 
2	There's an old saying: the toughest part of teaching politics is that every student comes in knowing everything already. 
2	I feel this on a spiritual level.\n\nWell I mean I would, if I believed in spiritual stuff.\n\nIt's not even just with politics though, it's what I come across when discussing basically any subject. 🙄 People just get upset whenever I'm approaching any thing logically and the logic happens to disagree with their point of view. 
2	I am an INAP (logical) personality type and I hate how basically all kids at my high school are passionate liberals that are driven by passion instead of the hard facts.

1	If you want people to see your side, you'll need some finesse. Sometimes, validating how someone feels works like magic. They'll listen to you afterwards. Then, coming from the ground up. Treat them as if they're the smarter one, but question their logic in a noncondescending way-obviously a trap. Most people can't see through this ruse. The dimwits you speak to most likely won't.
1	People of every political persuasion believe that only they (or "their side") are logical and all others don't know what they are talking about, are emotional & not interested in learning.
1	Very true. Of all the political stances, liberals are one of the last to be interested in liberty.
1	Interesting. I hadn't thought about people thinking the world is fair versus thinking shit happens. That makes a lot of sense. I have always disliked people who think the world is fair. I sit closer to the shit happens end of the spectrum personally.
1	Sounds like an xNTJ tactic. I have zero finesse 😆 but I could see how this would be more effective
1	I'm a classic liberal. I mostly for libertarian but only because they suck the least, lol. I find a lot of INTPs are classic liberals, but I've never really taken a count.
1	Politic is everywhere. Running away is pointless.\n\n(Learn to arm yourself)
1	[deleted]
1	You "hate" it, huh?\n\n\nLol
1	are you sure you just havent convinced yourself your emotions are logical?
1	you're gonna hate sex 
0	be patient, be rational, watch Ben Shapiro and maybe learn about political sciences so you understand the necessary illusion and so you can deal with it. The  system was almost projected to allow corruption or virtue signaling it will be really hard to change so I think studying political sciences and economic might help you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:grammar errors lol
402	Do you guys ever think along this too? "Oh damn it's gonna be fun thinking about this later. Saved!"	
166	Yeah, but I seldom get back to anything I've "saved" for later... If I do, I find that I've already lost interest, which is why I didn't spend the time on it initially.
31	lol I used to have like 100 different "restore sessions" (each with 50 tabs each) saved because my computer would restart or I'd close my browser with task manager then assume I'd want to go back and read things later... 
23	All the time, I have so many bookmarks and tabs opened in different windows that it’s disgusting. And then when I finally do get back to it, I’m not nearly is interested in it as I was before.
13	...and that's why I have a bookmarks file that's nearly five megabytes exported to a flat HTML document.
14	That is why my stack of books to read is about twice as tall as I am. 
11	Me and a friend often "bookmark" topics to discuss for when we have time to fully dive into it
8	Everyday. It's like creating a bookmark inside your brain lol. Seems fun and depressing both. Have to have that duality so that it balances itself.
5	I do this hahaaaa
5	I'm slowly letting go of tab hoarding. When my tabs (which often comprise of half watched youtube videos and half read articles) start getting out of control, I go back and delete the ones that I know, deeeeep down, have lost my interest.\n\nBecause I know, that poor tab will be there, forever and always, unless I'm honest with myself.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Yeah, I'll save or favorite a tab on a site, article, or journal I found interesting online and seldom get to it. The worst is the massive book list I have that will take me we'll into my college and further into my 30s to not only complete but contemplate for a while. 
3	open tabs, tons of unread books, watch later on youtube has more than 500 videos, and I never get around it.
3	YES!!!
3	You’re talking about mentally “bookmarking” something, not saving a browser tab, right? I do that a lot, but if I don’t have some kind of reminder (usually just on my phone) then I’ll remember I wanted to think about something, but forget what it was :( I like to save things to think about for bedtime since it takes a while to fall asleep anyway, and I definitely look forward to it, especially if it’s something novel or especially intriguing or hard to figure out.
3	Almost like the save/bookmark buttons are meant for that type of shit. wE inTpS ArE sOoo SMarT. 
3	For porn
1	Lol yes
1	Occasionally but i tend to think everything entirely about one thing in one thinking session so i dont forget to think about it later. 
1	I did it earlier on twitter
1	Yep, but I'm an INFJ. Does that make sense? X)
1	I lack discipline and think about them immediately, and without hesitation
1	I lack discipline and think about them immediately, and without hesitation
1	I relate to this far to well as I look at my 57 open tabs on safari 
1	I lack discipline and think about them immediately, and without hesitation
1	EVERY DAMN LINK. to never check them again because I read it and forgot I saved it. 
1	I legitimately saved this thread to read later.
1	My anime plan to watch list D=\n\nEven my watching list has over 20 animes too... Every list becomes a plan to watch list (completed list too because I rewatch shit a lot)
1	Yes! I have a section in my college notebook where I write down interesting things my professors mention but don't cover in detail so I can read up on them later.\n\nIt'd be nice if I put forth that effort with the actual content of the class, though.
1	on the computer of course I leave the tabs open to come back to - multiple windows with many tiny tabs.\n\nIn my brain tho - no... if there's something that is fun to think about - that will be thought about immediately.  I can't put off thinking about something... it just happens.\n\nThinking about something later is like... a hungry wolf walking through the forest and seeing a meal - There will be no saving it for later - it's happening right in that instant - the moment he notices it.  \n\nAnd I look for interesting things to think about with about the same intensity as the hungry wolf looks for food.
1	I totally thought he was talking about thoughts. Like "OOOOO, this is a great idea! I gotta save this for later so i can think about it before i go to sleep" or some jazz like that
1	Yeah. I was enjoying the talk too. Still had to throw in my 2 cents though
1	Nah, I just start thinking about it straight away and then I start pretending I am listening to people or look autistic in a public place
1	I, uh, may have a slight problem with browser tabs. And then running out of tabs and saving tab sessions to come back and look at later. And then not doing so.\n\nDon't even ask about wikipedia or TVTropes.
1	Reading the comments, i feel home 
1	Yes! Oftentimes I use my backlog to get to sleep. 
1	I have a separate email just for archiving those things I want to save.
1	Let's be honest. Usually this is for the purpose of fapping, right?\n\n"Oh damn it's gonna be fun fapping while thinking about her later. Saved!"
1	All the time. I always forget it then I'll get mad that I forgot it. I'll say to myself I was so excited to think about that but I forgot what it was! So yeah!
1	Pinterest is the devil.
1	At some point I became aware that I never actually go back to these things, so I stopped saving stuff like that or keeping open more than three or four browser tabs open at a time.
0	no bc i'm not pretending to be smarter than i am 🤪
0	A dozen+ opened tabs in Chrome says yes. :(

2	Playing the drums was awesomely therapeutic for me, but I haven't had a kit for decades. Lessons didn't appeal to me (youtube didn't exist). I used to play along with music at home which eventually became a problem.\n\nUsing music in a Baby Drivesque fashion is a good idea. I would personally use something that comes in quicker with more complexity (to merge all your threads).\n\nLike this from the film, but missing from the OST: Holy Calamity (Bear Witness II) (feat. DJ Shadow & DJ Quest) by Handsome Boy Modeling School\n\nThere is a point in the song after 2:35 where 'Do it' is repeated 16x for the next 18 seconds. Stop the song before this ends and make that call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	This song always seems to slow my mind down nice and steady. Something about the beginning hits me right in the Si.

4	Which Meyers Briggs type have it the hardest adjusting to society	I live in the US, so I’m referring to American society mainly.  I feel like it’s either INTP or ENTP.
7	Intuitive types generally seem to have maladaptive personality traits  ( at least in the context of certain kinds of society, such as USA); given they seem to be marginal in such places in terms of population, this makes sense. However, IN's in particular even more so just based on the discussions that take place in most mbtii forums .  Furthermore, INTPs probably have the hardest time. introverted thinking is appreciated in this country (and, in  most of history on the planet) only in specific ways such as a superficial genuflection to math. science or anything that appears as such. *Real* thinking and reasoning, forgettt about it, they don't wanna hear it!
3	I think male INFPs have a rough go of it
3	INFP, INTP, ISTP
2	I think in the public school system Ti doms have the most struggle, especially high school. From statistics feelers outnumber thinkers in the USA so they are in theory the underdogs just by numbers alone.
0	I would say INFJ, they may feel alienated more than other type and without purpose they tend to get a really hard time. 
13	Do you, INTPs, feel like you start late in life, in any phase of life ?	I guess it's because we're stuck in an analysis paralysis situation too often and struggle to take action. \nIt's like I figure out things and take action suuuuuper late.
10	Yes, I feel like I have a “slow start” or “late bloomer” trait.
8	I feel like it's more that I had to learn how to pretend to be "human" by rote, with a tremendous amount of trial-and-error, and it's so incredibly draining.  My parents pretty much just expected me to know how to do stuff and believed that I was being intentionally disrespectful or something when I didn't.  So I don't know what specifically you're referring to, but I feel like I'm years behind other people in my general age range when it comes to very basic how-to-navigate-reality situations, which of course is pretty much everything.\n\nAs a consequence, I get along much better and am much less uncomfortable around people significantly younger than myself, but then that makes me worried that now I look like some kind of Creepy Middle-Aged Dude.  Once you start to lose, you keep losing...
4	Nope. I actually feel more prepared than my peers because of all the research/studying/googling I did when I was younger trying to figure life out. I'm still a big procrastinator and I can be lazy/lacking in energy/lax/unmotivated often but I feel like I'm moving at my own pace which is fine.
4	No..I do not. \n\nGood thing I have strict Asian parents. So in a way, I was introduced to discipline from early years, and persistence when it comes to study.\n\nIn our house we had these rules:\n- Had 2 books for each course, practice book and notes book. And we must put date on the top right.\n- After school, we had to show my parents scores we got for homework/assignments/exams.\n- Afternoon nap is a must.\n- Homework was to be done in the afternoon after nap.\n- House chores and bathed before dinner.\n- Dinner @7PM with the whole family usually have conversations about schools/exams/etc.\n- Continue with study for tomorrow's courses after dinner until 9 PM.\n- Sleep at 9 PM, Wake up at 5 AM.\n\nWhat INTP needs, I think, is introduction to discipline from early childhood. This will help adult INTP to handle procrastination better. Especially since procrastination seems to be our default operation most of the time.\n\nI was teacher's pet, class president, and rank #1 during my school times. I do have tendency to procrastinate from time to time, but I always have "the tool" to get back on track and never really go astray or start late in life.

1	Calling artistic intp’s	So I found myself becoming a tattoo artist which is simultaneously perfect and the worst possible profession. On one hand, being able to turn emotion off and work is pretty handy. But I tend to be a lazy piece of candy, and there is loads of work. I’ll draw a tattoo start to finish 6 or 7 times before I present it to the client, and I’m terrible at managing my time so usually they wait awhile in the lobby while I’m jamming out another version of what I’ve already drawn.\n\nSo fellow intp working artists: how do you structure your day to keep productivity up?
3	I play instruments, and it's hard to me to manage time when I have to study, watch videos on YouTube, read books, play videogames, meet my fiancee...\n\n
3	I'd prefer the artist take as long as they need to get the stencil right, just my opinion as a heavily tattooed intp 
2	I've been trying my hand at art on the side and I try to make sure I complete one piece a week..... That doesn't always work, but I typically give myself 3 days to do it, and by day 3 if I haven't done it I start to guilt myself. I have learned to never stop in the middle of something, as I will never go back, so if I stop, I'm happy with whatever I did. Don't know how that's going to help you, but it's my method.
2	Former designer here. Try doing more and thinking less. If you think about how much work you have to do and how great your newest tattoo is going to be the less you will actually bring yourself to complete your task. I find getting absorbed in a task helps me complete it / finish my workload for the day. Get in, stop asking questions and just start doing it and once you're in that flow state, follow it to the end of your work day.
0	I think most INTPs are autistic to some degree. 
1	Free will?	Do you think it exists, and if yes, how would you define it. Also if you mention Heisenberg's uncertainty principle you automatically lose.
6	I strongly recommend watching a 24/5 part series by Robert Sapolsky of Stanford on evolutionary psychology/behavioral biology (forgot exactly what the term was) \n\nIt’s on YouTube, the subject matter is inherently interesting to an INTP and he’s a great teacher\n\nAs for your thread? No I do not believe in free will. We’re constrained by our genetics on an individual level. 
2	Yes, see the hard problem of consciousness.\n\nConsciousness supercedes all else. Science is merely an inductive framework constructed by the consciousness. Scientific materialism implies determinism which implies no free will, but materialism and determinism are also just concepts conceived by the consciousness, and are not provable by any "objective" standard. You would have to ask God for that.\n\nHence science will never be able to understand consciousness or free will just as a scanner would never be able to scan itself to understand its own workings. 
2	I am of the mind that all evidence I see in the world leads to the probability that the world is material in nature and that if there are supernatural components to it, they either can't or at least don't influence the material world. If that is the case, then I do not see how you could really say that free will exists as anything other than an illusion based on not knowing how things are going to work out.

1	As a Christian, I believe free will exists in that God knows what we will do but allows us to do it on our own. If we're willing to assume that God is omni enough to orchestrate this universe knowing its result, it would make sense that He is also omni enough to create one such universe with a perfect balance of intervention and independence of will for human souls to make their own way but without leaving us to die alone in a cold empty universe in the mire of our failures.\n\nBarring super-naturalist origins or explanations, however, I do not see free will as a material construct and as such it is not real, only illusory belief based on ignorant/naive perception of the inevitably deterministic influences of the natural world.
1	no. we are all reacting to context. what we are is shaped by it.  \nthat doesnt mean its not chaotic or predictable
1	It probably doesn’t exist, but weather or not is does or doesn’t, doesn’t matter. Unless it does.
1	Here's the thing about free will -- it doesn't make any rational sense. Logically I don't think free will exists. However, have you ever tried acting upon that idea? Your conscious mind sure as fuck thinks there is free will. Quite a fascinating disconnect between theory and practice. 
12	Help with being in love	my entire life. it’s just been me in love. \n\nand the only way i ever “get over” anybody is just by finding somebody else that i love more. and i always ruin it for myself. i turn awkward around them and cold and distant. and then i get sad that they do not love me back.\n\nand i know that i don’t even really like them. i mean they’re good looking but that’s it. and no matter how hard i try to get myself to realize that, it never works, and the high point of my day is still just getting to see them and talk to them. and plotting to make something happen.\n\nhow do i start my own life? one made for me and not anybody else? 
10	The root of this? It’s low self-esteem. You want some form of meaningful connection, and I would bet you’re also touch starved as well (never, ever underestimate how much not being held can mess with you head).  The stuff that makes me feel better about not having someone to love is to think of myself and my time as something to love. Like if I have a skill that I want to develop or something about my body that i want to change, it’s now my duty as the person in love with me to see that change through. The person who you’ll actually be in love with and who will return your feelings will come to you easier once you’re no longer pushing your desire for connection onto the first person who seems appealing.\nBeing alone can really suck, but constantly falling in love with an idea that breaks apart when you’re faced with reality (aka this person not returning your affection) can hurt more. It’s good that they’re the highlight of your day in that they can give you that. But if you’ve recognized this loneliness is an underlying pattern that plagues you and not something specific to the scenario in which your love interest isn’t interested, then you have to focus on loving yourself by yourself. That’s the only way to make it go away. Trust me, even if you think you already love yourself, you can always be better and kinder to yourself. 
3	> the high point of my day is still just getting to see them and talk to them.\n\nThis is incredibly sweet and romantic. :)\n\nWork on yourself and what you enjoy. That way it'll be easier to start conversation with someone with the same interest and you guys can both leave the conversation feeling fulfilled. \n\nIf talking to your romantic interest is too daunting for you (and let's face it, when is it not?) then you can start small and work up to that. Talk to a plant. Talk to a pet. Talk to someone online. Talk to your neighbor. Talk to the person packing your groceries. Talk to customer service. Talk to someone you mildly care about. Talk to someone you care extremely about. In this order. \n\nIt might sound silly but it'll help you pickup body languages and cues so you won't be so nervous when it comes to talking to someone that can have a bigger impact on your emotional state. \n\nSoon you'll go from "Um, hi." to "How's your day going?" to "Wow I can't believe (so and so) just happened." to "While you're here, can I get your opinion on (topic)?" to "Let's meetup this Saturday. There's an exciting (event) and I would love to have you there!"
2	My god this is so relatable
1	 I see it more as that it helps being sourounded by likeminded people because they will be the one to look at your situation and call you out on your bullshit
1	I'm exactly the same and because of it I'm still a virgin faggot. I look great but my emotional denial fucks me over in the love depertamnt. Can't except my feelings or deal with them. Honestly though just find a girl you actually like. Right now there's a girl I actually like. Unluckily she's taken so I'm alright with just being her friend till she's available. Life doesn't matter that much so don't worry about it all too much. I know I do.
1	I have the same issue and sometimes I wish we didn't have feelings at all because they're so powerful and can take over our lives. \n\nI've just come up with a new question, is it possible to lose control falling in love with our hobbies and goals? :O that would be so powerful.  
1	Can I ask what makes you want to be in a relationship if it's just looks that attract you in the first place? I only ask because I'm kind of in the opposite situation. I've forced myself into relationships with girls I did like but as soon as I got into them I realized my feelings were not what I thought they were and while I liked cuddling with them or being with them, i felt like i had an obligation to be with them, and i felt like I shouldn't be with them if there are times where I don't want to be spending time with them. Thinking about it now, being in a relationship just is something I don't want to be close to at all right now because of the commitment. It's like having a close friend but committing most of, if not all of your time to, which just doesn't make sense to me since I have not that many friends but the ones I do have are really close but whenever we see each other (fairly often) it's a mutual desire to see the other person that brought us together and establishing a relationship just feels like an anniversary commitment to me. What I am scared of however, is that my friends will be in relationships, and I'll be left alone because they'll be spending time with their boyfriend or girlfriend and my time won't be as valuable to them. 
1	Self knowledge
1	What is love
1	Screw oneitis. Go 100% redpill. If you really want to care for somebody, get a pet.
1	Maybe you should listen to Jordan Peterson and impose a little self-development regime into your life. Get up, make your bed, do something productive for the day, repeat. Slowly build up a life you've made with your own hands that you can be proud of, and eventually, that you can offer and share with someone. 
1	Just go redpill
1	You start by trying. \n\nRecognize this is an addiction, and that your feelings have much more to do with yourself than whichever chosen object is currently eliciting then. \n\nAdmit to yourself this had been enslaving you and keeping control over you, and seek to fill yourself with something else, something different - something that serves your *true* self, and not this addiction you are enslaved to. 
10	Created a Fun Way To Combat Procrastination	It's more or less a to do list. But it's used beyond just having a list of the things to do. I have a large whiteboard hanging on the wall. With 3 columns. The first 2 columns are 8 each, for 16 spaces for things to be done. Then the 3rd column has 4 things. But of bigger importance and generally tied to dates. \n\nSo I have my main 2 columns and any time I think about something I need/want to do but am not acting on it I add it to the list. I have the board near where I like to pace, so when I'm just walking around deep in thought it is both something that I look at and am reminded of, as well as easily accessible to add something I think of. However I can't remove anything from the list without doing it. So in order to make space for things I want to add I need to figure out things I can do to make space. It feels almost like inventory management in an RPG. \n\nNext to each of the items I also have a symbol next to it representing what is the main thing stopping me from doing it. Things like money, physical energy, mental energy, driving somewhere. And some items I've circled to note importance. \n\nIt changed the way I look at things that need to be done. Instead of looking at each individual thing as a task to focus my energy on, I see all those tasks as one big thing, and each item is just a small task I need to do, and  even just trying to figure out which one I want to do often feels like a puzzle, so I am engaging my brain just thinking about what I need to do.

1	Hmm a whiteboard, why haven't I thought of bying one
1	Anyone inspired by OP...\n\n“White hardboard sheets” are probably 1000% cheaper and operate 70% functionally the same as conventional whiteboards because it has a painted film. I decked out an entire wall as a whiteboard for the same price as an A4 Whiteboard and brain dumped over the entire thing. \n\nNow I think wall 2.0 will use a system similar to OP’s with coloured tape for the different sections, and I’ll overlay it with see through plastic Perspex plastic for the post it notes and whiteboard scribbles on top 😁\n\nHope this helps anyone!

12	Thing I do when I'm thinking...	Whenever I'm in deep thought I tend to twirl my hair with my finger. Whenever I'm doing it my gf always asks me what I'm thinking about when I do it. :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWondering if any of you have a weird tick like thing you do when thinking??
6	I tend to do the same thing, or sometimes just some other random motion with my hands.
6	When I’m facing a problem or lost in thought I purse my lips for some reason. I don’t understand it tbh since no one around me has the same quirk that I’ve noticed

2	Makes faces in response to a thought that came up in conversation with someone. \n\nCompletely wrong expression in response to the actual conversation... but my imagination has gone further and brought me to a different reaction than the actual conversation.

2	Talk to myself
2	I chew my tongue. My mom had to talk with my teachers every year and explain that I really didn't have an endless pack of gum.
2	I am not sure whether I'm an ENTP or INTP. I do that, too. In addition, if I'm brainstorming, I cut the eye contact also.
1	When I am thinking, I tilt my head to the side and stare into infinity.
1	I walk around. I’m convinced that when I’m forced to stay seated, my decision-making abilities are dwindled. 
2	what are your resources/tools for productivity?	im looking for something that can track your daily intentions, to do list tracker, task, etc for desktop/mobile. my phone notes app is too clutter for me to use right now. 
1	I use a spreadsheet in Google sheets to track daily goals. I color in the corresponding day/goal box either green, yellow, or red depending on the success of the goal. I also track weekly goals such as weight, number of drinks,   dining expenses, etc. This gives me an objective overview of my goals and helps set micro-goals that add up to the bigger ones. \n\nIt was tedious at first, but has become second nature. 
1	I use Asana for task, I can even group them in projects and put deadlines etc.
56	How to discourage people instantly.	At my first day of college I was waiting for a class to start with a lot of people around me and instead of socialising I was thinking about something very intensely. While I was in state of hypnosis this girl asked me why am I so quiet and my answear was "We have nothing to talk about.". You can imagine she was quite shocked so was other people and I knew i fucked up but instead of saying something to make it less awkward I just went with it. There goes my shot at being percived as a sane person. Eventualy I explained myself but it took me way too much time and effort. Don't be like me.
30	When you forget to bring your Fe to class...\n\nGirl: Why are you so quiet?\n\nMe: We have nothing to talk about.\n\nGirl: \*shocked\*\n\nMe: What can we possibly talk about on the first day?
41	I can't tell if that is authentic or autistic.
31	Dude, the part where you fucked up was when you tried to explain. Just own it & you'll be the quiet cynical badass everyone is afraid of/fascinated with. Did it at my job for years. No one needs to know how awkward you actually are.
12	Fuck all people.
11	If you’d said “*I* have nothing to talk about, it could have been okay; someone approaching you is more likely to be outgoing and might treat it as a fun challenge.\n\nExtending it to “we” sounds rude because you’re shutting the conversation down and telling the other person they couldn’t possibly say anything of interest to you. Even throwing a “yet” in there would have softened it enough to be acceptable, since it keeps the lines of conversation open by inviting the other person to provide a topic.
10	I actually just explain I am very bad at talking to people.\n\nThen people think I am shy, but likeable, not rude and aloof.
5	So... That's not normal then, right?
5	Well. If you're in the business of being socially presentable/sane or at least creating the illusion of it, then you're going to have to utilize your Ne better and flex Fe as hard as you can. I know its not what comes up first in your head but you're going to have to deliberately use Ne to gauge how well people will respond to what you say.  I get that its reflexive/instinctive to respond the way that you did, but if INTPs rely purely on instinctive Ti, more than likely you'll end up socially suiciding if not with ENTJ/ESTJ.
5	I'm shocked anyone asked you why you were quiet.\n\nMost people at my college leave a buffer, avoid contact, and leave you alone.\n\nAlthough they're not against it when I start a conversation.
3	Half the people in your freshman classes are so stupid they will drop out anyway
2	Thank you for being blunt.  Some of us appreciate blunt honesty (though I'll admit we are the few).
2	I think she likes you. You could say 'I don't really know you, but it doesn't mean I don't want to. I just find small talk difficult as an ice breaker.'\n\nIf you want to try that is.\n\nBTW that was her ice breaker.\n\nEdit: Here is a banging tune that proves you're not alone.\n\nUnloved - Crash Boom Bang

1	Hilarious 
1	That's why you don't say that, you just state something and if they're offended, theyre offended, and if you don't want them to be offended, tell them you didn't want to offend them, you were just being honest because you value honesty more than feelings
1	It doesn't. Take this useless meme xSFx shit out.
21	I just found out that I am extremely impatient when reading so I just skim the info or losing focus and end up missing important details. That's bad if I'm studying. Same thing when guitar practicing or anything really, I just impatiently skim and can't get my mind to stick to it.Got any fixes guys?	
3	Diagonal reading is a skill many people would put effort into learning. Slow down when you need to to grasp the content if it's important, or when you want to if it isn't. Why bother throttling down otherwise...\n\nI diagonally read your post and started replying while peeking up to confirm some details, it's not per se a bad way to read and it saves a shitton of time, IF you can get into a flow and be alert to the key info that hints at when you might wanna go back and read a part more indepth.
2	I had the same problem. Limiting screen time made a huge difference.
2	Couple tips:\n\n- Read with the intention that you’re immediately going to teach what you’re learning to someone else. We naturally pay more attention to something when we need to pass on that information to someone else or immediately apply it. Better yet, actually summarize and teach the material to someone else (a peer, for instance) so you’re reinforcing what you’ve learned.\n\n- Try the Pomodoro method. Set a timer for 25 minutes, study/play for that amount of time, then take a 3-5 (timed) minute break when the timer goes off. Write a tally mark on a notepad somewhere. Step away from your workspace, maybe stretch or go for a brief walk, check your phone if you absolutely have to, then come back. Repeat this process (study/play for 25, write a tally mark, take a break) until you have four tallies. At that point, take a 15-30 minute break. If you still have more material to go over, restart the process. The idea is to break up your session into smaller, more manageable and effective sessions while also keeping your brain engaged and refreshed.\n\n- Attach a goal or reason to what you’re currently doing. For instance, why are you practicing the guitar? Specifically, why are you practicing these chords or this song? Do you plan to perform this song in front of your friends, your family, your crush, your church, or your school? Can you imagine yourself doing so? Does imagining yourself performing these exercises or songs to approving nods and smiles make you excited and a little more encouraged to master what you’re currently doing? Does defining and knowing yourself as an accomplished musician make you proud? What other exercises can you practice to improve your technique, coordination, or speed? What other ways can you hold yourself accountable and improve your skills in ways that are effective for you (ex: joining a band, taking a music class, getting lessons, volunteering as entertainment at a nursing home, writing your own songs)? Try to avoid making yourself do something just for the sake of doing it—make it interesting for yourself and define what’s driving you. Furthermore, define what success and failure look like to you so you recognize them when you get there.\n\nGet after it.
3	take notes while you are reading. then study notes, re-write notes to the essentials and things that arn't sticking.  rinse and repeat.  makes your study sessions shorter and shorter, easier to maintain focus or go through another study session if your last one was crap.  Probably not the shortcut you're looking for, but this is the process ive used since high school.
1	I got a pair of Bluetooth headphones for pretty cheap (Mpow h7 on Amazon) and put music on while I read. I then placed the laptop on the other side of the room. It helped lol. Also took breaks when I got bored. 
1	defy yourself to be extremely patient then do it then prove youself that you've got it then use it. cheerz

3	Hot Mess:INTJ-INTP Relationship (Need advice)	I'm an INTJ woman (30 yo) in a relationship with an INTP man (33 yo). We've been together for about 1.5 years. We were together in the same city for the first 10-11 months and then he had to move to a different city within the same country for work, so we've been on long distance mode for the last 6 months. Before he moved there, we asked each other a couple of times if we wanted to continue the relationship over long distance because he'd told me before that he doesn't do great when it comes to long distance relationships. But to me, he said yes, he'd want to continue with me because we share great compatibility. And i agreed. Since his move there, we've met thrice. I stayed at his apartment for five days each time, and things went reasonably well between us. \nNow, before moving, we had a discussion about me moving in with him once I get a job there. He was enthusiastic about it and so was I. Now i finally have something coming through and when I visited him last (Dec 2018) i asked him off handedly, what he thinks about me? The relationship? He didn't give me a proper reply. Later, after coming back to the city, I asked him if he'd want me to share his personal space? Because a relocation is a big step for me. He said he needs time to think. Then he came with this reply: He likes my company, he likes it when I'm around, that I introduce a sense of order to his chaotic life, and that this means something to him, he also said he feels we work well in domestic settings, BUT that he feels he doesn't have an emotional connection with me. He said he doesn't know why this is so but apparently he feels indifferent to my presence or absence. He also added that he might be clinically depressed because he derives no meaning out of anything in life, not even this relationship. BUT that considering moving in with him would be a big personal risk for me in particular, he wouldn't recommend it. BUT if i do choose to move despite him being honest about his mental state, he is willing to be with me and tread this path. He also said the relationship has been based on logic and rational visions for him and not on warm, fuzzy feels. \nI was shattered. And mighty confused. He says on a conscious level he likes me and enjoys my company, but emotionally he doesn't feel anything. He also says that I'm important to him, but, like for instance, if I choose not to meet him, he'd still come down to my city. I said that doesn't say anything or make any sense. He disagrees. So, now i don't know what my INTP is thinking or feeling. \nSome factors to take into consideration:\nTill the time we were in the same city the INTP did make a lot of effort to meet, spend time together. he even got me introduced to his best friend (who is family to him), who in turn likes me and told him he should consider the long term with me. \nINTP has an extremely busy schedule st his new job. Works 13-14 hours daily and barely gets a day off. \nI have put on weight in the last so many months. Although, honestly, INTP has never brought it up, but I do feel a bit low about this. But I'm taking steps to be better. \nThe relationship has been a sexually intimate one. \n\nPlease help me figure out what the INTP’s motivations are. I'm thoroughly confused. He wants me to share his personal space but doesn't want me to come down because of him because he feels he won't be able to carry the guilt of me having to live alone in the city if things don't work out between us (I'll be living away from my family for the first time). I keep telling him I'm independent enough but he says he cannot extricate himself as a variable from the situation. And he's also worried he may not be able to develop an emotional connection with me. I don't know what to do. \n
4	Yeah I had a lot of trouble figuring out what love meant to me as well. Fuzzy feelings and what have you aren't really things I experience much. How I hear love being described isn't something I've ever felt. I do think I love though just as I experience every other emotion even if I don't really know I am.\n\nI view love (for me) as a commitment to the betterment of the other person more than the feeling aspect of it. If I'm willing to sacrifice and order myself to help someone as well as actively enjoy their company I consider that love as that's not something I can say for most people I interact with. I personal space and private time is one of the most important things to me so if I'm sacrificing that of my own accord to be with someone or even inviting them into my bubble that's huge. I see that as me experiencing love as opposed to the lovey dovey feelings. \n\nSo my point is that he may be like me in that he doesn't recognize emotions within himself even though they're happening. He'll still react and do all the things that emotion brings but won't be able to address anything about them accurately because he can't really register them consciously. I say if he's doing all the love stuff then he loves you no matter what he says.\n\nEdit: Also him being with you because it's the logical thing to do sounds like "I'm with you because I like being with you". Sounds like love.
2	Wow that is tough. When you're in a relationship with an INTP you always have to be the decision maker.\n\nThey don't like anyone making decisions because of them because they'll feel responsible. They'll tell you everything at face value when asked to relieve themselves of any trickery or guilt down the line.\n\nThe question here really isn't what he wants but what *you* want and if you're okay having a relationship with someone who doesn't feel emotionally connected with you. A handful of them value mindmates over finding their soulmates but that also doesn't mean you should have to put aside your feelings and concerns. Ultimately it comes down to 2 simple questions:\n\n* Is the risk of it not working out worth the risk of regret you'll feel if you didn't try?\n\n* Are you ok continuing a relationship where your bf doesn't feel emotionally connected?\n
2	although I've never been in a relationship, this totally describes how I would react in the beginning of one. \nthe Intp's reaction you just described is the exact reason why i don't want a relationship.\nbecause it's too confusing. \nEven if I love someone, it doesn't matter to me if i don't see them for months. i don't feel the need to go out of my way and contact them. even if i truly enjoy their company. \nand a relationship is all that stuff and i don't think i can keep up. \nI sometimes think maybe if i feel this way than it isn't true love, but i'm the same way with my family and friends. and i certainly love them so it can't be for that reason...\n\nidk, but i'm sure if somebody doesn't take these uncertainties away from me and put up with my insecurities, i will die alone :)\n\nI hope my ranting was somehow helpful to your situation ^^
3	Some advice from an INTJ woman who dated an INTP man. I have been in your situation and I know how frustrating and painful it is. Like I do for the people I care about, I'll give you all the information I can to help you make an informed decision. The decision, ofcourse, is yours to make. It \n\n-It's not a sign of a healthy relationship if you feel like you're walking on egg shells around this person where you don't know what might put them off (like you mentioned). Instead you both should ideally be able to communicate openly how you feel.\n\n-It's not a sign of a healthy relationship if you're having to do the talking for both of you (saying what you want and assuming what he might want). You're not a mind reader and you should not have to go out of your way to read his mind. You talk for yourself and he talks for himself. If you're having to do the talking for both of you, you may as well date yourself. (Sorry if it sounded blunt, i intend it to sound really polite)\n\n-It's not a sign of a healthy relationship if you find yourself on the internet looking for answers/ reasons for what is happening in your love life. Ideally, like I said before, you both should be able to communicate openly and come to mutually agreeable conclusions. If you find yourself reading research papers on human psychology (I've been there) or posting on reddit, asking a strangers to help you understand what might just be going on in your guy's head, it means you've been in put in such a helpless situation by the relationship that you are hankering at the loose ends. It's emotionally abusive.\n\nDo ask yourself if this is the kind of relationship you want for yourself. Are you willing to take the responsibility of his meeting both his and your own emotional needs because you are shouldering the entire weight of your relationship all by yourself, when ideally it is supposed to be shared by the both of you. I have a thumb rule, if a guy doesn't stop you from leaving, don't stop. If he is willing to live without you, you clearly don't matter to him that much. Because when you really love someone, you do everything in your capacity to make them stay because you simply can't/ don't want to imagine a life without them. \n\nIt's upto you what you decide, but what I believe is that you deserve better than this.\n\nCouple of months after I broke up the INTP I dated, I've met this INTJ man who gives me everything I longed for in the former relationship. I don't find myself trying to read his mind to figure out why he might have said what he said, I don't feel like I'm walking on eggshells, I don't second guess myself.\n\nInstead he open about he feelings for me and communicates openly. \n\nAll I mean to say is, you're not expecting too much. You're expecting the bare minimal from him. And he isn't giving you even that. \n\nMy opinions are based on whatever you've written here, and I've tried my best to help you make sense of what's happening. Rest you're the one going through it, you're certainly better positioned to decide. Hope the very best for you.
1	What he says doesn't seem to reflect what he does so the key is probably within the discrepancy, by sharing this information he is showing care for you. There is also the possibility he doesn't fully understand how he feels in what sounds like a healthy relationship. There is a chance that he believes he has no emotional connection because he's subconsciously afraid of getting more attached to you and then losing you, I've been guilty of doing this myself as an INTP male to my now wife ISFP, trying to guard against feelings one isn't used to having is very difficult. \n\nIf he truly doesn't have an emotional investment in you then I'd say that he definitely has an intellectual one, which in some ways is more important since he obviously respects and cares about you, it's entirely possible that without you around constantly he's grown unsure of how he feels since he's probably in his head all the time and it'll probably come to you being willing to test how he genuinely feels by going for living with him. If you think of it in a similar situation as an arranged marriage many of them would come to love the other through being there for and supporting eachother.\n\n Love is a complex thing and takes time to grow if it is to last, and I don't think anyone can really say exactly how he feels or what he means, I guess my best advice as a romantic at heart is not to give up on something you've put so much into and have yet to see the final results. I wish you well on your voyage of the heart.

1	You sound like you're in a situationship which is classic for our pairing. It looks like you're pushing the both of you to commit to being more serious and he is not willing to at this time play ball. Until he's ready to move forward to being serious as in commit to you then there's no point in you driving yourself crazy over everything. If you still want to be with him in a situationship then just let it be unless you are looking for something more immediate (dump his ass and move on).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefining your relationship is important and this is more your choice than his at this point if you want to continue. It seems like he's currently satisfied and you are now looking for more. Either upgrade him, stay where you are, or move on. You should ideally have an honest and open conversation about how you feel about each other's relationship together and how you want to move forward with it.
1	Sounds like his initial addiction to you wore off, and now that the convenience has been removed, he’s merely lukewarm and comfortable. \n\nLove should be willing to sacrifice. Love should be willing to die. *Would he really die for you* if he’s not even able to tell you if he wants you to move to be closer to you (from a grown 33 year old man no less)?\n\nI’m sorry, but I recommend not believing all the long-winded replies from INTPs here saying this is just how we are. NO. Any INTP saying that is merely doing so to defend *themself* after being accused similarly. \n\nWe like comfort. We often don’t realize when we need to grow up and take responsibility for our own feelings because we’re so unaware of them. However, we’re not blind to *strong* feelings. \n\nHope this message finds you with love. I wish you all the best.

4	Same I act like a total idiot sometimes for humor.  \n\n\nLike laugh at yourself, its fun and funny. 
6	Me too, I think it's part of the indifference and the amusement at seemingly average things. Like I would be happy and laughing that I was the one who first started to put away their stuff before class ends and I started the chain reaction of every one else doing it. People just think I'm laughing at nothing, which can be considered dumb. I usually don't want to bother explaining to them why I was laughing.

2	Having low IQ is the height of stupidity	I think this is funny.
7	How about having low IQ but wiling to learn? Is it still considered as height of stupidity?
4	I don't think it's funny I think it's annoying as hell when they try to talk to me and act like they know better than me, it genuinely pisses me off
2	Having average IQ is the meh of stupidity
1	Having spent a lot of time researching obsessive ideologies in people, it is usually those who refuse to seek new knowledge and ideas who are the epitome of stupidity moreso than anyone who simply struggles to learn something quickly.  An inherited setback speaks far less about a person than an individual who only seeks for truth in what they want to hear.  Logic, knowledge, and truth can be taught and learned, but a will to distance one's self from rampant tribalism requires much more.
0	If you rotate the bell curve 90 degrees clockwise, stupid people are on top
61	Anyone else feel they’re more extroverted when they first meet people?	I always feel more outgoing when I first meet people - for example when I started university I would be the one to start talking to people I didn’t know in my lectures and just generally felt like a social butterfly. A few months later though, after I initially met people I have settled into being more quiet and not really participating in conversation as much. Not sure if this is an INTP thing or more a quirk of my personality? 
27	Oh, yeah. I’m trying to make a good impression. Then afterwards I have no objective for interaction.
18	I concur with this..I may not initially start conversations, but, I definitely will engage in them...and then, for some reason, I kinda sputter out eventually. 
13	I do this because I want people to open up to me and I want to get to the interesting conversation. I’m interested in new ideas, and new people can carry them, so being outgoing at first helps to form new connections. I stop being outgoing once I feel that they either aren’t opening up, or just have nothing interesting to say or teach me. The vast majority of people are pretty boring to talk to and don’t have ideas worth listening to, so after a while I developed a streamlined system: I’m super outgoing at first, but I drop hints towards deeper or more uncomfortable conversation. If they react poorly, get offended, change the topic back to mundane small talk, or their eyes gloss over, I immediately stop being outgoing and switch to doing something more productive with my time. Sometimes people get upset when I drop them, and they actually take it personally and start rumors or talk shit, which can be a background stressor, but I always fall back on thinking those people are pretty much irrelevant, and those rumors are just them spinning their wheels in the same uninteresting, uncreative, and unproductive way that made me drop them in the first place. \n\nI’m also super outgoing and loud when I’m with a group of close friends because I don’t have to use half my brainpower on impression management. I don’t have to temper my words and put on a facade, so I can focus on being open and honest. I surround myself with open people, even though we may or may not be like-minded. Being outgoing only serves the purpose of discovering other open people.
6	I don't actively approach people, but I'm sociable when I want to be. The more comfortable I get, the more silent I am. 
6	I find once i get an idea of what the person is like i either make friends with them or have nothing to talk about & do not befriend them, & then some ppl get offended or do not like talking about ideas, theories, philosophies, or random observations all of the time, so they end up not enjoying the conversation, they want to gossip about so & so or brag about their alcohol consumption...
4	Being introverted doesn't mean you can't be outgoing, I'm pretty outgoing myself! You're probably just drained and need some alone time to refuel. 
2	No, it takes me 3 months to be able to tell someone hi, then 3 more months to get comfortable enough for small talk and a year for them to become a friend
2	I notice this in my INTP husband. I think it's the new and exciting that perks his interests up a bit before he eventually gets bored. 
2	Absolutely! I started a new job recently and had to meet dozens of people (and remember their names) in a very short period of time. At one point I was actually called “sociable” because I had no problem being outgoing, friendly, funny, easygoing, etc. But let me tell you, every night I absolutely collapsed in on myself. And after 2 weeks of that I had to hibernate for several days just to feel like me again.
2	Yup. I can initiate conversations and have a good time, but I have no interest or patience to actually maintain and grow a relationship with people. 
2	I love meeting new people, we generally have a great time. I can actually be very entertaining, but afterwards ..... eeeeeh. 
1	the opposite. I'm much more reserved until I have judged the person worthy of trust, then I can show them who I really am. \n\n\nunless we're talking random small talk bullshit. then who gives a shit. I'll talk if i feel like it, or not. I won't be rude but I'm not going to make myself uncomfortable for someone I'll never see again and who likely doesn't actually care if I make small talk or not. eg with a uber driver. 
1	I find I am quite the reverse, but I might just not be socially skilled (or confident) enough yet. 
1	Yes, I'm like this. Initially, I can be friendly, but eventually, I run out of things to say.
1	Novelty is exciting
1	We're not so interested in superficial relationships, so, after the initial meeting, once we're done following the social script of "Who are you? What do you do? Where are you from? This is me", we're either going to connect with someone explosively, through discussion of ideas we're passionate about, or simply have nothing to say.
11	Thoughts on Psychedelics	I am really considering trying mushrooms once because some friends said it was great for lowering stress and getting a new perspective. Also heard Jordan Peterson talking about how mushrooms cured depression in some cases and allowed some people to discontinue their SSRI dependence. Anyone have some personal or empirical insight into the value of using such drugs? 
9	I tried mushrooms about 4 times in a span of 6 months, nothing too crazy, about 1,5-2,5 grams each time. What I think was the most important in my case is that it allowed me to see what my flaws are and afterwards I could focus on improving those things. It won't cure you but can give you a better understanding of who you realy are. The thing with psychodelics is that they put you in a unique state of mind that won't last forever so if you want to take something from the experience you need to focus on the important things in your life and even write down some conclusions so you can come back to them later. Some people let these realizations fade away and come back to who they were before the "enlightment".
2	Start low dosage 1-1.5g. Do your research and whether you are doing it alone or with others; environment is everything. It is an all day activity so block out 8-10 hours for yourself and if you have a very close friend that you open to tripping around, have them trip sit for you. Keep in mind that people are part of that environment and don’t be around anyone you are not 120% sure about. If you enjoy your trip then prep for a larger dosage next time. You experience something different at every level. \n\nI recommend nature/hiking or sitting in a quiet place in the park. If you don’t have access to that, make a comfy spot for yourself and watch planet earth 2. If you need more help reply back here or look through my post history. 
1	I love mushrooms :) I actually use them as an alcohol replacement. I don't drink anymore but I take about 1g of shroomies when my friends drink. I like it because it feels like all the good parts of drinking (dizzy, everything is funny, more social), with none of the bad (hangover, loss of control), plus fun extras like colours looking extra pretty. I've never had more than 3g at once though. Make sure you have a good set and setting if you're planning on taking more than like 2g, and with good people! Feeling safe and happy is the best way to do them. Also, just like with drinking, its a bad idea to take some mushrooms if you are already feeling sad or angry, because IME they do amplify emotions a bit, especially if you're by yourself or its night time.  \n\n\nPersonal insights - I like myself better when I do mushies and don't drink. I don't like myself when I drink. However, shrooms make me happy, they make me want to be kind and understanding to everybody, and I feel connected to people on a deeper level. This includes low doses. Big, big big fan of mushrooms. 
1	I've gotten the same effects from just marijuana. Admittedly I have been wanting to try psychedelics for the same reasons you stated, but I am afraid I will freak out as I am prone to do sober. I would avoid if there is a history of manic depression or schizophrenia in you or your family, otherwise I think it is harmless if you have a good trip sitter around. 
1	r/psychedelics 
1	3 grams and under is not risky to your mental health as long as your mental & fear of them isn’t anywhere near the right state.\n\nAnd like the other guy said, I’ve years of self development in 3 trips. Believe it switched me from a hard INTP to a lean INFP with INTP. (I bottled most of my emotions in childhood trauma so wouldn’t be surprised if I was supposed to turn out to be an INFP) Credit them most with losing my depression and anxiety, but still it’s only a spark. You have to implement the lessons you learn from these experiences in your daily life.
231	This is all me.	
14	A group of five is my limit. Beyond that I will never feel comfortable
5	When I’m in an Xbox party with 2 other people and then 3 more join, especially if they’re randos, I have to get out
1	Lol. 
1	Typical.
1	Or a "gotta go, bye"
1	This made me chuckle.
1	For me it's usually a,"I'd rather not."
298	For many INTPs, their home is their happy place. I associate some bad things with my home, but my room is one happy place on mine. My other happy place is my car.	Its perfect. I can drive, and see things, yet still be secluded with just myself. I dont have to talk to anyone or anything. I can just chill and listen to music. 
68	Driving while listening to podcasts? Put me in limbo and never wake me up.
27	I've got a small bus that is both my car and my house, it's great
20	It is similar for me man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy room. It contains my bed. My softest, most comfortable piece of life. My computer is in here, I connect with people across the world in an anonymous and hilarious way on my computer. I am free to say what I want. You too. I have a mirror here, I am not sure what to write about that. My clothes are here, they are my front in a way. I am here, no one else is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy car. I am the machine I control. I love my car, its fuckin cool. Its fun. I become the car. If I am high then I am fully meat-machine. It takes me to the simple places where I move and see others. I have a good experience in public and so my car is the way to that. Many people are fearful of there lives in car. There lives, houses and relationships rely on their car. A car is a powerful thing. I feel like people are not used to acknowledging fear. In school they don't tell you too think about fear. Or maybe they did. Idk lol. I had a special experience.
22	My happy place is my room and ocasionally my bathroom
8	I don’t consider a home shared with people out of my control a “home”. It stresses me out really.
7	True, I love driving as well. I also love driving up to lookout points and admiring nature/the view. 
7	My "home" is actually playing volleyball and riding horses. My house is a trauma-filled prison. Also, weirdly, I feel most "myself" when I'm traveling somewhere and I'm alone and momentarily kinda lost. I don't appreciate crowded places but I like new places.
6	Haha I'm definitely a road trip person... I like solo road trips more than with friends (some of them fall asleep by hour 3 what casuals lol). Nothing like making a 5 hour playlist and driving to another state. I used to drive so much around town it burned as much gas as a road trip (probably not the best for the environment or my wallet) so I figured I should just get on the freeway and go until I felt satisfied. 
4	When I'm riding my bike.  I used to be my car but j need to exercise.  And, I find I zone out and thank while I do long rides (100+ km)
4	Here in my car, I feel safest of all...
5	I love driving. Someone asked me about a happy place and I didn't understand until I realized it could include my car.
8	I love long drives man. The world expects nothing of me when I’m commuting. 
5	the two cleanest areas of my life are my room and my car.  kitchen? meh, i'll get to it later.  Desk at work? one of these days i'll get all that shit organized. backyard? oh yeah, it's definitely going to have a garden.
4	This thread makes it seem that a lot of you are living with your parents.  Once you control your own living space, it's much easier to make your home your happy place.  
3	My past "happy place" memories haven't been phasing me, leaving me with a fairly constant sense of discontent now that I'm away at college and am sharing my room with some other. However, my good pair of headphones tends to bring me back.
3	100% agree. My happy places are my car (for the same reasons you stated) and my home, because that's where my cats are. It also happens to be more than two hours away from family so they won't visit, haha.
3	Gary Numan was the first thing that came to mind after reading this. https://youtu.be/99fRdfVIOr4
3	I love riding my bicycle
2	Anywhere I go feels great, and I've lived in many places, and felt like my best self in my homes in all of those places. The only home that felt negative was the one I grew up in, my room in particular. It's always dreadful when I visit or have to come back for some reason. 
2	my basement where i keep my games, tv, and solitaryness. a very warm and safe place just for me.
2	My motorbike is one place for me. Put on a helmet, whole world is shut out and it's just me and the road.\n\nIt's my favourite
2	My bed, my tablet and my mind.
2	Love my car - best place to relax and focus  \n\n\nI work with programming, so often times I work from the car for 2-4h easy
2	Oh boy, we're in similar boat. My home isn't really a place when I'm willing to be, bad memories and situations on daily basis but my room is whole Different story. I love spending time there not being restricted by anything and making whatever I want. Bed isn't exactly best thing ever, since insomnia is with me there but personal space is like oxygen for me. 
2	Lol, I degenerate when i go back to my breeding grounds
2	I made the mistake of buying my dream car as my first car. I was car poor for so long. But damn it was so comfortable and go anywhere. I used to prefer sleeping in the driver's seat with the radio on to going inside to sleep. Not exactly the most well thought out indulgence, but it felt like a cocoon, and it was mine.
2	My cars a piece of shit but its still mt happy place
2	I'm 16 years old so of course my car is my happy place. I can't be alone with my parents always home. But I dream of moving out at 18 and living in my own place and being alone every day 
2	I love my car and I love driving.  It feels like my own little space ship and place to think and explore.  I think driving is one of my favorite activities.
2	What you need is a van with a stealth living area in the back. 
2	i feel you, but i've been attempting to abandon cars in favor of bikes and trains for long distance travel. very difficult however. back in senior year of high school, though, i would skip classes to just drive around for an hour and listen to music.
2	Huh - One of my happy places is in the OR.  Get to fix people, solve problems, be creative, get to play my music.
2	Always loved being in the car with the windows rolled up. Seems like I'm in my own world.
2	I can relate. my only reason not to move out (temporarily) was because i missed my room too much. it seemed like i could never do anything outside of it :( \nlike i don't paint anymore. don't watch as many movies or read as much. \nit's gotten better after a couple months but it's just not the same T_T
2	Late night drives back from my old job we're the best. So easy to think clearly when there's no one around and nothing but the sleepy suburbs to drive through. 
1	I have a room mate and her bf.both are 420 friendly. I love my room 420 and watch utube , music  podcasts  atheistic experience and  I am in haven.😍 
13	Traditional Education	Hi, I'm 21 and I've been out of college for 2 years. I dropped out, to be exact. I was going in for a chemistry major and biology minor, but after taking my first physics course and doing well in college maths, I wanted to change to a physics major maths minor. That never happened ofc. I found myself struggling with information retention and studying and reading over and over again didn't seem to have an effect. Biology wasn't my worst class, even though I felt I was doing terribly. \n\nMy sophomore semester I had the option to fill credit hour space with either German II, or sociology. My advisor told me that the German classes I took in high school would not be sufficient for me to jump into German II and that sociology was a breeze of a class, so I caved and took sociology. Sociology was a breeze, I took all of the "white men destroy the world" bs I didn't really believe in and regurgitated it verbatim, but they didn't grade based on retention, it was a pass/fail course that was entirely dependent on weather the instructor felt you learned anything. Apparently I learned nothing because I failed. \n\nNow comes in the financial aid aspect of this dumpster fire. The sociology class dropped my GPA to a 2.9, but I still had a scholarship so long as I kept a 3.0 or higher annual average. I sent my fafsa in in April, and started showing up to the office to cover the rest of my tuition in June. They claimed the aid hadn't shown up yet. I started showing up and calling every week, and start of August I was there in person every day. I had my classes set up and on August 15th my classes were dropped because I didn't pay the bill. Same day they call me and tell my my financial aid was processed. I tried to get back into some of them but my financial aid would only cover a full time semester and I could only get back 8 hours. I said screw it and joined the army reserves because I already had that exit plan setup.\n\nWell that worked out the way I planned, broke my hip in AIT and discharged in April the next year. I did my fafsa again and rode APSU like a bucking bronco. I was supposedly elligable for the montgomery GI bill which would cover about the same amount as TN hope. Whenever I processed it they would tell me they couldn't find it, not that I didn't have it. The school eventually offered me a deferment, I paid my half and walked into another 17hr semester. \n\nThe glorifying experience of going to school was gone and I realized I wasn't learning anything. Chemistry instructor told us A's were for truely exceptional students, the half of us that passed would be grateful of having C's. Studying for that class consisted of reading each individual character of a sentence on a notecard (capital A, ND, comma). Because if it wasn't verbatim, it was wrong. This type of studying was absolutely torturous for me, and after neglecting an entire other class for half the semester to study I still failed to retain enough to keep a passing grade. My first lab was a 0 because I couldn't get Excell to present the date format like he wanted. Biology in it's entirely was "living in America means you're destroying the world". I started seeing that I was being taught an agenda. All the while I was being run in circles by the financial aid department and the VA trying to find my GI bill. \n\nAt some point in October some literal genius spilled the beans (because this must have been a hell of a secret for everyone to keep from me) that reservists don't get benefits if they don't complete their first term of service. \n\nI dropped all my classes that night, didn't get out of bed for 2 weeks, and then decided to deliver some pizza. I paid the rest of my tuition. Since then I got more adultish job but I find I get burnt out quick and none of it seems meaningful. I still want to be a physicist, but I want nothing to do with a traditional school. How can I get there without polishing my asshole with a cactus?
5	You could polish some physics professors large hadron collider instead
4	I'm a physicist-in-training, of sorts. Currently doing my PhD. \n\nIf you want to be a physicist: go back to school. \n\nIf the gen-eds are the problem - which it sounds like they are - then go to a university overseas where they don't do them (i.e. the majority of universities in the world). But this makes it harder to do a PhD in the States, and the divide between Europe and the States is a bit of a problem after PhD. The region where you complete your training tends to dictate where you can work, because the two systems have different ideologies and focuses, and don't recognise the other as much as they recognise their own. I'm sticking with Europe, for example, with the understanding that it gives me a leg-up in the European job market and is a weakness in the US job market. But that's fine, because I never want to work in the US. \n\nOtherwise: give up.\n\nNo one will give you the time of day unless you can first prove that you're minimally competent in physics, which you do through a Bachelors. In practice, it isn't possible to skip that first stage, and even literal child prodigies in physics will still complete their Bachelors, if only at an accelerated rate and with additional enrichment. But they still do it. 
1	Go to a private college 
1	I don't know if you can be a physicist, is it really a career other than being a college professor? Why not try some form of engineering?
4	Some are blessed/cursed with creative thinking that occurs in a higher dimensionality.	Use it.\n\nOr don’t.\n\nNikola Tesla was up against J.P Morgan.  His intolerance to sound was sometimes debilitating.  He was sending letters to Samuel Clemens 30 years after he died.   He got little recognition, and, right before he died, was in love with a pigeon.\n
7	I mean pidgins are cool. I’d date one. Be easier to talk to than a person anyway. 
2	What does this even mean 
1	A lot of INTPs are really into the occult and spiritual shit. Cause helloooooo who doesn't want to hang out with extradimensional beings!? 🍄🍄🍄
2	I'm tired of the way I think when it comes to emotional problems.	The way I think is just so non-conducive to dealing with emotional problems in my life it is utterly ridiculous. With a business...sure. I can make the theory and structure of a business by simple abstraction from "an exchange of two people." Same for economics largely(limited by data).\n\nWhen it comes to emotional problems though I get so tangled in never-ending thought it has become flat out annoying. I genuinely just want to avoid thinking about it because of how fucking slow progress is made. \n\nRight now I'm trying to tackle insecurity, and it's just...dude. trying to solve insecurity through logical axioms is just SOOO slow and inefficient. At every god damn step of the way I am thinking "that isn't necessarily true" or "why should I feel negatively about this statement or social situation, what does it imply" "well it doesn't necessarily imply that" ad infinum. It's so god damn frustrating. At least with economics and business there is logical lines of conclusions that can be made quite quickly from a premise, but with social situations and emotions I might as well be sorting sand with tweezers. It just takes so long, and to sit there dealing with the hypotheticals makes me experience the emotions too...so it's like I'm sustaining feeling like shit the whole time that I think infinite thoughts. It's like infinite pain forever. I need breaks just to get through it.\n\nAt the same time though...I feel compelled to continue thinking about it because I have a tough time trusting my emotions. I am always worried that I might be experiencing the emotion because of insecurity, not because of genuine pain and that if challenged "why do you feel that way" I would have no response and thus invalidated.
1	I would suggest looking at yourself first find the root of the problem and then you can use reason to correct/develop the area that needs attention. 
3	I'm bored; Let's rant about reality, shall we?	&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Why am I here?* Well, I'm bored. *But why here? This subreddit? I know it has the topic of philosophy. But it's of a bunch of people that are following a pseudo-science religously... how is this place better than say blahblahblah?* Well, the people tend to give more thought here, I don't know. *Fair enough, a boring conversation nonetheless, let's move to something more interesting, shall we?* Ok, did you have anything in mind? *How about why you're here.* You just asked that. *I mean why philosophy?* Well, I like to understand myself. I hate being lost, at this age, it's inevitable, learning about myself and "reality" might clear that up. *Why do you dislike being "lost"?* It means I don't know how to get back home. I don't know where I am, and I'm alone. It's safer in groups, where the path is known, and repeated, where I won't get lost, make a wrong turn and get eaten by a bear. *How do you plan to use philosophy to find your way home? What even is home?* If I know what I want, and "who" I am, I will know what direction I want to go - *But how does that help you go that direction? Just because you know it, doesn't mean you'll end up going that direction.*  I can look for what matches what I want. If I want a body of water, I'll follow a river. *But that body of water is only generic, it doesn't mean you'll get to the Atlantic ocean; if that's what you wish.* It's the best I can think to do...  *Are you ok with this?* Hell no! I have no idea what the hell I'm doing...  *You said you'd get mauled, but is that what will really happen? What does that mean in reality?* I guess it means being let down... Not getting what I want...  *Could you ask for directions?* Depends, how do I know I would be getting the truth, or if we're even talking about the same place, if I can even go down that path, or if that path even exists anymore?  *So, basically, you can't get directions, you can only feel more comfortable with where you're going*  Yes.  *What makes a path feel more comfortable?*  Well, generally, familiarity. And ease of passage.  *So, if you go where you want to go, e.g. just looking around for a path that looks "fun" to walk down, would it not get you to where you want to go? It may not be familiar, but you can trust it will be fun because if it isn't, there's nothing stopping you from changing directions.*  Perhaps, but then again, maybe there is. I could have stumbled upon a beast, and up getting chased, then I lose control, I just go where I can run fastest.  *Hm... Let's give this a break, for now, more thought is definitely needed.*  Agreed. Now what?  *At least for this post, let's call it done.*  With that over with, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
2	I should have formatted this better... Sorry. 
1	My thoughts on what though? Reality? Reality in what sense? The totality of everything that is, has been and will be? Then one must delineate precisely what it means 'to be,' but even then, one can't actually consider everything that is as-such, rather they can consider the symbol 'reality' (or life/existence/the universe, w/e) and what it may entail.  \n\nPerhaps something that would be of use is the notion raised by Victor Frankl that 'life doesn't have a meaning in the singular, rather, the meaning of life is something that is constantly renewed in every moment, and it is our task to discover that new meaning in every given moment.' \n\nAnother potentially useful thing to keep in mind is that language is a function of taking a continuous process (life/reality/existence/the universe, whatever those may be) and slicing it into discrete components (words, sentences, thoughts, etc). As such, the tool used to examine existence is already at odds with it by being a categorically different kind of thing. Which implies that the examination will always come up short, because there is a fundamental disconnect between the method and what it's being applied to. \n\n&#x200B;
1	Where are your *F* *I* *N* *G* *E* *R* *S* *?*
1	I don't believe in reality 
1	life is basically  a belief if you look at it in the broader nature of it, but I think our purpose should at least be to find that out since we were found to have a evolving self-awareness or intelligence/technology. I think that really worth living for.
1	A wise man once said "If you find yourself lost in the woods, fuck it, build a house. Well, I was lost but now I live here! I have severely improved my predicament!"\n\nOn the topic of feeling lost in the world, I think you just have to own it and carve out a place for yourself. Then you are home.

0	I need links to good enneagram test sites...	Basically, I personally feel I have more ENTP like tendencies in regards to my Ne and Fe use. I feel when participating in conversations irl that I’m there to somewhat make the other person or people feel comfortable around me to a certain extent and I try to build rapport every chance I get. I feel i’m a little bit goofier than alot of INTPs with enneagram 5 or whatever it’s called. My Ne is definitely more prominent and in social situations I really can’t stick to Ti, that drains me if i really wanna connect with someone. I always see groups of people and get a good number of moments (obvs not all the time or close) where I wish i had a group of friends that were pro-active in terms of social energy between each other. The INTPs that I’ve met irl which i’ll admit is quite a few, are alot more serious and composed than me and talk wayyyyy less. I wanna know if these things have to do with enneagram or not. If so, someone link me an accurate test so I can take it, Cheers 🍻 
2	You could try the [Eclectic Energies test](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test) \n\nYou might find that you type as a 5w4, social variant or something. I’d be interested to know your results bud
1	Are you sure you're not an ENFP? Asking cause I noticed you said "I feel" and also about the making people feel comfortable and wishing for social interaction. I was mistyped as an INTP for awhile cause my i/e were nearly 50/50. My enneagram is 7w8!
7	Mistyped	Ever since I heard of MBTI, I thought I was an INTJ.  This was partly because my ex-roomate, who was a physic-like INFJ, thought so combined with the fact that I honestly relate to a lot of INTJ traits. I can reflect now that I've gotten to know myself a lot better and I'm in less of an emotionally tumultuous time in my life away from my clinically insane parents, that I have always been more closely related to the INTP (in-so-much as you can resemble a single type. )\n\nI thought I was just an underachieving INTJ! But reading about the INTP makes me feel not alone . Like even if everyone I ever meet misunderstands me, I'm not even the only one like this ! That's awesome and hopeful. And now to make the best with what I've got . 
2	Same situation I went through, I thought I was a failing ISTJ a few years ago, but eventually when taking the 16 personalities quiz my results shifted to INTP and it felt more relatable.
1	> physic-like INFJ\n\nThe real lesson is that those don't exist.\n\nINFJ will try to convince you they can do it, but they can't. Not too bad a guess, though. Us and INTJs share the same strengths function wise, but we don't have the same preferences. Leads to a lot of mistype, since one can relate to the other.
1	Okay, buddy. Good point. But different personalities will reach success different ways . That's all I meant . 
1	Anyone got any tips for being more aggressive?	Today I looked at these pamphlets a busker had near them while they weren't looking. They caught me reading them and came over to give me one, asking if I could post it somewhere and spread his name around. I REALLY wanted to tell him that I didn't want to but I couldn't and ended up taking it with me just to throw it out when I was out of his sight.\n\nAlso today, I ended up talking with an associate of mine. I was asking if they knew about another person and they told me to just talk to them myself and how much they hated people who ask about others. It was okay advise but her logic was way too personal and I wanted to tell her that but I couldn't.\n\nSo any tips on being more aggressive and speak up? Some ways to practice aggression would be appreciated to A LOT.\n\nThanks!
5	Find your integrity, if you want to be aggressive turn off your fe and society standards. A lot of developed intps struggle with this because they learned how to approach social situations, and categorized doing things as just something you had to do. If you don't need and want to, just don't and proclaim it.
3	Speaking up for yourself reasonably isn't aggressiveness; it's assertiveness.\n\nWhat's stopping you from saying what you think?
1	Yeah. For starters, drop the word “aggressive”. It’s confusing your brain by inserting wrong elements into the right ones you are seeking to develop. \n\nSeek truth in order to develop assertiveness and initiation skills. Know yourself better and develop your confidence in your own thoughts. Once you have mastery over those two, you’ll be able to easily defend yourself and tell someone off when they are not being respectful or considerate to you. 
1	Where else have you seen a high number of INTPs?

12	I got some more [RHETOLOGICAL FALLACIES](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/rhetological-fallacies/) with pretty illustrations.
11	I’m already rude enough without this dude
9	I'm not as interested in this so much as I am in a guide on how to use logical fallacies against other fallacies. It's pointless to "win" an argument if the third party isn't even educated enough to understand what you're saying. Sometimes I don't want to be right, I just want to look like I'm right.
6	Even if you memorise all of this, as for yourself and others you're still up against [cognitive biases.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)\n\nAlso never forget the fallacy fallacy :-3
10	I saved this image.\n\nCurious question how much does it bother you when people use false logic or something from this image
4	Even most mainstream media outlets often commit several of these every day, and no one even bats an eye.
3	OMG where has this been all my life
3	The website this comes from is actually one of my bookmarks.
3	The econ majors (well at least one) approve.
3	Nice, combined image of all the fallacies featured in [this](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) site.\nNow I can use this cheat sheet instead!
3	THANK YOU FOR THIS
3	I'd say cherry picking or "the sharpshooter" is the one that gets people the most.  On both sides of arguments.  I see this a lot since I follow paranormal topics.  And both sides do it.  It's really funny to me.

1	I still don't understand loaded questions.
1	ah, 9GAG content from a decade ago. This sub sinks lower every day
1	This isn't gonna be a humble brag. This is going to be a straight up brag. I had a logic class (2 level. This wasn't an honors class--we covered about half of these) in HS where HW was only 10% of the grade. I did no homework. I got every single question on every quiz and test right. The teacher decided I must've been cheating. He made me do all the quizzes and all the tests again in a testing center he personally proctored in a day's notice The Q's were the same and in a different order. I got them all right again. I ended up getting a B+ in the class because must have been docked on laziness in group projects or something.\n\nEdit: This was only 3 ~20q quizzes and the midterm ~50q. The finals were done separately, on a separate schedule and before the final so I could get my semester grade. The class was only one semester.\n\n
1	There's a handy [one](http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) I've been using to annoy people on Facebook. \n\nEdit: Looks to be from the same site. I just love that I can drop the specific fallacy in the comments rather than taking the time to explain what a logical fallacy is and which one they are falling prey to.
1	No true INTP needs this.

0	Still bored, I'll rant some more.	*Reality. An idea. Maybe. We don't know what it is, but for now, it's an idea. Once we get some grounds in defining reality, then we can consider it... reality (for lack of a better term)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Oh, hello, nice to meet you. I'm Ethan, by the way. I see you've come a long way, judging by your condition. Here, please come in, there's a seat for you just down the hall, I'll get us a cup of tea." A young man lets you into his apartment, and begins making tea. Meanwhile, you're trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. How'd you get here? Where is "here"? Why is he acting nice? What am I? Who am I?   \n\n\n***Patience. Answers will come.***   \n\n\nYou acquiesce, knowing you are in no position to disagree with... *something.* You didn't even hear a voice, but you processed it as if you heard a voice.   \n\n\nYou take a seat, looking around the young man's acetic apartment. You look to be in the living room. There's a chair, some tables, and a fireplace, along with bookshelves around it. Seems kind of dangerous, but you don't question it.   \n\n\n"Would you like one lump or two?"   \n\n\n"Uh.. two please."   \n\n\nHe adds two to each cup of tea, places some biscuits on a tray, along with the cups. He pulls up a chair and hands you a cup.   \n\n\n"I can imagine you have many questions."  \n\n\n"Yes... Who are you?"  \n\n\n"Hm... I don't know. I'm a human. I'm secluded from the rest of the world. And I like reading."  \n\n\n"Uh.. Ok..." you said. "What about me? Who am I?"  \n\n\n"You're a blank slate. A canvas, if you will. You are nobody, but you have the potential of being anybody."  \n\n\n"What do you mean I'm a blank slate? Am I dead?"  \n\n\n"No, you are very much alive, but you were dead. This is universe number 298,488,002. This is only your second life, though."  \n\n\n"Do I live more?"  \n\n\n"I don't know. I'm not omniscient."  \n\n\n"Fair enough. Why am I here?"  \n\n\n"I'm not sure. This happens every once in a while. Occasionally, people materialize in front of my door. It's happened about 100 times, now. Of course, this is over the span of 40 years. I've gotten to the point where I can predict it. I've just shared my knowledge with the new guys. Give them a place to start, and a feel for the land."   \n\n\n"How can I know I can trust you?"  \n\n\n"You can't. Probably shouldn't. I get a lot of power here, if I play my cards right, power corrupts. I am most certainly not immune, but I haven't done anything, yet."  \n\n\n"Uh..."   \n\n\n"Here, I'll give you a basic guide, you can choose to follow it if you wish, but I'm not forcing you, I'll let you stay here for a week at most. That should give you some time to get on your feet," he explains. "First thing's first, let's give you some education."   \n\n\nHe walks you over to a room, it almost looks like a classroom from high school, except it's more like a laboratory with a whiteboard.   \n\n\n"Now, it may not seem like it, but you actually have a lot of knowledge, it's just forgotten, as I begin explaining, it will seem overwhelming at first, but then it'll suddenly click. You won't know any personal memories, but your understanding of the world will return. In this case, our universal laws are interchangeable."   \n\n\nYou nod. Wondering if you can ask a few questions, first.   \n\n\n***Patience, I'm sure he'll give you the chance. He's a good kid. But don't let your guard down.***   \n\n\n"Before we begin, do you have any questions?"\n\n  \n\n\n"Uh... no" You decide you don't trust him. He's too nice. Better keep quiet about that weird non-voice voice thing.   \n\n\n"Alrighty. Ooh, boy, where do we begin?"   \n\n\nHe takes a deep breath in preparation for a long rant.   \n\n\n"Welcome to your new reality. Pretty amazing how all of this is happening. But it's all confusing and endlessly esoteric. There are many complex things to talk about, from what even is consciousness to the atoms that make us up. But what are atoms you ask? Imagine this book, cut it in half. Then again, and again, and again. Eventually, you'll get to a point where you get something that you can't cut in half, right? Doesn't matter, humans, think so. We called this thing the "atom" meaning "indivisible" but much much later, we figured out that it actually is indivisible. It has a core consisting of protons and neutrons, with tiny balls orbiting it called electrons. The amount of protons dictates how the atom acts, what it is, what it does and what color it is. Well, technically a proton is colorless, but it's made up of quarks, which do have colors. But we don't know what these are. They could be tiny particles that make up protons, but we also think they could be tiny vibrating strings. Each string vibrating at a different frequency to form a different type of "particle." We can't observe this because light, which is made up of protons, is literally too big to bounce off these particles and into our eye, or any other sensor, in order to see them. They instead weave around them as they bounce up and down in a sinusoidal fashion. We could just increase the energy in the photon, which by the way is both a particle and a wave, and its wavelength will decrease, which means the bounces are squooshed closer together. However, this would have too much energy. How is it "too" much energy? Well, the amount of energy within the light would literally change the properties of the particle we are trying to observe. Making them literally unobservable. That being said, we can observe what they make up, and with this, we've gotten pretty far. However, we are still unable to fully explain what gravity is, string theory is our attempt at uniting quantum physics and gravity. however, it's not quite right. That being said, we have a pretty good understanding of stuff more our size. We can genetically modify flies to make legs grow out of their face or make mosquitos that are immune to malaria. We do this with a thing called CRISPR, which is a process that bacteria use in order to identify bacteriophage RNA (virus RNA) that has invaded the bacteria's own genetic code. Once identified, it cuts it out, and replaces it. We found this process is rather easy to modify, and we used it to cut out specific sections of DNA and replace it with the code we made up ourselves. Luckily, this same process works on all creatures we know of. Which brings us to the creatures, we're not sure where they come from, but we have a pretty good idea. We think that by random chance, chemicals (groups), called amino acids, that are found on asteroids, randomly combined to form proteins. After some time, these proteins coalesced to form bacteria. At some point, eukaryotes come around, and one particular bacteria gets engulfed into the eukaryote (or good kernel) and it provides energy, so they stay together. Eventually, these form together to form plants. Later, animals emerge. About 2 million years ago, our first ancestors evolve. 200,000, we evolved. We started off stupid. But our ability to speak has been of great use. It, in combination with the idea of material value, allowed us to form basic governments, at the time were tribes. Different people had different roles. This continued to evolve, and as such, so did we. We formed myths, money. This is a US dollar, the 100 dollar bill. Costs about 13 cents to produce, but we act as if it's 7,692.8 times that value: roughly. But, because we all play along, this works. This allows us to make smooth transactions. Basically, it's a fancy way to trade, without having to worry about getting something the merchant wants. With this and many other things we just accept, we form civilizations. Ones that are so powerful that they could literally destroy the entire world in a single day. And in the future, we plan even bigger things. Colonizing other planets, more control. More resources. More knowledge. We are becoming an unstoppable force, with a goal: Knowledge. Why knowledge? Because the ones actually changing anything are smart people, and people get smart because they are curious, and want more knowledge. So, whether you like it or not, as long as there are smart people, we will be getting even smarter. Collectively, the general population is getting dumber. But that's beside the point. Despite all of this, we don't know everything, we haven't even scratched the surface. But we are determined to dig. And dig we will."   \n\n\n"HOLY SHIT. That was a lot... And none of this shit makes any fucking sense! You're insane, you can go fuck yourself! I'm going to go fuck myself! Whatever the hell that means! Just let me go, you psycho!" You screech.   \n\n\n"Looks like my job here is done." He smiles, and offers another cup of tea, that of which you reluctantly accept.   \n\n\nYou drink your tea, and calm down.   \n\n\n"So, what's next?"  \n\n\n&#x200B;

32	Comfy bed, good food, fast wifi~
24	Then when I'm finally home:\n\nWhy am I not doing anything?
6	Yeah. And that's disastrous, arguably.
6	Seriously. Nothing better than being in bed.
4	I say it when I get home too. No idea why, I just say "I need to go home" and "I hate myself" all the time for no reason usually.
3	I was reading the comments in the linked sub and not this one and was very confused. People were talking about crying and shit, and I was just like "this really doesn't have an INTP vibe I'm confused."
1	This is so koot >.<

1	A control type? How so? I would think that would be an INTJ thing. INTPs are mostly known for being in control of their emotions. Daydreaming and videogames are all I need along with things to put my intellect to use.

7	What kind of driver are you?	I don't know if my type is a reasonable cause but I can't seem to keep focused on the road when driving for a long time, and I always find myself speeding very fast when I'm not aware. 
12	I'm focussed on the road. It is to dangerous not to be.\n\nPeople who treat traveling in the car as an extension of their own home with non-driving activities, irk me to no end.
7	I'm focused but I find driving so Damn relaxing. If I'm not driving with anyone I just get so mellow that I completely go on autopilot.
4	I usually like to drive around on back roads near my house and think. Driving calms me. I usually drive 5 under (25mph is posted speed) and just think and work on stilling my mind
3	I also speed when I'm not paying attention. Thank goodness for cruise control
5	I watch everyone on the road like a hawk. I do not trust people that are supposed to give me right of way. I keep an eye on my mirrors all the times. I drive about 5 over the speed limit, and I like to accelerate quickly... at least in my car. If I drive the wife's that's not an option. I don't dick around with anything else while driving. I still do find driving relaxing though.
4	I drive as if I'm barely in control of a stupidly dangerous, unsafetyed, badly-designed and worse-built weapon; sharing a crumbling and uncontrolled space with a whole bunch of psychotic, retarded monkeys even less in control of even more dangerous weapons.  The difference between common sense and paranoia is only whether you believe everyone else is conspiring.\n\nI do my best to be courteous even when it's unwarranted, and ensure that if any other driver wants to be a lunatic, they can do so *somewhere else*.  I drive at or below the speed limit, but if someone wants to get ahead of me, I try to make it easy for them to do so.  I consider staying focused on the mission and not getting mad to be an essential survival skill.\n\nI do, however, brake for tailgaters and the extra-deluxe assholes who drive around with their highbeams on.
1	I definitely am a "crazy" driver if my boyfriend told you, but I grew up with a dad who drove armored trucks and drove like he was still overseas when he was in the states. Kind of picked up his driving habits and he has told me I'm a great driver... I'm extra calculated and drive fast, and drive a small car so I can weave in traffic. \n\nI enjoy driving a lot and sometimes wish I had a fast car and a fun track to drive around, but then again I just don't care enough to make that happen. 
1	I'm super focused on the road, and how my car is behaving. I literally never look at scenery, or other people in the car, or devices. 
1	A very anxious one. I hate driving and would like to have a lifestyle that doesn’t require it.

132	Id say its an INTP thing, we daydream to the point of delusion and are incredibly creative	
14	Just like Cells at Work anime? Hahaha quite cute.
5	I don't know if it's being done ironically or not but a lot of what I see in this sub can be applied to much of humanity, not just INTPs.
3	Exactly. I'm not crazy, I'm creative. 
2	I wish I was creative. 
1	I've seen the movie. Dont remember the name.
17	DAE hate the special attention they recieve on their birthday?	
4	i went to a group meeting in a different city and told no one it was my b-day. away from family. it was fun.
3	Pretty much. Far better to take the day off, turn off all phones, avoid social media, and ideally spend the day physically somewhere other than home.
2	This year will be the third year I will have been on a road trip on my birthday. I honestly don't mind, it's even relaxing not having to make plans or anything. As long as my birthday is a good day, I don't really care how it goes.
2	Yes. I set up my own party last year and it was the worst birthday I've ever had. Spent the whole time worrying about pleasing the people I invited instead of enjoying myself. This year I'd like to spend my birthday with my boyfriend and maybe a couple of plants. 
1	Seriously, birthdays are the most pedestrian of "accomplishments". I really just wish people would ignore mine. I don't have an issue with getting old (already I have more days behind me than in front), but how about respecting my desire for it not to be a thing?
1	Immensely. I'd prefer attention for something I've done, not for merely having been born. It's like a yearly participation trophy. I care so little I've gone through my birthday not knowing it's my birthday on several occasions. Not since I've been married because my wife wouldn't allow it, but she keeps it as low key as she can and I tolerate it.
1	when i was younger i used to set my birthday to the wrong date on facebook... pretty childish looking back but i found it funny
1	On my birthday, all I want to do is wake, without an alarm clock. Read, without clock watching. Wear sweat pants, without going to the gym. Go for a walk, without needing to get anywhere. Work, without it being for someone else. Go for coffee, without having to meet anyone...\n\nIf that makes me abnormal or unlikable, I can accept that. I just wish others could. \n\n&#x200B;
1	yea being in the center is not my thing.  As i got older, i realize its more for the other people in your life.  People feel good to do something nice for you.  Its also a reason to get people together to hang out.  I guess its up to you if you think its worth putting up a bit of uncomfortableness for your peeps.
1	My last birthday, I had a date that night. I didn't mention it was my birthday beforehand because I didn't know if he was the type to make a big deal of it. He did find out because we ran into someone who shared my birthday. My date was INTP too. I got a quiet piece of cake from the bartender, no fuss. 
4	What are your opinions on life and success?	First of all, excuse my english lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I have gotten involved in the MBTI and as a supposed INTP I would like to know if there are others who share my views on life and the imposed path that we should take in order to obtain what many people consider as success.\n\nLong story short I just find it hard to relate to what others label as success. Acoording to most people to be succesful you should have a stable job (work many hours) and make a good salary, but in order to get to that you should give it your all at school/college as to get a good grade as a necessasy stem in the success cycle.\n\nATM I see things differently, maybe is because im burn out or something but I believe that there is no reason to make huge ammounts of effort in order to be "succesful". I believe that the effort deffinitely undermines the """success""" that will ultimately be achieved. (eg. Why would u want to study/work 10h per day even if you get $20k/month if you wont have time to enjoy it). At this time in my life what I try to do is employ the least ammount of effort I can, but still achieve a good ammount of satisfaction (I wont do much work  as that will require a lot of unenjoyable time but I wont be the kid who doesnt turn up to class as that would ultimately make my future pleasure way worse (unemployed?) so ultimately what i do is basically create a balance between pleasure and work, trying to achieve the max ammount of pleasure with the least ammount of work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think of this way of seeing life and our society? I really do believe that no ammount of succes can make up for an exhausting and inhuman ammount of effort needed in order to obtain that sucess, specially taking into account that this success doesnt have any real value because of life being finite and lacking of real purpose (maybe that sounds too nihilistic).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nId love to hear your thoughts on this approach to living life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\[Edit\]: Thanks for all the responses. Maybe it sounds like my post sounds like what some edgy teenager would say. Idk, but I definitely agree on the fact that you have to find something worth putting effort into. Ill try to find that lel\n\n&#x200B;
7	 Success to me is financial independence. I dont care about appearing rich and successful - I just want to be able to pay my bills and have enough left over to put into savings and enjoy my life. Ideally I achieve this with the lowest effort possible (shorter hours / non stressful job).\n\n I think some people waste a lot of effort working crazy hours so they can purchase status symbols. \n\n I'd like as much free time possible to explore interests. No overtime!\n\n Im childfree, and live modestly. Dont remember the last time I bought clothes. Ride old motorcycles because I cant afford a car, let alone a flashy one. Paying a mortgage on my own home. I work 40 hours a week, and I simply can't afford any real luxury. \n\n I'd consider working a harder job for more money. But only because inflation is outpacing my income and things are getting tough.\n\n I'd always rather have money in the bank than fancy possessions. Savings = freedom. Debt = slavery. And we INTP love us some freedom.
4	It's what you make of it. You should at least be happy; whatever that means to you.
2	I am pretty successful by society's definition. I have a high-paying job with good stability that regularly puts me in contact with powerful and influential people. \n\nI love my job, but I can't help myself from fantasizing about buying a piece of land, building a homestead there, and living in isolation for the rest of my life. \n\nBasically, I find limited satisfaction in achieving success on society's terms. I'm already bored with it. I'm certainly not sure if I have another 25-30 years of it left in me. I think it will make less and less sense the more time and effort I invest. \n\n
2	I would say I pursue a meaningful life focused on personal growth. I want to find out what I truly desire, master myself, and find out where my potential can take me. Sure, I’m inherently lazy, except when it comes to things that I’m passionate about such as music. I chart a vision of my life path with these passions in mind, aiming to master them. If mastery in most domains takes about ten years, then we all have time to master about five things. Each day will have at least five hours dedicated to honing those skills, and when I can muster the strength, more than five hours. I make things very efficient: I cut out everything unproductive that drains my energy and leave unproductive things that allow me to rest or energize me. \n\nThe typical day for me is in terms of being productive is 1 hour gym time, 1 hour singing practice and piano, 1 hour music composition, and 1 hour writing. Of course, some days I feel compelled to spend an excessive amount of time on any of these singular tasks, and I allow myself to indulge in it. The timing of passion should be followed in my opinion. \n\nThe rest of my day is for leisure or maintenance such as cooking, eating, showering, etc. \n\nOne of my most productive recent decisions was cutting out tedious people who waste my time. This meant that only my close friend group is intact, everyone else fell off. 
1	It’s all personal. Also here’s another point: some people that work those crazy hours actually love and enjoy what their doing, and in turn don’t mind putting in that effort. I personally would take $50k a year doing a job i love vs $150k a year at a job i hate.\n\nyou seem to want to do the least effort possible towards work for $$$ and that’s fine, but is there anything you’d be willing to put all of the rest of that effort?

176	This should be the Holy grail of this Sub.	
13	This is an INTP thing?\n\nI just thought it was a functional human thing.  How could people not do this?
11	This is taped to the wall on my desk at work. I hope more people make note of it.
4	All of this happens in the time it takes a person to say anything  to me and my response.....
3	Be source critical and objective.
1	These are too any thoughts dude. At work I gotta live within the next three breathes of my manager.
1	IWhy ? I do that naturally.
-1	“Idea of myself changed” yes it did. \n\nhence: “depending on the day”\n\nInitially I took three different tests, when I first wanted to know...intp, ok cool whatever. \n\nthen a few weeks ago I did those same tests again, to see what would happen after a longish period of time and me completely forgetting the questions...INTJ. \n\nWhen I saw the changes and read the analysis, they were of course different but nowhere near enough for me to say “ no fuckin way” as I read I shook my head in agreement at damn near all of it. \nIt’s a test of personality. Is there some black and white doctrine that says a person can’t exhibit slight traits of two different types?\n\nI’m an “I”  but can be an “e” for months on end. So what shit changes. They human mind isn’t black and white. Relax. 
0	Is there a sub for these kinds of posts? 
21	Humanity inclined INTPs	I've been made self-conscious by the INTP type invoking the image of an eminent mathematician or physicist in essentially all forms of media. I've never cared remotely for the natural sciences or "true math", but instead approach the social sciences and humanities with the trademark INTP analytic style. Anybody else around here in the same boat?
7	Language/linguistics nerd here. I enjoy learning about how language works at a granular level and the history of how words get their meaning.
3	This is asked here pretty regularly. It seems about half of us are more quantitatively oriented, and half are much less so. I’m in the former. 
2	I went to school for engineering/physics but these days I'm a lot more interested in society, cultures, philosophy, morality, how these things impact economy and lifestyle and the way we perceive everything.
2	Hell, a logician personality isn't just for sciences, unless you consider that only sciences are ruled by logic. I myself am a writer, and I find being an INTP really useful to analyze other stories and learn from the flaws. An beyong that, it helps me with my worldbuilding.\n\nIt doesn't mean I'm not quantitative, it means I don't quantity the same thing.
6	It's not a "science" if it doesn't have a true math component. In science, you need to prove things empirically with experiments that can be repeated and the results replicated. You need true math to process that in a meaningful way. \n\nBTW social science includes fields that use a shit ton of true math. 
1	Yes...into music, philosophy, literature,   some occult stuff, mbti etc.
1	I study analytic philosophy and want to become a professor.
1	I’m way more humanity focused. \n\nI own a food business and am working on a kid-focused AI project. Pure math/coding/research bore me to tears. \n\nAnyway, ultimately I just can’t get into work that doesn’t benefit the world.

1	Sociology major over here 🙋‍♂️
1	I'm interested in languages, history, social sciences, and culture, as well as programming, and I'm not very interested in natural sciences. However, I went to a science-heavy university because everybody else thought that I was and should be interested in math, science, and engineering, and I went along because I was used to being walked all over and having words put into my mouth.
0	Anyone else rarely get comforted/complimented/praised?	I feel like for all the swarms of good shit I do for people they focus on like the one bad thing I did a year ago and that’s all they ever think about me.\n\nIt’s honestly maddening. I need complements and praise just a little bit but it never fucking happens. Ever. :(
2	What does your parole officer say?\n\nJust kidding.\n\nThe good news is that most people eventually forget, especially after someone else fucks up.\n\nThat German word I can’t spell -schaeudenfraude - thinking this way doesn’t necessarily mean you’re an asshole.
2	I just get praised for stuff that feels meaningless.\n\n"Congrats on your grades!" Thanks they're always good.\n\n"You're so pretty!" Thanks my mom gave me my face\n\n"You wrote really good poetry!" Thanks I wrote it 10 minutes ago in the shower\n\nThen I'll put a lot of time and effort into something and no one even notices.
1	I get told "You're so smart"  But to me it means almost nothing.\n\nAlso, if you're not very good looking, you might get "cute"
1	Eh, compliments come off as manipulation to me usually .\n\nOnly thing more annoying is people saying "I'm sorry"
1	Lucky you. I get praise all the time, and I can't stand it.
5	How do you feel when someone betrays your trust?	I'm an INTP so I suppose I'll post on this subreddit. Let's talk about the feels.\n\nI would first off like to say that I doubt the accuracy of the Myers Briggs test. I've gotten both INTJ and INTP. Although when I got the INTJ I was emotionally distraught.\n\nPlease tell me if I sound like I'm overreacting. I honestly don't know if this is just me being a toxic narcissist or not. Or if I'm getting too emotional. This is gonna be long. I doubt anyone will actually respond or take the time to read all this. Although there is hope, which is why I'm writing this here.\n\nThere's this girl, let's call her Sophie. She and I hang out every day, basically. Well, not recently because I keep getting in trouble for not turning in homework so I can't hang out with friends. But on the usual schedule, her mom would drive her to my house, because I was close to the school, and then my sister would drive us. Every day, she comes in, runs up my loud ass stairs, starts looking for me super loud yelling my name across the house. When she finds me, she always asks the same question, "Is your sister gonna drive us?". It's like she forgets the fact that she drives us every day. I never used to get annoyed with her for this. I thought it was funny but that's all. Plus she's never made us late. \n\nI usually do in fact. My alarm doesn't wake me up so I always have to rush in the morning when I wake up. My sister always ends up waiting for me in the car for at least a minute while I brush my teeth. But my house is 15 minutes away with traffic and I've never actually made them late, just annoyed. \n\nMy routine is I wake up, find my clothes, go to the bathroom while peeing and putting on my clothes simultaneously, put my socks on, brush my teeth, grab my converse, my Chromebook, my phone, and my backpack, then I walk out in the snow to my sisters car. \n\nThis friend always sits on the right side of the car and she gets there first. But I also sit on the right side when she isn't here. I open the door to the right side, she tells me to go around, and I do. I never used to get annoyed with this person. She was the only person I ever fully opened up to, and I thought she respected me as much as I respected her. The one thing that ever annoyed me was that whenever she would show me something and I wouldn't laugh, she would ask me if I got it as if I was so dumb I couldn't get the joke. That happens rarely that I don't get the joke. I just don't think it's funny. \n\nNot in a mean way, I've tried forcing myself to laugh and that made her laugh, but I soon stopped because I was being stupid and fake. She would often tell me I was a dumbass, and that I didn't understand certain things. I am very oblivious to certain things sometimes, but I was still irritated when she would say stuff like that. Nobody else thought it was a problem that she did that on the daily. I talked to my sister about it and she laughed and said I was fucking stupid. So I can justify it easily. \n\nNow the real reason I'm writing this, part of it. She told me to go to the Winter Ball with her, I agreed, despite the fact that I really don't like going to dances because I always feel awkward. I assumed it would be fun since I was going with her. She proceeded to invite all her friends and I didn't mind. The more the merrier. This is the first time I realized she was basically my only friend. I have people I talk to in class, but those people weren't going and the others I didn't even say hi to in the halls. So I was heavily dependent on her because she was really the only person I knew who was going, and she told me I was her best friend so there wasn't an issue. So then we went shopping for my dress on the day of the dance, then she went home. \n\nShe was going with her other friend, let's call her Cthulu. She annoys me. Whatever. I was going to meet Sophie at the dance. She got there at 9:00, it starts at 8:00, I got there at 9:10. I met her, checked my coat and phone, then walked with her and Cthulu to the dance floor. All of her friends were there, none of mine except her. Everyone was basically ignoring me and this other girl. So I made friends with this other girl, Qwertyuiop, who is super judgmental to everything, and I talk to her. \n\nMy friend was talking to Cthulu the whole time. She didn't even look at me. When we started dancing she danced in a circle with her friends while me and Qwertyuiop were just standing outside the circle. Qwertyuiop was crossing her arms and looking at me surprised whenever something interesting happened. I tried to dance with her but I had to grab her hands to get her to do it and it was weird. So I went to the bathroom to try to fix my bun. I came back, found them again and the same thing was happening. I even tried to talk to her and she pretended she didn't hear me, the music was super loud but I went right in her ear. I figured it was gonna be like that the whole time so I left. I told her I was leaving early through text and she responded with "Awww k" my mom picked me up. \n\nThe next day all she did was make fun of me for how I danced, she didn't even mention how she ignored me. I tried to hint to her that I was upset by talking less but I don't know if she even knew me well enough to know when I'm emotionally turbulent. I started to notice little things that I was too stupid to know before. How every time I would talk about something she would bring the attention to her. For example, I would say something meaningless like, "I have to figure out how to get my hair to have the same types of curls and textures evenly." she would immediately say "Yeahh... my hair is super weird because my baby hairs are super curly but the rest of my hair is not and that's when I have to brush it four times a day. Plus my hair is harder than yours to handle because your hair is short and also I have a lot of hair but it's super thin strands so it just looks normal." How did I not know how self obsessed she was. \n\nToday, the actual thing that made me yell at her occurred. I almost never yell at people and I did today. So basically, I have physical education with her and she went to dress out. I always wait for her and walk to her class with her. She always brushes her hair before and after gym because it gets "messed up" I went into the bathroom and told her she was gonna be super late. She told me I had to wait for her and I was like "Can you hurry up brushing?" She responded with, "I still have to get my shoes on" and kept brushing her hair. I asked her to just do it while she was putting on her shoes and why she didn't do it in the locker room. She said "I want to it it in here". I put on her hand lotion. She complained about how I stole it from her last time. I told her how she was wrong and explained hat she gave me permission to use her old hand lotion. She got a huge glob. So then she was like, "Give me your hands.". I said, "I just put some on" She said, "Give me your leg". So then I held up my leg and she got the lotion all over my sock. This was an entire legs worth of lotion all over my sock and she meant to do it. I said "what the fuck" she said "oops." I was annoyed. I then said "why did you do that." She responded with "because you just held your leg up like that" I said " next time use your leg" she said "my legs don't need it" \n\nI was getting pissed of because I was waiting for her, the bell had already rang, and she was acting like a child. I grabbed the hairbrush and brushed my hair while she was getting her shoes on. Which was kind of hypocritical of me I realized but I didn't care. She put down her hairbrush and said put this in my bag. I put the paper beside the bag into it because I wasn't really listening. She took a long fucking time to get her shoes on, then she said "why didn't you put it in the bag" I realized she meant the hairbrush as I was saying "I did" She goes, "You're so fucking stupid, I meant the hairbrush." I said sorry sarcastically as she tore the paper from the bag and threw it on the floor. I say "Bye" and I leave without realizing she was right behind me. She says. "Were you just about to leave me?" "yes, that's why I said bye and started walking away." "you didn't realize I was behind you?" "I'm sorry if I wasn't staring at you while I was leaving" "Wheres my backpack" "your friends probably hid it while you were brushing your hair" "I'm gonna be so late to math" \n\nNotice how she doesn't mention how late I'm gonna be. She walks ahead of me and checks the gym. "My backpack isn't there" I am about to leave but some last string of being a good friend makes me wait for her and I walk back while she frantically searches the locker room for two minutes. She comes back with her backpack. I ask, "Where was it?", she says it was in one of the lockers. It;s like she forgot all those things she did just minutes ago. I was still willing to fully forgive her at this point but I was mad. And I try my best not to show that I'm mad most of the time. She went on about how much trouble she was gonna be in. She never thanked me or apologized or anything. \n\nI told her I didn't want to ride the bus with her after school, which I only do because she asks me to ride with her not because I prefer to. It's K-8 bus so it has the most annoying people. She says, "Yeah but it would take just as much time to get home on the bus as it would to walk" It takes 20 minutes to walk and about 45 to get home by bus because it leaves at 3:32 roughly, and the high school gets out at 3:00. "Are you mad?" "No. I'm not mad." "then why don't you wanna ride the bus?" I pause and weight the options. I reason I was going to snap some time in the future anyway so I said loudly, not yelling but I raised my voice, "Well, actually, I am mad, you know why?" Because You treated me like shit the entire time I was waiting for you" She says "How was I treating you like shit? Like actually. Can you tell me how I was?" All I could put into words was the fact that she harshly insulted me while I was trying to help her by putting the paper into her bag. She said, "I was kidding, that's what I do to all my friends. It wasn't like I was serious, plus you used my hairbrush after saying 'can you hurry up'" "I say that;s because you were putting your shoes on." I don't remember what happened next, I was too busy doing math in my head because I had to cry. The reason I am so mad at her is because she tried to manipulate me, and act like nothing she did was wrong and that I was the one at fault. She even lied to me and herself and told me she was just kidding when she called me stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr I just dramatized shit. Please tell me if my anger is justified. Also don't make fun of my grammar, I know it's really bad. I don't want to reread the story just to get the commas and capitalization right. Also you guys should try writing things down when you feel emotional, it lets me organize my thoughts while expressing my annoyance in a healthy way.\n\nDo you guys have some stories about toxic friends? If so, please share.
6	Cut her off. Real friends would never act this way. I'm assuming you're still fairly young, but this shouldn't justify anything. As an INTP, if you keep thinking and analysing your friendship time and again to establish what's wrong, chances are you'd be better off without it. 
5	Can you give a tldr;?\n\nBut to answer the title, I cut them off. Easy. 
5	With friends like these, who needs enemies!
4	Im not in this world to live up to ur expectations and ur not here to live up to mine" bruce lee more or less
3	I have a lot of trust issues and it takes time + consistent behavior to get into my inner trust circle. Once people are in, they never really leave or rather I’ve never had anyone breach my system. I’m super loyal and there’s a lot of things I do for my close friends but if one were to ever backstab me; there would be no second chances. Your experience leads me to believe that you should re-evaluate your friendship with this person and then potentially re-evaluate what you qualify as “friendship”.
3	Ignore her for good until you see she really tries hard to be ur friend. If she does.
2	Well I would've just left her if you were concerned about being late for class and she should've understood that. When she covered your socks with lotion that was just bad and annoying. I would've just told her to screw off or tell on her (as lame as it sounds). Then leave. Or try to give her the beat down.\n\n I don't think you're over reacting, she did things that bothered you so you have every right to be mad. I do think these problems are so small tho that a bit of communication would fix them. If she, in the end, doesn't understand that you don't wanna be late for class then just stop associating with her.\n\nIs she actually a good friend? Sounds like you open up to her cause she just so happens to be around you all the time. Honestly when she calls you f***ing stupid that sounds really mean. I'm not sure how casually y'all swear tho.\n\nLastly know that not having friends is perfectly fine. It's more important to befriend yourself before befriending others.
2	Emotionally manipulative people are the worst. I say drop her. 
2	Betrayed? It's a heart wrenching, chest burning feeling. Like literally in pain I thought 'I'm gonna die from it'.\nFemale INTP here. As I went through your rant, it was like reliving my high school moment.\nThe thing that I learnt is, you need to widen your circle of friends. You can't be heavily dependent of one.\nBecause in the dance, where you felt isolated from others, you felt quite resentful for her not entertaining you that time. You should get that you're not her only friend, and it's your responsibility too to go and have some fun.\nIt also depends on you if you want to cut her off or try to mend your friendship. I hope this helps you get some perspective.
2	You’re in that situation where you don’t have any close friends.\n\nThe key thing is to not be desperate to have a close friend. Can’t force it. Can’t fake it. Close friends need to connect on a deep personal level. \n\nWhen you’re desperate you take any old Friend and become too invested. And if that ‘friend’ is the type of person to take advantage of this imbalance of investment in this relationship, (like in this instance) you’re gonna get hurt. I think this person would be a fine ‘make small talk at the school reunion’ Friend. Nothing more. \n\nIt just takes time to find a close ‘I will die for you and raise your child if YOU die’ Friend. Good luck.

2	OMG....these people are really. I am pretty sure there are some female INTP lurking here. I am one but I decided not to lurk anymore.\n\nOkay...sweetie. I am no longer in school and probably older than you by a decade or something. But let me tell you, in your life, you will see that kind of manipulative people. \n\nWhen I was in elementary school, I did have a group of girls which I was dying to be part of. Being an INTP and asian (effort and grades are going hand in hand), so I could say I was not the typical procrastinator INTP. I was the teacher's pet, class president, rank 1 in class/school. And whenever our teacher needed to leave the class, our teacher would always ask me to write names of students who were noisy and behaved badly. And those girls, they would treat me nicely during this period, so I would not write their names down. Especially the "leader" whose name came up after me. So when it came to seating arrangement/exam, she'd be around me, and even during exam, she could peek at my answer sheet. I was just too naive to know about her tricks. But lesson learnt, and life goes on. And that's the first lesson I learnt about manipulative people.\n\nThere is also 1 thing I learnt about being an INTP. We good at enduring something. Because INTP looks at the bigger picture and supported by logic and rational thinking. We always calculate it first, and often times the result will be "it's not worth it". But it doesn't mean that you don't feel it. You still feel it inside and it keeps piling up because INTP has no "tool" to handle emotions until it's erupted once it has reached the tipping point. I did this a lot when I was growing up. It was bad because I hurt my mom and my sister a lot without me even realizing it. So now, I am better at communicating with my family about how I feel before it boiled over. I am not always comfortable talking about it with them, after 1 or 2 instances, I will take note and later on find a good time to talk about it with them. It's not easy, I swear. But compare to let it ruin my relationship with my family, talking about it with them is worth it.\n\nAnd...being an 30ish INTP, I only have few close friends. I can count them with 1 hand. But they are worth it. So worth it that I would fly back home if one of them is having emergency/festive ceremonies, like marriage, giving birth, etc (I am living abroad currently). And I am glad I have them and they understand me. But in order to get real friends like that, you need to put in effort trying to get to know someone. It was hard for me, but it is worth it. Because not even once they call me stupid, or idiot or laughed at my dreams/my silliness/my quirkiness. \n\nI am surprised really that you can take her insults for that long. One of the things that I am proud of is my intelligence, and no one should call me stupid/idiot only because I don't know how to handle certain social situations. "Just kidding" is not really a good excuse for me. You can throw playful banter with friends but it is you who needs to decide whether that is a joke for you or not. A joke is 2-way street. If you don't laugh about it, it's not a joke. Especially for INTP, we can joke, but we appreciate smart and witty joke and not crude one.\n\nBut anyway, shit happened and now is time to pick up the pieces. Decide it for yourself whether she's really that true friend that you would like to have in the long run. If not, then show her the exit. And probably you need to learn how to socialize, it will give you benefit in the long run. Use that INTP brain to learn how to socialize, sweetie. We may not be equipped with high Fe skill, but we have that intelligence to learn about it.\n\nRant over. Peace. V(o_o)V\n
455	This	
39	I probably have 7 Got sized novels Witten in my head
18	Rather than going to the therapy i so badly need i daydream of going to therapy which works just aswell lmfao
7	How dare you have similar experiences as me.
7	I literally have to keep an ongoing percentage of my novel's progress (relative to the average for the genre) written on a whiteboard in my room to remind myself to work on the novel. Even then, a couple weeks can pass without me opening the word document.
6	I'm commenting on this instead of writing
6	The Ti traps the Ne inside.
5	Hehe xd kill me, I am abomination
3	Did you see that one Adam Neely video about how practicing and just thinking about practicing both achieve the same effect?
3	This, everyday.
3	Day Dreaming = Planning
3	I have a total of 7 books (a series) and 4 novels already published in my head. 
2	Took me 2 years to finish an outline 🤣
2	Me AF
2	Ah, yep.  I have a bunch of stories with carefully built worlds, characters, plots, and so on in my head.  I write (non-fiction stuff) for a living, so it's not like I *couldn't* write them down, at least in theory, and if I could come up with a good place to start.  I just... uh... don't.
2	what about focusing on the recurrence of the meme as it's structure rather to even try to reblog
2	In the 90s I formulated just the reality TV show vehicle I would need to bring political factions together and be a transformative POTUS once eligible in 2016. Sorry humanity, but I never got to step one: befriend camera person. 
2	Me with studying 
2	I finally started writing three months ago, I think it's one of the best decision I had since a long time ago.\n\nMainly because it's one of the thing that can be completed relatively easily by an intp.\n\nThe book doesn't have to be good, and having low or no expectations really help.
2	This. So very this. 
1	All I ever do. 
1	I thought. I webbed out from that thought. It entertained me for a few moments. I went to another thought or no thoughts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thought is a stupid complicated word.
12	I wish I could use /s in real life	Does anyone else have a hard time with people not realizing your being sarcastic? When im around good friends they can tell but if I say something sarcastic around people I havent known for a while then they just kinda stare at me. Its rough. 
3	Alter a bit you voice and the way you say it, making it seem more like a joke
2	Absolutely. I've learned over the years to crack a smile or give a quick laugh so people know I'm being my normal, sarcastic self and not just a dick.
2	I usually just... *weird hand gestures* "SaRcAsM."
1	Hmm saw that before didnt know what it was for. Try a smile
1	(I) Follow it up with a creepy smile. 
1	Yes you can, if you use just say "/s" after each thing you say. /s
1	My close friends have somehow gotten good at telling when I’m being sarcastic, but I often say “That was sarcasm.” if I feel it was not otherwise clear. 
1	"I'm kidding" and do a little giggle or chuckle or whatever
2	What are your options after you run out of ideas?	Do you ever just overthink something so bad, come up with new plans to solve a problem daily, but the  each solution has a flaw. Try to talk to someone about it but then no one understands you and you eventually run out of people to ask. \n\nWhat options are left? Do you ever charge head on at a problem with no solution? I hate doing that cuz there's too many outcomes possible. \n\nI've been trying to solve a problem for 6 months and can't stop thinking about it. Sometimes I lose my sanity a bit but I never show it because I think I'm good at separating feelings from everything else. 
6	What's the problem?
2	there is infinite shit to think about. Or only if I need to do stuff like taking care of girlfriend or working, or practical stuff in general, that's what I do
1	Sleep.
1	Asking people is the last thing I do if I ever do it, usually I'm solving other people's problems along with mine and I only give up if I get bored or tired. 
3	I feel as if there are many layers to me, and I can peel many layers off.	It is till me there is no escaping the self LOL. Not so bad.
2	I think I have 3 layers. First later is thinking. Second layer is feeling. Third layer is understanding that life is pointless. The 3 layers work together to get things done.\n\nEdit: What do you mean by layers tho?
1	onions do great work
133	I constantly feel like the dumbest and smartest person in the room at the same time	Just like life is so boring but so fun at the same time. I need a new tv show to watch. 
64	Try leaving your room.
15	Watch Russian Doll on Netflix.\n\nAlso, same on both statements.
12	Same, i think its a combination of knowing your capabilites and low self estimate. I tend to fluctuate betwen the two depending on how anxious im feeling
9	Bojack Horseman 
7	Samurai Champloo.
3	IKHYF bro
2	"feel like" - this is the key expression
1	Watch Elite on Netflix. It is great! 
1	It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
1	I’ll take this as a chance to plug HBO’s *The Wire*, if you haven’t seen it already. \n\nI watched it a couple years back and I’m still recommending it at every opportunity, if that says anything. 
1	'The Patriot' on Amazon Prime is one of the best things I've ever seen. Don't judge by the dumb name.\n\nAlso Killing Eve and Ozark.\n\nAlso, [same](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/aj86va/its_difficult_to_know_how_people_will_receive/).
1	If you're alone in that room then you would be correct. 
1	It's actually not strange, I think you can feel both too smart and also too stupid at the same time. That's also how oppression works too, you're both too much and too little at the same time.\n\nSomeone who accepts and lets you really reach for the stars and doesn't hold you back won't make you feel too stupid and they won't make you feel too smart.

2	If you were rich, do you think you'd accomplish more, or less?	Would you say that because you're rich, you'd be able to achieve more in fields that are more obscure because you have enough money to take risks? Or would you say that since you have money, you have no need to really accomplish anything because you have everything you want? Let's assume this is inheritance money, so you didn't work for it previously. \n\nFor me, I think it's the former. Even though I love being lazy, I still feel a small... SMALL desire to make some kind of impact in the world. Of course not on a grand scale. Even if it's just helping some kid ride a bike, I still want to impact someone positively. 
5	i'd be very complacent. i probably would not do anything and waste the money.
3	I inherited a decent sum of money. \n\nI am so complacent because now I see zero reason to work. I'm a university student but I really don't enjoy the degree I'm doing, school just isn't for me. The only thing that really drives me forward is that my ENTJ brother is doing better than me in every way, and I want to prove that I am not useless to the people I love.
2	It’s almost certainly the latter.  People tend to like to think they would accomplish more “if only this” or “if only that”.  People that accomplish things just get things done.  Is there really a reason why you can’t teach a kid how to ride a bike?  It doesn’t take that much time.  And if anything it would make you more productive because you have enertia going and feeling good from doing something positive.  
2	Definitely more. I'd be more inclined to go places and explore and experience if I had money to throw at stores and people.
1	Less, unfortunately. 
1	I am about 12 years into my full time working career, some days I don’t feel like working simply because I know I will be able to live comfortably for x number of years before I have to work again.  But what’s the point of that..\n\nJust set good goals! My few are a sports car by the time I am 30. House and land paid off when I am 45-50. And a vacation home for me and the wifey when I am 55-60. \n\nSometimes with a nest egg built up it is hard to motivate yourself to work every day, but I always think how much better my life will be in 40 years if I make sure I do. I am self employed so it is all the more difficult to get up and work each day, but those long term goals keep me going.\n\nBasically saying my basic instinct is to be lazy the more financially stable I become, but I know that won’t benefit me long term.
1	Definitely less. If I were born rich, I’d be such a different person I’d be hardly recognizable. 
5	What if personalities are BS?	I think about this almost constantly. (side note: I supposedly suffer from moderate depersonalization, so this may be brought on by that) But seriously, does anyone else ever consider that maybe we *don't* have a soul or any truly identifiable traits? Is it possible that we act in situations based on numerous external factors that completely disregard emotion? For instance, how we think others will perceive our response? Not going to lie I hate thinking about this sort of thing bc it makes me feel completely meaningless like an empty sponge, but it seriously haunts me. Anybody else every consider this sort of thing?
3	It doesn't matter that our personality is the result of our surroundings and experiences, it's still our personality and isn't worth less, because we don't experience it as less.\n\nAnd to quote mah man Dumbledor (hopefuly you understand the analogy):  \n\n"Of course it is happening inside your head, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"  
3	Not sure why it would be BS.  Personalities are really just behavioral patterns, including thought processes.  These patterns can change depending on life circumstance, your mood, etc.. Drastic changes can happen, although much more uncommon.  The BS is when you think you have someone all figured out.  I think that's literally impossible, too many variables to account for at a given time (although you can have someone figured out to a very high degree).
1	The depersonalization is completely irrelevant, obv......
1	Or is it those thoughts of determining how to respond that would "define our identities?"
1	I don't think we have a soul. I think we do act purely based on things outside of our control, sort of like a long-winded reflex. I think emotions have purpose as well and they don't randomly appear. However, even though you didn't determine your personality, you still have one and you are under the illusion that you have free will. So I do think we're objectively meaningless, but that shouldn't make you sad. It doesn't change anything about life. You can still find meaning in the things you enjoy.
1	It's just a way to categorize people. It's also not always 100% accurate ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
23	ENTPs = INTPs	
20	"intps are cute / hot"\n\n-No girl to me, ever. 
4	Maybe stop using google then.
1	Hmmm..\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PW4kyZh
1	Theatricalness	every time i get up on a stage or other form of spotlight i become a super charismatic snark machine that rules the crowd. i think this is an intp thing, any similar experiences? 
1	ESFJ unconscious. 
1	Are INTPs the biggest procrastinator among all other types?	If you think you are not a procrastinator, can you pls share some tips? 
7	Procrastination implies things will still be done; xNxPs are likely to never get certain things done. 
5	I'm going to paste my comment that I made last week on a similar subject, hope it benefits you.\n\n> It's not about time management, it's about discipline. Discipline means you have to do what you have to do. Simple, straightforward, no sugarcoating.\n\n> Once you instill in yourself the discipline to do things (or finish things) time won't matter.\n> \n> For example, all my life I wanted to work out, never could stick to it. Something always got in the way; work, relationships, etc. This went on for 15 years.\n> \n> Then, last year, I made a decision that I will simply stick to it, NO excuses. I've been hitting the gym for 10 months now, 5 days a week.\n> \n> This is discipline. Just like a solider has to wake up at 4AM everyday. You think they like it? No, this is discipline. You think I enjoy going to the gym everyday? Most days I'm like "maaaaaaaan do I have to go?" and the answer is immediately "Yes, no excuses".\n> \n> You have to re-program your brain into this way of thinking, think of it as a hack if you want. Once you have discipline, you will achieve.
3	xNxPs in general are big procrastinators 
2	My personal tip: start small and schedule it. I HATE cleaning the house, but I also don't want to live in a dump. So I schedule 10 minutes every morning to clean at 8:00 am before I leave for work. Often times I'll clean for another 5 or 10 minutes beyond that because I'm already on a roll. Do that with whatever you're procrastinating with. \n\n&#x200B;
0	An INTP should brainwash themself.	You should scrub your brain clean. Start as fresh as you can. It will not be square one but it may be something new. It will still be you as much as you would like to think you have changed.
4	So do shrooms? On it. 
0	Do any INTPs out there believe in astrology?	Why or why not?
6	Yes.  I never used to believe in it until I started trying to debunk it cuz my sister was so into it and I hated that.\n\nBut then as I started learning more and more about it and how people suns, moons and venus affect their life I started noticing patterns.\n\nI started being able to guess peoples suns and moons with high accuracy.\n\nI started a spreadsheet to keep track of all my guesses of about 200 people so far over 8 years.\n\nSo far my guess average on Sun sign is 82%.  My guess on moon is about 71%.  \n\nGuessing them together correctly I have about a 65% hit rate. \n\nThis is far far higher than random chance would dictate.  \n\nI am aware that my sample size is quite small still, but I've seen enough proof to say that there is "something" to astrology, otherwise pattern matching peoples signs wouldn't work at all, or should work only about 12% of the time.\n\nHow astrology actually works is beyond me and it likely has nothing to do with the planets/gravity and everything to do with frequency spectrums on the quantum level affecting DNA as we form into beings.  So where the planets were at a certain time causes the suns frequencies to get filtered and DNA acts as an antenna to crystallize that into a strructure/archetype/personality or something along those lines.  Or the planets dont cause it....but they act as markers of the state the system was in when a being was born.\n\nKinda like a white light filtering into rainbows.  White light is pure consciousness and the rainbow colors are the archetypes of personality.   This relates to chakras and all that good stuff as well\n\n
6	No, but I am interested in it because it’s a  thought system and systems are fun
4	I'm open minded about it, personally.\n\nAnd I check my horoscope every day. Lol. 
4	No but I do know most of my chart regardless. It's fun
4	No, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was truth to it. I believe the world is very spiritual, and humans try to explain what are legitimate spiritual experiences by trying to find patterns.
2	No I'm not because I'm cancer and the horoscopes for cancer's seem to cater more towards feelers and emotionally sensitive individuals. I never really identified with the sign tbh.
2	Of course there will be. I don't believe in it although I am not shitting its existence. I mean, if this sort of "structure" is what make other people get shit done, i have nothing against it. Although... like MBTI, you do not live within its constraints.\n\n\nBTW, I am an Aquarian.
2	Numerology which is tied to astrology in some cases. I get a reading every year and it’s been helpful.
2	No, because astrology is stupid. Planets or gravity don't have an impact on your birth, and if they do, it would be constant.
2	I believe that it can help us learn more about ourselves and our tendencies, just as MBTI can. However, I don’t think it is self-defining. Rather than saying I am (star sign) therefore I am (this), I believe that it allows you to self-reflect on your behavior/thought process in a more specific way. For some people, self-reflection is difficult and often not even attempted, whether it is lack of self-awareness or just not knowing where to start. I think reading up on natal charts can help people figure out why they act or think a certain way and how to maybe correct/compensate for it if it is something they find concerning or feel the need to work on.
2	No. If they say they do, they're not INTP.
2	[deleted]
2	I believe that it exists, not that its true.  
8	Do INTPs love to travel??	Hey guys I’m an INTP and I have taken an interested in photography. This interest had led me into wondering and becoming curious of what is out side my town. And now all I would like to do is either stay home and binge watch stuff or do stuff, or go travel and explore to see what is outside California. Is this normal for an INTP? 
9	I like travelling. I enjoy spending time in other countries, off the beaten (tourist) paths, soaking up the feel of different places.\n\nHowever, it's not something I enjoy doing *alone*, and finding someone to travel *with*... isn't quite that simple, being INTP and all that, if you catch my drift.
7	Who cares if it's normal for an INTP? If you want to do it, do it! It's an amazing experience, you're sure to see beautiful things and have awesome stories to tell if you do. \n\nWhere do you want to go? 
5	I like being somewhere different, I don't like travelling tho, the actual movement from point A to point B.
5	I don't know if it's normal, but I myself am fucking *aroused* by the idea of traveling. I've been dicking around on Google Earth for the past few days; zoomin around and checkin out all the wierd little places there are on this planet.            \n\nEntire communities where probably thousands of people live, and here it is on this stupid little screen in front of me.             \nThere are actual people- *conscious fucking* ***beings***- that are just out there, existing.            \nThey've been around for maybe longer than I have, and this is the first time I have ever been aware of their existence.          \nHere I am looking at their stupid little houses on Google Earth, and they have no idea.         \n\nOkay done with that one.            \n\n\**ZOOM THE FUCK UP LIKE IT'S MAGIC OR SOME SHIT**\n\n\**FLY SOMEWHERE ELSE, LIKE* ***GOD***\*\n\n\**ZOOM ON IN ON ANOTHER LITTLE VILLAGE IN AFRICA**\n\nHey there little fuckers. Yeah, I'm lookin atcha. Watcha carryin there? Some big ol leaves? That's cool.            \nAll right then, bye for the rest of both of our fucking lives.\n\n-\n\n...so yeah, I would like to travel.
3	Yes.
2	I love photography and traveling. I haven't had the chance to travel alone yet, but it's definitely something I crave.
2	Yes, especially alone
2	I think the secret to INTP growth is to Ne yourself.  Be brave, get out there, you'll do great - you're an INTP after all.
2	Before age 21: What's the deal with everyone's fetish for traveling? Who cares? Everything I'm interested in exploring is right in front of me.\n\nAge 21 and after: Travel's cool
1	Yes, but at the same time I have 0 ability to come up with somewhere to go.
1	I love to travel. *figuratively*\nThrough internet and the books I've read.\nKek.
1	Only indoors
1	I love to travel. It offers experiences that can not be parrelelled in books. One cannot understand a culture until they experience it first hand. Traveling has really opened up my understanding of why people make some of the decisions that they do.
1	Well, this one does. I don't think this is an INTP thing, though.   \n\n\nAlso, stop questioning whether you want to do this and just go somewhere. You won't regret it. The world has an infinite amount of brain food in it. Treat yourself to the buffet.
1	Yeah I solo travelled for a bit and I'm an intp, but being an intp doesn't really have anything to do with it
