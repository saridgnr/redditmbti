367	Your ISTP Care And Handling User Guide And Manual	##**Your ISTP Care And Handling User Guide And Manual**\n*****\n\n**Congratulations! You have found yourself in possession of your own unique ISTP unit. Or rather, it has found its current situation agreeable for the time being. Since ISTPs are notoriously difficult to understand, we have issued this guide to help you along the way.**\n\n###**Getting Started**\n*****\nYour ISTP unit should arrive pre-activated and ready to solve problems. In case your ISTP has not been activated please complete the following:\n\n1. Place ISTP in a quiet setting.\n\n2. Point out 1-3 problems or things you do not understand. \n\n3. Wait 30 seconds.\n\n4. If after 30 seconds your ISTP unit has not activated, asking your ISTP to “Open up more emotionally” will immediately activate Flight Mode (though this is not recommended).\n \n\n###**Care and Maintenance:**\n*****\n1.	Your ISTP unit does not require any direct care, supervision or maintenance, and will be happiest left to its own devices. \n2.	Efforts to assist your ISTP will be met with annoyance and could possibly void your warranty.\n3.	If you give your ISTP rules to follow, you should take care to explain why they are in place. You should also expect that if they are inane rules, they will not be followed.\n\n###**Interpreting Your ISTP**\n*****\nAt some point you may say to yourself, “I wonder what my ISTP is thinking?” Here is a short guide on how to interpret your unit’s words and actions.\n\n>**[Silence]**\n\nYour unit is likely thinking through a problem, contemplating its surroundings, or is thinking about nothing at all. Do not worry, this is normal.\n\n>**“I’m fine.”**\n\nYour unit is fine. Do not worry, this is normal.\n\n>**“I need some time alone.”**\n\nGive your unit time to recharge. If you recently subjected your ISTP to an intense or prolonged period of social interaction, this should be expected. However, frequent abuse of your ISTP’s limited social engagement function is not recommended and can void the warranty.\n\n>**[Shared experience]**\n\nThis is as close to your ISTP as you will likely get. Willingly participating in an activity together is one of your ISTP’s primary methods of communicating fondness.\n\n###**Software**\n*****\nYour ISTP comes pre-programmed with the following abilities/traits:\n\n+ Remains calm in urgent and stressful situations.\n\n+ Reliably grounded, realistic, and pragmatic.\n\n+ Ability to be a “Fly on the wall”\n\n+ +10 Tinkering Skills\n\n+ +10 Logic\n\n+ +10 Feelings Resistance\n\n \n\n###**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n>*Does my ISTP actually like me? It’s getting hard to tell and it won’t respond when I try talking to it.*\n\nProbably, especially if your unit willingly chooses to spend time around you. Try not to talk so much.\n\n>*Help! I think my ISTP is broken!*\n\nYour ISTP is not broken. Due to its natural ability to overanalyze and rationalize (sometimes to an unhealthy degree), your unit may be stuck in its “WTF Years”. Give it time to grow, and offer encouragement when needed.\n\n>*Can I keep it?*\n\nUnfortunately that depends on the model. If your ISTP goes missing for an extended period of time it is possible that you have accidentally activated your ISTP’s aversion to commitment. However, with some models this feature has been omitted, in which case you might be able to keep your unit for the entirety of its expected lifespan.\n\n**Congratulations on your new ISTP unit and we wish you many years of interesting experiences!**\n\n*****\n*****\n(This post was heavily inspired by [this](http://thoughtcatalog.com/sarah-brady-wagner/2016/05/your-enfp-care-and-handling-user-guide-and-manual/) guide to ENFPs. I thought it was amusing, but a little too long. Mine is shorter and obviously specific to ISTPs. Hope you enjoyed it!)
101	Beautiful. Can we sticky this and just refer relationship threads here?
36	This here is a high quality post! Humorously written with a lot of actual good advice. Mark this ISTP approved!
21	Okay. Time to shut down any and all MBTI related threads. This one is the hands down winner!
13	this should be given to out to our SOs -_-
14	Well played! Commended.
12	Thank you for this! From an INFJ who thinks her ISTP is not really fine when he says "I'm fine". 
9	I want to send this to my co-workers.
9	Oh, ok. That would have been nice to know before I broke mine. 
10	this is fantastic
9	I found this excellent enough to say that it is excellent. 
9	Give the ISTP tools, but be wary as a juvenile ISTP unit may disassemble devices (like a tv remote) and not know how to reassemble.
7	hehe.  I really liked this.  good job.
6	(tear forming). you get me.
7	Late to the party ofc but jesus this is the most helpful shit i've ever read to understanding this girl lol. INFP here but so glad to see that it's not that she doesnt like me (or maybe it is) it's just how she shows fondness. *mind blown* now i know to stfu and enjoy this shit
7	Phenomenal
5	lmao love this
5	Fucking A man, thanks for the laugh.
5	Spot on
6	I laughed at every characteristic you laid out.  It's like you know me better than I do.
4	I laffed\n\nwhy can't our sticky be this funny? :(
5	INFJ here who has spent most of the last decade in a whirlwind relationship with an ISTP. You NAILED it. Sometimes it's easy to forget some of these things about him. Awareness of these behaviors/tendencies & a solid understanding of their innateness is key to keeping your ISTP long-term. 
3	Thanks for the read, quite enjoyed it. 
3	Bravo!
3	Yes! this is too accurate. Great work.
3	So true!
3	This made my day as an ISTP. Best thing I've read all week :)
3	this is hilariously on point! love it!!
3	How long is an extended period of time?
3	Wish I had seen this sooner. If my ex had it maybe we'd still be in a relationship. \n\nI may just print some of these out to give to new people I meet. 
3	This would have saved me SO much grief over the past 2 years.
2	By far the greatest post I have ever seen on this sub 
2	I really enjoyed this, thank you.
2	Really wish I had access to this guide several years ago! I took my ISTP apart trying to 'figure the unit out'. I don't think it ever got put back together quite right. Whoops...
1	Damn... I wish there was one of these for /r/ISTJ
-3	Still too long
-2	Yo, can we get stuff like this for some of the other, superior MBTI types?
15	I have a question about ISTPs and conversations, and especially explaining, and responding to things.	When you guys answer someone’s questions do you sometimes say more then you need to, or if your explaining something give more details then needed? I’m thinking about not saying to much, and doing short responses from now on I think people would like that, because there’s less to think about.\nAnd what function would be responsible for to long of responses?
15	I try to answer the question completely and accurately, and sometimes that takes more words than they were expecting. But I love imparting knowledge, and want to see the person now have complete understanding.  Why is the Sun yellow? Well, let's discuss black-body radiation and Rayleigh scattering!\n\nI also sometimes assume the person knows nothing of what I explain, and will get too basic. I've spent too much time in IT.
13	I'm the complete opposite - I tend to under-explain and assume that they understand more than they do. This is a recurring issue in my relationship because I hate explaining things (also because I'm bad at it, and my patience wears thin quickly) 
6	Yes, i tend to get excited when I explain something and tend to give maybe unnecessary details. But I think that in most cases, people enjoy the way I give explanations to them. 
4	Is it something I'm really into like one of my hobbies? If so, I may accidentally just keep talking and rambling on and forgetting to check the other side that they aren't getting bored or disinterested.\n\nIs it something that isn't? Usually short responses. Great at work when things needs to get done, and they will ask more details if they really need it.\n\nNot great in social situations. This is probably where people think I don't want to talk to them. It isn't that at all. I'm sure many of us find small talk not engaging. They will literally have to drive it to keep things going-- ask more details, different subject, etc.. I'm not very good amount remembering that sometimes I should ask the same thing back. I'm trying to work on being better at this, and a good tip I read was to just ask them exactly the short response back as a question. They will automatically expand on it which hopefully will lead to something deeper.
4	If a question has many permutations, or layers of detail that I suspect may be unknown to the questioner, I may either ask additional questions to clarify the specific point of interest, or, if I feel like I can tie it all up coherently, I may answer those permutations as I go to give the most complete answer.\n\nAs I turn this around in my head, a lot of how I choose to answer routine questions is predicated upon my initial appraisal of the questioner and the question. I tend to respond not so well to things I've already tagged #obvious or #easilysearchable and tend to be a bit of a curt asshole even to people I probably should be more humble toward.\n\nHope that gets at something you were interested in.
3	Yes, because I feel if I dont I won't give all the info needed. It's a balancing act for sure.
3	I am generally extremely brief, even when I know people expect more. \n\nI am only more verbose if it is a subject about feelings, and I literally dont know what i think/feel about the subject, so I try to work it out as i go, using myself or people as a soundingboard.\n\n\n
2	Depends who I am talking to. To people I don't care about, I talk too little. To people I care about, I talk too much. 
2	Whenever people ask me a question I ask if they want the "short answer" or the "long answer".
2	I suck at explaining, so I don’t.
1	Yea it’s always something you’d never expect 
1	Were you always brief ?
1	I usually give short responses and then have to explain myself a ton cause no one can understand what I'm saying.. Unfortunately, it's not always their fault either. I just suck at explaining things. >.>
1	yeah, it's probably Ti and Ni. the more we think about an idea, the more we can write about it. Ne sounds like it would be better for writing because it comes up with more information, but NTPs are more likely to entertain several ideas without coming to any conclusion. also why intjs write reddit essays that nobody reads
64	Feelings... my nemesis.	
3	Ha. Though, it's okay to feel.
2	Technically its your inferior lel
8	I started a new job and am having trouble interacting with coworkers.	About a month ago I (f/20/istp) got my first job as a QC Technician. Meaning I basically go around telling people when they're doing their job wrong. That's not a problem for me. But what is a problem, is getting to know and interacting with people. Apparently people have been talking 'behind my back' about how I rarely talk or interact with them. How they don't know anything about me. And the little they do know, was 'info they worked hard to get.' \nMy SIL works in the same place but at HR. They've asked her if she has gotten to know me (they don't know we're family). She told my mom about how I behave at work, ie I don't talk to my coworkers. And my mom told me that I should talk to them but obviously not get too personal. \n\nWhat exactly am I supposed to talk about then?\n\n I have at least 2min and at most 5 min of interaction with them while doing my rounds. I don't understand what they expect me to say to them during that time. I also don't feel like I'm being rude to them or at least not intentionally. \nAlso most of my coworkers are at least 7 years my seniors. I can't seem to relate to anyone at work. \n\nLmao I hope this post isn't too clustered. 
8	Try reading "how to make friends and influence people."\n\nPeople like you using their names, asking about things they enjoy, etc. \n\nI really find small talk boring as fuck but will use it here and there to grease the wheels.
4	I have found that the majority of the population is obsessed with small talk. It really is the best way to get most people to like you, even though it's a pointless waste of time. 
5	If it's your job to get them to do their job correctly I don't see why it matters if they like you, what they know about you, or what they say behind your back. Screw 'em. Do your job well and go home.
4	How to Get my ISTP back	Okay. so Im an ENFP 23F, and he’s an ISTP 25M. We worked together for 2 years and apparently he really liked me but I had no idea and was dating someone else at the time. Well last spring I broke up with the guy I was dating and ISTP coworker dude finally asks for my number after asking a mutual friend if she thought he had a chance. It was cute. Unfortunately I had already made plans to work a seasonal job for 6 months and we only had less than a month together before I left. \n\nI really liked him and he seemed to really like me too and we hung out almost every day and the sex was amazing and he was always so sweet and kind. He definitely seemed a little guarded however and I learned he had just gotten out of a 3 year relationship (and had a death in his close family a year ago). He talked about the future a lot, wanted to meet my family, and we made plans to travel together when I got back. He was really sad about me leaving. Well I left, we barely talked the entire time, but when I said I was headed back he started texting saying he was excited to see me again and hoped we could pick up where we left off. I got back, everything was really great, and then I told him I was traveling out of the country for a few weeks but then I would be back for good. He seemed miffed by that and made a joke that this wouldn’t work out bcs I travelled too much. He also didn’t want to hook up the week I was back saying he wanted to take slow things down and get to know me better. \n\nI left on my trip, and he ghosted me when I got back. A few months later I texted to wish him a happy new years, and he texted back apologizing and saying I deserved better than that (thanks, I did). Since then he’s been breadcrumbing, texting hey and such but never replies when I reply (he’s always been a shit texter though).  Recently I asked when I could pick up my stuff just to officially end things so I could move on with my life (bcs his last text said that he was keeping my stuff safe for whenever I wanted to get it) but he didn’t answer.  Anyways is there any chance he still likes me and is there any possibility we could still date in the future? I really liked him and I’m sad bcs I feel like we barely got to know each other but I feel like he’s dealing with a lot of stress at work and just life in general. Any insight would be appreciated. I’m so confused as to what’s going on in his brain. \n\nTLTR: Dated an ISTP for a month, traveled for 7 months, came back and he ghosted, but he keeps breadcrumbing and I’m so confused. does he want to end things or not? Is there still a possibility I can get him back? 
12	If this was me and I was acting the way he was, here's what I think my reasoning would be: he really, really likes you. Always has. But your travelling is incompatible with what he wants for the two of you. Knowing it probably wouldn't work, he writes you off into the "this isn't gonna work" bucket.\n\nEvery now and then, he gets a bug up his butt, remembers how much he likes you, and reaches out. Only to remember his previous categorization of you (as not going to work), and backs off. \n\nI think he loves with the idea of being with you, but doesn't actually want to be with you because of the problems it causes. I think he also wants you to be close to him (like, as in, not travelling), but he doesn't want to hold you back from it if it's important to you, hence, "you're better off with someone else [meaning -- someone who can handle your travelling better]".\n\nI think this is an ISTP thing, we're very easy to decide things about people and ourselves and we're very stubborn to stick with them. Right or wrong.\n\nIf you truly want to "win him back", I think the thing that is going to make the most difference is how much effort you put into it. Put all you got into him, be sure to ask what he wants and don't settle for him shrugging you off. Keep asking. He might just be "interest checking" to see if you're actually serious about this.\n\nJust keep in mind that you may not actually be able to win him back. If he's decided that you two are never going to work out, that may be where it ends. But try the effort angle first.
3	If any type wants to be available, they will. He doesn't. Move on. This is not an ISTP thing. Unfortunately ppl get confused and look to types for an explanation when every type will show interest if it is there.
2	ask him if he wants to try and have a relationship
32	Annoying an ISTP	Is it just me, but when a person purposely tries to piss me off (e.g. Like ppl looking at me with this fucked up look and then cutting the cake in the shitiest way possible) it doesn't work. It just meh, like okay idc, you except a reaction out of me and you aren't going to get it. \n\nBut when they do it unconsciously I suddenly become a pissed off 40 yr old Italian man.\nE.g. pointing at the thing with palm up "eh wtf, why u gotta do it like that, just do it like this (shows them how)" \n
31	being genuinely annoyed when witnessing inefficiency vs not being phased when someone is intentionally trying to piss you off
10	I'm perhaps one of the most patient people on Earth when it comes to dealing with people.  Inanimate objects on the other hand, will feel my wrath very quickly should they not comply with my wishes.
4	I don't get pissed off by people usually, I get pissed off over things that I can't fix but have to deal with.
3	Well I did read that in an Italian voice, so you must be right.
1	are you me?\n\nThis is exactly how I am. Like, I'm so contrarian that if someone is trying to get a rise out of me, I won't let them. But if someone is obtuse, it drives me nuts.
1	Ha ha, yes
1	Yeah I can easily spot the asshole and that just rolls right off but I am totally the Jimmy Fallon IT guy character from SNL... MOVE.
0	Yeah most people walk around with no idea of their surroundings. It pisses me off a lot. These people are so lucky that society exists because I think they would die in a dangerous situation where they had to pay attention. There's a lot of pickpockets around my school and I honestly am fine with them picking these unobservant people's pockets. If they don't want their pockets picked they need to get a clue
2	ISTP professional coders: which aspect do you prefer to work in?	The frontend UI/UX, tweaking layouts and colour schemes to produce functional and aesthetic interfaces?\n\nThe backend cogs, gears, and databases?\n\nTesting and fixing, hunting down bugs to work the cause of failure?\n\nReverse engineering legacy code?
3	\#5, taking a problem and creating a novel algorithm to solve it. But I usually have to deal with #2-#4.
2	2 and 4 are more to my strengths. \n\nI'm not good at creating aesthetics. I can tweak and improve aesthetics, but if I were to do it from scratch, it would look like something that begrudgingly goes on a fridge. I am good with user experience/application flow though.
1	I'm most interested in troubleshooting the cause of a failure. I'm not a "coder" by trade, but I do something similar all day most days and it keeps me interested.\n\nI also have an interest in properly normalizing a database and efficient code and whatnot, but also those things are often at odds with: "I could spend 3 days trying to make the most perfect thing, or I could spend 20 minutes, get it working "good enough" and spend those other days on something that matters more". The latter usually wins because interest in efficiency also encompasses "how much can I get done with my limited amount of time".
8	hello, how is your sex drive?	also... are you kinky? or do you like vanilla?\n\nor maybe strawberry.. 
7	High.\n\nI'm pretty kinky. I'm into intensity, would be a good way to describe it. \n\nI don't have any fetishes though, just a long list of things that turn me on. \n\nI'm mostly into pretty vanilla things like bdsm, cnc, and rough sex. \n\nThe most depraved thing I'm into is cuddling
7	Single is how I would describe it
3	Insatiable, and [varied](https://imgur.com/HLghB8y).
3	pretty low, but that's partially due to stimulant abuse. i don't really have any interesting fetishes
2	Medium to pretty high I guess? Depending on mood and if I'm single or not 
2	Awful.  But I am on medication that lowers libido. 
2	Sky high.\n\nAlso dungeons.\n\nEnough said.
1	High
0	What , why
5	Any speed readers?	Right now I’m learning to speed read. Many think speed reading is “skimming” but actually it involves 100% comprehension. There are some readers who can read 400 pg books in an hour or less. I feel that this skill would be the most beneficial for anyone. Do you speed read?
6	no. i can speed read and i do for things i don't care about, but if i'm reading a book it takes me like two minutes to read a page
1	I am not diagnosed, but i think im dyslexic. I do skim a lot. I really wish I could speed read.
1	I can do less than 30 seconds per page, and I’ve read over a thousand books 
9	how do you guys appear or act in a setting where you are comfortable? how about when you are uncomfortable?	I'm getting real interested in the ISTP's.
18	Comfortable: quiet with occassional funny/witty observation humor/topic. Might get deep without warning.\n\nUncomfortable: quiet with weird fidgetty moves that signals "i want to get the fuck outta here"\n\n
2	Well depending on whether I'm uncomfortable because of fear or disgust I leave the situation or maybe figure out why I'm uncomfortable and fix it instead if possible. Sometimes you need to get out of your comfort zone though and push through with courage.
1	More comfortable = more talking/more engaged. The opposite would be in the corner watching and not interacting, or if I can't wallflower, simple yes/no responses.
1	When I’m comfortable, razor wit, salty jokes, extroverted-like\nUncomfortable- silent, invisible for the most part
15	ENFJ (Male) trying to figure out my ISTP crush (Female)	Met this girl in my class back in July and had a crush on her ever since. We hung out a few times during the summer (just the two of us) and I noticed she was quiet, didn't say much and was not super open and most people would describe her as hard to get to know. I asked her friend at the time if she was looking for a relationship and she said no. After that, I started hanging out with her in groups. I noticed though that whenever I would ask her to do something, she would always say yes or have a legit excuse\n\nFast forward a couple months, I ask her out. She initially said yes but then texted me saying that she recently got out of a long term relationship but she still wanted to go as friends. We went ice skating/dinner/bar and had a great time. She was more open, wanted to get to know me more and overall I felt closer to her.\n\nWe continued to hang for a while and doing more couple like activities (Breakfast then library/nature trail, watching the lunar eclipse together on a blanket). Her texting habits got better, she even texted me first a couple of times which almost never happened. Eventually, she invited me to do stuff with her friends too and I thought things were good.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, my friends and I saw her on dating apps and which lead me to assume she was ready for something. Her profiles on there and very little pictures and no descriptions what so ever so I'm not sure how serious it was.\n\nSo i decided to ask her out via phone and she said that she's inclined to say yes but she does not want a relationship. When asked if it was me or her situation she stated that she enjoys spending time with me but does not want anything right now. Currently, I'm trying to calm my feelings before I can be friends with her again. When I mentioned to her the dating apps, she said that she was on there for a week when she was most over school but deleted the app.\n\nAs an ENFJ who is completely opposite to you guys, I just wanted to know if this is normal ISTP behavior and I'm still trying to gage a sense of what she is thinking. I'm not sure if she was being honest with me or just trying to spare my feelings by not flat out rejecting me. Is an ISTP super adamant about that kind of stuff?\n\nTL;DR\nENFJ guy likes ISTP girl. Hung out with her multiple times. Asked her out and she said inclined to say yes and does enjoy spending time with me but does not want a relationship.\n\nEDIT: Essentially, I misread her subtle increase in openness and availability as a clue she was interested in a relationship.
19	honestly with istp’s, take what we say at face value. we are known for being noncommittal so if she tells you she doesn’t really want to be in a relationship right now, it’s as simple as that. \n\npersonally i’ve been interested in many guys before and haven even gotten really close romantically to them, but i’ve never really looked for anything serious (making sure to make that clear from the get go as to not lead anyone on). \n\nif you’re genuinely interested in this girl, i suggest continuing to spend time with her and see if she warms up to the idea of a relationship, but don’t force anything as it would only be met with hostility. 
11	Hmm. So I've never exactly been in this situation but I'll say this. I was friends with an istj and I knew he liked me.. But I wasn't interested in a relationship with him at the time so I kept our friendship... Off and on. He was probably my closest friend but I just wouldnt always keep up the friendship because I knew he liked me and it didn't seem right or fair to essentially lead him on.  I didn't have absolutely no interest though. If I had absolutely no interest, I probably woulda cut him off permanently. Fast forward several years, and I'm now happily married to the guy. 
6	Shes probably not beating around the bush. \n\nAs a sidenote, I've known a few ENFJs and I've gotten along well with all of them but couldn't ever imagine dating them or spending extended periods of time with them. 
1	You should probably take what she says at face value, however, my best friend is an ISTP and she has a huge crush on one of her classmates, but she actually told him she would never date him (by accident; long story. In reality, she literally cries over not being with him when she’s alone. I don’t know if that behavior applies to all ISTPs, but that’s just an example I thought of.
1	This has been the thing with me and this ENFJ male I've known for almost 5 years. I'm very open with him to the point of actually entertaining a relationship with him. Heck we even recently talked about sex and what we preferred. He snapped out the last time and hated me for leading him on. He's frustrated for a long time, and I could understand. We didn't talk for almost 6 months. He went on a few dates, and I did as well. Those dates didn't work, and we're now talking again. WTF. He's very appealing, but my life is a mess and needs some personal hardwork.. I don't mind talking to him on this level. When my life gets better, I'd definitely take a move. He's been very patient all these years.
1	yeah this sounds about right. She probably is considering it because you approached her but because it's not something she was interested in to begin with she probably considers a relationship low priority and is focused on other things right now. ISTPs can be kind of hot or cold while they are juggling what their motivations are at the moment. I did the exact same thing with the dating apps before. I made the profile just to see what was there and to see if there was anyone on there I thought was worth considering a relationship. Not really digging it i deleted it after a week and decided i wasn't interested again. 
2	What are some real life examples contrasting INTP problem solving method vs ISTP problem solving?	Title
10	There are none. INTPs create problems.
4	Friendships with ISFJs?	My best friend since childhood is an ISTP and I’m an ISFJ. I’m just wondering if these types are known to get along and what your experience with ISFJs have been?
6	I generally really like them, I'm dating an isfj at the moment. Sweet people (most of the time)
3	My sister who raised me and is my best friend is and isfj. 
9	I hate these questions. Look, you've been friends since childhood? I'm gonna assume you get along. Doesn't matter what type they are.
2	One of my most favourite colleagues is an ISFJ. It's always easy to talk to her. She doesn't make silly jokes and she understands what I want to say even when I can't explain it that well. She is so well-organised and puts her 100% into her work. If you need to get something sorted, she's the best person for the job. She easily gets annoyed when her project is stuck because someone in our team isn't doing their job (which I like because no one else seems to care).\n\nShe's by far the only ISFJ I have ever met but she does give me a very positive impression of her type. I know that everyone is different but we're talking about ISFJ in general here.\n\nAlso I've read somewhere that ISTP is the type that supports ISFJ very well. I don't remember the details but theoretically we compliment each other. This colleague of mine is one of the very few people I intend to keep in touch after I leave this job (which is a huge thing for an ISTP. We tend to forget about people as soon as they go out the door). So, yeah, I think we get along nicely :) 
2	My cousin who's one of my best friends is an ISFJ. 
4	If introverted functions have a "final state" then how does its position really affect it at all?	If we talk about Ti as an equation function, then it should have some "final state." For example Te says : gravity on earth is 9.8 m/s. Ti says force of gravity=(mass of planet)/(volume of planet) or some other bullshit.\n\nEssentially, Ti can eventually reach THE true model for gravity that will be representative of every future Te measurement. Just like any theory eventually is correct though unverified. Once Ti hits that "one true theory" it has nowhere to go.\n\nIf that's true, then why would inferior Ti be any different than dominant Ti? Yes the dominant Ti might reach it first because they are primarily focused on understanding Ti models, but if the inferior Ti user learns the models from the Ti dominant, what makes them any different?\n\nSimilarly, how does your Ni in yourself compare to an inferior Ni if both have achieved the "end state"\n\nIs the inferior function in direct opposition to the dominant? I.e. tertiary can still serve the dominant supportively, but the inferior directly causes the user to not only be stressed but also to be slowed down in the use of their dominant?
7	What are you looking for exactly with your recent posts to ENTP, INTP, and here? What's an end result that will satisfy these posts?
2	I think you are over-complicating things too much. Go have a good read through [Psychological Types](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm) and you'll realize that all Jung talks about is definitions of functions and how they are expressed through the two attitudes.  \nThe difference between introverted thinking and extraverted thinking is that introversion is an attitude focused on making judgments based on an internal standard (aka following your "rules"; an evolutionary adaptation of preserving the self) and extraversion is an attitude focused on making judgments based on an external standard (aka following "the rules"; an evolutionary adaptation of propagating yourself in the world). The Te user obeys the laws of society and the Ti user makes his own laws. And here we see the first problem with the ego - that of relying to heavily on one function. If you rely too much on Te you become someone that never thinks for themself and becomes a sheep to the rules even if they don't make any sense. If you rely too much on Ti then you become someone that often gets into trouble with the law and can't integrate into society because you don't understand that you have to follow rules. It is only through a process of individuation do we learn how to use the repressed functions and our psyche becomes balanced.\nSince they are in the same realm of thinking, you often find that Ti types use Te a lot and vice versa. This is something Carl Jung talked about and is why I believe the 5th and 6th functions are actually stronger than the 3rd and 4th.  \nIf you're talking about the tertiary function, keep in mind that it is repressed by the auxiliary function so it's not actually that strong. Ti represses Fe just as much as Fi. However, the Ti user never uses Fi because their internal judging is done with logic not feeling, so their feeling standard is rarely internal and only ever comes from the external world.  \nAnd then things are more complicated when you start talking about "loopers" and how your interpret Jung's explanation of the auxiliary function.
2	Life time is not infinite.
1	A mind with perfect knowledge would likely continue testing new information against the perfect knowledge to ensure it holds up, so the knowledge wouldn't change once it's perfect but the mind would still process information surrounding it\n\nHighly unlikely a single human mind could develop perfect knowledge in a lifetime\n\nBut as a hypothetical the perfect knowledge in one mind would obviously be the same as the perfect knowledge in another mind... because it is perfect...
45	Really don't know how to talk to most people	Like it seriously baffles me, how do people have conversations, long in-depth conversations about their bus route, or their trip to the doctor's office, or some other mundane thing? It's like, I have nothing to say, Idk how people do it.
40	I was like that once, but then i just don't anymore. Don't know how though, the skill just...clicked...\n\nI think its because I watch how people interact for so long that i subconsciously knows how to act now...observe, copy, and adjust kind of thing.\n\nDamn i sound like a sociopath trying to pass as a normal human...
16	Maybe it's not that you don't know how to talk to people. Those topics you listed down just isn't very interesting and some people like talking for the sake of talking. That's not us.  It's fine, you be you, let them be them. There's no need to force yourself to engage in conversations you think are boring.  \n\nTypical solution (if you consider your situation a problem or bothersome), you just have to find people you have common interests with and connect with and the conversation could possibly go on for hours. 
5	I doubt these are *in depth* conversations. \nI'd rather opt out of hearing mundane details of someone's life, and don't find interesting recounting mine. \nIt's ok. You'll tak with fewer people about something that is of interest to you. 
5	Practice. \n\nNot everyone gets proficient in all the socio-emotional skills growing up. \nNBD, you recognize a skill you lack proficiency in, congratulations on your self-awareness, seriously.\n\nNow you have the agency to either maintain your current skill level or take steps, no rush, to improve.\n\nThat said I dont know how people get up at 4am to run & I'm not interested in improving that skill at all. 
3	Do you feel bad because of that? Would you actually like to talk with random stranger about your bus route? Would that actually make you happier?  \nStay yourself, find meaningful connections with people that share your interests. Conversation will just start itself. If you wan't to learn a chit-chat, it's possible, but is this your goal at the end?   \n
3	Small talk is the worst thing in the world. Or being alone in a room with a crying person...
2	ask people questions about themselves. have hobbies, know interesting stuff to talk about, make jokes. conversations just kinda flow naturally. \n\ni used to feel similar to you, but the more i just got out and met tons of people, the easier it became and now it doesn't bother me.\n\n
2	Same way, fuck it. Talk about what you need to talk about, and dip
2	Yeah, I really feel like an asshole sometimes because I just don’t give a fuck about anything people say. It’s like yeah we’ve talked about this before what more is there to say? But I don’t actually say that, I just nod my head and say Mmhm.
2	99% of the time, people are complaining about something. They need to turn their annoying day or their annoying acquaintance into an epic poem about the trials and tribulations of their life, and it doesn't take much effort from there to keep babbling about it. Nobody has long in-depth conversations about how great their bus ride was or how they didn't have to wait long at all to see the doc.
2	They're not *in depth* conversations.  They're just long ones.  If you actually listen to them, they end up repeating themselves over and over again.  It works because neither of them is actually listening to each other.  They're just waiting for their turn to talk.\n\nI used to work with a couple of people that were also just terrible storytellers.  They would relay every irrelevant detail of an event and totally miss the cues when people's eyes would start to glaze over.\n\nIf I'm in a situation where I can't just walk away, I've become really good at inserting random noises to make it seem like I'm engaged in the conversation.  "Hmm." "Interesting."  "Really?"  "Huh."  "Is that so?"
2	You don't-an INTP\n\nUnless I have a joke to say I don't speak. The point of conversation is to enjoy it, and I am not particularly seeking out any knowledge. Humor is enjoyable though so I use it when I observe something and think of something funny
2	My (ISTP) husband and I have times like this when we go out to dinner and just sit and eat and stare at each other. I can talk about theoretical things with people who are interested in such topics but he's typically not, and neither of us care about our trip to the doctor's office or something comparable.  It's not really necessary to do this unless you have a job that requires schmoozing. 
4	Men and women range themselves into three classes or orders of intelligence; you can tell the lowest class by their habit of always talking about persons; the next by the fact that their habit is always to converse about things; the highest by their preference for the discussion of ideas.\n\nCharles Stewart

21	Do you ISTPs find that if your irritated or mad about something, that it people can tell by your face and eyes even if you try to hide it ?	
50	Honestly the moment I stop fake being social they think I'm mad.
26	I find most think I'm mad even when I'm not. So they're bound to be right at some point. 
7	Lol, much like what others said, I frequently look mad. I do make a conscious effort to look friendly, and am pretty good at it by now.. but if I, for instance, start thinking or feel extra tired, everyone thinks I'm mad. It's just my default face I guess. Usually if people actually successfully peg me as mad, I wanted them to... or they caught me off completely off guard and it accidentally leaked through. If I want to hide it, I usually can. 
4	Where I'm from everyone walks around with a mad/irritated look on their faces, so I fit in just fine haha. But actually, I'm hardly ever actually mad or irritated about anything and I'm very good at covering it up, so no one really notices / cares to notice (because when almost everybody looks pissed, this look later gets understood as the "normal" look, and it's not worth talking about it). 
4	Not really, more like the opposite - people think I'm mad when I'm really not.
4	People can usually tell because I don't bother hiding it.
8	YOU'RE, NOT YOUR.
3	My face is basically a slab of stone except for positive emotions. And even then I generally have to choose to express facially. What’s funny is it’s even true when I get drunk/high. So while all my friends get giggly, I can sit there stone faced and nobody is able to get a muscle to twitch on my face. I love doing it to my best friend when he’s high because it drives him insane. I stare through his soul and it makes him so uncomfortable LOL.

14	WTF years	So I havent seen a wtf years post in a while and seeing them for the first time on here actually helped me out a bit, so I thought I should add to the pile.\n\nI'm a 22 year old guy in his last year of college studying software development, and honestly hate the course at this point. I feel like getting the degree and never working in software because of the 9-5 in an office or looking at code on a screen all day. All motivattion has left me and even the famous istp "do assignment at last second balls to the wall" approach is just an unreachable state right now. \n\nI plan on traveling to Australia after I finish, and just doing physical work like picking fruit or construction for a year, while doing the one thing I reliably like, travel.\n\nMy problem is trying to figure out what else I want to do for a job in the future. I have a lot of other interests like engineering, art, sketching, reading, endlessly researching pointless topics on the internet, and more.\n\nThe problem is finding a decent job that I enjoy, I used to like programming more but now that I know what it will be like working in an office (a highly structured, regimented environment) , I get a little sick each time I imagine going in every day.\n\nIs there a chance to use your brain and body as a career in this world or do I have to pick one? 😅\n\nAny advice/guidance is welcome, \nAnd to all you istp software workers out there, is it as bad as I imagine? How do you deal?\n\n
7	With programming i think it depends on the size of team you are working in. Where i work, i am in a team of three where each of us has pretty much complete autonomy when making changes or adding new functionality. The only requirements for any piece of work are \n\n1:it does what it is supposed to\n\n2: it doesn't break anything existing\n\nThis will of course not always be the case with the rise of project 'managers', change advisory boards and other well meaning administrative processes that mainly seem to slow everything down.
9	Be advised, if you get married and have kids, a stable paycheck becomes much more motivating.
4	Not all programming jobs are like that. Just need to find one you like. 
5	Some programming jobs are highly technical, others are just about writing simple code and bringing in a bit of creativity to build websites for example.\nOn top of that, not all offices are emotionless hell holes. Some are quite fun places with cool people all working together.\n\nOn top of that, not all programming jobs are in offices! If you get lucky you can work remotely and be sitting in the beaches of Indonesia or the mountains of Switzerland while you code!\n\nBut also.. coding is not for everyone. Good luck!
3	I'm a 23-year-old data scientist, not a software engineer but similar type of work. Honestly, I nothing my job. I don't love it, I don't hate it. I work in a 9-5 office staring at a computer screen, and I deal with an unbelievable amount of corporate bullshit. But I get left alone a lot, sometimes my work is really interesting, and I get paid way more than I deserve.  \nI feel like I recently turned a corner and climbed out of my WTF years. I spent a lot of college thinking that I'd made a mistake and I was gonna hate my career. It turns out there's more to life than just your job, especially if you have money. I work so that when I'm not at work I can do all sorts of fun shit. I also have enough saved up so that if one day I can't take it anymore, I can up and quit my job and not worry for a while.  \nI would say graduate and take whatever programming job you can find that looks not-awful. If you hate it, quit and get a different job, the job market for software devs is great. If it turns out you hate all programming jobs, then by all means quit and move to Australia.
3	>Is there a chance to use your brain and body as a career in this world or do I have to pick one?\n\nThe trades might be a decent option - Electrician, plumber, welder etc. You'll likely still end up with a rigid schedule though, and no hope of working remotely. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think it's more realistic to aim for a job that you can tolerate vs. one that is deeply fulfilling. Software seems like a very wise choice if you take care of your physical health in your free time. It might turn out great if you can trudge through a couple rough years to get to a remote position. 30-year-old you might be very happy you made the sacrifice. \n\nThe WTF Years article seems to suggest that you'll find some ideal path in your 20's and live happily ever after. That's not what happens for the vast majority of people, and everyone questions their life decisions from time to time. \n\nPart of me wishes I was in software engineering when I was 22, and part of me is very happy that I spent my 20's working part-time jobs and spending my days surfing and learning random things while my friends were stuck in offices. \n\nThe grass is always greener... I'd say lower expectations and just try shit out. Trust yourself to alter your course once you have more life experiences under your belt. 
1	Could you go into business for yourself? I'm currently at a disadvantage in my business, not having any programming knowledge, but am constantly using brain and body to solve problems and implement new strategies. \n\nI'd recommend entrepreneurship to any istp. The challenges are stressful but it scratches that istp itch of always tinkering and problem solving. 
1	I do helpdesk, i don't answer the phone calls i call users back and i figure out WTF broke this time. 
1	I'm actually in the same position situation wise. Last year of college about to get my degree in environmental science. While I do generally like the course, I really am not sure if its what I want to do with my life. I'm actually not much of an outdoors person at all, and coding of any level make me want to put my head through the wall. While I personally feel like I'd like a job in consulting, I've taken no steps and haven't even researched jobs to apply to because of this hesitation.\n\nMy family has a small business which is mostly selling at craft shows and corporate events and I'm planning to spend a few months there. while its a really small operation and still pretty early, sales are over 120k annually with I'd say 60% profit margin with a lot that can be done to make those numbers better. It's definitely not construction levels of manual labor, but theres a lot of labor involved. My parents won't be happy cause they want me to get a real job with stability and benefits but.. :/\n\nSorry if this is just a personal rant but it feels really good to get this off my chest, because it feels awkward talking about most of everyone I know. But I guess if I had to sum it up and put a kind of message, I'd say that I'm going to apply my life philosophy to it, that being, "everything will work itself out", or simply put, I'm gonna wing it. No one asked to be born into this world, you should do what makes you happy. Life is short so make the most of it, but also know that we're still young and can still make a new start. At least thats what people tell me.\n\nIf I can make a final suggestion, if you have any interest in environmental science and doing field work, then I feel like it might be something worth looking into. I know a few people actually who transferred in from programming backgrounds. Despite the stereotype and what you may be thinking, theres actually a decent amount of computer work. I had to take 2 levels of stat, 3 courses in GIS, and a quite a few labs that are statistical data based. Depending on how your courses double count, it could take as little as 2 years but don't quote me on that.
1	Do what I do and work remotely. Program a bit every day, explore foreign countries the rest of the time. Plenty of programming jobs are remote; it's probably the most remote-friendly job you can have.
1	Hey mate, I work in Australia in a big tech company. Most of my buddies at the office are software engineers (wouldn’t be surprised if many are ISTP). A couple are in management and they generally seem quite content. Feel free to hit me up if you want to come visit for lunch, talk about the tech industry, etc
1	As someone who has my own web design company, I strongly urge you not to give up on software dev. It's in huge demand, pays a lot, and you can be an independent contractor/freelancer... meaning you can still travel, set your own hours, and never step foot in an office. It does take work to run your own business, but your chosen field is perfect for the lifestyle you want.\n\nAnd you can supplement your own business, until it really takes off, with service-industry jobs (bartending, waiting tables, etc.). Also, you can start by taking small jobs on [upwork.com](https://upwork.com) to build your portfolio. Or, you can just work through upwork forever.
1	Finish school and go do something somewhere that you think you will like. The degree and/or certs will help get your foot in the door years later if that comes around. Life will be a mix of jobs, people, places, and things you sometimes like and sometimes don't. I work to live while others live to work.  Balance
11	Last time I cried update / relationship advice	Two days ago, the last time I (24) cried was August 4th, 2018. One day ago, the little streams returned to flow down my cheeks once again. I'm considering breaking up with my gf (25) of a little over a year, and I need to vent and ask you all for any advice. Since this is my first real relationship, it would follow that this is my first breakup. We've worked through religious differences and political differences, but I can't seem to shake our communication differences. I wanted to avoid going in depth, but I think this recent incident really highlights everything. If you want to skip everything below and just lay down some break up advice in the comments, that works too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Incident: When my gf gets angry she takes it out on everyone around her. We worked on the same team until this morning when her promotion to assistant manager of that team was announced alongside my promotion (non-managerial) to a different team. She was going to miss the meeting because she woke up late and got stuck in traffic. She had never called into a meeting before, so I sent her the number and code 30 minutes ahead of the announcement and she didn't call in, arrived half way through the meeting, refused to show up late out of embarrassment, and continued to text me about how angry she is at everyone. We've been through this song and dance so many times that I decided to tell her that I'm disappointed that she didn't call in and that her anger is misplaced on the people around her. It felt like she disregarded my help. I said this in person, and then she let her anger build for half an hour before sending me texts saying how angry she is at me for making this all about myself (waiting to text me is a common occurrence in our fights). I told her not to talk to me if she was going to direct her anger at me. Communication ceased for the day on my call. This is a more favorable outcome than the common alternative: ignoring me without warning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Issue: By the end of the work day she's texting me again and wants me to come up to her desk. As usual, she's pretending like nothing is wrong. I think this behavior messes with me more than I previously realized. I ask if we're going to talk about the issue and she says "what is there to talk about?" I slowly leave the room until she tells me to come back. I wait for 30 minutes in silence while she does some daily organization in her notebook. While waiting, I get a text from my younger sister apologizing for putting her emotional issues with our parents on me last year (parents are terrible communicators, got into lots of fights in front of her when I left for college, and she had blamed me for not being there for her). Finally my gf turns to talk, can't find anything to say, sits down next to me, starts to touch me, and then tells me that she's over it and wants to move on. I say I can't keep doing this. It's an exhausting emotional rollercoaster for me to have a fight, mull on it all day, and then suddenly it didn't happened; rinse and repeat. I show her my sister's text and reiterate to her that my parents are terrible communicators, so communication is the one thing I need to be super solid in the relationship. At this point I just start tearing up because we've been through this many times before and it never changes. My gf then says, which is essentially her mantra now, that I'm going to reach a breaking point and break up with her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNail in the Coffin: She texts me later to remind me that people aren't perfect, that she's pretty damn good compared to most girls, and that I'll realize how good I had it with her if I break up with her and date other people (it's actually been a huge struggle involving religious sexual shame, an overbearing obsession with marriage, and actions made from jealousy causing a coworker to hit on her for months including a flat-out refusal to let me talk to the coworker after some other coworkers found out). I clarify that the reason wouldn't be me wanting someone better, but rather that our communication styles don't match. She says it's exhausting to talk about her feelings and that I (an ISTP lol) always want to talk about every minute feeling, to which I clarify that I only talk about my feelings to her and only when we need to resolve something. I go off on a tangent about mindfulness meditation as a good practice for understanding emotions better and she says it sounds like I'm recruiting her to a cult. Here is where I (non-religious) took it too far by sending her (a southern baptist) bible verses about anger since she doesn't want to listen to me talk about mindfulness. She gets angry again and tells me that most of the time I act like I'm better than her and that I need to get off my high horse (in my mind I'm doing my best to qualify everything I say specifically to avoid appearing arrogant/superior. I do seem to have a problem giving her excessive advice when, in reality, she doesn't want any advice from anyone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just feel so many different feelings. I feel hopeless because she's unresponsive to my concerns. I feel ignored because we have the same issues on repeat. I feel hypocritical for thinking she's exaggerating claims of arrogance and self-centeredness for her own defense. I feel weak for loving her so much. I feel weak for wishing I didn't love her so much. I feel frustrated that I'm not strong enough to break it off.  I'm just mostly confused because I don't know what to do. It seems so simple because I've typed out this whole post to try and convince myself to end it, but I'll see her in a few hours and I can almost guarantee everything will somehow be back to normal with us until some other incident starts this all over again. I do think she's right that I'll reach a breaking point. I just don't know if the breaking point is now and, if it's not now, do I have the strength to make necessary changes before the breaking point is reached. I probably just need to rip off the bandaid, but there are only bad times to do it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the essay. I sacrificed a night's sleep to vent at this corner of the internet because I value your opinions, so thank you to anyone who manages to get through this whole thing.
12	Man, whatever you're getting out of the relationship doesn't sound worth it on the whole compared to the amount of mental/emotional drain it comes with. One way or the other whether you regret the decision or wish you'd done it sooner, and least all the drama and bullshit will be over with and you can go back to just getting on with shit. 
6	It’s time to end it, if you don’t do it now you’ll do it sooner or later.
5	This sounds like an absolutely miserable way to live... Sorry you're having a hard time breaking it off.
4	First of all I want to say I love ISTPs. I noticed some striking similarities between what you describe and my relationship with one, about three years ago. My first real love was with an ISTP and I witnessed the first time he cried over a girl (me)....when I had driven three hours out to visit him in a different state and he broke up with me (over religious and political differences—him being a strict Lutheran and conservative, me being agnostic and quite progressive). We had been together for about a year as well, most of the relationship long distance Bc he was in the military and doing some highly specialized training. It was an extremely hard breakup, but ultimately it was necessary as those religious differences couldn’t be reconciled. \n\nAs you mentioned, there was a lot of shame around sex, and also he was so scared of going to hell and me going there with him if I didn’t conform to Christianity. His family and their approval was massively important to him, and they couldn’t get over the fact that I ‘wasn’t raised in the church’. A feminist, strong willed female was basically the spawn of satan. \n\nBut just between him and I, we were so happy together day to day and we easily saw a future together. He felt like part of me, in a way no one has ever felt before. We would talk about marriage, kids, traveling and even retirement.  But when we would fight over religion, it was like he became a different person who spoke this bizarre religious language which I didn’t understand (“I want you to find salvation in Jesus” etc). And I would be like “what does that even mean???” \n\nI know you mentioned you have worked through religious differences, and if that’s really the case good for you. I just know it’s an ongoing issue, especially if people are really engulfed in it. \n\nIn terms of your gfs behavior, definitely sounds unhealthy. Do you know her mbti? It is incredibly frustrating to be in a cycle of arguments/outburst and then having it be brushed off like it’s nothing. My mom has BPD and I spent like ten years with her in that vicious, exhausting cycle. \n\nI agree—communication is so important. And it doesn’t seem like it going to get better with her if you’ve been discussing this for a while. Have you considered couples therapy? That is one option if you really feel like she’s someone you could marry and spend a lifetime with. At least in that case you could say you tried everything. \n\nAlso lol about her saying you want to discuss all emotions. ISTPs don’t do emotions, and it takes a shit load of introspection and love for and ISTP to even pay attention and make sense of the emotions that a certain person elicits. It’s unfortunate that she doesn’t realize this. \n\n\nBut in terms of breaking it off, I’m sure my ex ISTP had a lot of those internal debates you discuss over breaking up with me. I was so in love with him and convinced we could make it work (and convinced religion didn’t truly mean as much to him and it did his family....and that he just hadn’t figured that out yet). But like you describe, the good times are so good that he couldn’t do it. It really took me asking him a million questions one time (are you happy with me? Do you think this is going to work? What do you truly need regarding religion?) that he actually came to the conclusion it wasn’t going to work. I was really heartbroken that I had to pull it out from him when it wasn’t even what I wanted to begin with. He just cried basically the whole time I packed my things to leave....which confused me so much Bc he never cried. I was like “what do you want here?”. Was brutal. \n\nWhen I got all my stuff out to my car he wanted a hug but I wouldn’t give him one (I was so incredibly hurt and mad he would do this before I had to make a three hour drive home) and I drove off watching him cry through the rear view mirror :( \n\nWas a very sad and long ride home indeed and I just sobbed like the next couple days. \n\nSorry that was such a downer story! But just saying I relate dude. I understand what it’s like when ISTPs love, how hard it can be for them to get there, and how difficult it can be to be logical and rational (something ISTPs pride themselves in being) in the face of love. \n\nIm happy to talk about this in more detail. Hope this was helpful in some way. Message me if you’d like :) 
3	Imagine waking up tomorrow and there's no one texting you about how the world is out to get them and everything is going wrong and you need to fix it but also doesn't actually want you to fix anything. Imagine being with someone who is listens to you, who understands logical advice, who will talk through things, and who won't lie about how they're feeling. Sound good? Yeah, dump her. It will suck for a bit, and then you'll feel so much better.
3	Whenever a girl or person says they are better than most people...That's a red flag. It's basically saying, yeah I suck but I suck less than others therefore I don't need to improve on myself.
2	Holy shit. \n\nTry being single for a while, I think it’ll do you some good. 
2	Oh man, I am so so sorry you’re going through this. The post was so hard for me to read because I felt really bad for you. I know you love her a lot, but it doesn’t seem like this is something that’s going to work long term, simply because she doesn’t seem to want to change to make you happier. Even when she sees you crying she makes it all about her. I can relate to her because I used to act like her when I was depressed, anxious and insecure and I’m really not proud of that, but I can empathize. ( I guess that’s partly why this post was so hard for me to read...it reminded me of all the who I used to behave and hurt people) At the same time, you sound like a really nice guy and you sound miserable so you will have to end it at some point. Feel free to pm if you need someone to vent to during this process or have more questions about how to break up with her. Best of luck.
1	Come and lay on my bosom, babe...you need a hug❤️ \n\nSending good vibes your way. 
9	Do ISTPs sometimes disappear for weeks at a time to process/figure out important matters?	Without giving too much info away, I recently had some drama with an ISTP - this is drama that ensued from mistakes on both my part and the ISTP's part. I texted the ISTP and ultimately asked them to make a major decision that would resolve all of our drama. They have now disappeared, and it's been a week since they last responded. Are they just taking the time to process information/make a final decision?\n\nHopefully this post wasn't too vague, just didn't want to make it too obvious because this ISTP is also a redditor. Thanks!
12	personally i do have a habit of disappearing for weeks, but not when making important decisions. istp’s are usually very confrontational so the fact that they haven’t answered you in weeks leads me to believe they read the message, ignored it, and moved on with your life–something i suggest you do too. 
7	Yeah if I become uncomfortable around someone I avoid them. Plus I'm very busy and don't have time to socialize. Sometimes I take it too far and become a hermit but meh.
6	> I texted the ISTP and ultimately asked them to make a major decision that would resolve all of our drama. \n\nThat reads like an ultimatum to me. "All of our drama goes away if YOU do something." Depending on the circumstances, there's a good chance I'd walk away like it seems like they did. 
7	Your istp sees you as being unreasonable, rude, or for some reason no longer worth his time. Whatever the issue, he probably explained himself many times and figures it is a waste of time to talk again. Not knowing the details myself, my basic answer is no, he is not processing information. That happened in a split second days ago. I speculate that you are insisting on an answer and won’t take no as an answer.\n\nGood luck, though.
3	No, I just forget to talk to people tbh
3	Ultimatums are stupid. You made a very foolish mistake.
2	Hard to say without more info, but I can speculate based on your words and description of the situation.\n\n  I usually don't want to continue talking to people who treat me badly or refuse to validate my concerns or conclusions in a situation. Maybe your text completely dismissed what they were trying to convey to you.
2	Some heavy things happened in my life last year, I just texted my closest friends that I'd be gone for a bit and disappeared for as long as I needed. \n\nThey'll come back to you when they're ready.
2	Yeaa but if it seems like I disappeared for that long it’s probably because I’m not coming back or texting back, I don’t take a week to process a something unless it a big life change someone’s asking of me, like a job or a big purchase.\n\nI’m currently getting ready to do this with a girl and I’ve done it with other people, after I explained something or a problem many times in a lot of different ways I’ll just ghost them, or stop coming around with out saying anything. I don’t know your situation but if it’s a disagreement you guys have been having for awhile that could be why their doing it.
2	It's hard to give a definitive answer without knowing more about the situation but I once had a falling-out with an emotionally abusive friend who was upset that I was finally standing up for myself and not letting her walk all over me the way I had for years. I blocked her on all social media and then ghosted her because I wanted out of the relationship and wasn't interested in discussing it with her any further (which could potentially be what is happening here). I seriously doubt that your ISTP is having trouble processing information, rather they probably already made a decision and this is their way of communicating it to you because long emotional conversations are exhausting.
2	"I texted the ISTP and ultimately asked them to make a major decision that would resolve all of our drama."\n\nI'd also walk away in a heartbeat, to be honest. 
1	It sounds to me like you asked for too much and now they are processing the request. The more you asked, the longer it will take them to process it. Even after processing it the chances are that they will refuse to make a final decision, because we don't like commitment and anything final is too much of a commitment. \n
1	i'm going to make an assumption (based off of what i would do) that because the situation was dramatic to begin with, your istp now no longer cares about it and because talking to you would be bringing it back up again, you have not heard from them. \n\nso that's it. you just have to move on. when they talk to you again don't bring it up. if you do, be sure that you're ready to move on from it as quickly as they will want to. 
1	If i have drama with someone i tend to wanna solve it as fast as poasible if i Care for that person and our relationship. However i can easely cut our someone who i feeling isnt worth the time and energy etc.
1	ultimatums are a sure way to lose an istp. or anyone tbh. 
1	kinda late here but i don't ever do this. it usually takes me very little time to make a decision, i will disappear for long periods of time but not to think about anything in particular
2	I have a question about ISTPs and smiling	Do you guys notice you, and other ISTPs never smile in your pictures and selfies, or just in general, and why is that is it inferior Fe?
13	I smile for pictures and I smile when I am doing something that makes me actively happy, and I smile in a social situation where it is expected, such as church
7	I personally don't smile in pictures let alone take pictures, I hate being fake so you won't catch me posing. If you don't catch me smiling naturally then you're basically not going to get a photo of me smiling.
2	I only smile sarcastically but I don't think it's inferior Fe though
2	smiling on cue vs smiling because you actually want to
2	Personally any time I see a photo of me smiling it gives me the creeps. 
2	It is a natural reaction to when something is funny smiling for a picture is forced. I have no issue smiling when I think of something that makes me happy but I will not force it.
2	Even Nick Offerman smiles.
11	Practically speaking, what do you think ISTP do better than ESTP?	Estp probably are better at social talents because of higher Fe, and reacting faster(se), but what do you think your higher Ni and higher Ti help you do better?
45	ISTPs shut up better
13	Introversion
10	Strategizing. My ESTP friends do better at sales, I do better at poker. Both types are good at reading people, Higher Fe and Se translates to better relationship building, higher Ni and Ti translates to better analysis of what people are thinking, knowing when someone is bluffing, and generally having a better danger sense. That said, my ESTP friends are still good at poker, and I am good at sales - these are relative strengths.
9	Stay out of trouble
6	Give us 5 minutes and it'l be everything
3	We are a rational type, so we make better judgments than our irrational twin.
1	Istp with high te?	Okay so im having a really hard time lately cause i feel like i have high amounts of te and maybe even si, but im also pretty sure im an istp. \n\n\nI like to organize things and have things clean. It frustrates me when things are undone when i do them. I also normally follow the rules.  However i also feel that theyre silly sometimes. So now im confused between ti and te and dont think i understand them enough in real world examples. \n\nAs for si, i often think about the past and relate or remember things because of something i did before. Could it be our se ni? I also love to make things, woodworkings, props, gifts for close fsmily and friends. Help meeeehhh o brethren
4	About the "high" amount of Te, I think it's just the combination of Ti and Se at work. Your Ti says that you should probably keep your stuff organized or follow rules because YOU think it's right. Se makes it happen. I don't know about the Si part, though. Isn't that normal to people? IXXPs are hard to type because we just do anything that we deem right. I even mistyped as entj.
2	More literally, Te is about a preference for external facts and structure, whereas Ti is a preference for organizing one's internal thoughts.... I'm most definitely an ISTP and I don't like my place being really messy.. cause then I can't move freely in it. >.> That would be Se. I also don't tend to like organize, but I like things to be organized so I don't waste a bunch of time trying to find something that shouldn't be lost. I would much rather be doing something more fun or productive. >.>\n\nAs for rules... the ISTP that is constantly breaking rules is gonna have issues in long run. It's just not practical. But obviously, they exist. At times, I'll ignore certain rules that I deem stupid, but I'm certainly not looking to break all the rules. I do try to follow them when it's something that not a huge deal... Although I have this internal rebellious desire to break a rule that I have to fight off at times. But frankly, on a practical level, breaking rules can cause a lot of unnecessary drama or issues so.. sometimes it's just not worth it... or I'd rather be more careful in choosing my battles. \n\nAs to the past.. We all technically refer to the past. The difference is that Si users tend to be very detail oriented because they naturally internalize sensory data, whereas Ni users internalize impressions. We all reference whatever we have stored away from the past. The reason Si users are known for being past oriented is that they'll rely on detailed past memories and when they don't have those detailed memories, they'll tend to stress out because they don't readily trust their intuition. They'll mimic what they know has worked in past and usually have detailed memories of those things. Ni users are more accustomed to "abstract memories" and hunches and the like so they're usually a little bit more comfortable guessing. \n
7	20 y/o ISTP and 21 y/o ENTJ	I've been seeing an ENTJ for the last 6 months now, previously was (and still is) my best friend.  He's honestly great, our interactions are easy and efficient. They're  straightforward and philosophical, hilarious and fun. Its an ideal relationship and I'd go as far as to say that I have fallen in love with him. Even if I hate connotations associated with that word.\n\nBut lately I've been having issues with my living situation at the moment. (Unexpected changes, abuse. He lives far away from me so its hard to communicate)  It's difficult to focus, my usual habits of wanting to be alone have resurfaced. I forget that I'm in a relationship and actively avoid communicating. Just feels forced and confining even if he's independent and gets that. \n\nI realise that the issue lies with me. Honestly I like the freedom that being single gives, you don't have to worry about anyone else and they don't have to worry about me. There comes a point where relationships require a certain amount of expectation and I hate that. \n\nSo I'm thinking of ending this soon? It's all just confusing . Even if he's someone I care about I feel like he deserves better. A reliable partner. I've always been a cool best friend anyway and I miss that. Just hope he understands where I'm coming from. (I do have a heart)\n\nI'm  curious to see if this is normal ISTP behaviour? Anyone experience something similar. \n\n

3	Yes. 28 year old female istp over here and just went through something very similar towards the end of my last relationship. I resonated HARD with the feelings you described. 
1	Yeh, not a female but usually when I’m in a relationship I end up getting the feeling you described. Needing the alone time, still enjoying the friendship part but not wanting to commit etc. \n\nNot sure if it is ever going to be different for me.\n\n\n
1	Personally don't think you should, if you believe he deserves someone better then you are the best for him.
1	Op give us an update 
3	Career/life ISTP advice!	Hello everyone my name is Logan. I’m 19 years old and 100% sure I am an ISTP. I’m taking Pre Trades Apprenticeship classes right now thinking I might want to go into that field. Specifically an Electrician. Both of my parents went the college route so I didn’t get to experience building things/fixing things. I love to fix and problem solve. At the same time I absolutely love driving. Which has led me to consider becoming an airline pilot. I love flying. Just going to an airport I get exited to take off and land. I guess with more experience I will find out what career I want to go into. But as of now all of my high school career was geared towards the college route. Pushed down my throat like all these other high schools are doing across the US. But I love experiencing things and manipulating tools/ machines. Either route sounds good. I just wish I had more action items and a agenda to follow to better understand my place in the world and find what I’m destined to do. Any input helps. FIRST TIME POSTING ON HERE! Let’s see how this goes 😂
3	Tradesmen are a dying breed yet still extremely necessary and valued. \n\nI encourage anyone with interest in the trades to go for it. I absolutely know college isn't for everyone. It certainly wasn't for me. 
2	Follow that optimism and drive. When you hit rock bottom, these two things will help you surface back to life.
1	Trades are great! I've been in HVAC for about 17 years and am a senior tech at a school district. 
1	I'm an electrician and recommend it 100%.
1	I wish I'd gone into Engineering or Electricianing (that's a word, right?). I think they're both ideal career choices for ISTPs. Not to say being a pilot isn't, I just don't think it's such a stereotypical ISTP choice
1	I went to college straight after school and dropped out after a couple years. Wish I'd went straight into a trade. Theory isn't my strong suit much prefer practical careers. I am a chef.
1	I am 100% an ISTP and I'm about to start my second job in the circus. I couldn't be more fulfilled and happy :)
1	I wish I'd knew what you know at the age of 19. Unfortunately I'm at the near age of 28 having spent 6 years at University studying something I no longer want to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe working world is different to learning in a class setting. I much preferred working and found I learnt more on the job than I did sitting in lectures and having a non-engaging professor talk for hours on end. I'm sure your leaning is more hands on focus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf being an Electrician is something you want to do, do it! Either way, becoming a pilot will require some form of financing and working as an electrician could possibly make that happen.
1	I could never do something like be a pilot because there are too many rules and procedures to follow.
18	When was the last time you cried?	I think the last time I cried was at least 4 years ago. Sometimes I wish I could just ball my eyes out and just release all these emotions but it feels like an impossible task. I don’t cry during movies or anything and I’m not trying to sound like a tough guy. The closest I could get to crying was this little whimper noise I made while tripping on ayahuasca and not even a tear, I was trying to force myself to make it happen. 
25	Last time I cried was last year on the morning of August 4th after taking 10 grams of mushrooms the night before. Was washing the dishes when I remembered some traumatic bullying from my childhood that I had repressed. Kept doing the dishes. Very therapeutic. 
16	if we're not counting crying from laughter then it'd be 5 years for me \n:/
12	It was about 4 years ago.  Major depression, but I didn't cry until I had to tell my mom I was probably going to fail out of college.  I'm a lot better now.  I was able to graduate and I now have a promising career.  The time before that would have probably been when I was in fifth grade or so.  
11	I cry when i feel like crying nowadays.\n\nI'll keep the stoic robot mode for really fucked up/urgent situations. \n\nIts not good for our mental health in the long run if we keep it turned on.
7	If I get super shit faced I'll have a pity party and miss a specific ex and have a good cry.\n\nI tear up for movies and touching posts all the time. \n\nLast time I really cried was when my first relationship ended.  Burst out in tears in a train carriage with a Chinese family. I'm sure they were like WTF but it didn't matter. \n\nCrying is cathartic! People should do it more.
7	Wow, I'm I'm such a baby compared to you guys. I've cried twice in the past 6 months; once in an arguement and once while incredibly sick with strep.
5	Remember that not processing emotions (in this case crying) is like holding onto a glass of water at first it's easy but as time goes on it weighs heavier and heavier on you. As istps we are not prone to processes our emotions but once we understand the formula we will always process our emotions. When something upsets you just let your self think about it and then expell it with a burp, shit, piss, most common one is crying or yelling. Once you process the emotion and "expell" it you will feel a lot better! It's a simple formula deal with emotion by dwelling on the troubling thought, cry, yell, punch, forgive, or communicate and boom you now feel a lot better.
3	Yesterday actually. I was slicing habaneros for a chili cookoff and i stupidly wiped by brow and got capsaicin on my right eyelid.\n\nBefore this it was maybe a year ago to a game soundtrack.\n\nBefore THAT, I don't remember.
4	Last time I cried due to stress: Last December, when a water pipe in my closet burst, soaking most of my clothes.  It was a combination of knowing that I live in a POS building, having something I worked hard to obtain (my clothes, and many of them are quite nice) get damaged due to something beyond my control, and realizing that I might not be able to salvage my things.  \n\nCried because something emotionally moved me:  Three weeks ago, when I watched 'The Theory of Everything' on Netflix while I was drunk.  That final scene where the movie rewound back to when Stephen and Jane first met, set to "The Arrival of the Birds" by the Cinematic Orchestra, had me fucking bawling.  Goddamn you Eddie Redmayne for making this stonehearted ISTP feel that way.
5	The last time I had a casual thought about *The Iron Giant*...\n\nI get tearful at a number of movies, especially since becoming a parent. \n\nActually ugly crying? I've done it exactly twice as an adult. Once in frustration with my marriage 12 years ago, and once in a powerful cathartic healing moment a couple of years ago.
3	at least once a year over the same event usually 3 or 4 times a year been about 17 years now 
3	Pluck your nose hairs, you'll cry lol. \n/Joke aside, hope you get better soon dude, maybe you didn't reach a breaking point or something, it may be a matter of time.
3	Wait! What kind of an istp am I, a movie made me shed a tear-🤔?
2	Um like two days ago watching Captain America Winter Soldier lol. Not even just tearing up, it was a pretty steady stream for a hot minute. I love getting immersed into movies! Super fun, especially horror movies, I get to connect with characters and feel like I'm living another life that isn't mine, even if it is just for an hour or two.\n\nThe last time I could remember crying from intrinsic emotion though was maybe six years ago? When I was an angsty teenager suffering from overbearing stereotypical Asian parents. I guess I just don't use crying as a way to express my sadness anymore. It's not a bad thing to never cry, unless you're purposely holding back or view it as a sign of weakness. Just important to let out your emotions some place else, like through talking or through a creative outlet.
2	My cat died around December so I’ve been crying a lot.
2	I don't even remember 
2	This past Saturday.
1	I cried when she left me and I also cry a lot during anime.
1	Back in October when I watched Coco for the first time. I didn't expect it to be that sad but it was.
1	I tend to cry when I get over tired...which is like every other day
1	Last year when my dog died
1	It obviously depends on what’s going on in my life, but if I’m super stressed I’ll just cry all the time, it kind of helps get things out of my head. However it seems to be tiny, unimportant things that make me cry, whenever it’s something important I don’t seem to be able to cry. 
1	i cry pretty regularly, usually out of frustration with my relationship. feelings are hard and don’t make a lot of sense sometimes. haha
1	I cry a lot. Usually it's over music, but not even necessarily sad music. I think it is what people call frisson but instead of getting goosebumps, I cry.
1	Yesterday after an argument with my mother. Before that, a few months.
1	I've watched a few romance animes that made me tear up a bit over the last few months, but the list is maybe 3 or 4 and it barely counts as crying. Even though if you read through the comment threads of some of these shows it feels like walking your way through a wake. One made me cry a lot and I can't explain it, tears just started pouring out. The last time that happened was at my grandmother's funeral over a year ago. Before that I can't really remember.
1	this morning lol
1	Full on bawling was when a family member died 8 months ago. I get the occasional eye-leakage but it's literally 4 tears and I'm good again.\n\nWish I could cry it all out sometimes but alas.
1	A few times Dec 14 between Dec 22. Turned off my mothers life support on the 14th.
1	A little after my grandfather's funeral oof.
1	Little under 12 years and childhood friends funeral 
1	I nearly cried yesterday because I keep not moving forward with the situation with my crush,,,,,, I'm just leaving it stagnant because I'm a coward but I guess it made me sad because I missed an opportunity
1	I’m an ESFJ and I cry every day so it’s interesting to see the comparison
15	Dealing With Te Dom's Logic (help please)	I realize this may get many downvotes, however it feels needed that I make this post. I can't stand a lot (not all) of Te doms when it comes to discussions or debates. Here are some things that happens when I talk to them: they tend to assume that you are disagreeing when you are not, making arguments that doesn't actually dispute nor prove your point but is rather unrelated and then assuming everything you say is invalid because they fail to understand, then calling you a know-it-all or arrogant sometimes even after putting in conscious effort to narrow down your statement to a few words etc. This is incredibly annoying however, I realize that I need to become more effective at communicating with them as well, though I continuously seem to fail at it. What are some advices on how to talk and discuss with Te doms from fellow ISTPs?
8	One of, if not THE, biggest weakness of a Te dom is their sense of pride (aka a fragile ego). Most of them consider themselves to be amongst a special breed and usually attain accolades throughout their lives as a result. They're also extraverted so they usually feel no shame letter the world know it as well.
4	I’m still struggling with this daily with the Te-doms in my life. I don’t think it can be solved by just one side, but that might also be a cop-out. \n\nThere’s a reason I’m constantly making shitty jokes about Te types. Understanding what’s going on and being able to work with it in the moment are two different things.\n\nThe only success I’ve had is in asking prompting questions and letting them do most of the talking. Even my attempts at active listening are usually received with confusion or scorn because it sounds like I’m just parroting or something, to them. 
5	I’ve simply given up on high Te users. Many of them are assholes who don’t even want to understand you, just writes everyone who is not them of as an idiot.
3	This might not be very helpful, but I live in a family of Te doms and I've found the best policy is to just conserve my energy and not get into arguments with Te's. I keep my opinions, knowledge, etc. to myself instead of subjecting myself to an exhausting browbeating session where carefully reasoned thoughts are not welcome or appreciated.\n
3	Just chiming in to say that this complaint is common between any two types with significantly differing cognitive functions. As an ENFP I feel this way about Se, Fe, and Ti.
3	Hi there, I’m neither Te dom nor ISTP, but I *am* a pretty strong Te user who often has frustrating arguments with my ISTP spouse. Here are some things I’ve noticed about our conflicts:\n\n(1) I don’t give a shit about WHY something works. If it is a solution and it’s effective, then boom. I’m done. Moving on. It works. He wants to continue to entertain various possibilities or unlikely scenarios that might play out and prove to be an exception to the rule, which I find highly annoying. I used to even wonder if he was just looking for an excuse to argue or trying to be difficult. \n\n(2) He has a fuzzy, spatial logic that mostly serves to justify his inferior Fe. And he doesn’t seem to realize it. I’ve pointed it out and he thinks it doesn’t matter. So the rules of a logical debate do not apply. He will resort to straw man arguments, ad hominems, deflections, gas lighting.\n\n(3) he shuts out any incoming information that conflicts with his preconceived notions or, going back to my previous statement, goes against what he “feels” is right. He also entertains bat shit insane phenomena and superstition like chi and karma that cannot be scientifically proven.\n\n(4) he questions medical professionals, legal advisors, teachers, pretty much anyone in any field of expertise, almost as though it’s his duty. I got major problems questioning a doctor who went to school for twelve years and practiced for another fifteen, when it comes to chemical reactions and medications and anatomy and shit I know nothing about. Yet my husband is a contractor and feels *A-okay* antagonizing someone in any field of expertise, as though they have to convince him first, before they can be taken seriously.\n\nEtc.
2	You shouldn't have issues projecting your logic on mature Te users. It's only the immature who have too much pride to admit when they're lacking.\n\nMy two best friends are Te doms: ENTJ and ESTJ, and sure, they can have their moments where their pride gets in the way. But they'll usually accept input if the logic is better than theirs.
2	Just remember that Ti doms share a good deal of function with Te doms. The difference is that Te doms follow "the rules" and Ti doms make their own rules.
1	> however it feels needed that I make this post\n\nnah
1	You don't really need to convince them of your logic. You can listen to them and go do your thing.
1	If you have to improve your Te (ISTPs' nemesis function) to relate to them. This is the only solution. If you can't, then don't bother with them. They live in a different world. 
1	My best advice if you are arguing on how to do something; is to just do it your way and if went succcesfully, show the results in their face.
22	Monotone	Are you monotone? If so, what if anything did you try to change? \n\nI mean yea I don’t get excited about much so I guess it comes through in my voice. 
18	Pretty monotone here. Didn't do much about it. Coworkers despise it though.
8	I'd say my  bf (ISTP) has a decently monotone voice MOST of the time. However his facial expressions are extremely monotone and hard to read (Not as much for me because I spend so much time with him but I get so lost sometimes lol).  I don't think he tries to change himself, he doesn't see the need.\n\n\nHe tells me stories about how frustrated people get or how they'll joke around with him about it haha. One of my friends (who has trained himself hard to read expressions)  met him and was so confused the whole time, my bf and I got a good laugh. (We were nice). 
5	I've been called monotone.  But who cares?  
6	My face is pretty monotone but not my voice. 
6	Ya and doesn’t help that I have resting bitch face \n\nAt least it reduces wrinkles :D
3	Monotone when I’m not interested in the topic. \n\nAnimated like a crazy wild-eyed mad scientist when I am, think Doc from Back to the Future. 
3	Uhh, no, well, I kinda had to work on the way I acted, with both facial and vocal expressions and don't think about it anymore. Theatre helped in HS. I just wish my eyebrow muscles could help me show a bit more sadness like cartoon characters...or like Jon hamm
3	Yes. Students didn't like when I would read to the class and that's the exact words they used.
2	Yeah, My Facial Expression and Voice are super monotone which clearly annoys people that I’m taking to because they can’t read me.
2	I used to be more monotone. Didn’t do anything on purpose, just kind of picked up characteristics here and there. Listening to podcasts drastically changed the cadence and tone of my speech. Interacting with animated people, too. 
2	My default is monotone but I’ve developed a range of emotional expressions through practice. Honestly, doing theatre in high school and then being an NCO in the Army were two things that really made me more outwardly expressive.\n\nSo pretty much get into something where the impact of your expression is the tool you need for your task and you will learn.
2	I used to have this problem, along with not enunciating words and resting bitch face. I wouldn't care except for people wondering if I'm okay or why I'm pissed
2	I've learned to replicate other people emotions, tone, expressions, etc in most situations. Unless you know me when you'd never know I'm attempting to be human with you. If it's a situation I've yet to master then I become your typical istp, initiate robot and disappear the moment you blink.
1	These answers are so interesting, because my ISTP (confirmed) friend is very expressive and excitable. He loves to explain things to me, especially how he became really good at okcupid in his dating days, lol. another suspected ISTP friend of mine was pretty expressive too, especially when he was very excited about showing me the tiny house that he built. I guess there are variations in ISTP...Alex Honnold seems like the classic monotone ISTP (if he is one). 
1	I'm not, plus I'm p much happy all day long and on social interactions I like to change the way I mention things as much as possible
1	I am sometimes but its only when i dont givea fuck
1	My fiance always tells me I'm like a robot. Then he makes fun of me by making robot noises. Be-boop-boop. \n\nI get really excited about some topics though. (Like whatever my hobby is for the month). I'm pretty certain the excitement comes through in my voice when I talk about those things.
1	Apparently I can sound very apathetic even when I'm not. According to my one sister I'm more monotone than a lot of people but I'm less monotone than my INTJ sister.
62	Do you also do this when writing/talking?	Do you write long texts either on reddit or when texting people and afterwards you're like "tf am I talking about? I already forgot" and proceed to erase everything and either send nothing or just a sentence?\nI guess I do the same in person and just the filtered version comes out when talking. I usually think to myself "does that really matter in the long run? Do I really care? I guess not" and that's why I speak little.\nWondering if you guys are the same.
15	Yeah,everyday. Or sometimes too I'll type something up,send it off and go "why the fuck did I type that shit?".   \n
29	Yes. Can relate.\n\n(This was originally a much longer text but I deleted it all and boiled it down to this.)
9	Yea I've typed paragraphs answering questions on reddit and then realize I don't like my answer or it is not really worth saying so I just erase it all. Almost did it just now for this response. 
7	Absolutely.  Abridged version of everything.  Down to as few words as possible. 
5	Sometimes I think to explain something to someone- and then just nix that idea because just thinking about it makes me tired( esp for people who need a lot of explanation)
6	Happens all the time to me. I keep thinking I've got early onset dementia or something.
3	Yup
4	It takes a bunch of writing and re-writing a comment before I actually post something, if anything. 
3	All the time.
3	Well fuck, my memory's not that short term. Or wait... I was definitely typing something. Ugh... Fuck. This is not worth it. Nevermind. 
2	Yes I do this.
2	Yes. Almost every time. I hate being asked with vague questions because I tend to overexplain.
2	Yea I do that, and it’s on iMessage so if anyone’s watching the little 3 dots moving for 5 min and then I type a 6 word sentence it looks weird af lol
1	Yes
1	Yup, all the time
7	How often do you go get lit at the club?	
20	Never. Waste of time. 
9	Never. After about 30 minutes it stresses me out and i just wanna go home. Way too much energy for me. 
5	Never. I get lit over video calls in the middle of the night with my friends
4	Club? Never. But I’ll get lit at a rave/festival/concert. \n\n\nClubs aren’t about the music. They’re about getting fucked up and grinding on some greasy stranger. I don’t go to shows for the people, I go for the music. And being lit makes the music more fun. 
3	The thought of a loud crowded night club makes me shudder at this point in my life lol (31)\n\nI used to visit them in my early 20’s every week or two and would get just absolutely shitfaced every time I went. Took me a while to realize I was drinking heavily to compensate for my anxiety from being in a noisy crowded club. I didn’t like the atmosphere but couldn’t admit it to myself because I didn’t wanna miss out or seem uncool. \n\nNow, every once in a while I’ll go play pool at a dive bar or something. MAYBE even karaoke if Im feeling social and crazy that night. But a dance club will forever remain a big nope 
4	Sometimes, and usually with MDMA...
3	"The club"? Never, I will never go to a club.\n\nThe bar? Not so much anymore. Used to go every Friday and stay until they closed. When they banned smoking, a lot of the people I played pool with didn't come back.\n\nBig concerts, yes. Though within reason; I've missed a few by being too messed up too early.
2	In my early 20s quite a lot. Now almost never.
1	Literally never.
1	N e v e r
1	often, but i'm on a break now
1	I used to go out (almost) every week. Got lit beforehand cause we were all broke and messed around till 4. Nowadays I don't have friends so I just get hyped on music on my own till 4 in the morning in bed.
1	2019: 0 times\n\n2018: 0 times\n\n2017: twice.\n\n2016: once. \n\n2015: maybe 4?\n\nI can’t really remember further back than that.\n\nIt’s just not something I’m interested in. I don’t mind sitting down having a pint and a chat, but I can’t be doing with loud music that I hate and drunk people that I also hate. 
1	I prefer festivals and punk/metal/edm shows. The club is not my domain.   \n\n\nMDMA helps, though. 
1	Every week son, fun as fuck, good chance to engage Fe, good music, alcohol makes you stop overthinking
1	Club or Bars, Never they are the worst. \n\nAt the frat house raging with my brothers, that is another story
4	Does anyone have any experience dating their type?	When it comes to platonic and intimate relationships, I see a lot of info on how *theoretically* healthy it is to step outside of your comfort zone and constantly be challenged in your ways; personal growth and all that. But if I'm being totally honest, I've been in a LOT of relationships for someone my age and, looking back, I'm almost positive that none of them were with an ISTP. I also can't help but be intrigued when I read descriptions of other ISTP women and how they act, dress, and see the world. I find myself wanting to know more ISTP's. I get that it would be totally unhealthy to to bury myself in a world that never differs from my internal one, but just indulge me for a bit:\n\nDoes anyone have any experience dating their type? How did it go? What were the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship? What was ultimately your undoing? Would you do it again, knowing what you know now?\n\nThank you!!
4	One of my best friends from uni is a walking stereotype of ISTP. I don't know enough about functional stacks to say definitively that he is or isn't. But I assume he is.\n\nWhen the two of us are hanging out together without our SOs we just keep ramping up like the PENIS game in human form. Neither of us can say no, neither of us wants to stop.\n\nHim: Want to take a shot?\n\nMe: Yes! Wanna Sing Karaoke?!\n\nHim: YES! WANNA SET SOMETHING ON FIRE?!\n\nMe: **YES!!! BUT FIRST LETS HAVE ANOTHER SHOT!!!!**\n\nI'd imagine if we actually dated each other we would both burn out very quickly (pun totally intended). \n\nMy H is ISTJ and I think it's just the right difference of similar enough to not get on each other's nerves but different enough to keep each other on our toes. As long as I am able to keep my P-life together well enough he doesn't feel the need to push his J on me and as long as he doesn't force his J on to me I don't feel the need to run back to P in rebellion.
2	I could never date someone like me, way too infuriating
1	Dear god no, I don't need another me. Give me an Intj or an Entp any day 
12	What style do you have guys?	It is just interesting what kind of clothing style ISTPs have.
26	zip up hoodie and jeans all day everyday, at home change jeans to sweatpants.
13	Just about every thing I wear is black and grey and must be comfortable. I  guess I don't like to stand out. I like to do my eye makeup but never any type of bright colors and skip colored lip stick. 
12	Guess ISTP's dress what they are comfortable not fashion (minimalists we are).
6	21 m istp. Im like torn half and half between wanting to wear the typical Van's, ripped jeans,  graphic t, bracelet and a logo hoodie, or like the most out- there style ever.  I'm talking tank top and samurai pants or even like flip flops, jeans, and a floral shirts.
7	Something comfortable and sporty
6	I *might* be an N (I've been looking more deeply into the function stacks but still not 100% sure)\n\nBut anyway I'm a skinny/average 23f and I have an *almost* tomboy style. Picture: skinny or fitted jeans, casual sneakers, ribbed tank, flannel or graphic top, a choker, and beanie with full-face makeup (but not overdone). That's my style like 90% of the time. The other 10% is a mix of "I'm going to my stereotypical middle-class parent's house today" and summer boho-chic in...well, the summer.\n\nEdit: oh right and pullover hoodies lol
5	Comfort over everything! I could never sacrifice feeling comfortable with looking stylish. Love sweatshirts/hoodies combined with yoga pants/comfortable pair of black jeans. Black, cobalt blue, yellow are my fav colours to wear as tops! Though most of my closet is monochrome, I don't mind some colour
4	Used to be plain, minimal logos, jeans. Now I rock Pikachu and Stitch in each other's pajamas, a pixelated Sonic and still kind of plain-ish. Nothing crazy, except sometimes the Santa shirt n belt my family got me for Christmas around the holidays.
4	My style is all over the place. I like feeling good in my clothes, but also looking at least a bit unusual. When I'm lazy I will usually wear a crop top with jeans and an oversized hoodie or a huge sweater with shorts and thigh highs, sometimes with makeup, sometimes without. Then there are days when I want to have a "look" so I go for more non-ordinary combinations and do some colorful makeup. Those times I like to match jewerly and my septum piercing to my outfit.\n\nAlso, I consider my hair a part of my style, used to have long neon yellow, but then I shaved it all off and now I dye it any color I want while waiting for it to grow.\n\nBasically I wear what I want and do what I want with my appearance, don't care about current fashion trends and stuff.
3	I wear colorful shirts, or black ones, I wear hoodies, I wear sweatpants, rarely jeans, and skater shoes
3	All depends on the occasion. \n\nMy day to day: jeans that make my butt look good, are comfortable around the legs with a t-shirt, flannel, or 3 quarter sleeve that is _just_ tight fitting enough with my steel toe work boots. \n\nAverage Going out: jeans that make my butt look good, but are actually very nice (designer) and have a tighter cut. A slim fit button up, top three buttons undone, maybe sleeves rolled up, shoes depend on weather, but anywhere from leather boots to suede sneakers. Goofy/fun socks. \n\nDressing up: pair of tailored slacks that make my butt look good, leather dress shoes (brown or black depends on the shirt/pant color combo). Slim fit button up with a smoking jacket. Goofy/fun socks. \n\nHome: sweat pants that make my butt. Nothing else. \n\nEdit: everything I own is comfortable. When it comes to being stylish, I will spend the extra money to have fewer clothes that are more comfortable. I will also never shun away from a 10 year old t shirt that is perfectly warm in. 
2	black jeans or leggings, hoodies or simple oversided sweaters and pumas or vans, rarely some mascara, it just needs to be comfy
2	I live in the tropics so I make sure I'm wearing comfortable and good quality fabric. Linen and cotton. I dress up when the occasion calls for it, but I go for t shirt and jeans all the time. and leather sandals. 
2	When it's not my day to day basic fits (usually a sweatshirt or hoodie for a top, black jeans or navy chinos for bottoms, and white Van's for bottoms), I love experimenting with my style. \n\nCan go from a pink sweatshirt to match with my [pink Golf Le Fleur shoes](https://stockx.imgix.net/Converse-One-Star-Ox-Tyler-The-Creator-Golf-Le-Fleur-Geranium-Pink.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=700&h=500&auto=format,compress&q=90&dpr=2&trim=color&updated_at=1538080256), or a creme cardigan with oversized brown pants and brown shoes. Or if I want to freak people out at my school a bit, I'll wear my techwear outfit.\n\nMy biggest thing about my style is my standoutish-ness though. For example, my campus hosts a day called "Day Without Hate" and I'm wearing [this on that day.](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-stm8v/images/stencil/500x659/products/1434/3617/NO_VIOLENCE_VEST_1__89276.1550325391.png?c=2&imbypass=on) I've always worn stuff that scares or confuses people. 
2	I wear cargo pants, a t-shirt, and combat boots every day. If the cargo pants are tan i wear a light colored or red shirt, if dark anything but light colored shirts. 
2	Male,20,skinny frame.  \nWhen I want to look good/going out : Skinny black jeans,black doc martens,white t shirt,leather perfecto jacket.  \nWhen I'm chilling or just not doing much: skinny black jeans,black hoodie,reversed snapback, black nike high tops. Hood is always up,even over the hat!   \n
2	26F - Minimalistic/Small wardrobe \n\nCombat boots, black skinny jeans, tight black top, black leather jacket. \n\nSometimes I add stuff or remove things to change up the look. (Like a flannel tied around my waist).\n\nI wish I could just always wear the same thing *everyday* and not have to worry about this.
1	tshirt, shorts, teva sandals
1	Depends on my mood. For the winter it's been fleece leggings, boots and a sweater. If it was spring I'd just wear pants. Don't want to deal with pants tbh.
1	I usually wear jeans or demin shorts with a sweater or t-shirt. I have plain and graphic shirts but I wear the plain ones a lot more. When I feel more fancy I have these boxy button down linen shirts I really like and 60's inspired blouses with bows or bell sleeves. Shoes wise I usually switch from combat boots to flip flops in the summer. 
1	Vintage clothes I find that the thrift store or just steal things from my grandmother's closet. 
1	I would like to wear jeans and metal t-shirts everyday like I used to, but being an adult means I usually wear button down shirts and slacks. But I do wear New Balance sneakers. 
1	17M-Black skinny jeans, Hawaiian styled/trendy t-shirt, a huge faced minimalist watch, skater shoes
1	25F, I'm very unstylish for my gender.\nPlain everything, no graphic tees, some horizontally striped ones. Mostly black, grey and blue. Red or yellow if I'm feeling fancy that day.\nHot weather: t-shirt, short pants with pockets.\nCold: t-shirt, hoodie, jeans.\nI usually wear running shoes or vans.\nNo make-up, kinda short wavy hair with volume that I style with my fingers.\nI've thinking of adding some shirt to my wardrobe and a pair of less-sporty shoes.\nYep, I'm a minimalist.
1	Fashion is one of my main hobbies, but even though I have a beautiful wardrobe I love very much, I find myself wearing comfy jeans and a grey hoodie most days
1	Jeans, hoodie.
1	Whatever Vans has on sale. 
1	Jeans and a T, even to work. \n\nSometimes I change it up and wear sweatpants
1	Dark and minimalistic. Black jeans, black boots, black sweater, and dark green coat is my go-to winter outfit. 
1	24, male, teacher. Cossack haircut, well fitting plain t-shirt and jeans/chinoes, sports watch, awesome shoes, usually variants of allstars, then leather jacket or my awesome varsity jacket. Id say my jacket and shoe game is pretty much on point. At home I always change to fairly tight sweatpants :)
1	My style is more conservative/classic.  I work at a somewhat high end store and get a pretty good employee discount.  So my usual outfit consists of some pants, a button up shirt, a sweater or waistcoat, and boots.  My tastes are more masculine, but on days when I feel more feminine, I'll go with a nice dress with flats and a cardigan or jacket.  \n\nAnd most of my things are either blue, green, or a mix of the two.
1	Edgy Classic, mostly black with some dark green, grey, red.
1	To school or work : Jeans and a basic shirt or sweater\n\nTo hangouts or other stuff : Dresses\n\nColors : Dark Green, Blue, Bordeaux, Black and Floral
2	What is your mbti and love style?	
5	quality time/physical touch, i don't like giving or getting the other ones much
2	Istp, acts of service, physical touch 
4	love is for losers and weak people who cannot be alone
1	Quality time mostly. Not sure about the other ones.
11	Teach an Fi user to give no fucks like y'all	Please help. ISTPs seem to do what they want and have no qualms with people being offended in common interaction. Some people might be turned off by that, but I personally admire it a lot. I believe this is a function of Ti being in the dominant position for you all but I'd like to hear other your explanations on how this works for you.  
23	I am actually VERY insecure about how others feel, but only ever after the fact. And if I still believe I'm right (which I often do) I'm not going to say I was wrong just to make things better. I kinda hate it and I'm glad I'm an introvert because relationships (intimate and platonic) can get very tough to maintain when your mind works that way. People want to be right, or they at least want to know that you don't mind being wrong. I don't mind being wrong. I really don't. But I don't come across that way, and saying so doesn't really mean anything when you're still holding your ground. 
16	The only way I can explain it how I learned the term "self actualized" in psych classes. It's hard to explain, it's more of a feeling that I learned and embraced as I got older.\n\nIf I had to explain it, it's something like: I'm happy with the me I am, I owe who I am only to me, I worked hard to get here, so I'm my own top priority. My happiness is more important than people who would seek to minimize my happiness (for many various reasons). My values are important to me, and I generally admire those who espouse the same values and have zero fucks to give about people who act contrary to those values.\n\nI don't think it's a matter of not caring if I offend people. Since I live by my own personal code, it's important to me to respect other peoples' personal codes, so I try hard to understand and not overstep. But at the same time, to me, my code still trumps if there's something that runs afoul of mine, I'm back in "dgaf" mode.\n\nI don't know if that comes off well articulated or not. It's kind of hard to explain why you don't care about something because "not caring" is in itself, a lack of any sort of explanation. \n\nIf I had to overgeneralize with platitudes, it would go something like: you're the best you, be the best you, and if anybody tries to change that, they don't deserve any emotional investment on your part.
6	i honestly feel waves of gratitude nearly every day that i am not a feeler, so i sympathize with you. i am virtually unaffected by what those around me think and i’m pretty happy and content all the time. though there are great things feelers do for the people around them, it seems like you all mostly just suffer personally for it. both my sisters are INFJs, and i see this every dang day. your overall experience with anxiety also depends on how active your cingulate gyrus is, which is not something under an individuals control (as far as science knows so far). \n\nTL;DR: i cannot help you, i’m sorry <3
4	I don't care about certain things like I love to get into political debates or do things like talk about **things** that others shy away from or makes people angry.\n\nI guess it seems trivial to me that some things are taboo so I just don't care about it being a rule. But when it comes to asking someone something personal about themselves or their feeling or expressing certain feelings of my own sure I can get very nervous.
3	Vodka helps.
3	I strive to be honorable, I don’t always succeed. And I don’t mean “honorable when people are looking” or “ignore a person in need if I have plausible deniability.” or “only be honorable if you know the favor will be retuned in kind”\n\nSince I approach life in that manner it is much easier to think: I don’t give a shit about what you think of me. What I think of you is all that matters to me.
2	It's a process for me.\n\nStep 1: Do I know about this thing/person/ (or anything)?\n\nStep 2: If yes, do I have something new to add/say?\n\nStep 3: If yes, how will I say it in a way that it's going to be received as something helpful?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf answer to Step 1 question is No, I prefer to shut my mouth. People say it's IDGAF attitude. But really I'm just being honest to myself that I have no purposeful opinion to add. Or refraining from being /imsoverysmart\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	What type are you?
5	Sleep schedules?	Changing my sleep schedule may prove beneficial. Has anyone ever tried segmented sleep?  What sleep pattern do you have?
3	I have tried but not to make it constant. One thing I do like doing on occasion is to break up 8 hours of sleep into 2 segments. \n\n\n\nI work best between the hours of 2am-4am. My head is clear, its quiet and there are few distractions. I do very well going to bed around 10pm sleeping 4 hours and waking up at 2am. I then go back to bed around 4am-6am and sleep another 4-6 hours. The problem I have is that I feel a heck of a lot better after the first 4 hours of sleep than I do after the 2nd 4 hours, which leaves me feeling kind of tired all day but with the majority of my work done. I've found this schedule hard to keep two nights in a row but haven't been exactly disciplined with it. \n\n\n\nI do believe the modern 8 hour sleep schedule most people keep is almost a corporate model we've adopted. I often wonder what my farmer ancestors did as far as a sleep schedule. Frequent naps? Sleep whenever tired? Wake up in the middle of the night to restoke the fire? Work early in the morning when its cool and sleep during the heat of the day? 
2	The best quality of sleep I’ve ever had is from devoting about 10 hours to resting and sleeping about four hours, being up doing something chill for two, then sleeping another four. \n\nIt’s difficult to maintain, though, since eight hours a day goes to work and I like doing things in the evenings. 
2	I never tried segmented sleep, but regular sleep schedule helps me a lot.\n\n  \nI sleep for 8h, in exceptional situations minimum is 6h (if I drank a lot of alcohol i add one extra sleep hour). It is better to have 15-16 good hours than 18 shitty hours. When I do not sleep enough I'm very phlegmatic at morning and unproductive at work, but if I sleep well (and wake up before alarm) I have so much energy that I want to dance to music during making breakfast or destroy something with bare hands. \n\n  \nGoing to sleep at a fixed time allows for a better use of sleep time. Body accustomed to regular sleep hours produce hormones, regulates metabolism and do other magic things to fall asleep at specific hour, and wake up at morning with extra power.   \nI recently noticed that getting up very early is better than sitting at night (currently I try to wake up at 6 and go sleep at 21-22). I can go earlier to work, finish earlier and I have more motivation and energy to do things after work.   \n\n\nNever use snooze or set multiple alarms, extra 10 minutes will not make you feel rested, it's addictive, and it will fuck up your sleep cycle (I needed 3 months to fix my sleep cycle)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI use sleep as android app with mi band 2 to track sleep. For me the best feature of this app is go to sleep reminder based on lack of sleep in the last days.  For now I disabled smart wake up at optimal sleep cycle for more constant wake up time (its help me with snooze addiction)
1	~I use an app called Sleep Cycle, which gradually wakes you up based on a set time, and how deeply you are sleeping. Made it really easy to start getting up at 7AM.\n\nWorking back from that, I decided that going to bed at 11 would be best, with an alarm set for 10:30 for me to end up whatever I’m doing and start getting ready for sleep.\n\nProcrastinating in bed on Reddit is a bit of an issue, but I think some willpower should overcome that.~\n\nEdit: woah, totally missed the question. Haven’t given it a go, I like my 7 and a bit hours of sleep to happen without interruption. So can’t see myself wanting to break it up. Other than a trip to the loo then back
1	Go to a forum with navy personnel, former or present. The navy has the goofiest schedules, 4 hrs on 4 hrs off, 5 on 10 off, amongst various other concoctions. And they’re on that schedule for at least 6 month at a time.\n\nI’ve found that navy guys have some pointed opinions on this matter.
15	What's your use Of Se ?	In socionics, there's the concept of [Dimensionality of functions](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Dimensionality_of_functions) which is a way to describe the strength of each function. It works in four stages :\n\n* **1 Dimensional :** "Experience." Basically, trial and error is all you can do, aka, your own experience. \n* **2 dimensional :** "Norms". You can use your experience + the experience of others in the form of "norms". What's usually done, etc, even if you don't quite get why, you know the rules/norms. \n* **3 dimensional :** "Situation". You can use the norms, or what's commonly done, but you can also deviate of said norms and improvise in some situation. You see opportunities at one moment. It's not a social faux-pas, you actually succeed/get it better than the norm. \n* **4 Dimensional :** "Time" or "Globality". Not only can you improvise on a specific situation, you also can tell how it's going to evolve over time. If "situation" was a snapshot, then "globality" is a movie. Maybe includes the "Meta" level. \n\n***\nTo give some examples, both of our type have 4D Ti, aka, the level of globality. When we try to understand, we try to understand it on a "universally applicable" scale (at least, as an INTP, I do that. Is that accurate for you too ?)\n\nIf we compare it to others types :\n\n* INFJ have 2D Ti, or the "Norm" Level. They can learn, but they are pretty conventional in their thinking ? They don't really improvise, they don't really find a quicker way to do stuff. That's why they are kinda "by the book" in their approach (that's it, when they don't ignore Ti entirely). That's why they kinda like to quotes authors, like in philosophy, or find "Guru" of sorts ? \n* In ESTP/ENTP, Ti is 3 Dimensional, or at the "Situation" level. That?s why when you talk with one of them, they are right, etc, and can give you a run for your money in a debate, but that's it. They are right, but like, 80% right, it lacks sometjing. They didn't take the idea to it's logical end. They can follow in the debate, but they didn't really formalize it or saw the greater consequences of what they said.\n* In ExFx. Ti is 1 Dimensional, or "Experience". It's kinda trial and error for them, so even "simple" stuff looks complicated for them. I know one ESFJ girl and an ENFP who managed to fail a very simple test once. To me and my iSTP Friend, it looked so simple that it looked like a trap question, but they failed. It wasn't something they could know/learn, it was pure deduction. If they were shown, they probably would have been able to do it, though, but it was the first, so they failed...\n\nEtc, etc. Examples can be produced like that for all types.\n\n**Which brings us to my question :** What's your use of Se ?\n\nMine is 1 dimensional. It's trial and error for me, when I don't ignore it since it's my PolR/Blindspot function. Through research, I kinda understand what Se does, but not really.\n\nSo what Se thing do you notice in some situation ? What opportunities for you see ? What Se "Norms" do you understand you can break, while say, ENxJs don't understand ? How clueless do us INTPs and INFP look to you ?\n\nAsking here since the ESTP sub seems dead.
6	Se isn't working on its own, we use it through the lens of Ti and it's still influenced by Ni, which would give it that 4D characteristic you're talking about. Either way this varies greatly between person to person and the time in their life. At the baseline, Se probably contributes more situationally, but that goes to shit if you're caught in the Ti-Ni loop. So what does it look like? There's no clear answer since it's working through the personally applied logic of Ti. Functions can be understood on their own, but it's not the same in people. These traits will always be in relation to their stack and personal experience.\n\n\nThe closest thing I can give you to what you're looking for is 'grounded logic'. I can explain something to nearly anyone (in person) and make them understand. This is because Se points in a direction, and then Ti fires. This direction is grounded in the real world and facts that can be understood by anyone because we all live in the same world. I'm guessing other ISTP's share a similar unconscious understanding of the world around them just from living in it.\n\nAnyway I hope this helps you in some way.
3	I would say 3D, in general but mostly the Se, we are aware of what people do and are aware of what we did and when it comes to improvising Se is a perceiving function and we learn to improvise better as we grow up. Maybe that's just me, my improvisation skills aren't that great because I am still 19 and I got more Se to develop.
2	I'm very aware of my environment, and how it's affecting how I think, or the subjects of what I'm thinking, and what my day will usually turn out.\n\nFor example, I'm sitting right now at the balcony. I am observing almost everything, from how the glass looks when it's left at the window. From a far, I can see how the sunlight slides past through the coconut trees. There are hundreds of birds chirping up the two big mango trees next to our house. Some chickens are all over the garden based on the sounds they make. I know what's my mother is cooking based on the smell that goes up my room. I can tell the time based on the angle of the window light. I know it's low tide because people are going to the river to forage shells. Etc.\n\nBut I can also shut my Se off after picking a tangible object and then my Ti would deepen it. I can look at a tree, and then research the whole day about it, what furniture it can make, the cost, how long it would take to cut it down, etc..
1	My use of Se. I use my Ti to find everything I am a fucking bitch about. Then I use Se to be the exact opposite. Mostly in habits. And its hard to continue things all day. It can get really boring. But it is discipline for me which I try to overcome everyone with. \n\nLike, every Inconsitency I see in my life, I try to fix. Which is a long term goal and if something is fixed.. well you know the feeling. \n\nTo learn means to suffer. You don't learn in your comfortzone. And most of the time I can see my Ti comes up with some hardcore crazy shit if I am hustling against my fears and bad habits. \nAfter I realize.. my cock arise.\nBut only possible with the use of Se(which I try to improve with this way).
0	Survey on Flirting behaviors and personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
7	Just do nothing, i'm a pro
7	ISTPs: what’s flirting?
5	I honestly genuinely don't know what flirting even really is. 
1	Done, and done my friend
2	Favourite podcasts?	Ideally on Spotify but doesn't matter too much! Looking for all sorts of recommendations
1	I had a lot of fun with Reply All for a time. Check out episode 16 "Why is Mason Reese Crying" if you want just an episode to dive into, but my favorite is 64, the "On the Inside" series. They start by investigating Paul Modrowski, a man who's running a blog from prison. That's all I'll tell you but it gets pretty crazy, imo. True investigative journalism. \n\nHello Internet is a good "two dudes talking" podcast. Youtubers CGP Grey and Brady Haran talk about anything and everything. They're funny, have an interesting chemistry, and talk about some thought provoking subjects. \n\nLast Podcast on the Left is really funny, but can get really hard to follow if what you're looking for is a story. I'd start around the 40-100 range to get a good feel for them.\n\nRadiolab has some intriguing episodes, if you haven't already discovered them. That's where a lot of people get started with podcasts. \n\nAnd now my head hurts. I suck at recalling things I've already moved on from. Hope this helps!!\n
1	Sayer is a sci-fi story podcast, kept me up on many a long drive 
1	Optimally Living Daily. For those interested in productivity, self-improvement, constant learning etc. The guy narrates top blog posts by self-improvement bloggers, releases 1 audio clip per day. \n\nNot sure if it's on Spotify, but I use Overcast. I listen to it on commute to work every morning. Have learnt a lot and penned down key insights in my learning journal since. 
1	I used to watch the JRE once in awhile but now he sucks. Mostly only good when Joey Diaz is on. The Daily Wire I watch sometimes and sometimes Impaulsive
1	Joe Rogan, Secular Buddhism, Rubin Report, Dan Carlin\n\nBut\n\nI’ve basically only been listening to audible recently, totally neglected my podcasts, there’s probably hundreds of episodes to catch up on. 
2	ENTP or ISTP	So basically all the tests ive done so far came up as ENTP but I did one at  [https://www.sociotype.com/tests/](https://www.sociotype.com/tests/)  as someone suggested on the r/entp \n\nReading the descriptions I think im more of an entp but the redditor seemed quite sure of this test and that i'm an istp.\n\nI'm more confused about the whole types and which functions fit me. Thoughts?
2	The more tests you do and the more MBTI descriptions you read, the more confused you're going to get. I've only been privy to Jungian psychology, on which all of this is based, for a little over a week now. What I learned after taking my 7th test is that there's a lot of generalizations, sensationalized articles, and just straight up misinformation to dig through. If you *really* want to understand this to a point where you can actually apply it to your life, it's going to take some work on your part. \n\nSearching around on YouTube (I'm a true ISTP, so visual mediums are by far the best way for me to learn things), I quickly came across a channel by the name of C.S. Joseph. I've since watched multiple videos a day because this guy just... gets it. He's an awesome teacher and he really gets down to the heart of what Jungian psychology is all about. The production values are pretty baseline, but it doesn't bother me. The information and the way he puts it is invaluable.\n\nIf I were you, I would start with his "how to type anyone" video so you can A.) Get a pretty much immediate and 100% accurate answer to your question, and B.) Get a feel for the channel and the guy running it and see if it's what you're looking for. After that video, you're going to want to dig deeper and figure out what each of the type descriptors that he uses means so you can understand the type grid he shows you. I hope this helps!!
1	I thought i was entp for a long time. ENTPS never shut the fuck up and argue for the sake of arguing, whereas ISTPs are assholes who only care about themselves and argue for the sake of validating Ti ie being right
3	Is Dom Ti the most detached function from emotions and just in general ?	
5	I can't say if it's more or less detached than dom-Te.
2	Ti is Ti, it doesn't concern feelings directly, so in that sense, no. Say, Se isn't full of feeling eitheir, it's just Se. All the non F function are detached of feeling on their own.\n\nThat being said, the function aren't in a bubble. They all are part of the stacks . Having a strong Ti means you will have a weak Fi, and a weak Fe. As such, it's kinda true. Although, the same can be said for Te which push the F functions down too.\n\n
16	Making friends	Hey guys,\nSo I'm an istp, I live in an amazing warehouse of 30 people and I get along with everyone, I'm obviously closer to some people than others\nBut I don't seem to actually connect with anyone "properly", like I find it really hard to make friends, let alone close friends, join in a conversation or never know what to talk about etc\nDo you guys have any advice to give me ? How do you guys do with this kind of issue?\nI've also recently moved to London and except from the people I live in, I don't really know anyone else...
16	Not sure I can actually help you with this but I can at least say, you're not alone in this. I get the idea that I may present myself as standoffish. When I do converse with people, I have a tough time keeping the convo going and trying to find common ground. The things I'm working on to try and improve this are:\n\n1. Being excited to see them and to bring more emotion into the conversation/connection. I find this part the hardest. I tend to be all monotone and expressive-less by default.\n2. Trying to find common ground and branching from there. I'm trying to keep the HEFE method in mind (hobbies, entertainment, food, environment). \n3. Invite them to do something outside of what you normally do which they may be interested in.
8	I’m a female ISTP and I can relate. I can get along with other people but I can’t really seem to form close friendships or connect with someone properly. Although I’m totally fine and don’t think about it often, I do tend to ponder over it from time to time.  \n\nNot a lot of people approach me to start friendships either, probably my lack of charisma.\n\n
6	I have zero interest in speaking to people for the sake of socializing but I do understand the desire to socialize. I would suggest to find a hobby or interest that you like to do that also involves socializing with people whether it's DnD, hiking, or sports. There's bound to be locals there with similar interests.
4	I’d say a great start is find one you know you trust and be vulnerable with them. If they return the favor, it’ll lay the groundwork for a deeper bond and friendship. 
2	My job covers 99% of my spcializing needs
2	30 people? Next time you come home bring a couple cases of beer. Doesn’t matter if it’s that cheap tekate shit. Everybody likes the guy who brings beer. Maybe get some cups and play beer pong. 
1	Any Bipolar/BDD ISTPs here ?	
3	Nope?
2	Thought I was, WTF years are a bitch
2	Well this is odd. I've been trying to figure out my mbti type, can't settle on anything.\n\nWent from thinking INFJ -> ENFJ -> INFP\n\n(I was thinking of the cognitive functions, yes)\n\nBut then I think I just experienced my first episode of hypomania, and just got into my "normal" state after I dont know how long. So obviously my mental health is unreliable until I get to this doctors appt, so I dont think I can help.
23	I have a question for ISTPs and maybe INTPs about how you react to situations.	I’ve been wondering for awhile about my self and how I react to situations or don’t react, like a death in the family I just don’t feel anything, or once I was robbed and shot at and it didn’t bother me it was like I was playing a video game, or everyday things in my neighborhood shootings murders being in fights it just doesn’t bother me. \n\nThe thing is I’ve been aware I was like this for awhile but it’s starting to be more noticeable because of how I see people perceive me like I’m not human or something, and seeing how others react to stuff it’s like it’s a house fire but all I perceive is a small flame, let me know if any of you guys can relate.
29	Sounds more sociopathic. Not all sociopaths are evil assholes. Some of them are just normal people who genuinely don’t feel shit. 
12	I am ixtp,honestly I do react to situations but I do not get too emotional, it just pass by. I might cry at the time when the situations happened but at the next day I usually already feeling better and act like nothing big happened.
8	Yeah, this is common. The heroic flow state for IXTP is the Ti.\n\n\nYou can see this in boxing or professional fighting. Often it’s ISTP vs. ESTP in the ring, and the ESTP is very outwardly focused, while the ISTP is running through his practiced logic trees in his head.\n\nSince ISTP has tertiary Ni, which is underdeveloped, and unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of Ne alternatives, ISTP also has a pure sense of certainty.\n\nNi:  “I saw that I had to do it.” In which case, the actual strong functions take over. Ti does methodically what Ni has seen is the only course of action.\n\nINTP is a little different; they’re more stone cold parsing through vast quantities of alternatives for the working answer, but this is more done in a lawyerly way. An INTP can make fair, logical argument, accuse the other party of injustice, swing the sentiment of a room in a purely logical: if I say this, they will believe this, cold, sociopathic way.
7	same as an ISTJ , im a bit robotic/ autistic. yes its hard to feel 
12	Buddy , everyone thinks they have it all figured out in a crisis but then life punches you in the mouth 
5	I don’t react, I respond.  Everything has to process for a few seconds, but then I act.  Great for most emergencies, terrible for a fight.
4	OP, I react the same way basically. Death in the family (or a birth, etc. etc.) or some violent asshole accosts me in the street. My reaction is just 'meh'. Anger is the only emotion I feel very strongly and it takes someone being a total asshat to me to get that reaction.
3	Self-acceptance is a life-changing milestone for me, peaceful...\n\nDeath is never scary for me because from childhood i learned that it's a fact, what's variable is the when. I didn't feel sad when my grandparents died when i was in elementary school. My father just died the end of last year, i wasn't sad. I feel pity because he could not achieve his goal of witnessing at least one of his children get married. What scary /makes me sad is the suffering potentially preceding the death. \n\nI'm not good at affective forecasting anyway. I might feel entirely differently (e.g. optimistic instead of scared) in case i suffered from deadly disease. 
2	I too am a ISTP and act very similar in those situations. I've never been shot at, I have been robbed with a gun threat being made but I just was calm about it and gave the guy what he wanted (I didn't have anything of value so that part made me not care). I  sometimes think about what I would do if I did get shot and I concluded I would just have to accept it. When it comes to death it doesn't phase me much as it is a part of life everything that lives also dies. I also like to be happy about the life the person lived and not sad about the fact that they are gone. My friend who lived down the street from me died when we were in high school and it never really phased me I could only think about the good times we had. 
2	I just see most situations as everyday things cause that's kinda what they are. Somethings like being robbed or rough people coming up to me looking for shit catch me off guard and I do feel quite nervous but other things like witnessing a car crash or if a family member dies its just like thats an everyday thing. 
2	I feel the same as you when it comes to many situations. For me it comes down to "it is what it is", and no amount of worrying, or tears will change the fact that certain things happen, and can't be changed.
2	In general I don't react to deaths immediately. I mourn in private, but family deaths don't "excite" me immediately. I'm just like...well shit. That said, my parents have passed and when that happened it fucked me up pretty good, the first one for months. The second one was almost expected, like a sigh of relief...it was weird. \n\nI've also had an apartment broken into and that one fucked up my trust for a while as well. Now I'm paranoid of ground floors and windows, but in a careful way. 
2	Can't relate at all. \n\nSounds kind of sociopathic but I'm hesitant to suggest or peg it as that.\n\nIn emergencies I am calm but that never means my emotions have left or aren't there or can't be involved. It just means I'm not scared of danger. What I am scared of is losing people, it hurting others. \n\nSo it's not that ixtps (or at least istps) are robots, we're just not scared of what most are scared of. My fear lies elsewhere. 
2	Infj. Been robbed multiple times, sometimes been able to scape, sometimes not. I don't feel particularly anything about it? Feel the same about gunshots, broken bones, exploded fingers, knifes, bleeding. I don't have any reasons to do not deal with this things as trivial. \n\nIt can happen to anyone, anytime. (For me) being prepared is key.\n\nFamiliarized with the "non human" side of being perceived by others. 
2	Usually when it comes to grief and traumatic situations, Fi comes out of the shadow. To say that we don't have emotions is a lie, though we generally repress Fi with Fe.  \nWhat you are describing is maybe more along the lines of desensitization from being exposed to a lot of hardship.
2	My man! I have similar experiences of not feeling anything in particular from death of a family member and seeing incidents like i'm in a video game.\n\nI think its more because we've Ti-ed the situation already and went to problem solving mode. No Fe involvement needed\n\nMy blalala died: "Oh, well humans die eventually...nothin i can do to change it. Oh well, that happened." OR, "huh, should i cry and wail? What's the point in doing that? Its not like it'll change anything."\n\nSomeone got shot: "oof, that sucked. He still alive? He got insurance? Is he safe now? Ok. Any other shitstorm happening that might affect me if i stay around here? Yes, oh ok i'm gonna go now, good luck."\n\n
2	Yeah, I feel you. Roommate is an E/F type. anything I would consider a negligible event, she blows it out of proportion. 
2	I think you react, you just superunaware of that. You are concentrated on your Se I guess. It is mostly ISTP shit, not INTP. INTPs softer, they don't show, but they feel the shit out of things. As about ISTPs, ISTP reacts emotionally when his Introverted Thinking switches on Introverted Intuition and after Extraverted Feeling and hell starts. \n\nBut if you are a more healthy ISTP, your Introverted Thinking switches on your Extraverted Sensing and you become literally like James Bond. It is just ISTP's standard role in society, **a troubleshooter, mechanic in emergency situations.**
2	It depends on how close I am to someone who died. I grew up in a very large family and relatives, so every year there's always someone who passed away. I didn't feel anything. It's more of a curiosity of how they died, and the relation of this person to the people who he/she left. \n\nWhen my first boyfriend died, it's a totally different game. And also when my grandfather passed away. I lost my shit. I sobbed like a fucking retard.
1	I'm not sure whether I'm ISTP or ISTJ, but that's exactly how I am. To be honest, that happens mostly when other people are around me and I know they are reliable enough to fix this situation, and then I just get so nonchalant about the whole thing I become completely useless and just watch other people freak out / take care of things. When I'm on my own and something happens I take action but I do get nervous about the whole thing if it's something quite serious.
10	Being put on the spot	How do y’all handle it? For instance, at work if you’re being asked a question in front of 10 coworkers. Or just any group setting and you’re expected to talk / verbalize. \n\nDo you calmly get to the answer or does it go in 100 different directions to try and answer it? Sometimes feel like I’m good, sometimes not. 
8	I learned a trick to not do that.  If I have a piece of paper, I start writing for a couple seconds to give me time to get rolling, then I do pretty good.  If I don't have a piece of paper, I repeat the question while thinking of the answer. If I just start talking, I tend to wander.
6	I really don't mind it, but I'm slow and deliberate, so I'll take my time to answer.
5	It kinda depends on my mood. If I'm feeling confident I'll give a boastful answer. If I'm feeling a little depressed I tend to stutter and struggle to find the right words. 
3	That doesn't really bother me. I can usually come up with something that sounds good and more or less represents what I actually think about the subject. What bugs me is being made to elaborate. I *do not* like being the center of attention. 
3	Normally I would put on a pensive expression and take my time to answer, but if conditions are right I'll crack a joke or give a sarcastic answer and formulate a good response during the ensuing laughter.
2	Doesn't bother me at all.  Unless it's phrased as a simple question but it actually has a very complex answer.  It can sometimes take me a few moments to translate and parse down the answer into a coherent soundbite.
2	i've learned to ignore the pressure and think for a few seconds about how to react, but sometimes i'll panic and not be able to think of anything intelligent to say
1	Entirely dependent on how much I know about the subject in question. It's ok to say you don't know, unless you absolutely should know. The best approach is to prepare prepare prepare and get ahead of potential questions. If I'm lazy, and don't keep my mind on my work, my knowledge gets lax and it shows in my ability to produce information or input. I come away from those instances wanting to know more so I can be more effective. And frequently, if I was unable to answer something right off, I will follow up with the questioner if possible to provide further clarification. So, in the end, it's a mentality of accountability, for me.
1	Not a problem.
1	I usually handle it well. 
1	On the spot is when I am at my best
1	Handle it totally poorly. Make up some bullshit that somehow everyone tolerates, if not agrees with and praises me for.
22	Thoughts on physical pain?	A long time ago, even as a kid, I decided pain is temporary, and it really is. Of course there were the times where I cried and bawled at getting needle shots stuck in me but some time after that, I decided I can just wait for pain to go away. Getting winds knocked out of me, just sit for a minute and wait. Getting charlie horsed might make me chuckle and limp for a bit, of course it hurts if it's hard enough. And I don't know what getting literally shot is like but I imagine one of my reactions going something like, "Are you serious?" I'm curious about whether or not other ISTP's are like this, too. I'm not a masochist haha.
17	hmm..i dunno if it is ISTP specific , but i also have a high pain tolerance.  i just tell myself that it's my nerves telling me there's something wrong, and i recognize that, and then just deal with it.  \n  \none time i hit myself in the leg with an axe while splitting wood.  it took a chunk out of my shin.  my skin and flesh were splayed open and you could clearly see my shin bone.  i got a ride to the hospital, and walked into the emergency room.  i go to the counter and ask for some assistance.  i am remaining calm at this point, but in a lot of pain obviously.   the nurse behind the counter gives me a clipboard and says, "fill this out".   i ask to be seen quickly and she dismisses me.  i then hike my leg up onto the counter and take off the wrap that was holding my skin and flesh together.  my leg is laid bare to her and point to my bone and say, "this hurts a lot.  can i please have something while i wait for the doctor?"  \n   \nshe catches her breath and yelps, "ah! ugh!  yes!  come with me!  come through these doors!"   i got helped right away :)   
12	Reading the comments made me feel like I'm a little bitch.\nCan't take pain for shit. Though it's not always the pain itself, that upsets me, it's more of a fear of the wound getting infected or staying as a scar. Usually it's "Shit, I hope this thing heals by itself, I really don't wanna visit the hospital".\n\nSo yeah, maybe it's not actually the pain that sucks, but the permanent damage that can follow.\n
10	Like u/bumpty, I also look at pain as just warning signals that something wrong. I think of it like a little alarm or diagram in cockpit displaying damage to a robot or something.\n\nThat's when I feel pain though. Some times I wonder if I even do feel pain, because I can't remember the last time I felt pain. I hit my head hard on concrete a week ago, I don't recollect any pain or anything
7	I dont know if its ISTP specific, but ive had a few times where ive gone to the hospital, once in an ambulance. The time i rode in an ambulance i split my head open in a logging accident, (wasnt wearing a hard had, learned a lesson) and when i was sitting at the volunteer fire station waiting for the ambulance i was trying to calm my brother down even though i had 2 people pulling wood chips out of my skull and trying to stop the bleeding. Haha i have a pic somewhere of me in a neck brace covered in blood giving a thumbs up with my brother 
5	Thoughts on physical pain? It literally is the way the brain warns you of something being wrong in that area.\n\n\n\n\nDo you know the cause? Is it not that bad? Chill if it doesn't last long;\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you not know the cause? Is it not bad? Chill if it doesn't last long.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know or not the cause and does it hurt bad? Either do something or wait until it goes away. Is it taking too long? Go check it at a doctor.
3	I was just thinking about this while walking in the snow and wind the other day, with my face completely frozen. I have this thing where I can almost embrace certain types of pain and then it subsides. I usually close my eyes for a second and let out a slow exhale and the pain fades.  \n\n\nI haven't broken any major bones but I did tear a tendon in my foot when I was younger that made me yelp like a dog whenever I bumped it the wrong way. That kind of sharp immediate pain is much harder to control in my opinion. I always feel foolish when I hurt myself doing something stupid. 
3	ISTP's have a big ego about being physically tough
3	Another thing I forgot was when I was getting appendicitis but it wasn't figured out yet, but right before they figured it was appendicitis, the health aide was pushing on my bottom right abdomen which would cause an intense, sharp pain. Instead of exclaiming Ow, I would flinch, raising my leg up. My mom, knowing me and my pain tolerance, had to tell the health aide I was hurting hah. Blah
2	stop being a punk and walk it off!!....which has led me to having to go to the ER multiple time in my life and do NOT recommend 
2	I'm an ISTP and I do have a pretty high pain tolerance.  For physical and emotional pain.  I've broken a few bones, had a couple kidney stones, smashed my toe so hard my toenail fell off.  And I've been through some bad tragedies.  I was pretty stoic through it all.  Never go to the doctor unless it's very obvious I need to.  Like when my forearm was broken into a 90 degree angle.  I think because our main function is introverted thinking aka logic, we are able to keep our head and talk ourselves through these situations.
2	yea im pretty good at that
2	Hi. High pain tolerance here also. I tend to fall under the belief that part of the human experience is to test your limits and understand what you're capable of. This naturally leads to doing a lot of stupid things and injuring myself because the only way to know your limits is to pass them on occasion.\n\nBecause of the "voluntary" nature of it, I'm regularly classified as a masochist. 
2	[deleted]
2	I also have a high pain tolerance, but idk if it's ISTP-related. I recently got DNA testing done, and learned that my higher pain tolerance is genetic. 
2	Pretty sure my pain tolerance is low, but I like the sentiment that pain is temporary. That is, until it's not. I always dislike the thought of life-altering injuries, or even small injuries that will affect me for the rest of my life. I used to assume I was invincible.\n\nNow, even with moderately low tolerance, I realize that pain is simply brain signals tied to nerves. Pain isn't anything except mild electrical signals. It's usually there as a warning sign of something, so pain is good to pay attention to but something that needs to be shut off or at least turned down most of the time.
2	It all really comes down to what causes the pain. Like you said, there's temporary pain like charlie horses and getting the wind knocked out of you, but then you have longer lasting pain like physical injuries or getting your wisdom teeth taken out. Drugs help a little, but they still hurt like a bitch
2	Pain is inevitable in life, suffering is optional.\n\nI also have high tolerance for physical pain. I learned that the more you ruminate about the pain, you inflate its importance, the longer it lasts and then possibly turns into suffering. So i never give a serious attention to it and just move on with my activity. It might also because overall i'm an optimistic person? Istps in general might too?: pain is temporary i can get it over with.\n\nSome people commented about not liking to see a doctor / go to hospital. I would say hospitals and doctors are part of sickcare instead of healthcare. It's very rare a doctor advises you how to prevent symptom/disease, they prescribe or take a look at your health. It's how they make money. I also hate pharma industry. They are trying to keep you sick and earn a lot. That's why i take good care of my health: proper nutrition, sleep, exercise, meditation, and just enough social contact (for mental health, we're social animal anyway).
2	I think I have quite a high pain tolerance. for instance, last summer I cut my finger very deeply on a scythe and had to get stitches put in and was also asked to go on antibiotics for some reason. I hadn't actually realized it happened until I saw a fuck ton of blood all down my hand and on the floor. When I patched myself up I was just laughing about it. After about a week I was just biting the stitches off. Similar thing happened when I was using a power washer and it tore away some skin off my hand,I was just like "that shit stings" .   \nI also have done many tattoos on myself, with machines and stick n pokes and I can just do it and I think I just disregard the pain cause I know what im getting myself into.
2	High pain tolerance here as well. 
1	I like the comments of not going to doctors or hospitals unless we think we need to. I'm the same way. I tell myself there's no point in going to a clinic cause they'll give something for a fever or headache and tell me to drink a lot of liquids, and not something for the sickness, most times. I especially don't look forward to attitudes of doctors and nurses in the town (I live in a village). To me, I get the vibe of, "Why'd you come here? Didn't have to get seen."
1	Sometimes I'm so so numb to pain. For some reason i though i was running my thumb up and down the back (blunt) side of a stanley knife, and then turned out i was rubbing the Blade - I only realised this when I had sliced through my skin and there was blood. I was a bit too calm about it though, just held my thumb together until it started healing
24	ISTP here looking for a tactful, dignified way to avoid small talk.	Hey, Y'all! Lovely sub you have, though I do wish it were more active. But, I digress. The point of this post is to gather opinions, experiences, and resources that relate to avoiding small talk when you're forced to be around a group of people for an extended period of time. \n\nA few things I think you should know before you answer: \nI am new to Typology and still reside somewhere just below the surface as far as my understanding of it all and how I can apply it to the outside world. I'm a pretty magnetic and warm person, or so I've been told. I'm sure that a lot of you relate there, and as ISTP's I'm assuming you would also relate to not really wanting to stretch that trait past pleasantries. It's easy for me to come across as if I genuinely want to "meet" people and know their stories. I genuinely do not know how to be unfriendly or standoffish (unless I'm angry, but that's another post for another day), and it often leads me to being neck-deep in conversations that I just could not care less about. As I'm sure a lot of you are aware, I don't actively feel this way to be rude. I just don't see it as important and I lose interest very quickly, which results in me feigning interest (poorly, in my mind) and makes me feel awkward and self-conscious. I think you get the picture. \n\nSO. Here in a few months, I'll be attending a rafting trip with the managers of most (if not all) of the different departments at the lodge I will be working for this summer. This is so each department head can get familiar with one-another in a fun, no-pressure setting. The only thing I get a little anxious about when playing this trip out in my head is the possibility of being locked into lengthy conversations where I'm pretending to care about people's life stories and the like. I've been in this type of situation in this type of environment before; it almost always swiftly turns into a sort of "Look where I've been, look what I've done" casual pissing contest and I just don't want to be a part of it this time. So, since this post has been long enough for a simple question, I'll get to the point:\nI just want to appear friendly and genuine without inviting eeeeeveryone's story hour during this rafting trip. I'm wondering if any of you could offer some insight, perhaps even some examples (since I AM a true visual learner) of ways in which you've managed to accomplish something along those lines. Thank you very much for taking the time to read. EXTRA thanks for taking the time to reply. And in my mind and heart, you're all heroes regardless. Keep doin what ya do ISTP's. 
17	>  I just want to appear friendly and genuine without inviting eeeeeveryone's story hour during this rafting trip. \n\nThat's a tall order. When you appear friendly, people tend to talk to you about their lives. It's really difficult to avoid that while still appearing friendly. So at the end of the day you have to find the balance between how friendly you'd like to be perceived to be and how much time you want to spend being bored by people's irrelevant stories.
8	Would it be an option to try and find common interests / values and talk about those? \n\nIt doesn’t remove talk, but hopefully the bullshit parts you aren’t interested in 
14	- Earphones, even if there's nothing playing.\n\n- Don't make eye contact with people if you don't want them to talk to you.\n\n- Just don't respond, yeah you look like an asshole but you probably don't give a shit anyways.\n\nWith these 3 tips, you will never have to experience small talk ever again.
3	I've found that body language and gaze direction is a big thing. If you make an effort to not be fully engaged, like if you continue doing your thing while someone comes up to chat and don't stop your work to meet their eye contact, most people will see immediately that you're not interested in a long chat. It also shows them that your work is more important. \n\nI haven't been rafting but I'm guessing there will be work involved such as tying things up, moving equipment around, etc, so I've found that people generally don't like to bother the "busy" people. 
2	Only thing I can think to suggest offhand is to not ask questions. At work, often customers will ask "how are you?" (or similar). Expected response from me "Fine thanks, how are you?", but I typically just go with "Fine thanks", and stop talking. Usually results in getting straight down to business. Problem is, in a social environment, cutting out small talk usually results in awkward silence, and nobody really likes those. Other than that, if you can appear to be part of a group conversation, you can let others talk while you nod and smile along, and listen if you want to!
2	Unless you're stuck in a 121 setting the whole day, there will be people in the group that will "brag" about themselves and you just have to listen (or pretend) like the rest. When/if it's your turn just keep it to the minimum and pass the ball to the next person.\n\nAbout 121 conversations, it's up to you to control it by the amount of questions you'll ask. There are also tricks to stop the conversation like having to go to the toilet, fetch a drink...
2	Make sure you get plenty of "I" time and be cognizant of when your battery for social time gets low.  We can do some damage when when we're really not wanting to be in a group.  Find a reason to excuse yourself.  Even be honest about it.  "This introvert needs a break from you talkers."  Attempt to get understood or everyone will make incorrect assumptions about you.
2	Stop worrying about it ahead of time.  You might read up on tips and tricks for conversation, but once the moment gets here, you'll just roll along with what seems good then.  You'll be fine.  Definitely find common interests, even if it's work related (just not *about people* at work.)  Movies and TV work well as topics almost universally.  Gear, the rafting trip or the things that you notice around you as a sensor that they might miss also works well and highlights your strength.  "Check out that rock" is actually a pretty good conversation starter or distraction.\n\nReally, this is a pretty low stakes situation and as an ISTP, an environment that you may take to naturally, where your situational awareness and the ability to remain calm in intense environments will stand out..  Don't overthink it -- so long as you don't get drunk, your team mates will likely leave thinking better of you than when the trip started.  Edited to say, that you should just go to bed early anyway, get some solo time, and avoid potential nightime foolery.
2	Don't avoid it. Try to get better at it as it is a vital skill to have in business and life in general.\n\nI hate most smalltalk too but have become better at it over the years. That doesn't mean I am a social guru now but it makes connecting with people easier and less awkward.
2	Change your response. Instead of nodding and being attentive when one of the guys starts bragging, just say ok\n\n"Ya know, this one time when I was 9 I caught a shark half my weight" \n\n"Ok."
1	Act as if you don't care then they'll get the message and leave maybe
1	Strategically, don't worry about it, but tactically, what about whittling?  It's situationally relevant, you can do it constantly for days, stay on the periphery of conversations and no one will think you're anti-social, just that you are dedicated to finishing your piece before the end of the trip.
1	Fake it til you make it. For work stuff I will try to turn small talk into a topic that interests me so it's easier to socialize. Just practice, since doesn't come naturally to us.\n\n  In my personal life outside of work, I do not give a fuck about trying for small talk and just physically avoid people I can tell will try to talk my ear off. 
1	You type a lot for a person who “doesn’t like small talk” and is knowingly asking other people who don’t talk a lot.\n\nBeing genuine is easy for ISTPs because we don’t really care what people think. You, however, seem to care what people think.\n\nI think you’ve either mistyped yourself or you’re 19 and haven’t actually settled into your personality yet. In both cases, just chill. You’ll be fine.
0	I wear  fuck off hat. Too agressive?
9	Good ways to differentiate between ISTPs and ESTPs?	Hello, isTipays, interested in both your theoretical and anecdotal views on how to spot an ISTP vs an ESTP? Sometimes I find it hard to tell without testing someone (which I practically cannot do in many cases).\n\nInterested in how you’d see yourself being different both in physical and virtual settings. \n\nThanks very much :-)
13	Anecdotally ESTP are more adaptable in social situations. They are more charming because of tertiary Fe. They tend to say more controversial things because of PoLR Fi. ISTP on the other hand are more cautious because of inferior Fe so they are more afraid of offending people. Not because they care so much, but they have a harder time difusing the situation with low Fe and don't want to appear socially inept as well since we tend to be more self conscious with our inferior function. 
5	ESTP stays till the party is over and organizes the after party.  ISTP makes an Irish Goodbye at 11 -- either solo or with a couple others to go chill.
6	ISTP and ESTP might be hard to differentiate if they don’t seem either extroverted or introverted, but one of the quickest ways to determine which mbti type they are is to see them in multiple social situations. These social situations could be with family, work, school, friends, etc. I will go over those four situations and how each type would likely act\n\nFamily- ISTP’s are more comfortable with family, so they could act more extroverted, however an ESTP in a family situation would be known to be very active, a charming person, who likely has a bigger ego than a fellow ISTP. In this scenario, if the person likes to be around people more than a known introverted family member, they could likely be ESTP\n\n\nWork- An ESTP is generally well liked, as they are outgoing, and are known to be popular. Some people might not like how they tend to put themselves first, and act impulsively in work. Once again, the more outgoing they are, the more likely they are ESTP. The ISTP can struggle in new environments, though they have P instead of J, because of their introversion, if they have a harder time communicating with others they are likely an ISTP\n\nSchool- The General stereotype for an ISTP in school is to not care about School, but from my experience of ISTPS, though that tends to be true for some individuals, ISTPS are generally inclined with specific topics, though it might not be school related. They are called Virtuoso for a reason.  Once again, if they aren’t charming others, class clown/popular outgoing kid, they are likely ISTP. The ESTP on the other hand might observe the situation, realize how to act, then go on to their charming, outgoing personality. It will be hard to know the difference if an individual is only 50-65% extroverted ESTP, but if they are in the “popular group”, or are known to be well liked by most individuals, likely an ESTP.\n\nFriends- ISTP’s with 35-50% extroversion might be outgoing with their friends, but they likely won’t be able to communicate with their peers as well as ESTPs, resulting in them having a smaller friend group. While on the other hand, ESTPs are known to be the impulsive charmed of the group, and will definitely have a much more outgoing egotistical attitude compared to an ISTP. \n\nI hope this small amount of information of the stereotypical types help you differentiate between the two 
2	Hmm reading this thread makes me realize I'm somewhere in between ISTP/ESTP
1	They are quite hard to tell the difference.\nThe main one is that the ISTP is a rational type. They orient themselves around their subjective logic. They are similar to INTP in that respect, but perceive with Se/Ni rather than Ne/Si.  \nWhereas ESTP is an irrational type. They orient themselves around objective senses. Ti is not as prevalent, especially the younger the person is, and it merely serves the dominant function.  \nBut the primary focus of the ESTP is sensation whereas the primary focus of the ISTP is their logic.
1	I don't care about guessing people's mbti in real life. I use it to understand myself. Some tell me theirs. I use that to my advantage, e.g. to be okay to stay inexpressive in front of intj, or to just dance to music in front of infp. I never know a confirmed estp, beside the fact that i don't have that wide of a circle.\n\nStreotypically i read that estps are charming and have many friends? More impulsive and less capable of dealing with theory than istps?\n\nCurious on how you use mbti in real life. Why do you care to distinguish them?
8	What's your views/opinions on ISFPs?	What do you like and dislike about them. 
8	My brother is an ISFP.\n\nOne of the things I've always noticed is his (as best as I can describe it) attachment and nostalgia when it comes to creative things in life.\n\nWhile he's very down to earth and relatable, definitely not head in the clouds like INFPs I know, he has very strong emotional ties to certain landmarks around the world, or certain imagery, and will go to great lengths to take photos and hang them up in poster format within his various spaces. One thing that can be hard to pick up about ISFPs is how incredibly deep their emotional side can be, given how relatable and stable they can be otherwise. \n\nI find this quite interesting, and I like seeing that he is essentially what I could have been like if I were instead a feeler while keeping mostly the same functions.\n\nWhat I tend to dislike is that his Fi seems to have this weird stubbornness / attachment to things being exactly a certain way, or being unwilling to try new things. It's different to Si, but it's similar. I've tried extremely hard to get him to try new foods to no avail.\n\nThis part seems much more apparent with INFPs, but otherwise I think ISFPs are closer to us relationally than our commonly associated INTPs.
6	The girls are generally always pretty hot.
3	People I get along with very easily. Also ISFP girls....
1	Very noble but incredibly oversensetive 
1	Mostly harmless. 
1	Control freaks. \n\nGood people to know casually, great as the grandmother of a friend, and good coworkers unless you are an istp and resent control, terrible partners.
1	cute
0	They’re all individual people who deserve the time to show you who they are instead of making useless assumptions based on a 4 letter code. 
0	Conscious/Awareness before birth?	I don't know where else to share this right now but thought it'd be something interesting to share in this istp place. \nI opened my eyes, small space, light coming through this, canvas, or layer, of something, and little red lines are visible because of the light. Veins? I shake or something and at the same time, close my eyes or go back to sleep. Lot of peeps on the internet I saw say we're incapable of memory even before 2 or 3 years old. Another part of this is my mom and dad got married while I was growing in the womb. Part of the marriage was sipping red wine. When I was very young, I was watching my parents' marriage tape and started freaking out at the part my mom sipped the red wine. I was hysterical, "Mom look that's when I had Fire Water!! Look right there fire water!" Hope that was interesting.
9	Sounds like you have a very active imagination.  It's a gift.
6	everybody gets false memories 
5	Maybe your mom had a little too much fire water when she was pregnant with you...
2	Interesting. It's possible that we have memory from birth. But, not in the sense of vivid long-term memory. More like my action - my mother reaction. E.g. if i cry and my mother come comforting me or giving me food, i would just cry if i'm hungry or if i wet myself.\n\nI also wonder if light can penetrate the uterus. I understand that you can feel the light even though you've closed your eyelids. Maybe the skin/flesh to uterus is thicker and less translucent?
21	question for other women istps	I've been reading this book about how to use liminal thinking to reprogram your unconscious assumptions, and I started to think about how I have unconscious assumptions relating to "expressing emotion." \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to cut the preamble there, basically: I think that I have programmed fake "emotional responses" that I developed to meet social expectations of being a woman. This is not a conscious thing at all. I act out emotional responses that someone "should have" in a situation or in reaction to something, but I don't actually "feel" those emotions. The only emotion I strongly feel is anger. Anyone else? Could it be a result of unconsciously held assumptions or programming?
18	I agree.\n\nIn many conversations I have with women I notice my feminine responses are only feminine because that's how I'm supposed to act, not because that's my initial response.\n\nNot going to change that because it makes my life easier.\n\n&#x200B;
9	Anger would prob be the strongest emotion I feel too. Mostly because of all the fallacies that were all surrounded by on a daily basis. It’s all about thinking and removing yourself from the situation before reacting. You should look into some different philosophies and adopt some principles that can help you see things in different perspectives. Stoicism is my favorite, “we are not affected by events, but by the views we take on them”. The external world is completely out of your control, but what you can control is your level-headedness and your way of navigating through it. \n\nRegarding trying to meet expectations of what we’re suppose to be like as females I can see where your coming from. You might’ve picked up on certain behaviors you may perceive as being deemed as acceptable in our culture/society. When I go into work I have to put on a mask for eight hours so customers don’t leave us bad reviews. The first two weeks I acted like myself, and got three reviews with people saying I was rude, arrogant, and detached. You can either take that criticism personally or use it to improve upon yourself. I think most people expect you to be bubbly and extroverted in the hotel industry. I had to decide whether I would quit and work somewhere else, or adapt. 
7	I relate to what you say about acting the expected emotion. It's funny when someone throws a curve ball at me and I'm like "nope, no idea what face to make here. You get furrowed brow, pursed lips, and slight nod."
7	Guy here, feel like anger is the one emotion of myself i understand \n
5	Yup.  Definitely relate.  Anger and joy are the only emotions that I can feel and recognize in real-time.  Everything else is on a time delay, if I feel it at all.  Or it’s simply a scripted response that I’ve learned to follow in order to function in society.\n\nA big part of the reason that I’m such a loner now is because I burned out my “give a fuck” circuit from being fake for so many years.   Faking emotional responses.  Actively thinking through how I should be responding and behaving in various situations because my natural response is apparently not socially appropriate.\n\nI learned pretty early on that the golden rule, “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” simply doesn’t apply for me.  How I want to be treated is apparently horrifying and cold to the average person.  So I have to spend obscene amounts of energy figuring out how others want to be treated and then playing that role.\n\nIt’s exhausting work for far too little reward.
6	so yes and no—somehow. lol. this is me.. but not quite. i would say i actually DO care about people and their dumb life shit, but the way i care is by helping them, not taking on or mirroring their feelings. i am a career coach, so people come to me all day every in half hour or hour increments to talk about how to reach their goals and organize their lives, and there are a LOT of sob stories and awkward come to jesus moments. somehow i’ve just been able to skip feeling (or pretending to feel) the emotions most people would by jumping to what we can do to solve the problem. then once we get a little ways into that, i’ll say some reassuring things or ask some questions to get them to start transitioning from ‘woe is me’ to ‘this is not the end of the world after all’, and that’s my way of making sure they do actually work through their feelings. but i’ve never felt like my pretending to feel something would help (in my particular setup/life). and work is the only time i speak to people i don’t know intimately. lmao
6	Yeah, it's because we're lacking in the compassion and empathy departments, not because we're sociopathic dicks ;) I've found that I'm very selectively empathetic and it usually has everything to do with something I've experienced myself or something I can foresee as possibly happening to me.  I'm getting better at being less selective, as I'm in my 30s and have had lots of public facing practice, but as quickly as I turn that on, I turn it off, because it's exhausting to use and feels disingenuous.  \n\nOtherwise, yes.  I feel strong and passionate anger.  I've also had 30+ years of experience in dealing with the negative outcomes of that and learning to control it.  I think it might be a very early learned reaction in young TP girls in response to also being misunderstood from a young age.  As early as you can feel misunderstood and manipulated, you can feel anger.  I think in many ways anger is a TP female's most developed emotion, especially if we grew up in SFJ dominated households, at least.  \n\nThis is my completely on the fly assessment.  Arguments welcome.\n\n--intp
5	I completely understand that. My reaction to bad news or even something that others find amazing is fairly monotone on the inside, but I have default responses for people. Oddly enough, many people find my reactions sincere which surprises me, but I keep it up anyways because connections are how the world works in this day and age.
1	It's the inferior-Fe. We have relatively low experience in social interactions because Ti prefers alone time and space. The closest thing we can do it is to feel/act on our feelings deliberately (to keep harmony). When confronted with new or extreme emotional situations, we get pumped up easily. Thus, anger (or walking away to avoid being angry).

1	Well I don’t know if it’ll help to give you an ENFP perspective, but I always like to compare to see if something is type specific or more universal. I’m a female and I often feel a lot of pressure to say things that are not honest to my girlfriends and it drives me crazy. That’s why for a very long time, my closest friends were all guys. I couldn’t stand how much I hated myself for just smiling and telling someone that their hair looked great when it didn’t. I hate funerals and how fake it seems. The last two funerals I went to were for people I cared about deeply, but were not always good people. It made me very angry and uncomfortable to hear people say dishonest and broad sweeping things about the person. I cried about their deaths in private but didn’t feel sad at the funerals. I don’t feel emotional at weddings either except once when it was my closest friends. Is that what you mean about emotional responses? \n\nBut I do feel emotions strongly. I feel sad, happy, and cry during movies. I also feel anger really strongly, but I think it’s a strong emotion, so that’s natural. I also care about people a lot and I don’t like seeing them hurt when it’s real. I’d be curious to hear how to relate or don’t relate to this! 
1	Female ISTP - it’s the strong emotions, especially anger I’ll feel the most. As a woman it’s really hard because it’s expected to be a certain way. In a team of men at work they all say I’m the cold-hearted one. \n\nOne thing I feel like is that we do recognize emotions just the same as others, but they aren’t the most important thing going on in a situation. I see this mostly at work when dealing with someone’s performance issues. If someone just isn’t doing a good job, but they’re likable, or they seem like they want to do a good job, it won’t make a difference to me. I’ll recognize the feeling of empathy and then move on - it’d be unfair to let an emotion get in the way of solving a problem. I also think society confuses empathy with enabling way to much. 
1	I dunno if I'm much help here, because emotions come naturally as I'm opposite of ISTPs. Anger is just confusion about emotions because it's just a mix of irrational conflicting emotions.   \n\n\nI guess the feeling of not feeling is a bit of detachment and unwillingness to take chances to be vulnerable.   \nHere's a bit about dealing with feelings when dealing with others: [https://youtu.be/n3Xv\_g3g-mA?t=504](https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA?t=504)
1	neat
1	I also operate in the same way as you: logic based emotion. In situation A people expect to get reaction X so i give it to them, situation B reaction Y, and so on. Internally, i usually feel just neutral. \n\nBut whether i care to "express" emotions depends on the person. E.g. my brother knows i never react strongly to anything, so it's safe to stay stoic in front of him. If i deal with expressive new person, i will try to be more expressive as well as not to kill the (happy?) vibe. \n\nThis is because like any other conscious brain process, logic based emotion is exhausting and energy hungry. You have to keep the map between situation and expected reaction in your working memory. Actual emotion is unconscious and therefore more energy-efficient.\n\nAs for anger, i used to feel it strongly when i was a child. Now i'm in my late 20s and i don't give a crap for people trying to disturb my zen mind. Mindful meditation also helps a ton.\n\nMay i know the title of the book? I want to learn more about emotion beyond the amydala, but never find enough time to satisfy all my interests..
5	Would you like to know that your friend might potentially be seriously ill or would you rather not be bothered until there was certainty?	Probably very individual, but I'm still interested in inputs. If a person you love was awaiting a test, that might show a serious health condition, would you like to know? There's nothing to do but wait and it might even turn out to be nothing serious going on. And out of curiosity, how would you react if you were told?\n\nEdit: Here's some context: \nI (INTJ/f/36) is the one waiting for the test. Haven't told anyone because I hate when people react with feeling sorry/try to comfort me. The pressure was getting to me (much as I hate to admit it), so I told my ISTP/m/35 friend. And just as I expected he had the only reaction I needed. Basically "This sucks. Hope it turnes out well". \nIt was really helpful until my over-analyzing INTJ mind kicked in: "Did I just worry the shit out of my friend to make my self feel better? Would he rather not know since there's nothing to be done but wait?"
12	Of course I'd like to know. I won't have much of a reaction, but I'd tell them that I hope everything will turn out fine.
10	We handle information much better than most. \n\nMost people in your shoes share an issue with the expectation of getting emotional support. We suck at emotion support. Our first inclination is to figure out practical solutions. (Find the most qualified doctor for a second opinion, how to pay for treatment, how to overcome obstacles in daily life that may arise from the condition, these were the thoughts he had) The person seeking emotional support will see us as cold and uncaring, and minimizing their emotional needs.\n\nWhen he said, that sucks hope it turns out well, what he meant was that sucks and he hopes it turns out well. You probably picked the right person to tell, and if the diagnosis is confirmed this friend will probably be the first you should tell, because he won’t wallow in pity, he will jump straight to practical matters that you hadn’t considered.
8	I would rather not know until/unless something can be done about it. That said, if that something is just to take the load off your shoulders I don't mind. \n\nA simple "hey thanks for listening, it feels good to tell someone" will let me know I've just done something useful for you without stressing about what reaction you want from me to make you feel better, if that makes sense.
3	I don't think you needlessly worried your ISTP friend, they are likely quite aware that there's nothing they can do to help or fix it, so why worry needlessly?\n\nIf this is a really close friend that cares about you, telling them might be a good thing. It might give them information they need to do what they can to help: be a friend, help you do things you need to do, etc. \n\nIf it's not a very close friend, it might have seemed a little weird to them. I'm reading their response as a not close friend, and it's coming off to me like "I'm not emotionally invested in this person so I don't want to get too involved". But then again, it's impossible for me to know based on what little I've read.\n\nThe fact that you confided in this person does seem to make them important to you and I'm glad you were able to find some outlet for that. Perhaps you knew instinctively that they would be the best of your friends to not get too deep into it? Like just a vent without too much hope for a deep, meaningful investment in return.\n\nI do hope it turns out ok for you, and this can be a scary time, I hope you have a support network you can reach out to.
2	Typical INTJ se inferior worrying about giving someone a bad experience.  Dont worry,  an istp is the perfect person to say this to.  He likely decided that there is no use worrying about it before you even know if you have it.  And if you are sick, he likely still wouldnt worry much about it, an istp is a take action type, so they would immediately start coming up with a plan to treat and manage the illness. Worrying does not fix a problem.  I also hope your test turns out well. 
22	I deleted all f*cking social media	My life ks f*ckin mess andga was addicted to this garbage called Twitter. I was doing nothing all day... except getting influenced by Social media lmao.\n\nInstagram : Useless. Basically posts pics of you ? I have a mirror.\n\nTwitter : people crying all day\n\nSnapchat : same as Instagram for me\n\nI keep Facebook to keep track of ol' friends now I feel better
36	Hi welcome to this social site Reddit.\n\nEnjoy your new addiction.
13	Never got sucked in to social media. I dipped my toe in the water and it all seemed so fake and self absorbed. I don’t care what you are eating or where you are partying.
10	Thought that kind of behaviour would be rare around ISTPs
9	It's been 3 years without using social media for me. Never felt better. The whole show-off mentality and dependency just doesn't make sense to me. The further I am from social media, the better.
7	Ye i deleted social media too.
6	Smart move. At least Facebook still pretends to be about the connection between friends, Instagram is just about self-presentation and showing off your "uniqueness" and amazing life.  I hate the superficialty of it. 
6	Social media is curated to your interests.  Instagram and Snapchat are mostly just dumb vanity, but if you avoid following anyone or anything political or current events related you won't see people crying all day.\n\nMy twitter feed is mostly Jung quotes.\n\nThat said, the less screen time the better, regardless.
4	(INFP) I also deleted all social media outside of reddit. What did it for me:\n\n1. I looked back at old posts and saw that I didn't like what I said, and didn't like that things I didn't like that I said were set in stone. Its like, years of personal growth for nothing.\n2. An ex got a hold of me, and I didn't care to talk to him or hear his apology. Again, that part of my life was behind me and I was happy for it to be done.\n3. The drama...the drama...the drama....THE FUCKING DRAMA\n\nI figure, if people really want to get a hold of me, they'll fucking text or something.
4	Yep! I had kept Instagram for a bit but I never felt the need to post stuff and I was slowly getting addicted to scrolling down the feed. I hated it. I hate just staring at my phone. Even on Reddit, I go on to specific subreddits on occasion. I'd rather read or paint or study. Something productive. You took a good step towards the "right" direction dude!
3	I love Snapchat. But I don’t use the social media side. It’s essentially just replaced text messaging for me. I snaptext way more than I use actual text. 
3	I use Twitter, but usually in write-only mode, I post screenshots from Discord there :) Sometimes I do read it, but I only follow like 20 people I know.\n\n(this sounded better in my head)
3	That's great. Less social media, less screen time, more living and being present in the real world. \n\nI've been on and off social over the years, and wish I could go completely off sometimes. I use it as a way to maintain relationships (remind others I exist?) because I'm not really social irl with my wider network of not so close acquaintances/friends. I don't browse feeds or talk to people much on social. I just simply post and respond to the occasional comment that comes in. Find that it's a way of still maintaining a level of connection to others, and this sometimes has a professional/career dimension to it as my colleagues are on social. 
2	I started using Twitter regularly a few months ago, but that shit was so toxic I had to quit. I still use it as there are some bands I follow, but I stay out of the politics. I won’t even go near r/politics
2	Yeah did that a couple of weeks ago, I only use reddit now and many people don't even know what the fuck reddit is but Idc, it's the best place to waste my time on.
2	I post nothing personal on Facebook and i use reddit for home improvements and life advice. anyone on facebook that posted what they are doing was unfollowed

2	istps you just amaze me!	you guys have this aura. im talking about the unhealthy istps lol\n\n\nmost gangsters,crimanals are istps and estps, and you guys just amaze me by the fearlessness you have, you can just do anything you set your mind to. \n\n\ni knew this one istp friend he just had this aura of confidence!, he turned out going down a bad road, into drugs and stuff. but hes fearlessness just amazed me!\n\nopinions?
19	What? Being a criminal doesn't make logical sense since the risk is almost never worth the reward.
15	I know I don't speak for everyone, but in general, if we are confident, it means one of three things:\n\n1. We've dealt with the situation before and are in our comfort zone or taking a controlled risk.\n2. We are in an unfamiliar situation but we have heard/read about it because we like to have contingency plans.\n3. We have no idea what the fuck we're doing but we feign confidence and hope our wits get us by.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am not a criminal. I just break rules that I deem arbitrary/pointless.
7	I know what you mean by aura, but I believe it is your mind tricking you based on your perceived opinions.
2	Healthy ISTPs are just like that, but were not running around doing criminal activities so its not as noticed.
1	Criminal? Lmao. We're too beautiful to pass.
1	Don't know why you think it's flattering to come in here and assert that most unhealthy xstps are criminals but it's not. This is stupid offensive and you should feel bad because who the fuck even says shit like that to someone???. WTF makes you think that's a good idea? At least back up your bullshit claim.
3	Can't tell if INTP or ISTP	I'll try to keep this as concise as possible, because most of these posts are unreadably long.\nI think about the universe and its constructs alot and what could be outside of it.  But I've also loved building things and working on physical projects, and I've been told I'm charming.  Maybe my ADD OCD and anxiety are making me think I'm INTP?\nI'm only 17 and I get terrible grades in school and I joke around in class, but I have lots of ideas of ways to make money.\nI play in a band and fix people's guitars.\nAlso, I fuckin love cars and modding anything I can, and built my PC and play games all the time, as well as learning how to program.\nI have a lot of concepts and ideas.
5	So this sounds a lot like me and I think it’s possible to be an IxTP. To be so close in sensing vs perceiving that you act like both. Too tired to explain fully right now but yea. 
6	I knew from the first sentence you’re ISTP. Dominant Ti ponders the universe and its constructs, that’s not exclusively an INTP thing.\n\nAnd brevity certainly isn’t an INTP thing. 
3	I test like 40% intp and 60% ISTP on some comparison test i found 
2	My INTP boyfriend has same attributes like you. Cars, building things, working on physical projects, and incredibly charming (oozing adorableness). A programmer. A self-made man.\n\nI'm ISTP. We are very similar. We follow each other's Ti rather flawlessly, but he's more chatty and great at storytelling (Ne), while I tend to grasp information and synthesise (Ni) for practical use.\n\nHow we differ is in emergency situations. This is the big difference because he lacks Se. He cannot decide or act 'instantaneously' when confronted with problems. He prefers to retreat and think through possibilities.\n\nFor example, when given with a task new to him, (he'll either ignore or research tons of it). Say, we're traveling and I ask him to get burgers. He'd research, check apps, check google, check info. As an ISTP, I'd rather go out and ask someone nearby if there's a burger shop in town. I want concrete info from real world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	How much do you ramble in conversation and how many open tabs do you have on average?
10	I keep attracting you beep boops. Why?	Welp, got the answer. Feel free to talk about this kind of thing if you'd like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"TL;DR, why do ISTPs like ENFPs, ENTPs and ENXPs?"\n\n&#x200B;
34	I'm not going to try and decipher this, if you have a specific question, please ask it without all of the nonsense. 
15	Good looking, a good sense of humor, not overly emotional, those three things are really attractive in a woman. I've always had a thing for ENXPs, if I had to guess why it's probably because of high Ne. I think Ne brings a lot of fun and great conversation to the table, something I can appreciate since outside of my snarky remarks and practical knowledge I struggle to talk with people for too long. ENXPs have something that keeps me interested and talking for longer than any other type, so I can feel a bond growing with them quickly. Hope that makes sense to you and answers some of your doubts! 
6	[deleted]
6	\> I keep attracting you beep boops. Why?\n\nBecause you're smart, funny and physically attractive. It doesn't have to be more complicated than that.
3	what the hell is TL DR I've always wondered
6	Ugh. This stream of thought writing style isn’t conducive to understandable written communication.    \n  \nPlease use paragraphs at least when you have changed direction.  \n\nI have no idea what you are even asking.   I’m only replying because you called us “beep boops” and I found that entertaining.   \n\nStop being so self analytical and go with the flow.  
5	this is why you don't do a rail before making a text post.

7	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
1	This is really cool! Thanks for putting in the effort to help others understand themselves. I hope you receive the proper encouragement to continue! I haven't been able to get to a quiet, still place to give it a listen yet but I love the idea. 
1	there's few things that are more boring than people taking mtbi too seriously
14	ENFJ-ISTP Couple	I’m an ENFJ (F), dating an ISTP (M) of the same age. He’s my first boyfriend. As for him, he was previously in a 5 year relationship.\n\nWe connected on a dating app. He was my schoolmate, and I knew of him but was no acquainted. My BFF was his ex-classmate and the one who told me to like his profile and one thing led to another...\n\nIt took like two days of texting before we started to really connect with each other and catch feelings. (He says he already had positive feelings for me from the start, though) I generally take awhile to trust men, so it was really surprising to me how fast I fell into this. \n\nEventually, we made it official. Fast forward 5 months. It was great at the start. He’s never met someone like me, who’s really expressive, funny and direct. I’d never met someone like him, who didn’t play games and was just direct and honest. It helped that we both love working out and watching political satire.\n\nThings haven’t been great the last month. He was so busy with work that he had to keep cancelling on dates. I tried my best to be understanding, though I did tell him that I really wanted to see him. He started to become less expressive and consistent when texting. We finally met after 2 months of not seeing each other, and he didn’t even initiate any physical contact. \n\nI spoke to him about this. I also communicated that I felt neglected and alone in the relationship. I didn’t expect long conversations, but sometimes, he only drops me like 3 texts? He apologised for making me feel this way, but he said he had no idea I was struggling. He then said to discuss this at a later date.\n\nThen, it was 4 days of radio silence, until I initiated contact and asked to go on a date. He couldn’t because he was meeting his friends.\n\nContact resumed and just when I thought things were finally alright, last week, it was a full week of radio silence. He only called me after I dropped him a text telling him to do so, so I could ask him out. I’m planning to see him this week to talk about what just transpired.\n\nIs it time to call it quits?\n\nI’m so confused by his inconsistency - I have no idea whether his feelings have changed or he seriously thinks a relationship is supposed to function without engaging in any contact?\n\nI knew an ENFJ/ISTP relationship wouldn’t be easy, since we’re as different as night and day, but I hadn’t expected it to be this tough.\n\n
26	This is not an ENFJ/ISTP thing.  This is a guy breaking up with you thing.  He no longer wants to have a relationship with you, and, in fact, *is* no longer in a relationship with you.  He should just tell you, but at this point you should be getting the hint.\n\nI’m sorry to be so blunt, but it’s time for you to throw his number away and move on.  
7	[deleted]
7	> Is it time to call it quits?\n\nIt's up to you to decide how long you will allow to be treated this way. But it is actually a good question to raise directly to him.\n
6	Socionics says this is the perfect couple. If he suddenly starts changing his behavior, there's a problem. And I'm also baffled by the fact that you're still having to set up a date after 5 months. Sorry but I think you should just end it. Maybe he'll come to his senses then. But probably not. -ISFP 
4	Totally agree with tool-user about it not being an MB relationship thing, but wouldn't go as far to say it's over. My ENFJ SO has to drag my feelings out of me sometimes and whilst initially I'm reserved, because emotions aren't as important to me compared to trust and common interests, I always gain something positive from the experience. However in my earlier years I would quit and run pretty quick or, in my last case, bury my head in the sand and let it carry on for much longer just ignoring the issue. A lack of communication is usually the issue and if in honesty you aren't getting what you want from a relationship that should be a reason for you to break it off with him.
4	How old are you guys? He sounds like me at age 15 before I had any idea how to act in relationships.
3	This should be about your personal relational boundaries, and not up to him. I understand that it's your first relationship, but it's not the end of the world. \n\nLeave things as they are. Move on before you regret and lose respect to yourself.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Yeah this doesn't have anything to do with personality, it's just him being bored I think. Be direct and cut it off. This is a life lesson for you: When other people drag you along without reciprocating, don't simply cut off contact but be direct and tell them exactly why you're doing it, and draw the line. Ghosting while breaking up is just as bad as ghosting during the relationship.
1	MTBI is fun but don't put too much weight into it. It's like sperging out because of astrology. A fun indulgence but don't replace your common sense with shit you read in your horoscope.
1	If I don't talk to someone in a week I kindof forget they exist. It wouldn't necessarily mean I dislike them but it also means I'm not really thinking about them. Just my experience
1	> Is it time to call it quits? \n\nYes\n\n&#x200B;
0	Yeah, this isn't an ISTP thing. He just wants to dump you. None of the ISTPs I've been with pulled this on me, not yet anyway - had an ESTP do it though, such a motherfucker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it makes you feel better, he's actually your conflicting partner. You want an ISTJ.
28	I don’t know if this a Ti dom thing, a ISTP thing or just in general with people, but I’m wondering if it’s easier for you guys to work when your by your self and not being watched by cameras?	
27	Cameras don't bother me too much because it's just a fact of modern life. Having managers and supervisors around sucks it out of me though. My rationale: if they're watching, there's a reason. I want to figure the reason out as quickly as possible to help them get to the resolution so they can leave and let me do my thing. If it's an audit / observation type thing, that's great, but I prefer people just be upfront and say "I'm going to watch your work process for a little, go ahead and do your thing" rather than try to be sneaky or invisible whatever.
17	Yeah when someone's watching me preform something  when I'm usually not watched I will get thrown out of my "flow".
6	I hate people watching me work, but don't care about cameras.
7	If I know people watch me I get nervous and watched and it will not go right. I don't know why but I had this since I was little. I can work better without being watched. But I'm not sure if cameras will give the same effect. 
5	I work better if i'm being observed, or I start  using instagram, facebook, tinder, reddit...\n\nAnd being observed doesn't botter me, I actually like it
3	For me it’s not so much about being watched as it is about being interrupted. It seems like anytime you make eye contact with a manager they ask you to do something. It adds to my mental to do list and the effort of remembering more things makes it harder for me to get things done. 
3	I hate people watching me in general.
3	Yeah... I cant stand being watched when I'm trying to work on something... I usually have several iterations of attempts throughout my thinking process and would rather people not see the early attempts >. >
1	Yup
1	yea
12	What to do next?	Sorry for posting a relationship post (in case these types of questions are annoying to you guys) but I really like this guy and don’t want to mess it up. :)\n\nI am an ENFP, he’s an ISTP. We met about two weeks ago on a dating app and hit it off immediately. He’s hot, super sweet and easy to talk to. A few days after we met, I texted him inviting him to go to a hockey game with me, but we ended up staying in and chilling at his house, which was fine by me. I’m not the type of person who has sex with someone until I really feel comfortable with them and he was basically still a stranger to me at that point so we didn’t do it, but we fooled around a bit and I ended up staying the night. He made me feel so safe and comfortable and never pushed me too far even though I could tell he wanted it. \n\nAfter I left, he texted me every day little things like how was your day, hope you’re having a good day, etc. It took me aback a little bit since it wasn’t something I was used to, but I assumed he was just thinking about me a lot, and I was thinking about him a lot too, so it was fine. I went over to his house on v-day before heading out to dinner with friends and it was really nice. I could feel myself feeling more comfortable around him and enjoying myself more. He mentioned something in passing about having to focus harder on schoolwork and he also said he was really tired because he hadn’t gotten much sleep recently. After I left, he called me right when I got in my car and gave me directions all the way home because my gps wasn’t working. It’s things like that that make me smitten with him. :)\n\nBut I haven’t heard from him since. I think it’s fine, because he probably is just focusing on school but it does make me a little uneasy in case I did something wrong. I’m also self conscious that he may be no longer interested since I’m not having sex with him right away.\n\nI’m going to wait and see what happens, but I wanted to post here and see what you guys thought was going on and what I should do. It might help stop the what if loopings in my head that are going to confuse me and drive me to do something irrational. Feel free to ask for more details if you like! Thank you very much for reading. \n\nP.S. The first night, I had lost my hair tie and was kind of upset that I had to go out with my hair in a mess and I asked him for a rubber band but he said he usually just throws them away. When I went over the second night though, I saw that he had saved a rubber band on his wrist. :) maybe just a coincidence, but maybe not. Anyways, no more gushiness. ;)
17	Text him and ask how his day is or something. Don't just wait for him to initiate conversation, he may feel that if he's always initiating he is just annpoying you and you're not interested.  \nAnd the rubber band was not coincidental, it was for you
13	We are notorious for needing space and we sometimes don't think about how it affects others. It sounds like he likes you. Just shoot him a text (don't call or show up) and see if he wants to go do something soon. I have a feeling you're over thinking it. \n\n\nBTW my gf is also ENFP. We deal with things like this regularly where she thinks she did something wrong because I don't give her unprompted physical and emotional validation. I just don't think about it like that. 
4	You can't take his interest and his behaviour for granted. Texting you daily is his way of showing interest in you. But if he doesn't get anything back, he'll think that you're not that interested. \n\nIt's possible that he's not texting you now, because he's trying to gauge your interest in him. Your interest doesn't have to be expressed by texting. You can simply invite him to spend some time together doing whatever - watching something, taking a walk, studying together... any activity.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Hey, waffle. Here's how you keep communication with your ISTP.\n\n1. Do not expect your ISTP to initiate. Ever. You're the initiator type, so take charge! You can complain, but never get tired of doing it! We love it.\n2. Always ASK. Don't ASSUME. (This is how dumpster fire of communication begins between an ISTP and ENFP). Remember that we're worlds apart in terms of seeing things. \n3. Believe what he says. ISTPs mean what we say. If we say, "black", it means "black", not "dark grey". \n4. Give him alone time. 2 weeks is normal of not communicating with you. We aren't like you who tend to lose your mind and world for love. And want being always together, cuddling and exhausting all the feelings 'til you get bored.\n5. If you want sex, say it. You refrained not to and yet now you're wondering whether it's causing his detachment? That's all in your head. Stop that habit of unnecessary concern.\n6. You are not the center of his life. What we do is. Remember that always.\n7. Don't be like these stupid ENFPs who plague our lives. Search ENFP posts in this subreddit. You'll figure.\n8. Keep your emotions to your fellow squishy friends. We need only little. Even a smile can make our day. \n\n&#x200B;
0	That is *perfect*. This seems like a duality type in socionics. Your man is an SLI, you are an IEE, this is the best combination an SLI and an IEE can have when addressing cognitive functions, which may explain why you clicked so fast. This is definitely a relationship worth the extra effort. Just dont barrage him, the patience is part of the effort 
15	Help with feelings?	From what I’ve read on here, ISTPs are supposed to have minimal feelings. \nHowever, I feel that I am a very empathetic person, to the point where those short ig/fb/yt clips about sad things make me cry immediately. Pretty much any video with sad music or and lonely old person will make me cry within seconds. Even thinkjng about it made me cry. I will even do this in public.\n\nHowever, I don’t  have feelings about my own life/people around me. I’ve never been emotionally attached to anyone, and while I’ve made really close friends, and am grateful for my family, I feel like my feelings are more of loyalty than of love. Does anyone have friendships like those in anime or movies? \n\nSo, two questions:\n1. Are there any other istps who irrationally cry when they hear sad music or watch a sad video (even if it’s poorly made/not good)?\n\n2. Is what I feel for my friends and family loyalty or love? Does it matter? How do most people feel about their friends?\n\n19, female
32	ISTPs can have very meaningful, deep, emotional connections to things and people. I hate to break it to you, but I think you're normal.\n\nThe whole "ISTPs are robots" thing is a little exaggerated. It doesn't mean we don't have feelings. But at least in my case, it usually means "I share my thoughts regardless of the feelings of others because I value truth over feelings". That can lead to us being seen as cold or unfeeling, erroneously in my opinion.
6	i’ve been crying for 3-4 years. (25M)\n\nSure we don’t show emotions right out. My colleagues think I’m emotionless therefore I dont feel hurt from offensive shit or what not. They are so wrong but I can’t blame them.
8	Unfortunately this is normal and something you are stuck with as an ISTP. We arent emotionless robots, its more that our feelings are more deeply rooted in physical things. The homeless, neglected, abused, hell even old derelicts cars/trucks make me have pangs of empathy, remorse, and sadness. Its just something you have to learn to deal with.  
6	My husband is an ISTP and he suggests that you stop it.\n\nNow my contribution. When we were dating, I broke up with him for a brief time and he cried. He hasn't cried since, but clearly it's a thing that they do sometimes. My husband is very loyal to his family and friends. He just doesn't like most people. The ones he does though, he'd take a bullet for them, I have no doubt. As far as music and movies, he's capable of feelings but he doesn't emote them outwardly at all. He'll say something effects him but he remains stoic. But a lot of his family is like that and they're not all ISTPs.
3	Give me whiskey, play Bob Dylan's Most Of The Time, I'll be reduced to tears.
3	> 1. Are there any other istps who irrationally cry when they hear sad music or watch a sad video (even if it’s poorly made/not good)?\n\nMaybe the ISTP aspect of this is not so much the crying or not crying, but the fact that you label it as "irrational" and ask others if it's normal. :) I think feelings often seem sort of *alien* to us, both in ourselves and others. And many of us might not communicate them very skillfully. But that doesn't change the intensity, or "worth" of the feelings.\n\n> Is what I feel for my friends and family loyalty or love? Does it matter? How do most people feel about their friends?\n\nAren't these excellent questions? :)\nAgain, if you weren't an ISTP (or something close), you probably wouldn't question these things as much. People to whom feelings and relationships are "natural", probably don't _need_ to think about these things like you do. Maybe they take it for granted. Maybe the distinction between "true" and "fake" feelings, is less important for a natural feeler. Always seemed like a paradox to me, when "feelers" are able to express affection in a seemingly much more careless, irresponsible way, because they sort of own the domain. (Obviously this is a generalization and how it appears to us, no criticism intended towards any personality.)\n\nYou don't sound weird to me from your description.
3	I just got my period the morning after I posted this. Might explain why I was so existential 
3	I cry whenever I get my tax bill.
3	**1.**\n\nNo, I don't. I once leaked a couple of tears in a cinema theater a few years ago because a woman was begging a doctor to take her daughter's rare medical case else she die, and I was stressed out at the time.\n\nAnd of course, my friend was watching me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.**\n\nISTPs can experience love; we're generally not sociopaths. Expressing it, however, can be difficult. At least for me.
2	> Are there any other istps who irrationally cry when they hear sad music or watch a sad video (even if it’s poorly made/not good)? \n\ni am susceptible to teary eyes when witnessing betrayals or reconciliations\n\n> Does anyone have friendships like those in anime or movies? \n\ni cant pinpoint the feeling of love but i value loyalty and the feeling of caring towards those close to you.\n\n&#x200B;
1	1. Yes, sometimes I do that because I think I recognized my feeling but I dont know how to express it, tears already collected around my eyes. It's like I'm sad/happy/angry, my brain lost the correct words and my body speaks for itself through crying?\n2. Yes, until today I still wondering what is like falling in love, like those depicted in books and movies. Is it like when I'm obsessed with a new hobby/project that I keep thinking about it? But human isn't a hobby or project. 
1	It's probably our body's reaction to us not thinking about our emotions so it comes out that way
1	You are growing up and you are female, probably it's hormones.
45	Married to ISTP.	Just a quick note to say I love ISTPs. I'm a female INTP and I married a male ISTP a few years ago. We have one of the most easy rapports I've ever had. When we met we were like magents. He is my best friend. I love that he is not easily offended, he is honest and straightforward. My head is always in the clouds but he grounds me. I think about the future, he thinks about the present. We love to make fun of each other and things that are stupid or illogical and we seriously love to argue.  Sometimes he will come home from a stressful day needing space and I like to jokingly ask whether it's a good time to talk about our feelings. Hahaha cracks me up every time. Anyways, with some obvious exceptions like Tom cruise, you guys are awesome. Don't ever change ;) 
14	Thanks! \n\n\nI never knew Tom Cruise was ISTP. We do have Harrison Ford though so it's not all bad. 
10	> Sometimes he will come home from a stressful day needing space and I like to jokingly ask whether it's a good time to talk about our feelings. Hahaha cracks me up every time. \n\nIt cracked me up too :D\n
8	Calm down with the Fe that's not allowed here
4	I'm a female INTP married to an ISTP.  I relate to much of this except he hates arguing and isn't so good at laughing at himself but we enjoy laughing at other people. We're jerks. It's fun.  \n\nYou seem to have better Fe than I do. 
2	ISFJ (31F) married to an ISTP (32M). I can't agree with you more. Being married to a logical, respectful introvert makes for a very peaceful life.     ISTPs hold a very special place in my heart!
2	ISTP bf too! Love that they are not easily offended! 
1	Which type are you?
1	I'm an INTP with an ISTP too and you described the dynamic to a "t". ISTP's are great
1	Im an ISTP and hope to find a understanding match like you someday. Being an ISTP isn't always so glamorous.
1	My INTP has been depressed for three months now. Unresponsive. We were magical together. Best dates ever. But he has ghosted me after two love letters. It's almost a month now. First time I am brokenhearted (because he's struggling and he doesn't want me to get near him).\n\nI love you, even when I can't say it or these things to other types. There's just something about INTPs that make me feel heard, respected and so childlike.\n\nSex is heavenly as well. It's perfect. Ugh. Fuck you, INTPs.

0	ISTP/ENFP Divorce	   \nlevel 1[Hotmessmamajama](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hotmessmamajama)1 point·[just now](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/9ylc0y/how_do_you_istps_handle_a_break_up/egnaxuw/)\n\nHelp me understand what is going on in my ISTP ex's mind. I tried hard to reconcile at first but now am trying to move on. Based on this story, should I try again or let it go. I do feel like he's been my best friend despite details below.(Sorry, I'm an ENFP. Sit back for the novel...)\n\nI am an ENFP who was done with my 18 year marriage to an ISTP (too little emotion, too much judgement, too little honesty about anything financial-unknown credit cards, lied about purchases, past jobs, etc. early in our relationship, yet really working on himself later in our relationship) and fantasizing about living in an apartment or condo on my own or with my son.\n\nThen we had our discussion where I told him I slept with someone 15 years ago (super shitty on my part and I had been a hypocrite about all of his honesty things). He said he wanted a divorce right away and moved into the spare room. So angry and rage filled. Emotional talks every night and then we had sex two nights later. Really nice sex that we hadn’t had in years.\n\nDue to my immaturity with conflict and recognizing my true feelings, when I got angry with him I’d withdraw emotionally and sexually. But now that all the emotions were out and all the truths were out, we became more physically attracted to each other (or I at least did to him, he’d been initiating sex for awhile and I rarely “bit”). So sleeping together a few times a week, living under the same roof, sharing a young son, figuring stuff out. Then he said he was moving in with his boss (10 years younger, two young boys, also going through divorce). Took me by surprise at how fast he was moving on yet still wanted connection and sex with me. Keep trying to stick to no sex but it’s been hard because damn, it’s been so good. And so confusing.\n\nFeel like I’m falling in love again. But he’s definitely moving on and still so angry about infidelity. And then his boss who he has a “special connection” with. What the hell people? Now it’s been almost three months since we had the talk where he wanted divorce. Still wants sex and “connection” with me but is texting boss all the time and moving in with her. I’m trying to be in it just for the sex (who knows how long it will be for me again?!) but it’s hard to separate emotions. I feel like I’m fucking myself over but have little self control. I suggested reconciliation about a month and a half in and he freaked out, “Do you think I forgot about what you did?” Oh, lord. What a reality TV show. Is this kind of thing normal? I’ve been together with him since I was 21 and for 21 years. Only had one boyfriend before him. A couple of times, he's tried to say "no sex" and couldn't stick to it. Is it all physical? Or the 21 year connection? Or is it something I should try to nurture?
10	Once an ISTP turns on his apathy, there's no changing it. There's nothing to read. You're a good fuck, and all the years you spent were already set on fire (without you knowing it).\n\nYou are ENFP. You struggle with Inferior Si (everything about the past and mistakes). We don't have Si. We don't give a fuck about our past. It's done.
6	I might be the only one who thinks this, but was you admitting you cheated on him 15 years ago some sort of emotional manipulation? No offense, but the only people I know that would drag something like that out 15 years later are ones looking to get some sort of reaction. Don’t know what you expected from that conversation. The fact that you’re holding out hope for him despite A. Having cheated on him before B. Weren’t happy in the relationship and fantasized about leaving C. Purposefully told him info about you cheating that would permanently damage the relationship, sounds toxic af. 
10	So 3 years in on your marriage you fucked some other dude. Kept quiet about for god knows how long. You stole 12 years of someones life. Think about that. \n\nI kind of stopped reading after that.\n\nEdit: i read a little bit more. I think what happened is, that there is no more trust. \n\nI know for me in a similar situation, such betrayal cannot be repaired. But I’m kind of black and white in that sense. \n\nPeople can pull a lot of shit with me, but once you cross a boundary I’m done. 
3	How about you just show him this Reddit thread and offer to fuck his brains out for a couple weeks? Would make you two produce oxytocin and all that jazz.  Fall back in love, or whatever. This whole thing was tl;dr for me, but ISTPs are pretty sensual people (in my experience), sensual as in, they want to fuck you - they'll usually forgive you after that and some begging, in my experience. Also, the only reason he lied to you, is because he wanted to impress you. ISTPs show emotion by doing stuff for you, you know how many ISTPs offered to fix my car and or computer? That's bascially foreplay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso he doesn't love his boss, she's the rebound for the intimacy you didn't give him. If you want him, back, just tell him straight up, no emotional manipulation. He changed for you, but you never changed for him. Oh and I'll bet money he partially used you cheating on him many years ago as an excuse to end the relationship, that whole need fulfillment deal.
1	Did you ever apologize in a sincere way about the infidelity?
1	There are so many things I could say, but I'm going to limit myself to answering the direct questions only. In case you want more answers, ask more questions.\n\n>  Is this kind of thing normal?\n\nNo, but then again is it normal to cheat on your husband?\n\n> Is it all physical? \n\nNot only physical, no. His feelings for you are not just gone like that.\n\n> Or the 21 year connection? \n\nThis plays a big part.\n\n> Or is it something I should try to nurture?\n\nThat's very hard to answer. If you keep the sex going that keeps him attached, but it also increases your chances of disappointment when he moves out with his boss. This is most likely going to happen regardless of how much nurturing you do.\n
1	Thank you
1	True that. Well, maybe I’ll give it a shot. Thanks for advice. Gonna have to check out socionomics...
0	As I read my posts, I think, man, just let each other go already. But there’s a pretty unique and magnetic feeling connection
8	Music That Makes You Happy	Music thread fuck yeah. Post whatever you currently listen to that gets you pumped or makes a bad day better. \n\nI'll start. \nI like a lot of EDM. Just a ray of fucking sunshine and energy. Reminds me that that bad days aren't forever. With or without Lyrics.\n\nLove this band called Oh Wonder, their songs are very healing. Helps bring out emotions when I'm having trouble acessing them/letting stuff out that needs to get out that I'm auto-bottling. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAhRiUeJ8E&list=PLXbqqofRCultvbn0XUUvD6DeTn7zLCICq\n\nMAck & Diesle's *The Rhythm* Always gets me pumped. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdstkBrDfdM\n\nAll Don Diablos stuff makes me feel like I have to move too. \n\nNew one I just found today that I've been listening to on repeat for the last hour: Bali Bandits- Girls and Boys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF8It_la_UE
6	Nothing makes me want to go out and kick some butts like some old school Metallica. \n\nHere's three of the greatest albums ever to have graced this Earth. \n\nRide the Lightning\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VGzm8rTz8y4\nFavorite song: Creeping Death\n\nMaster of Puppets\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-YQm_1AWpr8\nFavorite song: Battery\n\nAnd Justice for all\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0NNadbG60Co\nFavorite song: Harvester of Sorrow
4	i like a lot of different kinds of music, i guess rap makes me happiest though. i like old school groups like wu tang clan, three 6 mafia, mobb deep, bone thugs n harmony, etc. and newer shit like run the jewels, lil ugly mane, death grips, teamsesh, flatbush zombies, danny brown, shakewell, ghostemane, $b, night lovell, etc. after that my favorite genre is probably hard rock/nu metal like tool, deftones, chevelle, katatonia, etc
4	Music is a big part of my life. If anyone is looking for new music here are my recommendations. \n\nRATKING and MF DOOM are great if you have an appreciation for boom bap rapping. I really tend to gravitate towards 70s too, taking appreciation to ELO, Queen, Lennon, Bowie, Simon & Garfunkel (both artists respectively), Fleetwood Mac, Earth Wind & Fire, Santana, Toto, Billy Joel, Sweet, and the legendary George Harrison (All things must pass is a dirty dirty album). Currently I am holding off on listening to the beetles (Hoping to save some of the good stuff for down the road). Alternative is great too, MGMT, Kid Cudi’s  WZRD, Sticky Fingers, Weezer...Etc. Rock is dope, I had just found out about King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard and the band The Velvet Underground ( The album w/ Nico is really good!!). Lastly, if you take appreciation to Zelda like video game moog soundtracks go check out Mort Garrison - Plantasia.\n\nThat’s pretty much it classical and piano are pretty cool too! I can add links to my 70s playlist and Alternative playlist upon request. Much love to all who have read, hope I at least entertained one person lol.\n
3	Hope I'm not too late. A song that totally got me pumped last week got me to do 401 pushups in 4 days. The Fire by The Roots. The song before that was Pikachu Use Thunderbolt by Asher Postman. I'm still a noob so I won't try to do links. Oh Wonder is awesome. Landslide was one of the first I ever heard of from them.
2	I like powerful, gangster music.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/burgosmusic/burgos-i-like-produced-by-bergotti\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/bad-kid-1\n\nWhat you think of it?
2	I like whatever gets me really moving.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tisoki/feel-the-power\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rustyhook2/just-a-lil-bit\n\n\nBut like also slower stuff. \n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/petre-mihai-1/riding-solo-dir-by-aris-jerome\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/vvndvls/shlohmo-jeremih-fuck-you-all-the-time-remix-extended-cut\n\nI try to pride myself in the music I listen to. I see it as a sort of representation of myself. Hard to pin down, but never a bad time. 
2	The music that I listen to depends very much on the mood that I'm in/am trying to get into. I also go through huge music phases in my life where I obsess over a certain genre. Right now it's K-pop/rnb/hip-hop. 
2	Few songs do more for my (immediate) happiness than this one. \n\nUp by EARTHGANG (hip hop, the good kind)\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zgNVvtOp8mU&feature=youtu.be\n\nAs one astute YouTube commenter put it "This song puts my depression in the corner of a boxing ring." \n\nHope you enjoy it! 
2	EDM: deadmau5, rokysopp, dream koala, aphex twin, burial, clams casino, FOMH (YouTube label - British wave music) \n\nRap/Hiphop: Aesop Rock, Tyler, childish Gambino, kid Cudi, joji, xxxtentacion \n\nAlternative/rock: a perfect circle, Deftones, tame Impala, psychedelic porn crumpets, ratatat, Radiohead

1	Anyone works at stretegic consulting?	Hello people\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently i'm at the end of my college degree (engineering) and i'm seriously thinking about applying to strategic consulting like McKinsey, Bain and others consulting companies.\n\nAs any other ISTP, i love to think and solve problems, but I have two major fears about consulting:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) As consultor, i will need to use a lot of Fe? My last job I had to handle with dumb and emotional people, and this stressed me a lot. I can handle with people issues very well, but everyday in weeks I start to get very stressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) I will need to handle too many theoretical ideas without validating them? I struggle a lot when I can't check if my ideas are right or wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone can help me clarify with these insecurities? Thanks a lot
3	Consultants need people skills
2	strategic......might wanna correct your title 
1	First, correct you title please.\nSecond, watch @TheFutur on YouTube. It's a design channel but if you search good for the strategic videos, you will have a sense of how it looks like in reality. He does this really well and explains it good and do able in my opinion. (w/ Melinda Liversy are the good ones I think)\n\nWho asks more questions is in control. 
10	Going back to be being friends	Would you have a problem with going back to being friends with someone if you once had feelings for the person? I read somewhere that as an Istp, you dont want to be reminded of the strong feelings once enjoyed. And going from being intimate to just friendship is like going backwards for the Istp. Do any of you agree on this? \n\nAs an infp/Enfp, this is not how I function so it’s interesting to me.  
12	Depends on three things:\n\n1. Was the ending a dumpster fire? (If no, then I'm open)\n2. Is that person fundamentally trustworthy? It means if he means friendship, then no ambivalence is going to happen. Just friendship. Keep your feelings away from me. (If yes, then I'm open)\n3. Will the person leave me alone and not into gossip, chatting/calling because bored, or keep inviting even though I've refused many times? (if yes, then I'm open)\n\nI'm different in friendship than in relationships. If I cared about you as a lover, don't expect that in friendship. I have a very radical thick line.\n\n................\n\n \n\nI’m friends with my INFP ex. He's an exception (because he doesn't get tired initiating contact and asking stuff.) We chat about what our new projects are, mainly. But he still love-bombs me occasionally and still declares his love for me (drunktexts maybe?). He still calls me, my love. It makes me cringe. While I don’t like to probe, I can’t help but think maybe he’s still in love with me. But I don’t take it seriously. He doesn’t get more than a smile emoji. I’m very clear about my boundaries (and they're not going to change). \n\n&#x200B;
7	If you are an ENFP you have a very good chance of going back to just friends with your ISTP. I don't know much about INFPs so I can't comment on them.\n\nISTPs in general don't go back to being friends after a romantic relationship, but ENFPs seem to be the exception from this rule.
6	Yeah for me I can appreciate what I liked about them from the start. I do need sometime to process before being able to hang out though. 
5	Funny enough, I once dated an INFP that later recommended we go back to being friends when it didn't work out. To answer your question yeah I can't go back to being someone's friend after I've developed a romantic feeling for them. So basically, I told that guy "fuck that".  
5	Nope.  I'd want them out of my life.
6	If I can't stay friends with someone I broke up with, it inevitably means I made a very bad choice in associating with them in the first place.\n\nThis is an observation in hindsight.
3	i’m still friends with all my exes. my thinking is i clearly thought they were a good enough person to date so why wouldn’t they be a good enough friend to have even after we break up? however, i have been lucky since all my relationships have ended without any toxicity. 
3	Its just too much hardwork to go back. They had a good share of me back then. Forward ever.  \nI suppose ISTP's are prone to being misunderstood all the time.
3	When a romance breaks down I tend to see that as the trust falling apart as well - I thought we were helping each other be happy and be better people. I highly value a small number of friends who help me when I need it, and if you don't want to be on that list then I don't care to know you, honestly. Perhaps this is some weird thing where I never learned to separate friendship from attraction, but outside of an intimate relationship my friendships with girls are nothing more than small talk, so exes are reduced to that level, if that.
3	FTM ISTP here. \n\nDepends how the relationship went. Have had a lot of romantic encounters so far but if they end in a way that doesn't break the trust, doesnt betray me, or hurt me excessively, then I don't see how its not possible. \n\nLast ex was a huge dumpster fire and I will never trust like that ever again. \n\nVery recent date i quickly deducted that he was not mature enough/was not what I needed  in a relationship and several things he did made me uncomfortable, and sapped all attraction very quickly. I trust he's still a good person though, and hes helped me quite a bit, so I think having a developed friendship would still be nice while he works on himself. I told him as such, was completely honest with how I felt and why we aren't going to work, and he took it well. Wants to work on himself.  If someone can walk away with being told how uncomfortable they made someone they were super attracted to and still take that criticism and want to be better and have a friendship, you can't tell me theres not good potential. (potential for a friendship. I dont expect him to get better in even 3 years, and don't ever plan on dating him as it stands.)
2	I'm friends with my ex wife. 
1	I'm straight. So no to lady friends, it's kinda pointless. Either you are someone I'm sexually interested in, or just another face in the crowd.
1	A girl (ENFP I think) recently asked me to be in a relationship with her (on Valentines day for Christsake) ,to which I declined simply cause I just feel like I could not commit to a relationship with someone like her. But stuffs kinda been awkward for us since then and honestly I cannot really talk to her normally now and with her saying all this weird stuff over snapchat to me after she sort of broke the ice over the whole thing I just feel like I cant be bothered talking to her. She's very exhausting to deal with and is quite annoying, no offence ENFP's. 
1	If I was in a relationship with the person beforehand, then probably not, even if it ended mutually , it would feel so weird to not be able to interact with them at the same level of intimacy.\n\nIf I just had feelings for them and they rejected me, maybe. But itd be kinda weird as well, them thinking that you like them and all.
1	Still friends with my last gf. Sorta. We were on and off / fwb for a bit, but I still have feelings for her. Things have kinda cooled off a bit recently, and I know I should probably cut all ties but I don't want to 
0	I want to but his girlfriend is so insecure he has to cut out or keep a distance from all of his female friends so :/
4	Recommed any books about loving yourself?	i’m certain ISTPs are capable of loving themselves. i’m just in a rut i know i can get out and its time i get out. i’m really fucking sick of this. I think I’m getting better but I still find it hard to love myself.\n\nI find that books help me a lot so is there any book or writer that is good at ya know helping you see that you come first? And that loving yourself is everything?
6	12 rules for life 
3	The youtube channel "The School of Life". Guy has Ted Talks and books out. Good listening.\n\nGo to the profile page to see playlists. The search page can look overwhelming.
3	i think if you want a change in mindset, you need to change your lifestyle. start working out, eating better, dressing how you want to look, focus on job/school, spend less time consuming media, spend more time doing things that you want to get done (hobbies are important but also stuff like cleaning/fixing up your place, learning about things, pursuing a career), spend more time with people you care about, etc. there may be negative influences you need to remove as well like drugs, unhealthy relationships, other bad habits or addictions (porn, food, whatever). while you're doing this i would reccomend reading books about philosophy and self improvement to keep yourself motivated, but you won't start being happy just because jordan peterson told you to wash your penis or whatever.
21	fellow lady istps i have a question for ya	question : does \~ lady times \~ make you a hormonal maniac and then you're also angry because you *know* you're having irrational emotions ??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: i should have made it clearer that i'm not outwardly angry - i just realize that i'm being irrational and then am angry with myself. but thank you for all the comments ! i'm glad most of us are on the same page. 
29	Dude, yes. For me it's like my threshold for experiencing negative emotions goes way, way down. I get frustrated or annoyed by things way more easily. Honestly it's most noticeable when I'm playing video games, if I have PMS and lose a couple games I tilt like crazy. And then I feel stupid for getting mad at a video game, but I can't make myself not be mad, which is even more frustrating. The best I can do is try to notice when it's happening and then stop playing. 
14	Yes. Pregnancy and postpartum hormones shed some light on what “normal” women must experience. 
8	Yes. I want to be left alone the entire week before my period because I am aware of how uncharacteristically and irrationally emotional I am behaving. I can’t endure things like traffic, or being rushed, or people standing too closely to me in a line/queue. I am on edge about everything and can feel all this tension inside of me. \n\nThen, my period starts and it’s like the pressure immediately releases and I’m back to normal again. I hate it. 
11	No.  
7	For me it's more sad/depressed than angry but then I get mad at myself for being sad for no reason.
6	Neither. But I think that just depends on your body. Hard to mess with hormones. 
6	When I wasn't on birth control I would get too emotional about really trivial things when PMSing, and I'd realize it at the time and get mad because I knew I went being rational- but would still act super emotional because of the hormones reacting with my brain chemistry.\n\n  I'm on birth control now so the hormones don't fuck with my emotions anymore (except very very very rarely, maybe 1 or 2 cycles out of a year). Much better.
9	no, i don’t let my feelings control me despite the time 
2	Yeah. I get mad at myself for being so irritated over nothing lol. But tbh my pms doesn’t go beyond that
2	Lots of understanding and stuff, but man does this thread make me love my penis! That little fellah is a trooper AND doesn't go apeshit for a week and pump me full of hormones and pain. I feel for yall!
2	I cried on the way to the grocery store the other day. Sooo, yeah. Not a fan of feeling that much negative emotion at all. 
1	definitely. and then i get ‘mad’ at my bf for being inconvenienced that i have emotions for once. lol. 
1	Not angry but I am more Fe when it's near that time. My husband you me my car was junky last month and I teared up. He was extremely upset because he thought he hurt my feelings while I had already Moved on.
1	FTM ISTP here. Gonna answer anyway. \n\nYes, period horn is real and it is hell. I've never been angry for it though. Just excessively horny and wet. I've only ever had some frustration that the constant desire to jerk off kept me from getting shit done, and it was annoying. Doesnt happen that often though. \n\nOtherwise I've never had any chronic moodiness or PMS from periods. Like, maybe once? But mine are kind of rediculous and aren't ever consistent. 
1	Haha, yes. However, I don't usually get upset.
1	Not really.
1	i'm a guy and an istp and i act irrationally a lot of the time, everybody does. nobody is never not controlled by their emotions
1	Istp or isfp?	I took the personality test last year in school and i got istp, but I've been doubting whether I'm really thinking or feeling recently. Took 2 quizzes which 1 of them I got thinking and the other quiz I got feeling.\nHow do I really find out which one am I?
5	the dominant function is completely different, Ti vs Fi. read about the differences between them to see which sounds more like you. there's tons of descriptions of the functions online but here's a short one of each\n\n>Introverted Feeling is constantly taking in the world around them. They filter it out through a lens of “good/bad” or “this is me/this isn’t me.” An introverted feeler is very self aware of who they are and their place in the world.\n\nand\n\n>People with Introverted Thinking want the world to make sense in a logical manner. They form an internal framework of how the world works. It is constantly being modified and improved through life experience and experiments.\n\nfrom personalitygrowth.com, first link that comes up
2	probably istp, thing is, i'm the same way, you're probably borderline, more of a thinking than a feeling. which is good, check out the isfp subreddit, if it makes you cringe, then you're an istp, at least the way i see it
1	HELP: is my friend istp or intp?	alright, fellas, i need some help with typing my good friend.\n\nfor months I was certain he had to be an intp, the descriptions fit him quite well and he seems to agree. functions wise i have never doubted he's a Ti dom. dichotomy wise, i - t - p are all very obvious in his behavior. we've both been introverts our whole life and somewhat lazy.\n\nhowever, me and him were talking about mbti today in class, this isn't something we usually do, because he is not even remotely interested in reading about functions. or mbti theory in depth, i believe it bores him (made me suspicious because it seems like intp's are at least moderately invested). During this conversation, he mentions reading the intp sub and not relating, apparently people seem a bit stuck up, decorate their sentences with pretentious word and in general, aren't "chill enough" etc. i think: idk intps are obviously all different and this is the internet.\n\nlater i wondered if maybe he was mistyped, and i was biased enough to type him as a intuitive because of something subconscious. Ne isn't all that present in him, at least not externally recognizable. we are both fond of deep conversations and it's genuinely something we enjoy doing. say we're talking about immigration: if we did things his way there would be an exploration of immigrants until we both were satisfied and ready to move on to the next topic or when the awkward silence appears.\n\nin retrospection - i am always the one steering the convo to loosely related things, making connections and bringing in anecdotes "thats like..you know when...similar to". he follows along and isn't irritated by this at all.\n\nconfirmed Se users i know tease me for always bringing so-called random experiences or ideas into a discussion. the problem is that, he doesn't fit se stereotypes either. he definitely is a thousand times more observant than me, but "active", "hands-on" and "thrill-seeking" aren't adjectives i associate with him.\n\nwhat do you think? any traits that are very istp i should be looking for:)? how does one differentiate?
3	ISTP.\n\nSe: He's bored with theory, he's not a generator of related topics/ideas and he's very observant.\n\n"Active", "hands-on" and "thrill-seeking" come with a strong Se, but Se isn't that strong in all ISTPs. I myself am very close to the middle of the S/N axis and even though these stereotypes are too strong for me, I still identify with them to some degree.
2	[https://www.idrlabs.com/test/intp-or-istp.php](https://www.idrlabs.com/test/intp-or-istp.php)
2	Not all ISTP's are badass adrenaline junkies, even though some of us are. You can still be an ISTP and want to be more chill/domestic. \n\nS vs N in Ixtps comprise our learning mechanism. How is your friend learning? Via observances, things he can see, touch, taste, feel? or is he learning via imagination, abstracts and concepts?\n\nI find when it comes to learning the goals are different between the types. \n\nThe INTP wants to get obsessed so they can find out everything about a subject and all that it relates to, and culminate so much knowledge that they can pull it out of their ass whenever needed. They want to be the human equivalent of wikipedia. Even if the information isn't personal, relevant, or related to them, they may still want to stick around and listen just for the sake of absorbing more more more more info. (youll see them make lots of associations, conclusions, and branch off the original topic easily, whereas the ISTP will be more focused, will want to stay on the topic while learning, "how does this relate to xyz im learning about? How is this relevant?" will be their thinking, may be bothered by irrelevant associations.)\n\nThe ISTP wants to get obsessed because its 1. Fun. 2. They simply want to be good, or competent at something. May show more disinterest if they can't find the value in it, or relevance towards their lives. The closer it is to their interests, the more theyll light up and pay attention. \n\n**Other notes:** \nYou may also find that some INTP's will exhibit some of the pretentiousness associated with that of the fuckboi/incel crowd in regards to beliefs of intelligence. Please venture to r/iamverysmart for examples. This prententiousness can be seen in various NT's across the spectrum depending on development. I usually see it the most from Ni-Dominant people (INFJ/INTJ), however it all depends on the individual. I have met some very openminded kind INTJ's, and then I have met some INTJ's that comprise the worst of these stereotypes. \n\nI don't see much of this in ISTP's. When ISTP's tend to have bad perspectives, it usually involves a very "cut the bullshit" attitude? You'll see their Se has hardened them into a narrower viewpoint in sense that if they don't see it in reality, they don't believe it. Actions over words always. Very distrusting. Like someones x war veteran dad. \n\nNT's also tend to display a very strong sense of apathy towards others that I don't see in ISTP's. 
3	Is he a vindictive asshole or a clueless asshole?
1	Look at Ni vs Ne.\n\nIf he listens to you and gets to synthesize to a premature conclusion everything you said (just to clarify whether he got it right), then he's ISTP.\n\nIf he expands what you're saying and deepens it with associations (without quickly coming into conclusions), then he's INTP.\n\nBarely a difference, but that's me and my INTP boyfriend in discussions.\n\nAddition:\n\nSe vs Ne\n\nISTPs use past real world experiences to give breadth to any subject. Example: death = his experience when a  relative died\n\nINTPs use concepts and theories to deepen a statement. Example: death = (insert his favorite philosopher's take on it) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	I have a strong Se dominant.\n\nI'm fine with theory as long as it's a cool topic. And I'm not too much of a thrill-seeker.I like to delve deep into ideas that pertain to me.\n\nTeleportation is a neat idea, but it doesn't spark my interest. I'll still listen.\n\n&#x200B;
11	Sports?	What are some sports you like?\nEdit: Realised I wasn't super clear: I meant playing sports, but you can talk about sports that you like to watch too. 
17	None. I can’t even fake support the local teams. If someone asked me about a local athlete I would be so clueless that it would be obvious that I didn’t know anything.
12	Oh, I see that we have a problematic lack of separation. Watching vs doing. Anyways. Watching: pretty much limited to the super bowl,  people are awesome videos, some drifting and the occasional extreme sport video. Doing: All of them, can't remember a single sport I didn't like. As for hobbies I've done: football, basketball, skateboarding, mountain hiking, biking, running, tennis and freediving. Esportsy videogames.
7	Anything with an internal combustion engine and at least two wheels/tires. \n\n\nMy favorite being Formula Drift. But I’ll happily watch F1, GRC, WRC, Indy 500, super stock, etc. Only racing I really can’t stand is nascar. \n\n\nI don’t follow it religiously the way people do basketball/football/baseball/etc. But I generally do stay pretty close to Formula drift simply because I’ve been around the drift scene for 10 years. \n\n\nNow as far as sports i participate in, I don’t do many regularly. However I’m a huge fan of disc golf, competition shooting, and autocross (although I don’t get to do autocross very often anymore because I sold my project car). 
5	Watching men play with balls is akin to watching paint dry to me. I'll maybe watch the world cup every 4 years, until we get eliminated. Motor sports I like, but I have a limited attention span. I used to enjoy playing Football (proper, not American Handegg), Badminton, Tennis, Table Tennis.
5	Hockey.  Soccer.  The rest are boring to me.
4	Swimming. Solitary sports.
5	Climbing, running, swimming, paragliding and skiing mostly
5	Do esports count? If so, Overwatch. 
2	Hockey, love that shit. Playing hockey and making music are my two favourite things. Don’t really fuck with any other sports tho, I suck at them.
2	MMA is the only one I like to watch and participate in.  
1	Association Football. Squash, badminton, tennis. 
1	Floorball
1	Soccer
1	Love soccer, both playing and watching
1	Watching? None.\n\nPractising? A bunch - cycling, table tennis, running, weight lifting, volleyball and probably more.\n\n&#x200B;
1	What are these words you speak of? Team, sports?\n\nI don't know about you but me as istp, I'm so introverted that a concept of a team bigger than 3 or 4 doesn't appeal. Roll with the tight crew or none at all.
1	Used to be really into paintball in the early to mid-2000s before it sorta died down
1	Running is my life!
1	I play badminton. Kinda into handball and table tennis too.
1	when I was younger I was into "highland games" and lifting\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_games\n\nnot a fan of any team sports really
1	Motocross, supercross, arenacross, endurocross, enduro, trials, supermoto. 
1	I like to play volleyball and table tennis. But I'm not super passionate about any sport. 
1	i'm not good at sports but i like playing them. i guess basketball would be my favorite, idk how the actual game works but shooting hoops is fun. i've never liked watching sports, except a few years ago when i was into betting on csgo matches if that counts
1	[https://www.medieval-combat.net/](https://www.medieval-combat.net/)  \n\n\nThis  \n\n\n&#x200B;
1	Big boxing fan, casual basketball/football/mma fan.
1	Soccer, swimming, crew (rowing), sailing 
1	Surfing, skimboarding, wakeboarding, fishing, Rock climbing and any Motorsport. 
1	I like to play soccer though I am not that fit for it so I just play goalie
1	I LOVE swim. 
1	Football (soccer if you prefer), Handball, Biking, Running
1	Skiing and Basketball\n\nI love the concentration required for skiing down a steep line, or working on my technique. All my thoughts are focused on the feeling and planning my next turn. All my problems disappear.\n\nI love the competitiveness of basketball, the feeling when the ball leaves your hands and goes straight in. Or when you intercept a pass. They're small wins/successes over a course of 40 minutes. 
9	Move on or pursue ISTP?	I recently went on a couple dates with an ISTP. Thought they went really well and we were planning on another. Unfortunately I got a text saying that he wants to take time off from dating (my understanding is that he recently got out of a long term relationship).\n\nIs this over or is it worth reaching out to him at some point?
26	Lol. We mean what we say, or at least I do. For me, it means "he wants to take time off from dating". Don't complexify it.\n\nEnjoy your life, and he'll come back when he's sure about it. 
7	Depends how patient you are.  If you are very interested,  I think you could send a text once every 1-2 weeks and use his responses to gauge where he is.  If he's still in a funk after 2-3 months, then you should probably move on.  The important thing is not to drop contact completely because he will likely assume you weren't that interested after all. 
4	It is over for now. Who knows about the future. You can reach out to him at some point if that's what you want to, but there are no guarantees that anything will come out of it.\n\n&#x200B;
4	Recently, I had an ISTP tell me that if she wasn't so useless, she would fall in love with me.\n\nSpent a minute rereading that and then went about my day.\n\nI don't always get you folks, but usually the best step is to ignore what you say until we cross paths.
4	What is your MBTI type? That will help to decide. Also, of he's just gotten out of a relationship then it's best he take some time before getting into another relationship. 
1	It's over for now. If they were into you, they'd prioritize you. You can reach out again some time later, but I would not expect too much.

24	Are you a magnet to mentally ill ENFPs? What's your story?	I've been with a few. But the most recent one has been the worst (and also the most awakening experience) for me. A lot of self-growth, really.\n\nLet's call this guy David. We went to the same university. We met there and only had a few interactions. 6 years later I moved to the city where he lived, not for him, but  to pursue MBA. He's the only person I knew at that time, and this was everything started.\n\nDavid is a very social person. He has the city in his hands in terms of networks. He liked to bring me to parties, drinking sessions and awesome adventures on weekends with his friends. As an introvert, this was a shift of reality for me. Exciting.\n\nAs we got closer, David started to share with me his most deepest secrets. He said I'm the only person who knows this. He's born out of rape. He doesn't know who his dad is, and he hates his mother for leaving him to neighbors (his foster parents). I never felt a high degree of empathy 'til I got to know him this closer and what's behind his goofy, whimsical and incredibly optimistic exterior.\n\nWhile he's able to keep up with all his friendships, he left me an impression how important I was to him. He calls me his best friend. Later, he'd go to my apartment at 10 pm, sometimes slept in my couch, and invite me for some beers. Months later, I started to pay for his drinks because he lost his job, and I paid for his stab (huge money) at a bar. He became depressive (completely dark and locking himself inside his room and not eating for two straight days). It worried me.\n\nI had a motorbike accident, and when I recovered, I decided it's best to return to my hometown because I lost a lot of money during this recovery. David thought it's a regressive decision. He said it's best to leave my apartment and share a house with him (which he rented with a friend). I did consider his suggestion. Months later, I found out he'd not been paying for his rent and that friend had been struggling to ask him because David is a very emotional guy who hates to be confronted.\n\nStupid me, I did pay for the room since I was also occupying it. His friend went to Germany for 6 weeks, and a week before she came back, all bills were piling on David's end. This was when I got myself in trouble because David told his friend I could save him since he had no job. I was unemployed at that time, and extremely unhealthy.\n\nI came clean to his friend and said I'd give my remaining savings and pay the rest when I returned. I decided to visit my family (I was super broke), self-loathing for returning with empty pockets, and stayed there for two months.\n\nThis was the time I didn't know I had been catatonic for many months. I realised I quit MBA, spent so much time with David, always drunk, and holy shit I was in love with him the whole time, an explanation why I did care that deep. Thrice David would come home drunk and try to sleep-harrass me. I kept this truth. I lost huge amount of money. We went to several holidays with advanced plans we're splitting budget, and I'd always pay the bills like an emergency issue.\n\nWhen I came back, David already had a new job. He was drinking wine in the couch when I arrived, and asked me to sit with him and talk. He said I was so selfish and egotistical for leaving, and that I was fucked in the mind. That's the moment I lost the last streak of empathy I could have for him.\n\nI got to know more friends and started hanging out separately with each of them, becoming more outdoorsy, got a high-paying job, and started getting attention from a lot of people.\n\nNow I am at my parents' home. I've decided to move here for good. It's incredibly epiphanic how I can view my life (in a matter of 3 years) happening in that city with David.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: This post is not an attack to ENFPs. While there was a post in the history of this sub how ISTPs attract mentally ill people (diagnosed or not), mine simply happened to be an ENFP. I also replied on a comment that Ne is a trickster function of ISTPs, and Ne being ENFPs' dominant function, I thought there's a connection. I thought this made my own rollercoaster more amplified to delayed knowing of abuse.\n\n&#x200B;
16	I think there's something about an istp wanting to help and fix things that attracts the emotionally unstable partner. The problem is that people aren't as easy as replacing break pads. For the emotionally unstable seeking a relationship is a quick fix to healing their issues, without having to really acknowledge they are/have a problem. Seeking psychiatric help would be acknowledgement of having a problem, so a relationship is easier for them until it isn't. That's when then they seek it from others by cheating or breaking up, running around and then coming back for more. The desire to be helpful in this case is only enabling this bad behavior. 
3	I relate to this title on so many levels. \n\nThere have been at least 5. Why are ISTPs attractive?
5	Dunno if they're an ENFP, but about 4 years ago, we started chatting almost everyday over messenger. when i came home about a year later we hooked up and then decided when i came back home a year later we were going to be together, or her side was we didn't decide this till i came home the second time. During this second time of being away from home she called me crying asking for forgiveness for fucking her EX and his brother ( at separate times). i came home and about a month later i sent a message that may or may not have been that great, another few weeks go by and then she accuses me of trying to have sex with a different girl, it was an old friend i was trying to purchase a phone from, i was stupid and i caved to that pressure and just said i was trying to have sex. i was living with my parents at this time. the next major event i remember was i got a job i got my own apartment, she would come up on some weekends. one weekend she came up and said she couldn't do it any more and she had fallen out of love with me, it was so sudden i was kind of a mess. i checked her phone and she and her ex had at some point been watching shameless either over the phone or in person. and then the breakups started happening every couple of months, then i though we had things figured out and i was looking for a house ( i hate living in an apartment) so we went house shopping i found a house and just before finding this house she had told the EX she missed him. On my own good judgement and my families advice she was not put on any of the house paperwork. after we moved in things started steadily going down hill. the breakups started being every couple of weeks, i was constantly accused of cheating (going to the store, going in my room, going to the library, playing games, falling asleep on the couch, receiving phone calls, asking for time to play my games, porn(because this ment i was sexting with someone)). she wanted to see the ocean, so last year i decided to take a weekend trip to see the ocean, it all went well till she seen some porn on my phone, and of course this means i am sexting someone. she says the porn is evidence i ave been cheating on her the entire time.\n\nsome other notable events:\n\nshe was in a manic episode and made up this elaborate story about meeting a dude she knew at the store and how she and her sisters were gonna hang out with him. it was worded in a way that she was trying to make me jealous. i told her i wasn't worried and this set her off, which led to the events of the next few weeks. as she was leaving for her sisters house i told her not to shove the dick to far down her throat, so for the next day she insisted she sucked his dick and let him play with her tits and then she backed it down to her just looking at it. and she finally shut up about it when i told her i asked the dude about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile i was laying in her bed with her she told some dude she might fuck him, she insists this was not a big deal because i was there and knew she was joking( she was trying to upset me).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshe received two messages from Her EX i didn't catch the messages, and she screamed at me asking if i saw the messages.\n\nat one point she told me i could go through her phone but she deleted all of the messages between them.\n\n\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni love sex and she uses it to manipulate me. i have gone emotionally numb in this entire relationship\n\nshe currently lives in my house pays for some groceries and her car. i love her son he is not mine.\n\nnothing i can do will ever be enough for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nafter the dick sucking story i told her we were done, she has tried to use sex to get me back several times. it was one of the best times we ever had.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis whole situation is addicting its worse than cocaine and i've never even done cocaine i can't' escape it. she hates my mother and my mother is one of the kindest and sweetest people on this planet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am sorry for rambling folks,\n\ni show up as ISTP on the MB got INTP once took another one for INTP VS ISTP and it showed me 43% INTP and the other side ISTP\n\nShort Version\n\ni ignored several red flags, made a few mistakes and now i have someone who is batshit crazy living in my house scott free, and i don't have the heart to kick them out, i've told her we were done, but she keeps pulling me back in  \n\n\nEDIT: she has been diagnosed with Bi-polar, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and depression
2	Cool story. Can't say I have anything like it to share though.
2	Sorry, I don't think I understand the point of this post... ?
2	Oh and btw i don’t think it’s fair to say ISTPs attract mentally ill people... seems a big generalisation based on personal experience
2	I browse this board now and then since ironically, I dated a mentally ill ISTP (still friends though). ENFP is your duality partner (ENFJ is actually conflicting, the P/J flip is bullshit btw). That's why you keep attracting them. My ISTP was attracted to me since I appear like an ENFP due to my ENTP subtype (AKA I know how to say nice shit to people).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, there is a connection, they're attracted to your functions and vice versa.
1	How do you know he’s ENFP? Either way, he just sounds like a messed up, manipulative dude. Sorry to hear.
2	I admittedly tl;dr'd parts of this but I know of several ISTP/ENFP relationships that were all dumpster fires. I like both personality types and really think they should stay away from each so they can be happy. Separately. \n\nDisclaimer: If you're reading this and this doesn't apply to you, I'm glad for you, you are a rarity.
1	Aw this post makes me both sad and a little down on myself. I'm an ENFP and have had a history of mental illness, but I would never take advantage of anyone so please don't think we're all like that. I love feeling safe and taken care of though, because of my history of being hurt a lot and I think ISTPs are really good at that. Before I met an ISTP, I always thought they were cold and quiet (because they are rational) but reading this subreddit and meeting a really healthy and wonderful ISTP made me realize how much you guys care about others and how cuddly you can be (must be the Fe, which makes you guys very different from ISFPs, for example).\n\nBut maybe also take a closer look at yourself and why you're attracted to those types of people. Not meant as a criticism at all and I hope you don't take it that way, but I know that I was attracted to a certain type of person too when I was more depressed. It might have way more to do with the individual than Myers Briggs.
1	I seem to attract a lot of "Mentally ill" people, I remember that one ex who was BPD. To be honest, I was kinda an asshole to here when It got too much for me, as I just totally disappeared from her life (Blocked her and moved on to another city).\nI couldn't handle all the drama, ups and downs etc. \n\nOtherwise, most people I've attracted were depressed. Maybe that's because my very nature is to fix things, and somehow they sense that.
1	Loving the 2 out of 3 ENFP's in the comments who flocked to this thread to tell us how all our experiences or perceptions are wrong because they *don't agree*. Please fuck off. You don't get to decide whos experiences are or are not real just because you don't like it. Grow up, contribute something, or GTFO.\n\nThat being said: I've had similar experiences. I don't know what the fuck it is about ENFPs that make just such a perfect unsuspecting simpleton vs overdramatic overassuming teenager relationships, but thats been the jist of every single one so far. \n\nNone of them have ever gotten so far as romantic because I'm good at communication and ENFP's (that I've experienced) can not handle criticism or honesty well at all (giving or receiving). Ultimately, I want to spend time with people who will treat me well and as I would treat them, and actually perform duties of a friend. So far most ENFP's I've experienced tend to treat me as a fun toy which they assume they know more about than they actually do. Then backpedal and accuse me of being a demon when I point out that "hey that was kinda rude" or "no you dont know me or x thing all that well please stop." and cause needless drama. It's stupid, it's tiring, I don't have time for it. \n\nWould love to meet an ENFP that has a handle on their bullshit or likes improving themselves. 
38	It's mostly 20% Learning Zone and 80% switching between Comfort Zone and Fear Zone.	
12	Thinking about it, I am past my comfort zone. I spend most of my time in the fear zone and have some learning zone days and I hope I can make everyday a learning zone one day, I think that I am close to being there.
6	Yesterday I started a job at an Indian restaurant. I'm a white dude who doesn't speak any Indian. I have thrown myself into the unknown and it's both exciting and scary. I have no idea what's going on lol. I have problems integrating myself in my own family's culture let alone Indian culture...
3	Turning 34 in the green!
3	The learning and growth zones should be the same dimension , but the creator of that illustration really wanted 4 colors/zones.
2	I recently got a promotion at work that i am like half qualified for, but its an easy-ish position to learn on the go. Just takes making a lot of judgement calls and managing time. Its basically been trial by fire my entire time so far, but im finally starting to get the hang of it. 
1	Thanks for the picture it's amazing.\n\nFellows IPs and Ti doms, growth is the way forward of life. The perpetual unending process that gives meaning, joy and greatness overall. Thanks for the reminder. 
1	Great picture but I don't agree with the title at all.
11	Do any of you ISTPs find hard to look people in the eyes, or interact with them if they’ve lied to you about something,they gossip, or their just a untrustworthy person?	
26	I don't find it hard to look people in the eyes. I despise interacting with them if they gossip, lie and are two faced. Come to think of it- i hold an uncomfortably( for them)strong eye contact then. 
12	It's easier to talk and think when you're not looking at the person, this is a scientific fact. I'm not an articulate person so this helps me, but people interpret this as like disrespect or me having aspergers. I do make an effort to make eye-contact more though.
7	Personally, I don’t like eye contact. My INTP friends use the N part of them to see into my soul XD. \n\nBut yeah, I don’t actually interpret eye contact or facial expressions - it confuses the perceiver part of me actually. I can get more information if their face is blank. \n\nIf they’re a lying, gossipy, and untrustworthy person, I can tell from a distance, and usually avoid being near them at all. 
9	i don't like eye contact i feel like people are staring into my soul
6	Depends how I feel, if they're shamelessly lying to me/something similar AND I trusted them before, I can't look at them because I'm disgusted.\n\nBut if I'm angry or I didn't like them in the start, I stare them right down. They should feel the shame, and apparently my glare is quite the something.
3	I was taught very early to look people in the eye, so no issue there. I find in life that there are very few people I must interact with.
3	Eye contact makes me feel awkward in that I never seem to know if it's too much or not enough, but also am I blinking too much? So I end up feeling off balance and thinking more about the eye contact than the interaction. \n\nNow I mostly just let myself focus on the interaction and not get caught up with as much direct eye contact unless someone is trying to stare me down. Then I don't care if I'm socially awkward, I'm not easily intimidated and I'm usually not about to let someone think they have that power over me. Well, unless it works in my favor.
3	I have no issue w/ looking at someone in the eyes, and if I'm intrigued with what they're saying I do look them in the eyes.  But one of my few central principles is all of my friends are completely trustworthy and loyal.  Show me loyalty and I'll have unbridled loyalty and respect for you.  If you take advantage of my loyalty, I'll see you as subhuman.
3	No
3	I have the opposite problem. Apparently people find it intimidating 
2	No. The opposite is true for me. If I don’t think a person is honest I’m likely to be extra assertive.
22	I can do anything, perfectly, once.	more than that im bored. bye
10	Lol that happens to me now and then and everyone asks “how’d you do that?”\n\n“Uh......magic”
8	I've unfortunately realized this applies to my work. I keep getting new assignments but I keep becoming bored with them in a couple months. The only thing that keeps my attention is learning something new. Unfortunately, people don't pay you to learn forever. You eventually have to do something.\n\nSo now I'm job hunting trying to solve the existential crisis of finding out what I can handle wanting to do more than once. 
5	My boyfriend is an ISTP and he’s that way too. Just naturally good at things for the first time.
5	I have this thing when im learning a piece of music where once i memorize it (which is pretty quick) and can play the whole piece perfectly, i  start to fuck it up for some reason. 
3	k
2	This applies to me when playing VNs.
2	Depends on the thing. I have somethings where I have just dropped it once I've mastered it. Other things are more permanent. Like there are boardgames I can play forever. 
2	Ok, but can you beat me in Fighterz?
1	I have something similar with music and that's why I never look up lyrics of songs I like. Once I know the lyrics I become bored with the particular song and have to move to another one. 
1	Agreed. The first time it's thoughtless, off the cuff, pure instinct. Bam, nailed it. \n\n"Do it again!"\n\nWell shit, now it's expected. Fail.
1	Same. Same. At work I’m lucky enough to have a job where I work on new things all the time but once I finish a project and have to go back to it it’s like a mental temper tantrum happens. 
16	At work	Do you ever just put your headphones/earphones on just to avoid unnecessary conversations at work?
12	90 % of the time
6	My coworkers know my rule. Send me a message on Slack, don't interrupt me. This way, I can divert my attention away from my individual task at a proper stopping point. It's more efficient, and has also saved me from the unnecessary conversations that OP is trying to avoid.\n\nOnce they have my attention, I become a pleasant person to be around that genuinely cares about what they want. It makes everything acceptable. 
5	I wish, but my whole job is talking to people and I fear I may soon lose my sanity.
2	My boss told me to lessen my “headphone time” so I can be more approachable. I get her point and don’t blame her but sometimes I just need to get in the zone to work properly. 
2	I really want to but I am a lead in a NOC so my job is to know what's going on around me at all times. \n\nOnce my management promotion goes through I'll get more headphone time 
2	I work all night on my own doing security so nobody else to talk to lol  
2	Sometimes I just put the headphones without music to just avoid conversations.
2	Yea but it usually doesn't work tbh. 
1	Buddy, that's 90% of my work day!
1	Basically always. 
1	No headphones because that’s unprofessional but I do avoid unnecessary communication 
1	Always
1	Nothing better at work than the days where I can just shut my door and work in peace
50	I'm in love and I dont know what the fuck i'm supposed to do with it.	Female istp, 25 years here, and ya'll will be freaking delighted to learn that i have found love. Just kidding, idk if y'all give a shit but its true, i'm in love and its the fucking worst. I have never really liked romantically people outside of a few weeks crush on some guy freshman year of highschool but other than that, i have never once felt gushy feelings or that butterfly shit everyone talks about, and in the case of my ex, we were best friends initially, and i was genuinely affectionate and i cared deeply about him but not in any romantic sense, and honestly, i could've been happy the rest of my life with him, we got along perfectly fine, solid partners in life, blahblah, but things didn't work out geographically so i moved on, not a big deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, like 2 years ago, I met this guy, and its like my world was turned inside out and I still feel that way, like every time i look into his eyes my heart pounds and recently when i heard he got into a car accident and i visited him at the hospital, the sight of him lying on the hospital bed unconscious made my heart drop and I almost blacked out. its unnerving, how strongly i feel for him. Now given that i had been single for most my life and have no example of a solid healthy relationship around me to emulate, i dont' really know how to handle this. if i could have it my way, i would never have met this guy and have continued in my solitary unbothered existence and never felt the need to let people affect me emotionally, but this guy has a huge inadvertent influence on my emotional health, and i can't keep him out so we've been hanging out in this weird "friends with benefits" thing which is as much as i feel like i can handle at this point because i can't imagine seriously dating and being so deeply involved with someone who has such a huge influence on my emotions. I don't know how to trust him with it, like not even for any flaws in his personality, but for example, had he died from that car accident, i think it might've broken me for a very long time. Shit shook me. I don't know how to have these feelings and i definitely don't know how to date someone that i have feelings like that for. It was nice in the past to date people that i had got along relatively well with, but had no emotional hold over me in anyway. I don't know how to operate in a relationship with feelings that fucking real. I can't unmeet him, and i definitely can't stop hanging out with him, and you know what, everything would be perfectly fucking fine in my emotional purgatory except he had to go and almost die, and now I don't know anything except i dont want to lose him. Help, i have the emotional development of a fucking child, i don't think i'm evolved enough to handle this right, i dont know if i'll ever be able to let him in any deeper than he is currently is, everything inside me screams at me to run, but I can't stay the fuck away from him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat the fuck do I do? Anyone else been in this situation? Manage to rise above your collective bullshit self and surprise yourself with how fucking stable and mature of a human being you can be even when the thing/person you love beyond anything you could've ever imagined is fucking destructible? Why the flipping fuck is he so mortal? do i have to die first so that I never have to experience him dying? fuck. Btw, i know he has feelings for me, but idk how deep they run or if he feels about me the way i feel about him. he also has no idea that i feel so strongly about him, i keep that shit locked down. I try to show him that i care through my actions, like showing up at the hospital, i always say yes to whatever he wants to do, because it really doesn't matter as long as i'm there with him and for the most part our hobbies line up pretty closely, sex is possibly the only time i let a more emotional/tender side of me show (btw having sex with someone you have feelings for, holy shit, thats a different experience), but we've never once verbalized anything, i spend most of my time shitting on him mercilessly, and getting shit on mercilessly. i think he's an INTP but honestly, i dont know how much that matters. he could be a fucking alien and it wouldn't matter given these fucking feelings. So yep. heres the problem. i'm in love and i dont know what the fuck to do with it. shoot dat goodshit life experiences/advice at me, ya?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr i've got fucking feelings and i'm trying to figure out a way to coexist with these feelings peacefully.
30	You wrote a lot of stuff. Just tell him how you feel. Fuck it.
29	As a 28 year old man with a relatively cold heart, I am extremely embarrassed (but strongly compelled) to say that this may be the cutest thing I've ever read. I stopped working for a fucking full 20 minutes to write this at work. I can't really tell by what's written as to when this accident occurred, but if it's recent, I wish for your friend's speedy recovery.\n\nAs for your personal issue, you must come to terms with the fact that love cannot be rationalized, no matter how hard you attempt to be objective about it (and yes, what you've written is THE fucking textbook definition of love).\n\nIt is your choice as to whether or not you want to make something of this situation, but consider the possibility if you don't express any genuine interest. He may move on. That, I think would be the worst case scenario for you. It is ~~almost~~ most certainly better to risk it all and have it fail than to have to deal with unrequited love (Speaking from experience). Just know that you will not be able to maintain the relationship you've described forever.\n\nLove is a two-way street. As you know, it takes a certain degree of trust between two people for this to happen. That ALSO means putting yourself in a vulnerable spot, at the total mercy of the other individual. I realize this may be scary, but if he knows you at all, I am certain that seeing you in such a state will make him definitely realize he means a lot to you. I think all you need to do is to be a bit more expressive. This post is a good example. In some hypothetical scenario if he were to read this, I am certain he would reciprocate these feelings you have for him many times over.\n\nYou say he has feelings for you but you don't know how much. Same goes for him. How is he to know how heart-wrenchingly moonstruck you are if you don't say a single word to him about it? Men, I think, are naturally more afraid of rejection. Lay down the red carpet, and I guarantee, he will let his feelings be known. No need to try and guess. We just need a little push sometimes to get it through our thick skulls.\n\nThanks for your heartfelt post. Makes me feel more human. A real pleasure to read. Best of luck. I don't even know you but I'm shipping this so fucking hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Grammar, additions, omissions.
15	Been there, still there. I know what you are feeling. You've looked at the logical side of relationships, then out of nowhere BOOM, nothing makes sense. It's deep, confusing, exciting, and if it ends it's fucking physically painful because you never truly understood it to begin with. All you can do is let it ride. If you are happy let it be, and remember everyday is a new day, and adventure. You will learn as you go.
8	This is a good post, it's rare to see ISTPs be so open about how it feels to have no fucking clue about what to do with our or other people's feelings, even when we all struggle with it. I've been in a similar situation, but not quite the same, the main difference being that she didn't felt the same as I did. But I know a whole lot about a single person having such an strong impact in me emotionally it gets scary, so story time:\n\nThere was this girl in highschool, she was really damn attractive and her whole personality made me feel like I was about to melt in warmness. The way she talked, the way she smiled, everything about her was just what I loved seeing in a girl. Whenever we talked or texted, my mood improved, seeing her smile made me feel butterflies. Thing is, she had really strong depressive tendencies and those were affecting me *hard*. Whenever she was feeling down my own mood would dampen, one time she messaged me what looked like a last goodbye and I felt so sick in my stomach I puked, fortunately she didn't end it right then and there, cause I don't know how I would have dealt with it. Anyway, after about 2 or 3 months of "dating" (she never wanted to make it official, have no clue why) right before the beginning of winter vacations, she completely ghosted me and everything died down. Needless to say, I felt fucking awful for the entire vacations, but two or so months later I was back at my old self. \n\nWhat I learned from that experience is that sometimes we can get too fucking intense for our own good, and that it's good to take a step back and evaluate the situation with a cool head. The only advice I can give you is to decide wether or not you can trust that guy with your true feelings, and that's something only you can judge. If shit hits the fan and you end up heartbroken, believe me, you're gonna be fine, it'll hurt like hell for a while, but ISTPs are pretty damn tough and you'll be able to move on, like always. Best of luck to you guys and I hope everything works out fine!
5	Ahahahahhahaha I love this so much. I remember freaking out just one day on the guy I've been fwb with and I'm still trying to just take it one day at a time. Cause I can't gauge how strong my feelings are for him yet or they get so intense that I try to shove it back down the box it came from. \n\nBut you're definitely not wrong about how sex is so much more enjoyable and vulnerable when you have feelings for the other person. And since you do love him and he has said that he has feeling for you then say it. I think the weight of your feelings will be lifted once you tell him you love him.\n\nI'm excited to see how things turn out for you. 
3	you'll never get rid of your feelings by not doing anything. either you tell him how you feel, get rejected, and move on, get in a relationship with him, it doesn't work out, and you move on, or you get in a lasting relationship. even if you don't want to get involved with him, you can't run from your emotions forever. some people never fall in love, it's not something you should (or can) ignore. you already know what you have to do, you're just scared of what could happen
3	Aw, I know the feeling girl. (ENFP here). Count yourself lucky that you've met someone who makes you feel this way - not everyone does, or at least it takes them even longer to. It's the most amazing feeling in the world, and I know you're feeling like you're in another world. \n\nMy advice as someone who's been there: find some outlet for your feelings. for ISTPs, it's probably exercise or something else physical. Try to write or vent as much as you can. This is important, because you're having more feelings that you usually do and you don't want them to get too bottled up or you can't think clearly and then you won't be yourself. Being yourself is important. \n\nSecondly, enjoy yourself and don't worry about how deep his feelings are. Be true to yourself and act/say how you feel you should. Let the moment carry you. We admire ISTPs for their confidence (heck we admire all people for their confidence) so don't worry too much about him. You won't ever truly know anyways unless he tells you. Things may not work out and you may lose him, which is the scariest prospect in the world, but it's better to have lost him being yourself than to lose him being someone else. Trust me - that kind of regret takes years to get over. So if you want to tell him about your feelings, definitely go for it. \n\nI'm so happy for you - this is an amazing time for you. Good luck and keep us updated!
3	Develop your feeling side, go for gold.
3	Lovely.  Drink it up.  Just trust yourself.  You'll figure it out- like you always do. 
2	I've been going to a psychotherapist for 2 years just to learn how to deal with my feelings.\n\n1. you cant block them, unfortunately. we are weak humans no matter what we do, and the emotional part of the brain must be taken into consideration.\n\n2. you have to find a way to listen to these feelings, give them some free time to roam around your body, react to them . for example when i noticed im feeling sad about something, im letting the sadness some room and time to roam and maybe even cry a little.\n\ntheres more but i forgot ill edit if my brain wakes up maybe\n\n
1	I feel like a fucking cliche vending machine these days, but "That's Life". Shit does fuck you up for a while on occasion. Enjoy the good bits, try not to dwell on the bad bits too much (easier said than done!)
1	Go all in and see what happens next. It will either be a beautiful flame or a fireball from hell.  Either way you have your answer.
-3	you're not in love, it's just your feelings doing their thing from valentines day hype bs. go do some physical work
11	ISTPs, are you ever actively looking for/wanting a relationship?	Or are you pretty much never actively looking for a relationship, unless the right person comes along and changes your mind?\n\nThose who weren't looking for relationships but ended up in one, what about that person changed your mind?
8	I used to be, from about puberty til about 30.  Had multiple long-term serious relationships, usually lasting ~2 years.\n\nThen I came around to the notion that what I was seeking in others was something I needed to develop within myself, first.\n\nNow the prospect of a relationship is somewhat daunting.
10	Never looking, I let it come to me. If the person seems like they’re worth it I ride the wave.
7	During my early adulthood I decided to be single because people are so unpredictable, in the sense that I didn't know how much more I should fake so that I could be 'acceptable'. I realised probably it was better for me to be alone than to be lonely in a relationship, which was a crazy idea because this is very much against my culture.\n\nThen I met my best friend in university who ended up being my husband. He changed my mind about commitment because he somehow manages to accept me as I am, no matter how weird my ISTP quirks seemingly are. He is ENTJ and I did have to make him understand about my quirks by explaining the logic behind everything that he questioned. Since we work well as a team, and are obviously attracted to each other, we decided to become life partners. It has been working very well and we are managing our relationship in a cold, calculating way that only we can understand although not very relatable for most. I mean, I don't even remember who proposed? It was a logical decision to get married and it somehow just happened. I think it is perfect for me and I am grateful for the mind camaraderie I share with him. If you are looking, I hope you will find someone who makes you feel comfortable in our own skin at any moment of the day for the rest of your life.
6	I would like a relationship, but I'm a dang ISTP so probably won't happen and I don't go around looking for one, especially since it's my senior year of highschool and in 6 months I'll be moving on with life.\nTrying tp get a busy INFP to go see a movie, that's workin out about as much as a road trip to Hawaii with flat tires.
5	Enjoying being single but missing the companionship and closeness another can bring. I'm also less emotionally available so I look for younger people since it seems most girls my age (25) just aren't interested in growing a relationship so much as unwrapping their perfect companion. Mix in the being "busy", ghosting culture, cheating, drama, and preferred type, it boils down to me being single and (now) dropping out immediately when they pull stupid shit. I know what I want, I work hard to be open, to examine my feelings and put time into learning a new person. But this culture is bullshit for growing things, and peoples standards are laughable at best. Life isn't a rom-com.\n\nSo, yes, seeking, but with a keen eye and partially closed heart.\n\nI'd rather have a puppy than a girlfriend, far more satisfying than my experiences thus far.
5	I didnt seek -- Got screwed over a couple of times and decided to go mgtow. But one came along and somehow actually survived hanging out with me lol; I am truely impressed by her resilience and loyalty, so 10+ years of relationship later i decided to commit and marry her. Legit best girl in the world for me.
3	Throughout my 20s I wanted a relationship. Then after three serious ones and a lot of dating, mostly before I even got into a relationship, I am enjoying being single. \n\nOr maybe I just haven't met someone who matches my personality better. \n\nIf I were to get into another relationship I know damn sure to get to know them slowly and never ever become exclusive in two weeks or move in together within six months. 
3	I’m currently searching, only problem is that there’s noone I currently like except for one person, but she doesn’t like me back, and I don’t have the faintest idea of how to approach girls with something like this. I have pretty bad people skills so my virginity probably stays for a while lol.
3	No, it seems like wasted effort.\n\nI have a saying, “There’s always another Wendy”.\n\nIf you don’t get the reference, I’m Peter Pan and Wendy is the girl he takes on his adventures. Peter Pan is the eternal child and Wendy always grows up eventually. But, there’s always another Wendy.\n\nIt’s been true throughout my entire life. I do whatever I want, a new Wendy will inevitably follow with little effort on my part. Then, Wendy will grow up and a new Wendy will take her place. \n\nAs is the cycle. \n\n
3	no. i mostly just work on self improvement and try to make myself someone who could be in a healthy relationship, otherwise i don't see any reason to get into one. problem is i don't know how to pursue that with someone when i am ready
1	From my late teens to early 30s. I wouldn’t necessarily say I sought relationships; more of companionship of the sexual kind. Most of those lasted anywhere from one night to 3 months.\n\nNow in my mid 30s I have little to motivation to seek any relationship.

80	Sounds pretty relatable	
6	istp or intp here\n\ni whished it was that easy to manage
11	Perks of having inferior Fe. 
4	I have a question for ISTPs in the grip of Fe, and how, and if it affects Ti Se.	When ever I’m around friends just one, or more, or especially a girl i like i feel like i get kind of self conscious, and my Ti Se takes a hit or doesn’t perform as well. Basically things like driving skills thinking making decisions when buying things, or just decisions in general. Would that be something with the grip of inferior Fe
6	No, that’s normal human cognition. \n\nOther human beings, and interacting with them, are very taxing to our attention. \n\nEver try playing a video game that requires concentration while also holding a conversation?\n\nWhen it comes to someone we want to impress, this effect is magnified. 
2	Podcasts	Are there any y’all enjoy? Could be related to personality type or just in general. 
3	Not super into any of the typology-related podcasts. Personality Hacker *occasionally* has something worth listening to, like an interview with Dario Nardi. \n\nSpeaking of Jung is nice to listen to if you want something more Jungian that isn’t type-related. \n\nI like the Mindscape podcast with Sean Carroll. Usually covers interesting topics with people who actually know what they’re talking about. 
3	Joe Rogan, Secular Buddhism. \n\nAlso, get Audible, it’s my absolute favourite thing in the modern world.

3	I really enjoy My Brother My Brother and Me, great comedy/advise podcast
2	I love joe rogan and Duncan trussel 
2	Sam Harris, Rubin Report, some Joe Rogan, some Art of Manliness
2	Mike row's podcasts 
2	- College info geek (not really about college but two guys share their practical life insights)\n\n- The ground-up show (a minimalist guy who does interviews to artists/entrepreneurs/comedians/etc)\n\nBoth shows are in video format on youtube and audio on podcasts platforms.
2	Only one i listen to is joe rogans podcast. mostly when  there is expert talking with him, rarely listen when there is just some random dude but sometimes those can be interesting too
1	Red Scare
1	I love listening to 20somethinghood on Spotify. I am female and I'd love to have girlfriends but to be honest I have zero interest in all the dramas that come with it. So listening to their podcast gives me a sense of being in a girl friends group with zero emotional commitment. I also like Sealed Section, which talks about sex in a very open, honest and witty way. I think there is nothing wrong in talking openly about sex because I see it as a human experience, but of course by now I realise that is mostly inappropriate, at least in my current circles. I enjoy their podcast because I get to hear how others see it which I find fascinating.
1	Tiger Belly & Theo Von
1	[Thinking Allowed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qy05/episodes/downloads). It's rather short - only half an hour, but really packed with content. Concerns sociology, anthropology sometimes crime studies. 
1	Of the normie podcasts I enjoy some Joe Rogan episodes (depends on guests).\n\nAll other podcasts I listen to are highly specific to my field of business and are rather technical. Though I have a fucking huge backlog on those. Mostly because those people don't know what they're talking about.
6	Why are humans so annoying?	Why can't they worry about their own dull existance and stop asking me moronic questions about my life?
17	You are one as well.
13	This is ironic
4	They like to share their problems with others because it then feels like it is only half that hard now. Stupid.
3	Hey I'm not annoying
3	no u 
3	... says the hooman asking a question 
2	What is the problem?
2	I don't know, hell is other people.\n\nSo how's life? 
2	I would answer this question but it's too edgy for me.
2	They ask questions about your life cause they have nothing going on in theirs.
13	Authority problem.	I have a good friend(ENTJ) who likes to play the dominant role as they usually do. As long it doesn't effect me and my mood, I don't have a problem with that. \n\nThe thing is, that I've started to do business with him a time ago which is very profitable which I would like to continue. \n\nThe problem is, that when he always try to be more dominant and 'knowing it better' it really affects my thinking and mood as well, in a negative(fucking feelings) way. \n\nTheir Te can spot the truth or a personal preference(which I recognized) and it's hard for me to come up with my own because I preference to do internal thinking first to decide for the best option. And they just throw shit out, belive it's the best, play that dominant role and want to move on asap.. I hate that shit 💯\n\nHow would you overcome that?\n\nSometimes I do stupid shit which I learn from when he brings it up, which I am thankful for. But, the respectless way these people talk sometimes makes me to punch them in their face, which I obviouslly can't do rn. I am searching for a better solution. \n\nI belive I will do my own thing in some time, but it will take some time before everything is made up ready.\nIt's like a big point rn where he needs me and I need him, but I like to overcome such bitch behaviour of people for now and the future.\n\nAny exp in this? 
12	We respect authority right up to the point that the rules don’t make sense. He finds that condescension helps him control people around him because it often does. If everything is as you portray, you need to push back. Either he will come to understand condescension doesn’t work with you and he needs to find a better tact or you will be angry and miserable until the situation blows up.\n\nIf I might be so bold, the next time he pulls it, give him a “fuck you” and not a friendly/joking fuck you, but a fuck you knock that shit off with a finger to his chest.
4	talk to him about it. if he doesn't understand and/or won't change, i wouldn't want to be business partners with him. it's both of your problems but if i were you i'd never be able to start treating him as an authoritative figure, so either he'd have to change or i'd stop working with him. i don't know the details of your business arrangement so i don't get the exact situation though
4	This is a communication issue. Communicate this to him.\n\nSit him down. Let him know you need to talk to him about something. Tell him how you feel and how his behaviors effect you. Use "when you say this the way you did, it makes me feel this" as a formula, but try not to name his behaviors or name them in a derogatory way. So don't say "when you snap, boss me around, be a bitch to me, act like a jerk" say "when you said _________ (thing he said word for word) it made me feel like this and it makes it hard to stay around you" \n\nBe understanding. Be empathetic. Go into it assuming good intent on his part. State your intentions "I say this because I care about maintaining our relationship and want to continue to be your friend/partner", tell him what you would like him to do to fix this situation. \n\nIf the conversation seems to be going in a bad direction, it upsets him, or it seems to be going worse not better, end it. Do not let it become an argument or a fight, do everything in your power to prevent this. \n\nYou can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink, and unfortunately this is also true of people. Some people are not open to criticism, open minded, or have the ability to think outside of themselves and when confronted with that, will do everything in their power to push blame, avoid the conversation, in order to protect the ego. You can only hope your friend cares enough about you to listen and change his behaviors. If he's not, there's nothing anyone can do. He has to decide to be open and considerate. No one can make or move him to be that. \n\nTry to vent the emotional build up from his bullshit before confronting him. Don't bring your emotions to the talk, or it will influence it in a negative way. Bring good energy in only. People can sense emotions even if we, as dumbass Istp, cannot. They can also sense intent. It does effect the other person and their mood and mind and thoughts, and it can hinder conversation if they're on guard or suspicios or defensive because they picked up on your anger before youve even gotten the chance to speak. \n\nThat said, good luck. I hope it works out. If he is really your friend, he will listen.\n\n\n
2	This an alpha/ dominance play. The only way to counter act this is to push back. I encountered similar types in my Army days and other professions. These people find they get the best results by essentially pushing others around and announcing their way is best.\n\nYou will have to challenge him head on and don’t back down. Even if there’s an instance where you may be wrong, you still need to push back as he will see you as a pushover.\n\nTldr: people won’t fuck with you as much once they know you’re not the type to back down and submit to their will.
2	>Any exp in this? \n\nYeah, don't go into business with friends or family.
18	Forgetting about conversations with people	Hey fellow ISTPs,\n\nA recurring complaint from my significant other is that I constantly forget things we talk about. For example, during the day when talking by phone and telling how it's going she tells me she is going to the cinema watch movie X and gives me a brief description of what that movie will be about. Next day I ask her how did he cinema went if she enjoyed the movie, and what was the movie about .. :( the worse is that I have absolutely no memory of her telling me about the movie, even though she says I even articulated a discussion when she was telling me about the movie.\n\nThis also happens with other people and is getting in the way of things. Do any of you feel the same issue? Do you have any techniques to mitigate that? Can it be the start of memory impairment? I'm just 32.
27	I generally don't remember things I don't care about such as a movie someone is going to see. It's just not useful information that helps me understand anything, so it's in one and out the other. I'm sure low Fe plays a part in entertaining the conversation despite not giving a shit.
8	No man, it's not memory impairment 🖤 We all have selective memories, even si dom, just in a different way.  Ours tends to pick and choose what we remember and if it's not interesting to us, or we're listening while doing something else, the details just aren't going to stick.  \n\nOn how to mitigate, idk other than putting all your focus on the conversation and utilizing things like repetition to commit the details to memory; although when I've done that, I feel terribly disingenuous because I'm concentrating so hard on concentrating and I get this really weird, intense, big eyed look that ends up freaking out whoever I'm listening to (this is legit feedback I've received).  Perhaps you'll have better luck.  \n\nOur memories are actually pretty decent, though the interpretation is subjective depending on the other person's type.  My enfp friends can't believe the shit I remember.  My infj husband thinks I don't pay attention to anything. My esfj mom can't believe I don't remember things the same way she does.\n\ntl;dr You are not losing your mind.  We're just not detail oriented and that parlays into what we retain of everything, including conversations.
7	It took 20 years but my SO finally came to understand that I don’t remember the minutiae of her day. If she tells me something she thinks is important she will need to remind me. If she tells me she will be flying out of town in a month she needs to remind me a few days prior., not because I don’t pay attention to her, but because I will get along just fine with her out of town and I don’t see it as nearly the big deal she sees it.\n\nI’m really not forgetful, I’m a master at prioritizing information.
3	Be proactive about having forgotten. If I say something like “remind me again what the movie was about?” Or “did you already tell me what the movie was about? Could you remind me again?” It’s generally well received vs just asking what the movie was about\n\nI do the same thing. Forget little things like that all the time
2	I think maybe you feel obligated to ask her how was her day and dont really care about the answer. \nAnd the next day you ask same question.\nBecause well, ISTP is paying attention and they are sucks at small talk so they deploy the same question arrays like:\n-how was your day\n-what movie did you watch\n-what do you eat on lunch/dinner, etc\n\nMission accomplished, no further action required. ISTP just forget it and ask the roughly same question again so that we dont being called as cold or distant? \nI often do it. And this is what I think I am doing. Correct me if I'm wrong. 
1	no, i have a very good memory for past conversations, even though i usually don't care about whatever it is we were talking about. a lot of times i'll bring up something someone said a long time ago and they'll be surprised i remembered
9	If I weren't an INTP I would want to be an ISTP.	Being an ISTP would be cool.
30	No man you don't what is wrong with you. 
19	If I weren’t an ISTP, I too would want to be an ISTP.
5	Okay man
5	Can you elaborate on your statement? What are some things about being an INTP you dislike and what are some things about being an ISTP you think are more favorable?
5	Oddly enough, most of my friends (and presently I really only have three close ones) have been INTPs, with a dash of F. It’s not a bad combination in my experience. 
1	intps are smarter tbh
-2	I believe I changed from INFP to INTP to ISTP. It's totally possible... Probably not on purpose though. It's just a matter of different experiences and growth when you're young
5	I have 2 interesting question I think about ISTPs and emotions.	I’m a ISTP and people give me really weird looks sometimes when I’m talking to other people next to them or just casually doing something, and the only reason I can guess they’d be looking at me like that is because I’m not showing certain emotions there used to seeing maybe? It’s a look like something’s missing and there trying to figure it/me out I don’t really no!\n\nSometimes I think it makes some of them uncomfortable, and I asked a question on another website that do unemotional people make you uncomfortable and im wondering if you guys have experienced this personally or in others. 
5	personally i don't experience anything like that. i usually have a very neutral expression, sometimes people take that as me looking angry or whatever but people who know me know that's just how i look, and strangers don't seem bothered by it. if someone does look funny at me i just stare them down
5	They aren’t used to people not giving a fuck. That scares many people cause they have no power over you. It also throws them off, which can be fun .
3	Your a ISTP ?
2	I think it depends on the type of people you’re with and how well they know you. I find that extroverted feelers who are strangers to me are more visibly put off by the lack of displayed emotion than anyone else.\n\nI think it’s because they are trying to read into our intentions using their feely radar but because they can’t get a read on us it makes them uncomfortable. \n\nAnother poster mentioned it’s because we look like we don’t care and people can’t manipulate you if you act like you’re not interested. I don’t really notice this reaction from men as much as women since most women love attention. 
68	I mean, that's good too.	
11	uhh. no. my sexual fantasy is not to not have sex
3	How is this an istp thing? I think istp's have a higher than average appetite for actual sex. 
5	Female ISTP here, hey goys

1	Anybody have experience with dating an ESTJ ? Does it work well  ? I read that estj best match is istp ... looking for confirmation ...
1	dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun my bagels bring all the goys to the yard
3	ISTPs and full sending (especially regarding drugs)	Hey guys.  Disclaimer: I'm pretty drunk rn and took like 100 mg Benadryl too for my cold (ik stupid idea but fuck it).  I was just wondering if any of u guys ever have trouble with doing shit, specifically Se shit only In moderation.  For example...\n\n\-I smoke weed and try to get so fucking high I can't see anything, to the point where all I can do is listen to music and admire some intense closed eye visuals\n\n\-I get absolutely hammered, to the point where I'm falling over and being retarded in public\n\n\-I'll take 50 mg of Adderall and feel wired...but then I decide I need to be *more* woke, and I'll down a large coffee...\n\n\-I used to consistently drive 100-110 on the highway before I got a $450 speeding ticket\n\n\-I like to binge real hard on Call of Duty and GTA\n\n\-Whwn I hookup with a girl, I'm usually pretty aggressive (dw not to a rapper point ever ).  I feel like slower make-out sessions are just boring and understimulating\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLmk if y'all have the same issues with doing dope Se shit in moderation guys!
27	Seems to me you have a huge lack of self-discipline. Quite a stretch to justify that behaviour with ISTP personality traits.
4	Yup our YOLO-ness actually have to go thru some self-check logic-gate first before those events actually happen. So yup our Se shits are pretty moderated.
3	Impulse cpntrol is also something i struggle with. Theres a line when im drinking in public (qnd at hoem really) where i go from drinking a beer every half hour-hour and then i just start killing em in like 10 min. Once i go past that line i start to get stupid. I dont like looking stupid in public. (At home its less of an issue for me) so i have been trying to learn where that line is and stop drinking before i get there. Still working on it. But im getting better. 
3	I used to be like that.\n\nEmphasis on used to, because it's only fun until it isn't.
3	I'd say that I love to push the limits that I'm pretty confident are safe. Now not totally safe, as where's the fun in that?\n\nBut if I think it's safe enough, I'll definitely ramp it up to the edge and then judge whether it was fun/successful/educational or whatever.\n\nFor me it's all about intelligent exploration\n\n&#x200B;
2	i have impulse control problems too but that seems a bit extreme, you should prolly work on that. it sounds like you may be an estp; we might make reckless decisions but we're still ti dominant and think shit through beforehand. could be wrong though, i'm an addict myself and i definitely understand the urge to push the limits as far as you can. try learning about shit that interests you, hanging out with friends who don't just party all the time, read books, start a project, fix up your place, try and get a job that interests you, and take care of your body. it's kind of ironic for me to be saying this after spending all day playing gta and snorting adderall/drinking but i've beat this kind of thing in the past so i do know what i'm talking about
2	I’d say these traits line up more with a drug addicted mentality and perhaps even a mood disorder. At the very least, drug and alcohol seems to be affecting your impulse control and decision making- not your personality type. 
2	Get high and meditate \nJust lay off the alcohol and other drugs
1	yes i also like to let go of the steering wheel occasionally
1	You don't sound very ISTP to me. I don't full-send anything because I usually know exactly what I'm getting into before I do a mild send.\n\nWhen I was younger I did some dumb shit but for the most part I had good self-discipline.
1	I would stop everything for just 15 - 30 mins. Don't consume, listen, play, or do anything. Your brain and body need down time. Smart choices take more time often than stupid ones.
1	while i don't condone the use of substances, for the record. swim may have an idea of what you mean
1	Honesty question, sorry I'm new. Do drug-related ISTP posts appear often? Are posts like these the reason  ISTP's are stereotyped as peeps who like to get fucked up, or are posts like these a satirical result of the stereotype itself?
6	Do you guys like moving to other places?	I'm moving to Colorado to get away from NJ. How has moving changed you?
4	Yeah definitely. I moved to Florida while in school and it liberated me in a lot of ways. 
5	I hate staying put.
4	I'm pretty indifferent about moving. Unless it's moving to a cabin inna woods/hills to live alone and go insane. Then I'm thrilled.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8LbD4Pu.jpg
3	I like where I currently live. Although I love to travel and want to travel. I still want a familiar place that I can always return to.
2	I wish I could but I married an infj sooooo.... love wins. lol.
2	I fucken hate LA
1	I love it. I have moved a lot as a kid and I think that somehow became a personal comfort zone. In the last ten years I have lived in Australia, Indonesia, the UK, and Germany. I get to start over and have completely new experiences, and I won't have enough time to start getting used to things which usually leads to boredom real fast. I also like to have new acquaintances, since people (myself included) are on their best behaviour during the early stage of relationships. It is not that I don't want real relationship, it is just that I hate asking for help but it seems all that people end up asking of me is my help. Until I figure that shit out I am okay with acquaintances since I have my old friends even though they are away. \n\nI also like moving because it teaches me about priorities, especially in terms of belonging. I have grown into curating what I own to be little but of high quality in the past years, which has been very fulfilling to my sensory needs. It is like a personal challenge of how little I can own while still preserving the most self rewarding experience. This helps me became wiser with my finances too and I got to save a lot of money with this lifestyle. Although the moving itself does cost a lot, not gonna lie, it is still cheaper than the money I gained from living this way.\n\nI also like that I am free to do whatever I want and be truly myself (a hermit) because I am away from the annoying people in my old circles. That way I can stay at home without people badgering and judging me, and I can also take my time to work on my goals and my self improvement. I like the social distance and the solitary aspects of it. I feel like I am in control of the intensity of my social interaction when I start over in a new place. I can also somehow apply what I have learnt in the previous place and continue improving that way when I move to a new place.\n\nI realise of course that in the long term this is no way to live for a long and healthy life and I do have settling down in mind for the future. But for now, as a female ISTP, this lifestyle is gold.
1	Yes, I loved living in different places. I am currently stuck in a place due to circumstances and I think about moving again  every single day.
1	Did seasonal work and have lived in 5 places over the last 3 years (In three different countries). It's exciting starting afresh each time, not knowing who you are going to meet, what experiences you are going to have. I love exploring. These are all outside my home country too.
2	Is excellency in certain things a common thing crossing your mind?	
5	When i start something new, i want to gain experience and be one of the best at it. I rarely get there, but i want to. When you do get up to the level of proficient it is satisfying. 
3	I kind of see it as a result of one's upbringing. If someone has lived a childhood-young adulthood held at high expectations (either imposed by their self or others e.g. parents) I feel one is more likely to drive their self via self discipline towards the desired success for self and/or social validation. Coordination and kinesthetics I'm sure plays an exceptional part but I really feel it's in the drive.
1	Yes, that's always the idea.  If it doesn't pan out that way, due to ineptitude or boredom, nbd.  I kind of feel like a jack of all trades but that said, it would be cool to be a master of something but that requires a certain amount of discipline and it's hard to hyper-focus on one thing when so many hold your interest.
1	For me, it's more important to rack up new experiences than to be really good at one thing.
1	Definitely. I'm not good at much, but the things I am good at I want to be very good at. Some of those things I consider really important and expect everybody else to also be excellent, like driving (because everybody does it every day and damn it there's no excuse to suck), and my job which is flying (because our lives depend on doing it perfectly every time).\n\nBut other times I just don't care.
3	Trying to come up with a new personality theory model, any and all criticism appreciated	Hi,\n\n  \nIt seems to me that the current personality theory models out there have a lot of holes, and even the technically consistent ones are extremely hard to use accurately on other people. I wanted to create a model similar to MBTI that is technically accurate, but doesn't require a huge amount of time and effort to grasp, i.e. a model that has a happy medium between precision, accuracy, ease of understanding (to those who are new), and ease of application. It's not completely fleshed out right now, but I'd appreciate it if y'all could poke as many holes in it as possible, and maybe offer possible new directions to take it to account for those holes. \n\n[Link to the model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AMXNVDeb-_PQNTyXvVwpq3SAk0YELTGc/view?usp=sharing)  \n
5	Hey buddy, \n\ndon't worry about being downvoted and critically raped in the ass so hard. The MBTI community is a bunch of crack-heads which lack the intelligence to grasp their creative visions. See it more like a symptomatic medium, and even though I've already tackled MBTI to its end, it'd be arrogant to not listen to new perspectives. Just don't steal my ideas from me, alright? HMU in PMs\n\n-Yours truly, \n\nNarcissistically Genial and Genially Narcissistic ENTP
2	It looks good so far, like you're laying the groundwork for it. I can't see any flaws yet but you didn't write a whole lot. Keep me posted though, it seems like it might have some potential :)
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/entp] [Trying to come up with a new personality theory model, any and all criticism appreciated](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/aoy4ge/trying_to_come_up_with_a_new_personality_theory/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	u/Killa_Kamikaze would love to hear your thoughts on this
1	Props to using LaTeX, makes this a serious proposal already :)\nSo what do you believe are the current shortfalls of MBTI?
1	‘Environment’ seems like redundant variable so far. Will you be expanding on it later? I see you’ve associated experience with the ‘set of all objects’. Does this mean that there is no such thing as a ‘subjective’ experience? (Perhaps in the sense that everything that is experienced must initially originate from an external source?) \n\nHow will preference be discerned? For the purposes of typing other people, is it equivalent to frequency? \n\nAnd… Can I pick your brain? :D How do you view Se, and its relation to Te (if any)?  
1	What you need to do:\n\n1. make an online self test\n\n2. spread the test on 4chan. they love that shit. \n\n
1	We don’t need a new personality theory so much as we need a new sort of people who are interested in this sort of thing to replace all the cranks and self-help gurus.\n\nMaybe as you’re designing your new system you can include things that screen those guys out or naturally drive them away or out of business.
1	https://youtu.be/MGfhQTbcqmA  \n  \nThis is dario nardi and basically he made correlations from mbti to brain scans so its a bunch of new detail on how the patterns we notice.  \n  \nLike your first category to me shouts 'Tacticam navigation' brain region. Which ISTPs happen to use on avg more than others. Though everyone uses it when gaming.  \n  \nAlso your definition of mind could be more precise i bet.
1	people are in too deep into mbti
1	There isn't much...\n\nTbh, if you want to simplify it, then limit it to the top 2 functions ? I personally find mbti too simple (took me time to grasp it due to the missing info), I prefer 8 function model like socionics, which is more complete.
24	Problems with emotions	The past couple years I've come to realize that I've always have a hard time processing my emotions. Every once in a while things will get too painful and I'll end up crying and have dark thoughts where I keep spiraling down just to feel the pain cause it doesn't come by often and then it's as if I turn on a switch and I'm back to my old self again, unfeeling and unemotional about the issue. Or I could just be weird and this is sooo not an ISTP thing and it could just be my coping mechanism.
19	You are not weird. I believe all ISTP have difficulties handling emotions, me being no exception. [This](http://istp.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Abuse,_Grief_&_Neglect) has helped me to understand emotional detachement that I was going through for a long time, after a painful breakup; it might offer you some insight.
9	I'm also pretty unemotional, but when i watch movies or anime i can actually find myself pretty emotional. \n\nI also have a very rare tendency to dissociate. I dont know what the trigger is; Probably when i have a feeling i want to avoid. I am basically a mute, and i just observe and move about the world until i sleep or someone can snap me out of it.
8	Me too. I’ve been purposely distracting myself from my emotions this whole time and am just now realizing it. 
5	So here is my take on emotional processing that takes place in my head:\nI do feel emotions, and at times intense to the point that i am overwhelmed and interferes with handling business at hand. It takes some time for me to identify aaand name them, and emotions end up being on a back burner to process- as they are passing, and not every feeling/ emotion need to be voiced  or acted upon- in fact very few do, and I'd like to think through before acting up. \n
3	Fuuuuck. I can't realise my emotions, not even in words. The only thing that I can realise is aggression, happyness , little depression.. but any other thing is a mysterious thing for me. I try to empathize very often but fail in the inner world like everytime. Don't know how to express myself? Any recommandations?
3	sometimes I wish I *could* cry 
2	This is where my INFP best friend comes in and offers insights. She said that what I feel shouldn't be taken as a problem. It is what I feel, it's real. The length of time that comes with suppressing it is somehow proportional the level of outburst I'll experience later. And it's true.\n\nI avoided my family for years because I couldn't deal with family romance (drama, manipulation, obligations, and negativities I deemed coming from being so close). While it helped me being away, it didn't really help eliminate all the emotions that had taken root to my own ignorance. Each time I came home, I'd always have a meltdown. And it wasn't always pretty. Like volcanic eruption-level. Last year, I started to acknowledge that I should be kinder to myself and must face the paranoia I'd been writing in my mind. To nobody's knowing.\n\nIt's a coping mechanism. However, it doesn't lend itself to goodness or self-care. All my past relationships became another place where I was building walls against the other, and I'd only feel intense guilt and shame (in moments of deep reflection) for not having learned the healthy ways of facing my own weakness.\n\nI'd say I'm much a better person now and much happier for having practiced acknowledging what I feel. And I share it with few people close to me (an INFP best friend and an ESFP sister). I used to fear vulnerability because I was afraid of becoming a problem and coming off as an emotional hypocrite behind the "cold and calculating' intelligent exterior.\n\nI still distract myself from intense moments, but I find time to acknowledge and recalibrate myself. Regularly.\n\n&#x200B;
1	My emotional processing also sucks.\n\n1.what the fuck just happened? 5-10 min\n\n2. What am I feeling ? 5-10min\n\n3.  Why do i feel like this 5-10min\n\n4.  Should i feel like this 10-20min\n\n5. Does it matter enough to feel or do anything?  10-20min\n\nTime varies a lot depending how much it actually matters but by the time im done with the process in my head then i start to try and fix it , if it can’t be fixed then oh well less work for me. \nTake note this is when i deal with friends/family emotional shit. This includes trying to see problems from different POV’s, what that person/s can say, feel or think. How they would solve it, etc, etc.
29	Do you use your sense of a humor as a crutch?	I don't mean this in a pitiful way, but I feel like most of what I have to offer in friendships and gatherings is my sense of humor - my ability and deep-rooted desire to make myself and others laugh. I kind of feel like if I can't be funny, then what's the point of choosing to be around me, aside from sharing common interests of course.\n\nI would also consider myself a pretty thoughtful person, a good listener, and helpful (traits that I value in others), but I feel like those traits are easily replaceable - if I couldn't provide them to a friend, it wouldn't be difficult to find people with those traits elsewhere.\n\nDo you guys feel the same way? Am I at least somewhat correct here, or do you think I'm projecting my personality onto others (i.e. I generally don't need other people for emotional support or empathy, just for entertainment, shared interests, and stimulating discussion)?
20	On one hand, yes. I have a sense of humor and it could be considered a mask. \n\nAnother way of looking at it is a tool. A sense of humor is a great way to get your point across in an effective but nonconfrontational way, and this is how I try to think of it is as many aspects of life as possible. \n\nIt also just makes things more enjoyable. You can say anything with a smile on your face. Especially if it’s a genuine smile. 
10	No, the best thing I offer is honesty based on fairness, something I've thought well and usually deliver well. This is what binds me and my few closest meaningful friendships, and even my family. Humor is second, but it's a given thing when I'm in a social mood. People not very close to me often get shocked when I give them my card of honesty behind the easygoing exterior (which most of my closest people find truer and even funnier about me). 
9	I use it as a FUCKING wheelchair!
3	"The youngest child in any family is always a jokemaker, because a joke is the only way he can enter into an adult conversation."\n\n-Kurt Vonnegut\n\nI feel like this may apply to many of us.
2	YES i literally do this to a T. And furthering your point, I find it makes more people laugh when I make jokes about myself. So my humour has evolved into people-pleasing self-deprication.
1	I  tell people how shit they are and they usually think I'm joking. :/
8	I initially got INTJ on this test but I just took it again and got ISTP (My answers felt more honest this time). I think lots of people get INTJ on the test because its easy to misinterpret intuition and judging.	
7	Test are mostly unreliable. Use cognitive functions to type yourself if you want a deeper understanding. Also tests usally type you as intuitive more often. The ratio between Intuitive types and Sensing types is about  S 70:30 N. However if you look at the distribution of typed people based on 16personalities.com you can see that about 60% typed as Intuitive. Intuitives are much rarer which is good because the world would be pretty chaotic with just intuitives. I typed myself as Entp and Enfp the first times i took the test. But if you know the cognitive functions you can see the big differences between the types.
2	I think this might be common for ISTPs. And ISTP guy I dated did the same thing - took the test and got INTJ but I guess it didn't feel right to him so he took it again and got ISTP. 
2	the difference in functions isn't much but the difference in personality is huge. you should be able to tell by comparing the wikipedia page for both types, if not read about the functions and see if you use Ti/Se more or Ni/Te
1	I took a bunch of tests and scored as every IxTx type, but reading the ISTP description was the one that matched best. All the other descriptions had something that made me think "no, that's definitely not me".
1	I got INTJ the first time I tested. I didn't know anything about MBTI and was hyped to be, "The Mastermind." Asked my friend if he thought the description sounded like me and he said, "ehhh...kinda." So I decided to be as honest as possible(what's the point of testing if you're going to lie?), and wound up getting ISTP, "The Mechanic."\n\nWasnt too thrilled to go from a mastermind to a mechanic, so I said screw MBTI(came back to it later, obviously). Icing on the cake was that the same buddy I asked to read the description took the test and got, "The Mastermind."
3	What is this ISTP thinking? [relationships/dating]	I (female) recently showed romantic interest in an ISTP male. He heavily reciprocated at first, seemed extremely into me, and our friends could even tell we were into each other. He then suddenly pulled back and went cold. At some point, I asked him a question and his answer was so brief/cold, it was almost rude. I know it wasn't loss of interest, because we have mutual friends who have let me know that he's "confused" and "doesn't know what he wants." We never hooked up or anything, so I know it's not that. Have you ever been in this position? What is my ISTP's thought process during this time? How much time will he need to make up his mind about me?\n\nI have pulled back and am giving him plenty of space, please let me know if this was the right thing to do, or if there is a better course of action.
8	you are doing the right thing. Just give him  space and if he is interested he will be back. I am an istp woman (single) and we just like our freedom and independence. We also do not like to be put on the spot and asked relationship type questions... 
3	Ask him.
2	Just out of curiosity: how did you show your interest? Is it 100percent sure that he understood it the way you intended?\n\nIf so I would second the other answers here. Give him time to think it through. But don't let him forget you (not having any contact at all, for several weeks eg) ;) 
2	i agree that you shouldn't push him but i think after a while you might need to make the first move. it can be subtle but even after he's had time to decide what he wants, he still might not act on it at first for a number of reasons.
1	If it were me:\n\nmy friends saying I'm confused just means they know what's up, or I lied to them because there's a real reason I don't want to share with them (as to why I don't want to be with you, that is). \n\nISTPs like space but we also like things to be clear. I would recommend saying exactly what you want and ask if he wants what you want, and if that doesn't work that's when you need to give him space. \n\nAdditionally, I have been turned off of MANY girls due to very small things. Maybe I'm too much of an idealist and this isn't an ISTP thing, BUT, it may be. I often become completely uninterested in certain girls that I was very interested in simply over a small quirk that may reveal more about their character. I know this is vague, but you may be better off dating someone who's not an ISTP anyway haha. We tend to not be the relationship type even if we seem great. 
1	This may come across as harsh, so apologies in advance. Dont try and bring up emotions of feelings really at all unless initiated by the ISTP, just invite him to do fun things and make sure he knows you are into him. One thing i struggled with when dating was when i would get home and i was alone i would analyze any and all interactions i had with my date and nit pick and convince myself that they really werent into me. That could be what happened, he showed a lot of interest really fast and then later got in his own head about it and convinced himself he was being too clingy. Dont send him messages all the time unless he seems to be reciprocating, and try not to make him feel pressured. Just invite him to things and have fun. Because us ISTP are introverts, we really dont initiate social interactions. And if it doesnt work out, then it doesnt. Just take care of yourself out there. 
1	I usually take a really long time to develop trust in a person, whether it's just friends or a romantic interest. I spend a lot of time thinking on my own about it as well.\n\nI don't think he's confused at all, I just think he feels a little shitfaced that this opportunity has arisen at all lol. I talk myself down from a lot of things that seem to good to be true, and I'll only actually pursue them if they *keep* seeming like great opportunities. For example if a girl were into me that much I'd be like "...wtf did I just get myself into" and honestly I wouldn't push the subject unless she stuck around for a while. Then I'd finally be like, alright I guess this is happening now.
1	I'm in the person you're talking about position right now.  In my situation, he didn't make any effort and I'm annoyed so I decided to ditch him. he could come back if he wanted to, or tried\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe invite them for coffee or something? Just continue the effort you were making with a bit more so he snaps out of it (but this is purely advice from what I'd do when i get all cold and reserved)\n\nLet me know a little bit more about the situation maybe, have you guys talked a lot? How frequently? etc...
1	I disagree with the space stance. I don't think he wants space, I think he wants you to show you want him. To put in the effort to show that he's not putting you out by wanting to be with you. If you give him space, he's going to think you don't want this and he'll move on.
7	Noncommittal in initial dating?	I’m starting to see this guy who I think is an ISTP and he appears very passive to me. Like he won’t initiate conversations or plans, but he will be glad to do whatever I want to do. Whenever I suggest something though, he’ll seem very cautious and say things like “that might work” or “that seems cool.” This is totally fine by me since I’m not ready to jump into anything serious right now and I like being able to set the pace but I’m wondering what he’s thinking out of curiosity and if it’s an ISTP thing (I suspect it is. I dated another ISTP before and he was very similar and ended up marrying a girl who was very aggressive in her pursuit of him, hahah). I guess it does throw me off a bit because I’m a traditionalist and I like being swept off my feet as a girl and when a guy takes charge once in a while. I was head over heels for an ESFP before this and he was very much that way. Anyways, do you think this will change over time or will I always be making plans? I’m an ENFP btw. 
7	If this gentleman is in fact an ISTP, I'd be led to believe that his nonchalant behavior is just a way for him to contain his excitement. The fact that an ISTP is willing to spend time with you alone should speak (lol) volumes for itself. Once you get to know him, and he, you, he is very likely to start contributing to the plans. I was the same way. Hope this helps.
3	I am a total non commital person when making plans. Unless its something i really need to do. Then its gonna be mapped out from the start. 
16	Would you guys say that STPs and SFPs are a lot more impulsive then other types, because of their Se, and make a lot of stupid decisions sometimes?	Than!
19	I think ESxPs are more impulsive than ISxPs because Se is dominant rather than having to go through Ti and Fi first.
10	Impulsive with inconsequential stuff, other things go through Ti first. As i hate to sort  out messes. 
10	Oh yes.  Lots of doing things just to see what happens, with no regard for the ripple effect.  I always land on my feet though, even if I do have to stop for a bit and recollect myself.
5	Just because someone is impulsive doesn't mean they make "a lot of stupid decisions". If anything ISTPs are good at quickly discerning what is not a stupid decision and we are also impulsive, so that seems not mutually exclusive.
6	i am both impulsive and make many stupid decisions, but they aren’t usually related. 
2	Se doms may do this moreso than judgers. Judgers think before they act. Perceivers are more likely to repress good judgment.
2	I am opportunistic, which is not quite the same as impulsive. I often see opportunities that others don’t, and move quickly before the window closes. What may look like an impulsive move to others (and sometimes myself), often isn’t. After the fact, I realise I took the opportunity because of some combination of groundwork my Ti has done and an inkling of success from my Ni. \n\nA lot of people don’t see the amount of foundational work that Ti invests in the background, even before any opportunity is a blip on the horizon. So when an ISTP moves quickly, it looks like they didn’t spend time thinking about it. Truth is, all the thinking has already been done and has been assimilated into their worldview of how the world works, and is thus instantly accessible.  
2	I am impulsive, especially near the slowpokes like INTPs.
2	My amazon history says: yes.
2	The way I see it as an ISTP, stupidity can be very relative (of course this does not include harm-inducing behaviours) because I think nobody really has the right answers to life so you can only do what you think is best. All I know is that it was the right decision at the moment. I am learning to include long term consequences more and more though. It has not been fun but then again it is necessary.

10	Do any of you ISTPs have a hard time winning an argument or debate with an INTP?	\nI just had a 5 hour convo with an INTP, about various topics: child support, solutions to gun problems,god and religion,rather a women should be president, and no matter what it seems he had a logical answer to every counter, or thing i said in the conversation; they weren’t  always right of course, there’s never right answers to those kind of things, but I’m wondering if it’s a Ne vs Se thing,or could it have something to do with tertiary Si because he used a lot of history to,I obviously use Ti to so my answers are logical like his it just seems kinda different between the 2 of us.
24	I don't debate people because I really don't care about their opinion
6	I don’t generally lose debates to anybody. Because I don’t enter debates I haven’t very thoroughly researched and thought through. Not to say that someone can’t out-research me or out think me. It’s just very rare in my specific case. It’s not very often somebody brings more to the debate table than me. I’m also usually more eloquent with my words during a debate which goes a long way. The winner of the debate isn’t always who’s right, but who posed their arguments more effectively. (Basically talking like a lawyer LOL) \n\n\nHowever, if someone does take me down, I’m more than willing to accept defeat. I’m not one of those “always has to be right” types. If someone can sufficiently prove me wrong with enough supporting evidence, I have no problem conceding. 
5	Why are you trying to win? I debate to learn. If his points are more valid, rather than frustration, I would feel a sense of enlightened satisfaction that I actually had a productive, novel, conversation.
3	I don't mind losing a debate if they use facts to support their stance...but yes INTP's can be difficult. Almost as bad as an ENFP
3	Debates aren’t for the people having them, they’re for the people watching them. \n\nEngaging in one on one debate is just mutual mental masturbation, and I’d prefer the physical kind really. 
2	My Dad's an INTP. As long as my thought is the more rational I can convince him to give up the devil advocate schtick. In opinion based debates neither will really be convinced. we both have starkly different views of the world surprisingly considering our similarities. I agree with what u/__celli said where i dont lose debates because i dont enter debates unless I've fully thought through my reasoning. My dads the exception as I'd debate with him as part of the process of forming my opinions. INTP's are handy like that
2	> there’s never right answers to those kind of things\n\nof course there are. but normies don't like those answers
2	I never know what sort of personality I'm arguing with because most people I know aren't nerdy enough for this shit. Regardless, I don't enter debates unless I've got my position wound pretty tight.
1	no i know lots of intps and i usually win debates with them, but i won't get into a debate if i don't know what i'm talking about
29	Any other istps romantics at heart?	For me I grew up with saving princesses and telenovelas so I guess it's in my Latino blood haha long story short I love my isfj a great deal and I do any and everything to show her my love but mainly I'm a huge sap haha oh and I'm just in a romantic mood right now and I figured if this gets enough comments it'd be great to show her
25	My istp and I don't fight, but we did have one conflict arise where I told him something that is important to me and he forgot, so when I wound up having to nag him about it he snapped at me for the first time in our relationship.  By that point I was already at my wit's end with the subject so tears started to escape in spite of me.  I'm not a crier so seeing me in that state made him think he must have missed something important.  He changed his tune rather quick, just took me into his arms and held me while I regained my composure.\n\nWe didn't get a chance to talk about it because of how late it was though we were no longer upset.  At work the next morning he took some time to think about it, realized what had happened and sent me the most sincere apology outlining what he did wrong, how he plans to make sure it never happens again, then asked me to let him make it up to me first thing when he got home.\n\nHe was good on his word.  If making love was like cleaning a kitchen he left it clinically spotless.  While I wouldn't exactly call him a romantic in the sense of flowers or poetry he impressed me with the depth of  his humility.  I wondered what I did right in life to have a lone wolf treasure me like he had something to lose.  In all my past relationships I'm used to being the one to do the heavy lifting because people have a hard time taking responsibility for their mistakes.  For a straight shooter he has a knack for reducing me to a school girl experiencing her first crush again.
9	I am too! I make desserts and get flowers and make crafts for my darling. I made her this rock necklace and carved out a rose and filled it with glow in the dark resin. Made her a music box that played the theme of her favorite song 
11	Never been in a romantic relationship for a number of reasons - one being I don't really want one so never took the initiative, but I have a serious weakness for romance media and romcoms in particular. Movies, shows, anime especially, I will happily binge watch and derail any productivity until I finish. I'm definitely not an outwardly emotional person, but show me a heartwarming romance plot and I'll strangle a teddy bear harder than Lenny and his rabbits while giggling like a madman.
5	Not consistently but my husband goes through little romantic spurts.  I think he'd do it more if he didn't suffer from depression. When he's happy he can be quite romantic. When he's depressed he gets very closed off and self centered. (I'm the same way.)
3	My ISTP husband scheduled a root canal to take place *on Valentine’s Day* and then joked that he was looking forward to that more than the date afterward. I’d secretly been hiding some sexy lingerie to surprise him with that evening, so that’s gonna stay in the box. 🙄\n\nBut then he bought me a mirrored armoire that locks so I can store the jewelry I make in it and keep it from our kids. It was something I really wanted and the best gift I’ve received in a long time (next to a beautiful synthetic opal ring he got me for my birthday two years ago.)\n\nSo my take away from him is that he’s a closet romantic, but outwardly more like...Red Foreman from *That Seventies Show*...
2	I am at heart, but I often feel too shy to show my boyfriend. Or the perfectionist in me thinks what I've made for him isn't good enough. I'm 17 so I think it might just be my lack of experience, but it feels like writing long parragraphs is what does it. At least with my bf. It always seems to get to him in a good way and it makes me really happy to see him happy. He's the only person who's ever been able to get me to calm down when I get super pissed or upset, and he doesn't overcomplicate things which I appreciate. And he has this like knack for getting me to mellow out and open up to the point where I'll start letting everything out like it's some soft of vomit (terrible analogy but I think it gets the point across). And he's made me cry of joy in more  than one ocassion. Am I too young to say I really feel he might be the one?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGot sidetracked, sorry.
2	I’m an ISTP and definitely a romantic at heart. I think it’s because rather than express feelings verbally, istps have a tendency to do romantic things to show their love. This usually seems to come as a surprise to partners when their ISTP SO starts doing random acts of romance. I think it really shows you care about your SO 
2	To answer OP's question, and to rebuild our hard-as-nails reputation, this: [https://www.tshirthell.com/funny-shirts/hopeless-romantic-seeks-filthy-whore/](https://www.tshirthell.com/funny-shirts/hopeless-romantic-seeks-filthy-whore/)
2	I just had to share this because I don't have anyone else to share it with - I'm an ENFP and just started seeing someone I think is an ISTP. I love how chill he is about everything, but maybe he likes me a lot or something because he's been texting me every day since we last hung out (and we've only really hung out once). It scared me because I'm way more guarded about this since I had my heart so broken recently that it took me two years to get over it and I still feel sad about it. But I told him that I wanted to take things slower and I said something how about I liked how he made me feel safe and comfortable and I didn't want to make things weird between us. And he wrote back, "It should be my job as a guy to make you feel safe and comfortable, if I ever didn't, you let me know so I can fix it." I can't explain how happy it made me feel. No guy has ever said that to me before and I've always been made to feel like all issues with relationships were my fault. It may not be the most romantic thing to say but it was to me and meant so much. 
1	My current complicated arrangement, i use to stop and grab her flowers once a week and do nice things for her, the constant break ups from her, i did make a couple of mistakes and i completely stopped when she got upset about it, i suspect she may have still been fucking her ex, she has BPD and Bi-polar and anxiety and depression, i am now emotionally numb her hurtful words have little effect on me i don't feel the same way i did, and i will probably never try to have another relationship again.  
1	Nobody really suspects it on the outside but ugh, yes, I am 
1	depends what side of the pillow i wake up, more false than true for sure
20	Realizing i'm an ISTP and better understanding my flaws in past relationships	(M19)   It wasnt until this week that I took the Myers-Briggs test, realized i'm an ISTP, and was able to understand myself better after doing research on my personality type. \n\nIn light of all this, it has made me realize why my past relationships have failed, why people don't seem to bother getting to know me at first, and why I'm so damn socially handicapped.\n\nThis may be different for other ISTPs, but personally, I'm very bad at small talk and seeming like an interesting person when I first meet people. I just don't feel the need to chat about things that don't matter, and have an even harder time with understanding and expressing my emotions. I'm bad at committing to relationships, especially with people who try to plan for the long term future and tie me down.\n\nThis has been a problem for me in the past because i didnt understand why I had such a hard time connecting with people and being sympathetic. Multiple relationship issues as well as failed job interviews due to not having any "personality" at first impression and seeming dull or uninterested. (oops)\n\nLearning about all of these things being part of who I am, as well as uncovering other characteristics of my personality makes me feel as though I can now communicate these needs in a more effective manner when prospecting relationships and work to improve my interactions with people, allowing them to get to know me better and allowing me to bond with them more readily.\n\nJust thought I'd share how eye-opening this research has been for me. Did any of you have a similar realization that allowed you to better understand the depths of your personality?
10	Yes, I'm female ISTP. I always been told by my mother that I'm weird, tomboy, sarcastic and rebellious. I also being compared to my friends that behave like a girl, graceful and looked mature. \nI believed I'm weird and worthless until I found out MBTI. I love myself more now. 
7	I’m either great or horrible at leaving first impressions. I find it better to deal with people over time. Though there are those who I get on with great at first meeting 
7	I didn’t know about mbti until my late 40s. I didn’t  have too much stress in my life but knowledge about my type would have been very beneficial in my younger years.\n\nGo forth armed with knowledge, young man. Life will be easier.
6	I know exactly how you feel, as I'm the same. I often wondered why I am this way, until I became familiar with MBTI. Knowing I'm an ISTP hasn't changed anything really, other than making me a little more comfortable in my own skin. I'm still terrible at engaging with other humans, but fortunately I found myself a lovely INFJ who compliments my weird personality perfectly.
8	yeah
3	I didn't take the test until my 30s and I had already figured most of it out by then.  So it confirmed a few things, shed light on a few other things, raised some questions, but also gave me a community of people I relate to really well.  \n\nAttachment theory has helped me understand my relationships better than the meyers-briggs.
96	Truth	
26	I've opened up to a grand total of 1 whole person. Well actually she's a Marine, so only half a person
5	ISTPs are like onions...
2	I left my feelings in the shadow realm after my christian father abused me.
-4	Aww. You’re being deep. That’s cute.
7	I work alone and it's the best	I work doing night security in the U.K on various sites. I get my work rota emailed to me by my boss so there's no interaction  there, I work a lot of the places completely on my own all night/sometimes days literally at work now on here on my laptop finishing off the final series of The sopranos. Really for other istp's out there I'd really recommend this job is so solitary that it gives me the energy or being asked to socialise because I can spend so much time left to my own devices.   
6	Do you socialize a lot on the weekends? I work for a software company with minimal human interaction but I  find I really need to go out and socialize every weekend or I'll be depressed. I realize there is different levels of introversion but just wondering how you feel towards the end of the work week. 
3	Nothing in that story resembled “work”.
2	(One) of my dream job(s) is park ranger. 
2	Im a grave shift lead in my shop. Its the perfect balance of not interacting with people, and socializing. Although i do use my weekend to "recharge". 
18	Recently found out I am ISTP and I relate to this a lot. Sorry if repost.	
11	I’ve read many articles pertaining to ISTPs but never that one. I’d say it’s spot on with some things although a bit vague on others. Especially the bit about act first think later. During these situations I usually base my actions on instances that have happened in the past and use that information to move forward. To those on the outside it may appear as I’m just jumping in, but that’s not really the case. Although there are times when I do jump into situations and rely on my senses to get me through the experience.
8	ISTP woman here. I am 41 and have never been called or considered a tomboy BUT I was in the military and I do enjoy "guy" things.
5	This so sticks out to me.  I think this is a big barrier to our success and wish I had better self discipline to not do this.\n\n"There have been times when you abandoned your plans when something more exciting came up. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but later, you suffered the consequences. ISTPs can grow by learning to pause to think before reacting, asking themselves if what they’re about to do fits with their larger goals."
3	Do ISTP's marry? The post said something about being terrified of commitment . 
3	Ok, I rarely like these kinds of articles since most of them are kinda barnum effect, but I legitimately laughed out loud at several of these. Almost every single one of them is very strongly me. The only one I didn't agree with is about not being a cheerleader, but to be fair, that was something I definitely was not when I was younger. But I purposefully worked on my F to be a better friend. After all, there ARE practical benefits to making people happy and being encouraging. 
8	Have any of you stuck to a career?	I'm currently looking for work, no degree. There are things that interest me like being a mechanic, electrician/plumber, some kind of repair engineer.   \n\n\nBut if i don't stick to them for many many years then its like where do i go from being an \*insert trade\* when i decide i don't want to do it anymore? Like i don't have a degree to fall back on, i'll just be a \*insert trade\*.   \n\n\nDo i go get a HNC, HND  or some qualification in engineering and then have that to fall back on?   \nWill i feel that my intelligence has gone to waste by just wiring up a house or replacing breaks? Could i be solving bigger problems?\n\nAre there any broader varied jobs that can allow me to jump to different areas?  \n\n\nMy longest job has been 4 months, so i can't imagine the idea of staying anywhere for so long because i have this need to just explore\n\nAny opinions would be greatly appreciated
9	If you listen to stupid popular opinion/beliefs and take to heart that you need some fancy, degree(read debt) requiring job to feel as if you use your abilities correctly to better society you will never be happy.\n\nYou use your intelligence for you to do your things. You being happy is the best thing for society. If you are happy those around you will be happy and you will be more likely to commit small acts of kindness that have a greater impact on society than a doctor does. \n\nIntelligence does not have to be channelled through college to be used right, I could even argue with the assistance of Mark Twain that it would hinder the use of your intelligence, and not everyone is meant for college. That's not because they aren't smart enough to do well in college, but because college just isn't structured for them. High school has sucked enough, and I do well in school, but a four year degree would be suicide for me. \n\nDo what you have an interest in, something where you can do things and manipulate them to get tangible results. That will take you places. 
7	Yep. Been in my line of work from 17 to 45yo.\n\nYou can hop trades pretty easily, if you are proficient at one, you would be generally with the others. If you do electrical, say, watch what the plumbers are doing also, and everyone else. Work with other trades when you have downtime and ask questions.
3	I’ve never stuck to a career. I’m doing alright, I found my dream job working for myself. I won’t mention every job I’ve had (I’m older than dirt) but I have a nursing degree, a para legal degree, and 3/4 of a journalism degree (did all of that with no student debt, I worked full time through each of those degrees). I strongly recommend istps work, find their calling, then go to school to further their career in their dream job.\n\n But no one ever listens to me.
2	I have a itil foundation and sec+ and work with computers 
2	I also don’t have a degree, i do pretty good, but haven’t made it big... yet. \nMy tip would be to do something you like doing and you know you’re good at. \nFor example, I like creative stuff. Designing, drawing, photography. I suck at it tho. \n\nI like computers, software, solving problems and explaining too and compared to most people I’m pretty good at it. So I do something with the latter. \n\nStart at a middle large company and shine your way to the top. I would avoid big corporates. 
2	Go to A&P school, get on with a large regional airline or FEDEX/UPS and you wont regret it.
2	20 years now, so yes.
2	I think ISTPs are great for trades... On another note, I haven't had a job for more than a year, but I'm only 20 and I've always been a student. I'm currently studying botany, will join the military soon, then I want to go to pharmacy school to get a PharmD and pHD. \n\nMost of us ISTPs don't like school, but I'm passionate about these careers so it's worth it to me. \n\nDespite wanting to become a Doctor, I want to learn electrical work and carpentry or mechanics at some point. 
2	Im an aviation maintenance technician. School is usually 1-2 years, pretty much guarantees you a job in the $50k range once you get your license. Schooling can cost anywhere from $20k-$40k. Im a lead on my shift now making $60k a year, and no plans of changing careers. And im only 22yo. 
2	I love working on my car and my motorcycle, wouldn’t become a mechanic cause i like doing it for me .\nI love to spend time cooking but i wouldn’t like to do it everyday as a chef.\nDoing things for myself is what makes it good , doing it for a paycheck would simply make me not want to do it for myself. Im not sure if others feel the same way, but i plan on becoming a firefighter/ paramedic. I’m no hero i simply rather get paid for helping people and keep my hobbies to myself. A bit selfish but making something i love into a job would end up ruining it.
1	Yup, I've done HVAC for almost 20 years. Best trade ever. Refrigeration, plumbing, electrical, welding, controls, air side, designing, balancing..... it impossible to know every nuance of this trade and there will always be challenges to overcome. Also, we can fix ANYTHING. Like for real, ANYTHING. Also work is pretty solitary, so that's cool too. Like anything else, there are ups and downs, but I have a stable life and am really fulfilled.
7	dating for the first time....	Hey again... It's your local confused ISTP female!\n\nI have pursued my career and education all my life pretty much, and shamelessly, I'm going to admit that I have never been in a relationship.\n\nMy mindset has always been to subdue and cut off feelings so I can set up myself for the future, but now there's this guy I met in a sport who walks me halfway home (basically until the roads split going to our respective homes) pretty much every week. I really like him, we can hold good conversations and we laugh together a lot. My friend speculates he's going to ask me out soon/ progress in a "potential relationship" but it has dawned on me that I have 0 actual relationship experience and despite being a confident and independent woman usually, I have no idea what to do if he asks me out. Or even on a date?! What do I do.... \n\nWe meet every Wednesday and yesterday he wanted to either hug or kiss me but he must've been nervous because I waved when he went in so... guess who subconciously turned down that offer. He tells me about his music tastes, and went out of his way to introduce the walking home thing that has turned into a highly-anticipated Wednesday evening event. I understand I sound like a teenager, but it's almost embarrassing that I'm early twenties and don't know what to do. \n\nIn honesty, I'm not a nervous girl either. I am very willing to be sexy and not afraid of that, but I feel like normal relationships probably develop bit-by-bit and if I started doing that it would be too accelerated. He also doesnt like MBTI because he thinks it's pointless and uninformative (I will convert him someday!) but I speculate he's ISTJ/INTJ. \n\nAny advice about relationships for an ISTP would help.... \n\nSati
4	Sounds to me like the typical ISTP problem of being afraid to engage the first contact. Personally, I never asked a girl out on a date out of the blue, normaly things just sorta happen and I won't have the confidence to do it until the relationship is more or less consolidated. \nMy advice to you is just start small. If you see he doesn't pull the trigger on the whole date scene, just ask him out for a coffee instead of going directly home (assuming you want something to happen). That way you don't have that much pressure and you're just going with the flow.\n
3	You don't sound like you're ready to jump into a relationship and there's nothing wrong with that. You can take things slowly until you feel comfortable enough to take the next step. Tell him how much you like and anticipate Wednesdays and try to find another shared activity that you can do, so that you can spend more time together and become closer without risking the awkwardness of an official date. Over time things will naturally escalate, but forcing them right now sounds too risky, seeing that you lack the confidence of what to do next. So don't push yourself, just find a way to move forward at a pace that's comfortable for you.\n\n&#x200B;
2	If you got if his phone number you could skip gym one Wednesday and then text him like "Hey missed our walk today, do you wanna meet for coffee sometime and catch up?". At least that's what I'd do if I were you and I so know what it's like to be an ISTP girl that's never been in a relationship ;)
1	If he asks you out say yes. If you get tired of waiting for him to ask speed things up by asking if he wants to go get coffee or something. Don't think about the small details too much, I dare say things would work better if you just not dwell on what to do and just act on impulse when the time comes.\n\nThat's all I got
1	If you get anxious, be honest. Better ask question to fill empty silences. Most of all,  enjoy it! It's just a date. 
1	You're a female. If you manage to not get fat you're golden. That's all it takes.
1	Just let him lead, and show interest in case he feels rejected by your wave lol. \n\nIt's really fine. It doesn't matter that you haven't been in a relationship yet. Just be cool and don't ever apologize for not knowing what to do on a date or something. 
1	Why don’t you just hug him the next time you see him? Seems like a logical, non-risky next step. 
1	guys he didnt come yesterday LOL rip me
8	Dear Less Perfectionist ISTP	Whenever I take on a task I can't help but to thoroughly complete it without missing an imperfection, which sometimes involves using more time and effort needed to complete the task. How, if possible, can an ISTP allow themselves to do a half-assed, rushed job as opposed to perfectly completing it? I'd prefer answers from ISTPs that have overcome this perfection hurdle\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks
7	I recommend taking a step back. Your goal is not the individual task that you are working on. You have much larger goals and aspirations that you are striving towards.\n\nWhen you find your perfectionism taking over, ask yourself, is perfecting this task worth the return on time to your larger goals? Or can that time be more effectively spent on a different task, or even better, is taking the time to relax and recharge more important to achieving your larger goals. Be a perfectionist in the war, not the battle. 
9	I'm not sure you can overcome it, but you can certainly mitigate it.\n\nEDIT: don't know why this submitted mid typing. \n\n* Recognise however good you can make it, it will never actually be perfect.  \n* Learn to recognise when you get to the point of marginal gains.  After a point the time you put in will make very little difference and it's time to walk away.\n* Try to accept that a level of imperfection is not a problem.  I often find that work I think is barely polished is well above other peoples expectations.
4	What kind of stuff are you working on? I feel like it depends a lot on what kind of stuff you are working on and what your goal with working on it is. 
3	I usually obess over trying to make it perfect with everyone else telling me it looks good. I just try and rationalize with myself that it is functioning and does what i need it to do and will do it for a long time 
3	I prioritise. The first priority in my field (design) is usually to get things done, so I focus on that. I trained my brain to get used to the idea that no number of details no matter how crucial is more important than actually completing the work. I found that this is an absurd idea when I first got into uni. I studied architecture by the way and it was a perfectionist hell because there was so much abstract expectations, deadlines, details and so very very little time. But I realised it got easier to do this when I start working because the priority and objectives are much more clear aka submit the design before the deadline no matter what because that means the invoice can be issued and the other consultants can start work! I am back in school and I realise that it is easier to take control over my perfectionism tendencies now since I have work experience because I see what is more practical and important.\n\nSecondly, learn to say no. Just because you can do it, does not mean you have to do everything yourself. This brings me to another point, learn to delegate workload to other people/colleagues/team member etc. I used to hate this because it made me feel useless (? i know). But the way I see it, would you hit a nail with your fist when a hammer exists to help you? I know it is cruel to compare humans with inanimate tools, but personally it helps to ease my conscience and focus on what's important.\n\nThirdly, realise that most of the time (or all the time) the world does not end if you miss out on one or two details. What I realise as well is that what perfectionists consider as bad and lacking are usually other people's good standard anyway. At least that's what I realise from my own experience with my peers in class. \n\nLast but not least, take a break when you can and see the bigger picture. Give yourself time to recenter and relax because life can be comfortable without stress too. I myself make the mistake of confusing stress as a comfort zone because I have lived with it so long. Truth is, it is not healthy for your mental health and your perfectionism energy will be more useful when directed to what's really important. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;
2	The reason I’m not a perfectionist is because when I was growing up I didn’t have much or any money to spend on projects, so I would just make things work with what I had. 
2	i can't either but it's not really a bad thing, it affects my motivation to do shit i don't want to do (aka school) but in the real world it's almost always beneficial
2	Get older with more responsibility, you stop worrying about the stupid crap so much.
2	When I worked at Wendy's one of my jobs of the day was to take out all the trash that was left over from the night before. Every single day I would improve the trash run until there was no wasted movement. Then I would get additional tasks done after that. Perfectionism is great when you're "plugged in" \n\nWhen you're not "plugged in" it can be a problem to be overly perfectionistic. Perfectionist idealism can create non-starter activity. Sometimes it is better to do, then to not do and think about doing it perfectly. Or more simply don't procrastinate.
2	In my line of work, there is no half assing a job. We have maintenance manuals that detail every step. As long as you curb your attention to detail and dont draw out a 2hr job into a 6hr job, but you also complete all the steps the manual says to, then its up to spec. Within limits is within limits. Dont go making problems where there arent any. 
1	I usually try seppuku.
1	perfectionism is a form of insecurity (Brene Brown is a great resource on this topic) and personal armor. work on the underlying issues to see the perfectionism problem fade. :)
1	My perfectionism went away with time. How old are you? Have you had a "real world" job like retail or something like that? Crappy jobs teach you how to half-ass work because your managers take their jobs very seriously even when you're just stocking shelves or something mundane. \n\nSo yeah, get a mundane job haha. \n\nOr accept that your perfectionism is a perk.
1	Be an ESTP 😎
13	With Ni as a child function, is it true that you (ISTPs) always know what you want?	Or how does this function manifest in your day to day life? Can you get extremely stubborn based on this function?
25	Lol, right. I'm 27 this year and i have no clue about what i want to do in life.\n\nBut then again, if i do decide on doing something, I WILL get what I want/ finish the thing I want to do one way or another (except when i have to do something illegal to get it, no thanks. Too much of a hassle)
36	Us ISTPs often overthink things, weigh options, and don't really know what we want until we act, and the decision we act upon may not even be the one we deemed the most logical and efficient, in my experience at least. \nSo after pondering away at what we should do, we make a choice and take action. And we get what we want. Always.\nDoesn't matter what you acredit it to, willpower, sturborness, God, luck, whatever, we get what we want and when we want it, after we spend a month trying to figure out what we want that is
8	Not at all, for me at least.  I have some vague idea of what I want most of the time, but I can't always pinpoint it.
6	Yes
5	Se represses Ni so it would be the opposite. Unless you are a TiNi type ISTP (INTP) then Ni would repress Se.
2	I never know what I want, it's like I don't even want to want anything. The only reason I have achieved things in life is because of people around me doing something and me thinking "Oh, they are doing it, so I probably should do it as well" or if someone gives me a suggestion and after thinking it though I get used to the idea of it and start working towards accomplishing it. If people around me are not doing it, then I'll never even think about wanting to do it, you know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I don't think I have ever worked very hard for something, it's like I just did what was required without putting too much effort into it and I still got it in the end...
1	I know want I want but I don’t know how to do it (I’m surely I know what I need to do but it’s takes tooo much time to get it that after I don’t want what I wanted). ISTP should start the « Life game » with 1M€ full fil our desires 
1	I have an easier time defining what i don't want.  I have a general idea what way i want to be heading.  Small, inconsequential day to day decisions come easily to me. Deciding on something more impactful takes awhile for me to arrive to- and it's partially subconscious. Ive learned to go with it and let it percolate before i make a decision.  It works for me.  I practically have no * buyer's remorse*\nSo, in a way i guess i let my Ni to do its job. 
1	I've always known what I wanted. I never had the high-school crisis of what am I going to do in life, etc. I had my career, children, marriage, religion, etc., all sorted in my teens.\n\nI especially know what I *don't* want, and I am extremely inflexible on that. Salesman's worst nightmare kind of thing.
1	almost always. but during the times when i don’t know what i do want, i always know what i DON’T want. so i can at least narrow the hypothetical field. 
1	Not always. However, I am always most comfortable when my decision is truly my own not because someone else said so and so, and probably that has something to do with that. I think people do see me as stubborn because of this. It sometimes take me a very long time to process a decision because I do not stop until I find what i truly want so to speak. In my younger years I have blatantly rejected people's ideas and help because it seemed like I was not being authentic. I do that less and less and can separate better between considering a good suggestion apart from people pleasing. I think this helps me take responsibility of my own life, including mentally and emotionally if that makes sense. I see that as a good thing.
1	i am stubborn, and almost always have a sense of how to do something intuitively without actually consciously realizing it. like if someone says how to do something i might ignore them, knowing i know a better way to do it before i actually thought of how i'd do it. Ni also gives me sudden epiphanies about my own life or the world, especially in conversation or while writing i'll develop an idea further and understand what i have to say much better than when i started saying it. like at the beginning of this post all i had thought out was agreeing that i was stubborn, when i realized that connected with wanting to do things my way / rejecting authority and my Ni function. compared to Ne types like intps and entps, we can be much better at constructing a fleshed out theory due to the convergent nature of introverted intuition vs the divergent nature of extraverted intuition. intps are usually better at debates and writing because they come up with many ideas that bounce off one another, but istps (provided they use their Ni function) can have far better constructed ideas given interest in the subject and time spent thinking about it. Se is also very useful for providing a basis for our thinking, and is definitely a much more practical function than Si (although i do like istj types in particular, and i think Si becomes more useful with age/experience)\n\ntl;dr istps are the smartest type, fuck intps
8	Entrepreneurs	Any of yall own a business?
10	I own a failed LLC... LOL. But I was just offered a job at a start up company that just signed a massive contract. It takes them out of start up status. I won’t be an owner but I will be an executive. That is, until I buy my way in. They’re going to allow me to redirect part of my salary into buying some stake from the current owners so I can sit on the board and act as an owner. I just won’t be a cofounder. \n\n\nSo I don’t exactly own my own company lol. But I’ll be treated as a part owner with the new job. 
6	My dad is also an ISTP. He used to have his own a law firm, now he owns a real estate development company. I can see ISTPs preferring to be entrepreneurs than having to work for someone else. I’d eventually like to start my own company, just not prepared to take on the huge loans required for that quite yet lol. 
3	Had my own PC repair business throughout high school/college. It got too stressful for the pay so I joined a 9-5. I can say for sure that being in an office 9-5 every weekday is pretty maddening (I miss the sun) so I don't think this will be permanent.\n\nIdeally I would like to work flexible hours, work remotely, for my own business, or just have passive income. Having multiple people decide what I do for the majority of my waking life is just too much.
3	I own a software company (well actually two, but same product 2 regions).\n\nI can say I don't think I'm suited to it, it just happened to happen and means I don't have to work for anyone else ever again, which I was even less suited to. 😆
2	Not yet. I'm an engineering student and i have a few startup ideas. Routine 9-5 jobs are not my thing so I'd need to work on one of the ideas.
1	I had a woodworking business but i sort of stopped making things because i would lose interest in the stuff that took too long and i feel like i would need to be more social to really branch out or have a social media presence. I liked having my own aide business, but i work better with someone pushing me.
1	Self employed for some time now. Never had a W-2. The freedom is nice as is the ability to decide what to work on and when. But discipline is required to not stray too far off. Entrepreneurship fits the ISTP personality well, especially in regards to solo or contract work. Haven't gotten around to wanting/needing employees yet.\n
1	21y. Didn't finished school. Started doing Entr. stuff with a friend. Got into many scams at first and now in a very big thing involved to work from anywhere. How rich i will get.. i don't yet. \n\nAs a side thing I plan to help a Skateboard Company to grow big and after that I want sell my own, differently made clothes and make a company out of it. \n\nSo far everything is going well.\n\nThe hard part for me was more to find myself(who I am and how I am) and why should I even want to bother myself with life and all this shit. It creeped me out for many lone nights. Because that was a thing for me to have answered before.. otherwise I felt and thought I would walk around like a sheep(everyone else).
1	Ya i co-founded a corporation with a couple buddies and have been working there for the past couple years. 
1	yup. I managed to automate human contact to the bare minimum. answering support mails is the most customer contact I have.
1	I'm not an entrepreneur, at least not yet.\n\nMy dad's an ESTP so not the same, but he owns a ranch and is on every board he can find, god.
30	Putting myself out there.	As an ISTP, it seems natural to me to be able to talk to people one on one or in small groups just fine, but in front of large groups it does NOT come naturally. I end up flubbing every word and not knowing what to say.\n\nI became buddies with a higher up at work and, for whatever reason, they decided it was a great idea to single me out in front of the entire company to talk about why I joined the company.\n\nWhy, as an ISTP, am I so charismatic around individuals, but then become a complete idiot in front of crowds. Has anyone else had this issue? And, if so, how did you break past and become a better public speaker?\n\n&#x200B;
14	It is not a natural thing.  It is a skill.  It takes loads of practice and is among the harder and more patient things to acquire in life.  So don't beat yourself up too much.\n\nBeing put on the spot is never easy.  That wasn't cool at all to spring on you without warning.  Even just a "hey, I might ask you to say a few words!" Would have given you time to think.  To some people it comes more naturally and they have a tendency to assume it is the same for others.    \n\nHonesty, humility, and not being intimidated by eye contact are some things for everyone to work on.  Knowing yourself and your principles well - instead of just going along with someone else's flow all the time - these things might have helped you a bit but they aren't a planned speech.  \n\nMatching energy levels is a rapport skill, and having an entry and exit line is a good thing to have practiced, and you can gain a modicum of stage presence through practice elsewhere.  I used to perform music and poetry, for example, in front of small crowds and I'm frequently finding myself in front of whiteboards having to explain things to peers and clients.  Having a sense of humor and comedic timing is also a learned ability  and I suggest the book "comedy writing secrets" for people who feel they don't have the knack. \n\nA Toastmasters club would be a great place for someone like you if performances in another area doesn't sound right for you.  Improv comedy is a fun class you can take.  Act out a schtick in some voice-enabled chat or video game room or something.  Work on your voice and do some light role acting or something with a friend just as a joke.  Practice approaching strangers and have them answer a question that you want an opinion on.  This is a good opportunity for you to pay attention to another and gauge their response to you and see what you notice, if they are comfortable or not, and how you can adjust.  Pay real attention to their face, posture, and aspect.  If you aren't comfortable, they won't be - people are a good mirror for you to find out if you are where you want to be or not. 
23	Introverts can actually thrive at public speaking.  Everything is under your control and planned ahead of time.  Aside from maybe a Q&A session it's actually very unsocial
6	Probably because inferior Fe is in a bad spot, and Se helps you use it enough to be good, but only good with people one on one or in small groups. I can talk to like max 3 people at a time, if there not staring at its easier eye contact from a lot of people kills it.
5	Talking in front of crowds requires you to lose a lot more of your Fe than even in a small group or one on one with people that you know well. You don't have enough experience with that function.
2	I'm the exact opposite. I actually feel more natural at the center of attention than one on one type stuff. I think it's because as the socially dysfunctional person I am it's usually easier to "talk at people" than to "talk to people". Think about it that way. You don't have to connect to people as a group in the same way you have to connect to people you're conversing with individually. Just learn to at least pretend you have confidence and talk to the room.
2	Your confident appearance might give people the idea you don’t care and are not afraid of speaking in public. I’ve had this happen lots of times. \n\nEspecially in college, i had to do a lot of the presentations because every project people thought I wouldn’t care. So I did it a lot, i stumbled a little bit the first few times etc. \n\nLast year I changed some stuff at the company I work for, it was a pretty big deal for the people working there so I kept them up to date every other week.  No problem. It is trainable and you will get better at it fast. 
2	I am the opposite. Around people that I like and/or doing things I enjoy, I feel much more sociable. In a 1v1 interaction or smaller groups, same kinda of people, I am not that sociable. Sure that this sociability does not last much longer.
1	I'd use my humor to help me relax a bit. Not too much. And just be yourself, don't stress. You'll be alive at the end of the day.
1	Im like that, I start stuttering in front of big crowds. Only trick I have found that works for me so far is to not drink coffee before it and to do sports right before. Oh and practicing once or twice just to be sure you understand everythings you have written on your PP.
1	I personally prefer the one on one but at the same point if I’m talking about a subject I’m well versed and confident in It doesn’t matter who, or how many people I’m in front of. It’s when I have to speak about a subject I’m not comfortable with I start having a hard time. I found though if your upfront and admit you don’t know, people take that better then a person trying to think it through and stumble over your words. 
1	Same
1	I've never spoken in front of a crowd of more than 50 people, but I like to look individuals straight in the eyes as I speak. For me it helps create the illusion of speaking to fewer people, and those who meet my gaze seem to be more impacted by what I say. One of the few instances where RBF works in my favor.
1	in 8th grade, i used to cry when i had to stand in front of the class and say anything. now i speak on the conference circuit as part of my living. the first time someone saw me speak and then personally invited me to speak at another conference i was shocked. then i realized i had been working on my speaking skills for 10+ years in various ways. the more you do it, the better you get. but the fastest way is definitely toastmasters. 
1	Think about what you are trying to say, use the least amount of words possible to get there, and follow the flow of the conversation. If a moment passes and you dont get to say what you want to, so be it. 
3	I have a question about Ti and Te in a hypothetical situation.	If a person were a predator and had a task of clearing out a hive of aliens, which function would be best Ti, or Te? The reason I ask is because the goal would be to get rid of the aliens, but Te is focused on accomplishing the goal in the fastest way, and Ti would be about getting it done in the most efficient way. So which one would be the best at getting that job done, assuming we’re talking about a ISTP, ESTJ,or ENTJ?
6	Entj.    Ni combined with te usually involves "finding the right answer amidst the new system they've entered".  \n\nSo it will be the right way to do it the fastest which also would make it the most efficient.  
3	ESTJ. The ENTJ would be too busy thinking about the most efficient way and devising a strategy for doing so. The ISTP just jumps in head first into the forray. The ESTJ delegates others to specific positions and ensured everything is done the right way.
2	Ti/Se/Ni or Te/Ni/Se. Ti could be more useful in terms of analytical thinking like planning strategies, but Te would get the job done and would be more useful if they had to lead others. estps or intjs could be equally useful (although tertiary feeling would be less helpful) but in different ways; all four types would be good at this and have their own individual strengths and weaknesses. sp types typically perform much better under stress than njs which could be a factor. entjs might be too focused on coming up with a plan, but istps are better at action based thinking; although the istp might seem reckless at first, being able to think on your feet is much more important than having a good strategy. there's a reason why action hero movies typically portray istp-esque characters, but that's assuming a 'lone wolf' type situation. istps can think of strategies when they need to, which is much better for an individual battle; entjs are better at war. entjs know strategies for how, when, where, etc. their men should go, but aren't always particularly skilled at combat. estjs are good at the same kind of thing, their Ne gives them a different perspective and Si can be very useful provided they have past experience, but the lack of Se, Ti, and Ni means they probably wouldn't be great at fighting the aliens personally. of course this is just based on a theory that's only mostly accurate for classifying people's inherent personalities; the type differences are moot if you're comparing an intelligent entj with years of military experience and excellent marksmanship to a dumb istp who's never fired a gun in his life
6	IXTP questions	so in the test I am actually 56% INTP but I mostly also can relate to ISTP. \n\njust want to ask have ISTP ever contemplate something like uhh I should've answered that question with "blabla", not what I said at that time 
25	Yes  but so do most people.
8	I test as INTP now sometimes. Used to always be straight ISTP. \n\n\nI think it has to do with personal development and socializing. The more I developed myself and my weaker functions, the more often I got INTP. 
5	having a dominant S function doesn't mean the lack of N, simply the lesser use of it. 
2	I also used to test as an ISTP and preferred that description for myself. As I get older though, I have come to realize I am definitely an INTP. 
2	Just look up definitions of Ti Se vs Ti Ne, or tertiary Si vs Ni.
1	Yes
1	I also used to test as an ISTP and preferred that description for myself. As I get older though, I have come to realize I am definitely an INTP. 
1	Yea I tested for INTP then ENTP for a few years and then figured out i was a ISTP, it was the Ne Se thing going on.
1	All the time. 
17	Advice for a young ISTP	Hi everyone, this is my first time posting, so I'll give my best shot.\n\nI'm 19, male,  studying computer science, which as it turns out is perfect for me. It allows me to find creative solutions to problems using logic. I also like photography and think that it's a great outlet. However besides these two things there's nothing else, I'm good at both of them, but besides these two things and some passive entertainment there's  nothing else I feel like doing. I have no real friends, no relationships , no connections. So everything becomes a routine, eat, sleep, program, repeat . It also doesn't help that my parents are super traditional and don't approve of anything outside these activities.\n\nSo my question is to the more experienced ISTPs out there who had the same problems, How do I break the loop ? How do I become an actual person ?
19	Sports. Exercise. Fitness. Whatever you want to call it. ISTP’s a usually naturals, and it’s so good for your health. There are a bunch of new things you can get into that don’t have a ton of up-front cost! 
10	When I was nineteen I wanted the same as you. Something new. I was lacking. Got my own place, job, started school. Had no time to creative, bills came in, grades slipped. Anyways hears the boring answer. Suck it up, find little projects to get your hands on, finish school, get out of parents house so you can breath. You're 19! Don't rush it, cause you have a lot of time to explore yet. Damn I can't be that old 😂
9	I had the same situation in my 23.\n\nBegin running. It sounds as boring as picking potatoes but when you get comfortable with running in a couple of weeks you'll have a lot more ideas during your runs, you'll feel better. Trust me. You'll find casual runners to chat with eventually, usually they are single 20-35 year olds. Never regretted a day of running. It'll boost your confidence\n\nDress better. I hate dressing up but it definitely helps not looking like a kid anymore. Nobody cares if it is thrift stuff just make it fit. I have mostly black jeans and flannel shirts over charcoal t-shirts - that's fine to be smart casual where I am from. It'll boost your confidence\n\nI'm not sure about your family situation but don't be afraid of critical thinking and developing your own opinions. I find most people inherit their parent outdated opinions and that causes a lot of unrealistic expectations, frustration, anger, bitterness.\n\nI'm not sure about friends anymore but in college I just talked to some introverted blokes that turned all right and we had our own small crew. Apparently turning a group gives you street cred.\n\nGet Meditations by Marcus Aurelius - the last great Roman emperor. Book is incredibly relatable today because we deal with pretty much the same friendships, relationships, betrayals. This is great classic, easy to read book consisting of short passages. I have Hayes translation which I love.\n\nOther than that have yourself something that inspires you. Something simple and memorable for when you feel down - "do what you can, with what you have, where you are" or lookup Markus Aurelius quote. I have distilled my inspiration to "Be useful". I find it deep when you think of it and it fits every situation one could ever get into. But read some books before you're 25, develop your brain.\n\nHave fun!\n\n  \n\n\n  \n
6	Get your own apartment. Their house, their rules, which is fine. By breaking that routine you will find life gets more challenging.\n\n(I Assume you still live at home because of your wording.)
4	Depending on your flexibility to pursue your interests I'd suggest finding a hobby or sport that involves interacting while building personality.\n\nMake the effort to sit-in/try-out activities that you "thought" you might not have access to as well as those you see value in (e.g. public speaking).\n\nIf you have options consider something that you enjoy and the parents might not look down on.
4	 \n\nBefriend someone who’s good at something. I’m very close to our village carpenter. It’s nice to go out and see what he’s working on. Also, conversations never get boring because I learn something new everytime. I get to socialise and meet people who go to his shop. Perfect way to snap out of my everyday loop. Or get a bike. 
9	go to a bar and talk to people. if you’re nervous then drink
1	I'm the same!! I found that by using your talents, it gets you involved in stuff which makes you get friends (heheheh)\n\nFor example, I know some visual design, so I joined this society that is about business and helped design their website. By doing that, I shared my knowledge and people valued my opinion, and then naturally the more  i spent time with people about the website, I slowly became friends with them. The main points I think a lot of people are going to say is, Sport (especially team sport!) and other societies (CompSci society maybe? Run some coding workshops, idk) are a great way to be forced to meet new individuals & them to meet you, so hopefully you can make friends!!\n\nI don't know whether I'm making sense though, because I pretty much used to be the same as you :0
1	First of all, you are already your own person without having to follow what other people define as an 'actual person'. Second of all, are you trying to find new things to do because others seem to do this or want this for you? because you said there is nothing else that you feel like doing.\n\nI am 28 and I used to follow what most people seemingly want in their life in the hope of becoming more relatable. Somehow I thought this would help me feel happier and make better connections with people. Unfortunately, I could not keep it up because in the end it was not really what I want and I struggled a lot internally. Living as a true ISTP can be lonely sometimes, but I feel comfortable as myself every day and the few people I have in my life accepts me as who I am.\n\nI guess what I am saying is that it is good to listen to what you truly want. Trying new things that has something to do with physical or technical activities might also help. Joining communities with similar interests are also good because you interact based on activities and less on emotional load. Focus on career and hobbies that have levels to master as this will keep you interested longer. Take it as a challenge to find ones that your parents also approve of if that is important for you. You can also direct your energy on earning your freedom too e.g. turning your hobby into an income. Also be patient, you will be an adult some day soon and you will have more options and freedom to truly be yourself then.
5	I have a question about dom Ti	Im a ISTP, and when someone’s asking me for something, or telling me a story and they leave out pieces of information, I have a hard time doing what they ask, or accepting the information. Is that something you can relate to with yourself or others? And would dom, aux Te users have this problem?
8	I have this problem when someone gives me a task or problem to solve. I hate it when they are not precise in their formulation because there could be 5 things they could mean by that.
3	I have this issue as a Ti dom but my husband is an ISTP and he doesn't have this problem.
3	Feeling frustrated is easy for us, but asking for more information is the key. Some people think that other people can easily get them or the way they think, but find a way to bridge this gap.
1	Logical contradictions is the key word !
6	Dealing with 'senioritis'?	Hey guys. I've finally reached the second semester of my senior year and my motivation has plummeted. I don't know what to do with my free time now. I hang out with friends occasionally but it drains me every time. I want to do something solo so I feel like I have a purpose. I'm not outdoorsy or crafty. tia
12	Start teaching yourself. Learn a hobby, read books, figure out what you're going to do when you graduate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"School" never stops or goes away, and if you stop learning, you'll get passed up by the younger, more motivated crowd.
7	Drop out, lol.\n\n/s
7	Do something that involves exercise! Running, martial arts, weightlifting, climbing... whatever it is you want to start, you should stick to it and I think as an ISTP you will love it. Moving your body is so so good and creates better habits over time (such as [eating healthier](https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/working-out-leads-to-healthy-diet?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1)). 
5	ah you’ll soon realize life doesn’t have purpose, so you just do what you want to do; keep yourself busy. there’s no place you need to achieve. achieve what you want to, not what you think others expect you to have achieved
3	Don't let senioritis carry into college or you will drop out like I did 
2	Yo, do some activities or challenges with some cool friends. Always given me a buzz when I’m down!
2	Just let it happen and ride it out.\n\nSpend some time thinking about where you want to go in life because you're really close to being able to go to college or whatever. Don't be like me and wait until you're 24 to start studying for a career. Think of it like this: The sooner you start working toward a career of your own, the sooner you'll be independent and in charge and able to do whatever you feel like. And if you call yourself an ISTP then I know you'll at least develop a strong desire for independence.
1	Hey, as I am outdoorsy and crafty I might not be the best to ask. But I am guessing you do something with your time because if I had to stare blankly at a wall for two seconds I would kill myself or the wall. I an going to go ahead and guess its netflix/videogames or youtube/social media that entertain you at home. In my experience they are life killers. They are an extremely simple way to mild entertainment. I cut some of them out and I noticed it forced me to make choice and put some effort into my life, that really helped in getting meaning and value out. Also, in my experience social activity is great, the trick is that we need to control it. If it's an activity we want to do it can be great. Sitting around and talking to people is fucking hell.\n\nHope its helpfull, doing my best not just to lurk the subreddit.\n\nTL:DR: drop the simple entertainment like social media and videogames and make sure you center social interaction on activities you love.
1	I personally recommend weightlifting. It is physically engaging and it is a solo activity. You can even listen to music or audiobooks when you workout which is awesome to the senses. The results are visible so I personally find it rewarding. There is always a higher goal to achieve next and there are so many approaches to try. You can take your time and discover your own pace. A side note, do try to limit talking about it in general conversation though unless you are talking with people with similar interests because i notice it can be annoying to others. 
5	Best Friends?	I’ve been best friend with a ENFP my entire life and have just recently started to think about something. Straight up, what personalities are you experiencing the best friendships with?
10	I don't have "best friends" on a permanent basis. I will be intense friends with someone for a while and then we will drift apart and I am fine with that. I guess you could call my wife my best friend. She is an ENFJ and we've been married for almost 13 years. We have our ups and downs though. We go through periods where we don't talk to each other much, and then there are periods where we are really close. 
8	All my friends are fuckin ENFPs I hate it LMAO
4	ESTP, ESFP, ENTP, ENFP.\n\nThose are basically my top 4 friends in no particular order. So EP's.
3	My best bud is an ESTP. While I've known him for like 15 years, we're not particularly close (well, not as close as other "best friends" I see out there). Still, we share some interests and viewpoints on life. Dude's pretty abrasive, but straightforward and no-bullshit, which I like and respect him for. From what I can tell I've also earned his respect because I'm "smart".\n\nHe's also very reliable. Hell, he even saved my stupid ass from getting beat up by a bunch of dudes who didn't like my jokes (for reference, I'm 5'6" and he's 6'5" and 250 lbs).\n\nSometimes it feels like we're not really on the same page, but I've learnt to put up with his temper and just let him cool down when he's aggravated. Currently looking for other friends for emotional support though, as with this dude we can only help each other with practical problems.
3	I truly don’t know the type of a single person I know in real life. I only use MBTI for personal understanding of self and personal development. I see absolutely no need to know other people’s types as it’s just another box to put them in. They already have gender, class, race, sexuality, etc. \n\n\nI prefer to get to know someone as an individual and learn what makes them tick through immersion in their world. 
2	ENFJ, ENTP, INTP.\nI mean friends, I guess that's what OP asked about but for some reason others are commenting about their partners(?)
1	I don't really have a best friend but I am pretty good friends with at least 1 ISFJ, 2 ISTJs, and an ESTP.
1	Besides my sister, I don’t really have a “best friend”. But I do mostly hang out with extroverts. I see each of my friends every once in a while. I do not choose to go to nearly as many things as I get invited to. Many people take it the wrong way. So I’ve missed opportunities to have closer friends than I do. I also find myself very involved in a group (as involved as I can be, lol) for a few years and then I drift onto another one after I outgrow that group. Not that I think this is a great thing or a bad thing, just a trend I’ve noticed now that I’m in my thirties. 
1	My current girlfriend / best friend is an ENFJ, she introduced me to the personality type and tbh we really click and fit perfectly... Her desire to reach fits my desire to learn and her perception of things broad my horizons when I ground her with my way of thinking etc\nIt works really well :)
-10	There's no way you're ISTP. Way too many grammatical errors in your post. 
8	Politics:Opinions about the situation in Venezuela	Question for those fellow ISTPs interested in politics: the current situation in Venezuela, who is at fault and what should be done?\n\nIn my opinion, the US is actually doing the right thing(will trigger a lot of people propably). The elections weren't clearly democratic unlike authoritarian countries like China and Russia would want you to believe. Henrique Caprilles wasn't for instance allowed to participate as a candidate, and there is clear evidence of vote buying and other irregularities. \n\nRussia, China and other authoritarian countries would want you to believe that the US is doing a intervention like they are doing in Iraq, but this is clearly not the case. The US is supporting a candidate who actually wants to solve the problems in Venezuela, while the other's are supporting Maduro, because they will have an ally in South America who is as authoritarian as they are. I'd rather want the Venezuelan people not to suffer anymore and depose Maduro?\n\nWhat do you think?\nPs. Not from the US, and please don't downvote on the basis of my opinion, downvote for some other reason if you are going to downvote\n\nEDIT: I know it's not related to our MBTI type, but i just want to get an overview on our thinking of political situations and how we use the T(thinking)of our ISTP function, in the realm of politics
10	I don't even follow politics in my own country.
11	I'd rather the US be hands off, unless there is a barrier to voting for the "good" candidate, such as armed threats, etc. 
10	A country that has a lot of potential that was run to shit by a poor government. The US has both ethical and economic benefits to exploit by intervening in Venezuela so yes, I agree with you. I'm not a big fan of US imperialism, but installing a US friendly govt in the country with the largest oil reserves in the world isn't a bad idea.

2	Intercepted is a nonmainstream (in the sense that it goes to town on both sides pretty brutally) incisive podcast and their latest episode was on this issue:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/4kkJZ2rPh2QuMhtfrPN6i8?si=cU2t07RXQX-b_kTiuF9HPw sorry if no Spotify you may have to google.\n\nThings definitely have gone wrong in Venezuela, but the U.S.'s interest at this juncture is curious, and the U.S.'s past history of interventions in these circumstances is not the best. There's a strong case based on surrounding soundbytes and context that Trump's group is interested primarily to secure connections to, if not ownership of, Venezuelan oil, above any humanitarian or Democratic concern.
2	I have mixed feelings. Yes they are in poor conditions they shouldn't be, but so were the Afghans. All they wanted was money, they didn't care about bettering their lives in the long term. \nIf we are gonna intervene and risk the lives of our 18 year old kids they'd better be more involved and committed to the fight than thr Afghans were to theirs.
1	I'd rather every country mind their own business than meddling around with other people.\nHowever in this case, it's pretty clear that Maduro's faction is pretty corrupt and playing dirty which I dislike.\n\nSo I'm neutral on this. If an intervention is to be made, I'd rather the tone of it be like "Don't start crazy shit or I'll send troops" or something like that.
1	America attacks venezuela for it's oil, it's done this a lot of times to a lot of other countries
1	Communism solves everything.
1	Venezuela has made it pretty damn clear they aren’t capable of caring for themselves. If nobody steps in to oversee the throw out of the government that literally destroyed the country, it will end up a waste land. 
0	[The elections were democratic.](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/13899)\n\nThey support Maduro and recently tens of thousands took to the streets to protest against the opposition.\nhttp://www.laiguana.tv/articulos/54333-87-venezolanos-guarimbas\n\n[The opposition didn't want international observers to confirm this.\n](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-un-idUSKCN1GO2J0)\n\n[Capriles was banned for fraud by the supreme Court but the decision was overturned.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/henrique-capriles-venezuela-banned-public-office-170407230838078.html)\n\n[So he was allowed to run but decided to boycott.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-20/venezuela-main-opposition-parties-to-boycott-presidential-vote)\n\nHe supported violent protest in his state that got his own officers killed. [He has yet to issue a public statement condemning the homicide of a police officer in his state during a protest that he himself led.](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/venezuela-maduro-opposition-violence-capriles)\n\nThis IS the case. Securing Venezuelan oil by privatizing it with American or America friendly companies gives them great leverage over other countries who rely on that oil supply. \n\nVenezuela has been a liberal capitalist country before and it absolutely did not go well.\n\nI don't think he wants to solve the problems. He wishes to privatize Venezuela and allow foreign companies to control their resources. \n\nI really recommend checking out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/breadtube/comments/ak1wtu/_/ef0rcwi) the media coverage for Venezuela is quite badly done and unreliable. \n\nI'll quote for those too lazy to click.\n\n>What is the media coverage of Venezuela like and why is it that way?\n\n>I published a book based on my PhD where I conducted a qualitative and quantitative study of the coverage of Venezuela from seven of the most influential newspapers from the US and UK and have studied their content over a 20 year period. I called it “Bad News From Venezuela: Twenty Years of Fake News and Misreporting” because I found the media consistently portrayed the country in the worst light possible, presenting minority opinions on highly-contested issues as facts, while rarely, if ever, acknowledging there was an opposing side. Furthermore, the majority of empirical evidence often backed up the opposing side’s points. In short, the corporate media is passing off opposition propaganda as accurate, unbiased reporting. I uncovered a huge network of disinformation agents within the media, some of whom are directly paid by the State Department, to pass State Department propaganda off as genuine news.\n\n>An example of skewed coverage: In 2014 the media overwhelmingly presented a wave of US-backed far-right violence that included garrotting innocent passers by and attacking doctors, kindergartens and social housing as a peaceful, democratic uprising against a dictatorship. Public opinion polls showed up to 87% of the country rejected the supposedly peaceful protests.\n\n>The second part of the book deals with why this is happening. I interviewed 27 journalists and experts to find out. Aside from the very obvious fact that Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world and is defying the US and Europe, there are some interesting factors. First, the amount of people who actually produce news about Venezuela for the entire world is very small indeed, barely a few dozen. Due to massive cuts in media funding, it means there is only one full-time correspondent for the entirety of the mainstream English-language press in the country. Much of the rest has been outsourced by agencies and news organizations to cheaper, local journalists. However, the media in Venezuela is extraordinarily partisan. The local media is not just affiliated with the opposition, often it is the opposition and has led coups against the government, like the one in 2002.\n\n>Western journalists, often without the ability to speak Spanish (and therefore, to the bottom 90+% of the population) are parachuted into this newsroom atmosphere, and quickly join their ranks. Critical journalists said that their colleagues call themselves the “resistance” to the government, and think it is their number one job to overthrow it. In order to accomplish this they sometimes deliberately publish fake news about the country. One Bloomberg journalist told me how he managed to get the notorious “condoms now cost US$750 in Venezuela” article to go around the world. That it was immediately disproven and actually a box of condoms cost no more than $8 and that the government actually gave out 18 million free ones did not matter. He was unrepentant, saying it was his job was to get clicks and he would use all the “sexy tricks” he wanted. He seemed proud of his ingenuity. [This interview took place before the term “fake news” was in common usage] Why journalists felt so comfortable telling me this is anyone’s guess, perhaps because they see themselves as noble warriors for democracy.

38	Any other ISTPs find yourselves having to teach yourselves in school?	I have a very distinct way of learning and I often find that when someone else tries to explain something to me in their way, I get really confused and overwhelmed. For this reason I rarely get tutoring or ask for help from a classmate. I feel like I have to just read the textbook where the information is written in a straightforward, objective way, and process/decode it in my own way. Occasionally people will explain things to me in a way that makes sense, but usually I have to modify it in my brain somehow in order for it to stick.
19	College senior and YES!\n\nI love it when teachers post slides/notes online and don't take attendance. Those are my favorite professors. \n\nI stay home and can teach myself everything from the 2 hr lecture in less than 30 min and have a much better understanding of the material.\n\nWhen I'm in class, it's hard for me to stay focused. Especially classes with students that are constantly asking off-topic questions or making pointless remarks - the type that just like to hear themselves speak. A guy in my program has been doing this in half my classes for the past 3 years. It's awful.
9	Yes. My learning style never really matched with most teacher's teaching styles. I usually just figure everything out in my own. I figured out a while ago that asking questions usually just confuses me more.
9	Are you me? Learning by myself is way more effective than being stuck in a classroom for an hour. Also if someone’s talking too much, my mind starts to wander. I can teach myself stuff that I want to learn and can go at the pace I want. 
5	Yes especially if the teachers are just feeding you paragraphs from the text book and formula for calculation. I don't want to memorise, I want to understand. My mind won't be able to rationalise storing those information without making sense of it first.
3	Yes, all of my life.\n\n
2	There are many competing theories on different learning styles and learning preferences. All of them have a category pertaining to visual learning. I doubt learning preferences are strongly correlated to mbti, but I could be wrong. Google “learning styles” for insight
2	Yeah I teach myself everything from the readings. The way most profs put things together doesn't make sense to me. Like there's no logic to it and it just feels like random slides of information. I cannot remember it at all unless I spend time trying to figure it out on my own. That said, I like figuring things out on my own and I feel good when I understand it, so I'm not complaining.
2	Yh, I thought I was just dumb, I spend more time re learning things at home than in school
1	I tried teaching myself school stuff and left that to teach myself how to do circus skills. It's worked out pretty well so far!
1	I did that since the very begining and until the end and  I continue in college
1	Only because I don’t pay attention in class. 
1	Definitely. There are times when I don’t even need to study and just pay attention in class and ace the test. Other times I find that as long as I understand the information then that’s the most important. 
1	Yes. 100%. \n\nSo far I have taught myself the ukulele, guitar, piano, and percussion. Am I as good as someone classically trained? No. My skills are impressive enough to me though. I enjoy it. I would not take lessons. I just didn’t want to. I wanted to figure it out by myself over time. \n\nSame with painting, and drawing, singing, and cooking. I’ve gotten pretty good at those things. But I also never wanted lessons. \n\nI actually get quite angry and anxious when I don’t have control over the pace and way I learn something new. \n\nIn college this was the worst. Is there a book for this class? All test questions and material are based out of the book? Ok I’ll see you on the test day. I don’t need to come here for 3 1/2 hours per week, on your time, and listen to your shitty PowerPoints. I will just read the book myself. \n\nAlso, math. Math classes are useless to me, as the teacher almost always flies through the material without bothering to make it understandable. It took me a fuck of a long time to learn math. I learned it myself, bit by bit, on YouTube and by studying the book alone for several hours a day. 
1	Yes, same here. I am studying my masters now and I practice selective hearing in class. When things start to get off topic for me, I just start doing my own to do list or grocery list or whatever. When things got relevant I pay full attention with my senses because I learn a lot that way. Then I focus on self learning at my own time from my notes, slides, browsing additional information that interests me etc. I think it helps to use our sensory abilities to make the most out of class and edit the information we keep as we go. I have survived exams that way when I just don't have time to study beforehand.
6	How do you focus and follow through?	I find I can get distracted and/or fail to finish things. Is this similar for you guys? How do you focus? Thanks!
9	coming to ISTP's for tips on how to focus?? XD alright.
5	It’s really a rather simple solution. You just need to...... Ooooooo sparkley! What do we have here?!?
5	Addderrrralll!
4	I am pretty good at following through with and finishing things as long as they are important to me or they're personal goals or something. In fact sometimes I have a hard time setting things down and not obsessing over finishing projects or whatever so I'm not so sure this is completely just an ISTP thing. But when it comes to following through with things like plans to get together with friends or go on vacation? That's a different story. I've noticed I've got some pretty bad short term commitment issues when it comes to stuff like that. From my experience as an ISTP, if you are going to not get distracted and finish stuff you need to find a personal reason to care that it gets finished I guess is what I should say.
2	It doesn’t really belong to certain type, there are plenty of methods. I use just the time when I can control myself at best + reminding myself about the goal, faith in what I do etc
1	woot woot
29	What goes on in an ISTP's mind when crushing?	Hi, an INTJ here.\n\nBased on the experiences of people I know who are ISTP, you all seem really laid back. Like, so laid back that I can't imagine you pursuing anyone even if you're romantically interested in them. Also, I feel like you guys are really grounded and present-minded unlike INTJs. So I ask these related questions. When you crush:\n\n* *Are you actually interested in a relationship or are you perfectly content sitting back and admiring them from a distance?*\n* *Does this person make you stressed out and/or nervous? If so, why?*\n* *Do you fantasize doing things with said person?*\n* *Do you ever become obsessed about this person?*\n* *How long does it usually last?*\n\nI get mentally hyperactive when I crush, and I think that is a typical reaction of an INTJ. But I feel like you all being more cool-headed, you would act much differently in this kind of situation. Really interested in hearing the responses. Thanks in advance.
45	To answer question one, yes I want a relationship, but I tend to just admire from a distance due to social anxiety, which answers question 2. Yes, our crush makes us nervous. When I was younger, my nervousness would paralyze me. Now that I'm older it's more of a fight or flight response. Either I interact with my crush (fight response) or I just quietly fade into the crowd (flight response). To answer question 3, yes. Four can also be a yes, but it all hinges on how close I am to my crush. 
31	My wife chased me. So I don't know. 
21	I sit back, and try to read a person. Scope out personality, watch how they interact with others. Honestly I'm pretty content, and don't see the point of rushing into anything. How long it lasts is a gamble, and may never amount to anything.
9	In my case, most of time i prefer just to sit back and watch my crush over the distance, usually i wait until she gives me some signal of interest and only then I make my moves. When I was younger, they made me feel very nervous, but now (I'm 29) i only have the "normal" anxiety that I feel when I met someone new. About having fantasies, it happens to me all the time, and it's kinda an obsession because every time I see that person I can't help to avoid staring at she or looking at her Facebook etc. In my case this last until either she notices me and feel stalked or I found someone new who drags my attention. 
7	> * Are you actually interested in a relationship or are you perfectly content sitting back and admiring them from a distance?\n\nI don't know. When I was younger, yes, but now that I'm 30 I don't care as much and will make conversation with anybody if something sparks my interest. The "sparking my interest" thing is still curious to me because even beautiful people aren't necessarily attractive to me if there isn't some aspect of their character that is interesting.\n> * Does this person make you stressed out and/or nervous? If so, why?\n\nNervous, sure, but that's normal when you like somebody. Everybody tends to overthink it.\n> * Do you fantasize doing things with said person?\n\nIs that a real question? Lol\n> * Do you ever become obsessed about this person?\n\nYeah it can definitely lean that direction if I'm not busy with other things in life. I spend a lot of time thinking, so honestly having a lot of time on my hands pisses me off because my mind might obsess about anything from traffic lights being a stupid idea so fine tiddies.\n> * How long does it usually last?\n\nUntil I have a reason to stop it which unfortunately could be a long time if I'm getting played for attention, which has happened a couple times.
6	Yes, I am interested in a relationship.\n\nI have very bad social anxiety, so, yes.\n\nDepends on how well I know them.\n\nOnly for a brief period.\n\nIt varies.
4	>Are you actually interested in a relationship or are you perfectly content sitting back and admiring them from a distance?\n\nI do, but I don't mind if it doesn't happen.\n\n>Does this person make you stressed out and/or nervous? If so, why?\n\nYes, but that's often due to feared elements of a relationship. Loss of autonomy, volatility... someone else depending on you for happiness.... learning something about them I don't like.\n\n>Do you fantasize doing things with said person?\n\nWhen I was younger, yes.\n\n>Do you ever become obsessed about this person?\n\nRarely.\n
3	It took me a while to figure out that I have a crush on a guy. As ISTPs ain't the most emotionally aware people. 1) I am interested in a relationship but before I am committed I tend to observe from a distance and ask myself if I am ready for a relationship with that person.  2) I can stay calm on the outside but it is a chaos in my head. I am nervous to make a move. I over think a lot after meeting with the person and sometimes I feel quite embarrassed after I reflected on our interactions. 3) I fantasize us just chilling and having a good time together, or like he invites me to do an activity that I would like to try for so long. I don't think too far ahead of the future. I never fantasize about getting married or having a family. 4) I wouldn't say I am obessed with him. I still have my piorities and I think having a crazy obession to somebody is an unhealthy behavior. 5) Well, this is my first ever crush and it started three months ago. Right now the feeling has no sign of fading.
3	For me.. [f,31] I tend to ruin relationships before they ever really start. I overthink, over analyze, and feel uncomfortable when it feels like I’m the one doing all the work. So I try to play it cool and “laid back” and back off, even though I daydream about them/us a lot.\n\n\nIf someone pursues me, I tend to be very cautious around them, as if they have a hidden agenda and therefore I don’t trust them. I tend to only trust those I pursue. It’s weird. \n\n\nHowever, to me—what’s worse, is that after a while, being the pursuer is exhausting, and it’s always bitten me in the ass in the end b/c the dude tends to not care about being with me b/c HE didn’t make the decision to. (He didn’t chase me-it wasn’t HIS decision to begin with) He just went along for the ride :( \n\n\nI have a tendency to daydream about the person I’m crushing on a lot. I do have crushes OFTEN, but they’re fleeting. Usually they don’t last more than a few days to a month at most, depending on how often I see them. Its also dependent on if they reciprocate anything towards me. Im incredibly perceptive and know when to back off or keep at it. I have no problem saying hi or talking to the person I’m crushing on but... I will usually say or do something dumb around them, and it will replay in my mind over and over until I lose interest in the chase b/c I feel like a failure for doing or saying whatever dumb thing I just did. How could they ever like me after that? Sometimes this has led me to pretending that person doesn’t even exist anymore. Walking past them and not giving the usual smile, or saying hello. It’s easier to pretend they don’t exist, than to deal with learning what they think of me.\n\n\nI should have prefaced this with a side note... Lately my confidence is pretty much zero, and so I almost ignore all strangers. I don’t even want to get to know anyone new. I don’t want a hint of feelings to rise to the surface b/c I just can’t handle heartbreak or embarrassment again. So I am indifferent to just about everyone and just go about my business. \n\n\nEven when someone shows me interest, I already play out the worst case scenario in my head so I don’t fall for them—growing indifferent towards them once I develop feelings to keep from feeling vulnerable. It’s a defense mechanism that is very personal to me and I can’t vouch for any other ISTPs. 
2	I don't know if I'm interested in a relationship. When I do like somebody, I usually just admire from a distance. When I find myself catching feelings for some girl, I immediately try to let go of those feelings and not let my thoughts get out of control. I guess with repressed Fe, I just really try to filter my emotions as much as possible and not experience any that are too intense. Having less emotion makes me feel.i have more power and control over what happens to me in life.
2	1. Yes. Some days.\n2. Kind of. Some days.\n3. Occasionally. Some days.\n4. Not often. Some days.\n5. Too long. \n\nIt's confusing and frustrating some times because crushes seem so pointless. It's one of those, "my body says yes but my mind says no" kind of things.
2	I have a crush on girl I met 2 days ago. I am inviting her to do sports with me tomorrow. Usually I do fantasize about my crush, am interested in the relationship, not nervous about being around, become obsessed. And usually do nothing about it.  Just kick it down the road. This state last for 3 days - half a year, it depends. This time she left a big impression on me, so I am even going to pursue her *myself*.
2	1. Yes, but I'm also perfectly content knowing and admiring someone I like from afar. Sometimes it's enough to know he's happy. \n2. When my crush is closer, yes. I get extremely anxious but I'm a master of concealing my affections. I was able to live with someone for 6 years and he had no idea I was \*in love\* with him. \n3. Yes, I want to bang the living hell out of my crush.\n4. Obsessed? Yes, like I'd come up with witty and loveliest lines to say to feeling dumb and acting mute around him.\n5. Depends. When my crush is always in sight, I can't get over my feelings. When away, he doesn't exist even in my mental periphery. 
1	>*Are you actually interested in a relationship or are you perfectly content sitting back and admiring them from a distance?*\n\nI am interested in a relationship but I'm usually admiring from away for a good while before engaging with them in any way\n\n>*Does this person make you stressed out and/or nervous? If so, why?*\n\nYes, my anxiety would increase 10 fold. But I think that's the case for most people\n\n>*Do you fantasize doing things with said person?*\n\nThis is kind of an odd question tbh\n\n>*Do you ever become obsessed about this person?*\n\nIt happened when I was in my teens, now not at all anymore. I just spend a lot of time analysing stuff, interactions we've had or things I've seen them do. When I was younger and I was near someone I liked I thought about every aspect of my presence as I wanted to be as cool as possible. \n\n>*How long does it usually last?*\n\nIt depends, usually not very long.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Istp here. \n\nSince we want to get as much information as possible before we talk to a crush, we will never cat call. But starting conversations is a skill and I've worked on mine enough to initiate with crushes. Ive also worked on my social anxiety in two ways. I focused on building empathy (istp's nightmare) so i can identify basic emotions my crush is feeling. It helps me relax when im around her. \n\nThe second thing i worked on is leading conversations confidently and better communication (aka active listening). Now when i talk to her i relax to the point where when my hyperactive mind spontaneously thinks of something i don't know about her i dont say it immediately, keep it to myself until there's an appropriate break in the conversation, then i bring the question up i thought of, in the normal flow of the conversation. It works out really well and i recommend this style of chatting.
1	I just begin talking. The trick with introverts is not to stop
1	I might be the outlier in this sub about these things. Although I am not good in making the initial contact I usually go after a girl pretty aggressively once that has been established. And no, not in the #metoo sense of the word but when I fall I fall hard so I'll actively pursue a woman for a first/second/third date.\n\nNow for length... That isn't been my best track record lol. 
1	ISTP female here. I love the sensation of having crushes but I see relationship as hardwork and it needs to be worth the experience to happen.\n\n1. When I have a crush on someone I want to get as much sensory experience as possible with them. This depends on how much I like them. Sometimes admiring their good looks from afar is enough for me if I don't enjoy talking to them.\n2. I feel somewhat high when they are around, which is an awesome, uplifting sensation to have. I am usually very playful and flirty because I want to share a good experience with me. I don't feel comfortable when the interaction is not smooth or the other person is upset about something. This makes me nervous because I worry I will say something insensitive that jeopardises the experience/moment.\n3. Of course. Mostly physical activities, make of that what you will.\n4. Only if I cannot make sense of something about them. But I obsess on my own, like trying to figure things out in my head at my own time based on my experiences with them. Only if necessary I will confront them but very rarely.\n5. Until I figure out whether I can continuously have interesting interaction with them or not. Usually if the answer is no, I move on and just treat them as friends if possible.
1	I tend to admire from a distance, and I *don't* have social anxiety. I'm just not interested in sex or fun with romance. If I develop feelings for someone, I don't act on them. I've never been in a relationship for that reason.\n\nWhen I was around ten-twelve, I had a mutual crush. We both acknowledged it; our mothers would giggle about it; my little sister and our cousin paraded around chanting, "Ezzi likes W, Ezzi likes W," in front of an entire room of people(both of which pissed me off).\n\nBut besides playing more together without other kids, we didn't act on it. I didn't care to exchange feelings, and neither did he.   \n\n\n&#x200B;
-2	i observe from a distance long enough to figure them out (a couple encounters, typically, most people are simple), then i approach them and initiate sparkling conversation about stupid shit they like, like sports and guns. after they are intrigued because i’m ‘not like most girls’, i leave and pretend i forget they exist. never has this ever failed to get them to ask me out. lol boys are silly, but fun. 
1	ISTP here. I have a question about what functions would be responsible for this conclusion I came up with about women and money. No offense to anyone!	So the other day i came to the conclusion that, most women that ask men for money dnt really like them; based off my experiences, and ran it by my INTJ friend to. Basically how I came to this conclusion was I looked back, and compared: all the women I had sex with, dated and the ones I didn’t do any of those things with. What I got was the ones who actually liked me, and wanted sex didn’t ask for any money, and the ones who didn’t like me did ask for money basically. So besides my conclusion lol in case you care, my question is what functions would be responsible for how I came up with that, Ti Se, or sudden insight from tertiary Ni ?
3	If she's asking you for money she's a hooker. Nothing to do with functional stacks.
2	I think is Se > Ni > Ti\n\nYou experienced these women through your life (Se), noticed a patern (Ni) and created a hypothesis (Ti).\n\nWhen you use Se, you get faster information but not too deep, while Ni, is much deaper and slow.
2	Wait what? You've had several women asking for money? How the fuck does that go?\n\n"Hey, yeah I don't really like you but I need these shoes. Give me money!" ?
2	Yea i guess thing 2 the red pill is quarantined ?
2	You don't have to blame every quirk on a type, some people are just shitty people.

27	Accepting apologies	What is it about ISTPs not able to accept/handling heartfelt apologies? (enfj F here)
37	It's meaningless. If someone actually cares, they change their actions. "Heartfelt apologies" are just talk because other people don't want to claim responsibility for their own guilt 
49	I think it's because words don't solve problems. \n\nie "Sorry for ruining your life."\n\nUm yeah thanks. Now are you gonna fix it, and pay me back in interest? Yeah, didn't think so. \n\nEtc.
20	Am I the only ISTP here who actually does appreciate hearing an apology? That said, it has to be genuine. We sniff out BS with marked precision. \n\nIf someone wrongs me and they're like "sorry bro", um, that doesn't mean anything to me because they're likely just to keep doing whatever it was. So it's a non-apology.\n\nIf someone legitimately owns up to what they did (they have to actually acknowledge what the wrong was) and says they're sorry and it change their behavior in a way that shows they're trying not to do it again, that means **a lot** to me.
17	"The only true apology is changed behavior".\n\nDemonstrate over time that you won't do whatever it was you apologized for again in the future. Just saying sorry doesn't really change/mean anything.
17	Actions speak louder than words.
14	Tip for my fellow ISTP's: People make mistakes. For the longest time I would cut people off that crossed me. I didn't see any value making up with people and it took me forever to trust them again. It didn't make me happy constantly avoiding/ignoring people... Just made me bitter.\n\nFor your own sake, sometimes it's better to forgive and move on. But sometimes the other person is just shitty and needs to be cut off.\n\nEdit: But also echoing everyone else in here... Actions speak louder than words.
8	Idk about other ISTPs but I don't get offended easily. Apologies more often than not piss me off. Just say sorry and be done with it. Unless it's something really bad that we need to talk about to set things straight, then Idc for an apology really. But some people just drag on with the apology, baby me like I'm a hurt infant, and just make me uncomfortable in general. Which ironically, offends me.
13	Apologies are generally a useless waste of time. I'd rather you just not
6	I'm married to an ISTP and the answers I'm seeing here are very consistent with his attitude which is probably our biggest difference. I think apologies are needed sometimes because people are bound to screw up. It's inevitable. At least when you say you're sorry you're owning up to it. That being said, if you ISTPs screw up do you ever apologize to others?
5	Regarding big issues: I accept apologies but don't forgive very easily...  If they've already ruined my trust or have shown me their character or behavior is self centered and hurtful, words will never be enough. Especially if the offense was to do with showing how their behavior and character is shitty at its core. Only time and their future behavior or actions will build the trust again. Even then... I will always have a caution with them in the back of my mind and probably won't open up again intimately like before.\n\n  Regarding small issues: Apologies for small things, everyday things, like bumping into me or eating my cereal. For example, if my fiancée forgot to get me a birthday gift or accidentally ruined my favorite hair product... Not a big deal. Accidents, mistakes, small things like that are easily forgiven and forgotten.
5	Apologies are easy, cost you nothing and are a key component of civilization.  \n\nAn apology must start with “ I am sorry that I.”\n\nI forgive most things easy, some things never, but I always expect an apology. I will call people out on “I’m sorry that it or you.”
3	Now I wanna know what you did...
3	What I've learned is, an apology will probably sound like bullshit to some people if that apology does not include very specific acknowledgement of how your actions negatively affected that person. Acknowledgment of how your actions have negatively affected a person shows that you actually sat down and thought about it and intend to change your ways. If you do not do that, the apology just comes across as pure fluff that you only put out there in an effort to relieve yourself of guilt. So the formula for a great apology is this: State what you did, state how it negatively affected the person you're apologizing to, state that you realize your error and how you intend to change your ways, THEN follow that with whatever form of "I'm incredibly sorry and I hope that you can eventually forgive me." All while keeping in mind that this person is under NO obligation to forgive you after you've said these things.
4	Im more of a * don't tell me, show me* with regards to apologies.  I don't hold a grudge, but i make a mental note and keep in mind your prior behavior- i'll avoid putting myself in a situation where it can affect me again.  If i see you reoffending- i'll likely delete you from my future life experiences. \n
3	I appreciate sincere apologies. It's the first thing I look for if someone does me wrong. Don't just pretend it didn't happen. Say you're sorry, tell me how you're going to fix it, and we can move on. By moving on, I mean I will not hold a grudge against you but I'll be watching from the corner to see if you do as you said.\n
2	I for one forgive too easily. I'm a doormat. I blame it on being brought up as a Christian.
2	i forgive people even if they still hold a grudge, i think dwelling in the past is extremely unhelpful. i don't apologize if i don't mean it which pisses people off sometimes, but i think agreeing to disagree is usually the best option unless you have to come to a solution. i can tell whether an apology is actually sincere, but regardless of the fact knowing that they want to come to a resolution is good enough for me. idk what specifically you're talking about, but in general i'll either forgive them, or cut them out if they did something really bad. 
2	I don't know how much this relates to Meyers Briggs but I personally find it relatively easy to accept apologies. I recognize that everyone makes mistakes and if someone screws something up it's usually easy to just move on. The only times I really find it hard to accept an apology is when I can tell that person isn't sincere or they aren't actually going to do anything differently in the future. 
2	My wife is an ENFJ and when she apologises, I just have to accept it, otherwise we don't get anywhere. Doesn't mean I am happy about it. I don't know why. 
2	Speaking for myself and my general opinion of other istps:\n\nWe can accept apologies.\n\nIf you have to apologize too often, or if you were just being cruel and fucked up very badly a single time, you are dead to us. In several years we may change our minds, but an apology alone won’t cut it once you’ve crossed that line.
2	It can be accepted, especially if it is in this form "**I realized that I was wrong, at that moment I didn't know that I was wrong, now I realize it, please accept my apologies.**". Realization can be enaugh to accept.
2	Depends. I have no problems accepting apologies for most things. It’s when you’ve physically or fiscally damaged me that just words don’t cut it. \n\n\nFact of the matter is, certain scenarios require more than just words to rectify. And there really is no blanket “rule” to lay out. Truly just depends on each individual scenario. 
2	Think of it this way, if a person physically abuses their spouse, does an apology instantly heal the marks and bruises that were inflicted?  What about the wounds inflicted the day after?\n\nThe question is, you can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?  Really there are so many idioms to choose from.  The road to hell is paved with good intentions also applies.
2	It's not necessary for me. That is all. I have probably moved on and don't want to be reminded again of stupid things that have happened in the past. Half of the time it seems like people apologize over things that didn't even effect me and I don't want to deal with whatever frivolous self-guilt is happening.
1	Well, this is not something I deal with. Sounds like you probably did something that the ISTP perceived as proof that there is something inherently wrong with you, this then warrants them cutting you out of their life. If you're a pos ISTP's will notice faster than others and will be the fastest to cut you off.
1	depends on the severity. it's either i was never mad, or i learned my lesson. with that, you can either continue making the same mistake, and thinking it's ok (accepting an apology), or moving on, there are 7.54 billion folks out there. never give up on fam though
1	Apologies are usually for making the apologizer feel better. If you fucked up and it affected me negatively, make an effort to fix it. If we just accept the apology without any attempts at fixing your mistake (especially the part that actually affected us), we know that we'll just reinforce your belief that fucking up is okay as long as you feel sorry afterwards.
1	First of all, I usually warn people about what is ok and not ok for me. I notice people tend to not remember this because they are too busy listening to themselves speak. I see this a lot from the enfp's and enfj's that I know, unfortunately.\n\nThen these people go on and make the mistake that I have warned them about. It is highly annoying because I have told you already and because it became obvious that you did not listen which is disrespectful.\n\nSo see if the ISTP you are dealing with communicated about this before or not, because for me it will make a big difference in how you seem to value this relationship to the ISTP. Secondly, apology is not the end of your efforts. You should apologise, and then prove that you know you are guilty by fixing your act in a consistent manner. Then the ISTP will decide whether to forgive you or not and you should give them the space to do so. Otherwise you can probably do better in listening and paying attention to the next ISTP you meet.
2	Jan Rader maybe an ISTP?	[In the opioid crisis, here's what it takes to save a life | Jan Rader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLAw7yF0YBc)\n\n>As a fire chief and first responder, Jan Rader has spent her career saving lives. But when the opioid epidemic hit her town, she realized they needed to take a brand-new approach to life-saving. In this powerful, hopeful talk, Rader shows what it's like on the front lines of this crisis -- and how her community is taking an unusual new approach to treating substance-abuse disorder that starts with listening.\n\nWork great in crises, great at listening. Wdyt?
25	What makes you Sad?	Not much really makes me sad, but i feel so ashamed of myself when someone i look up to is disappointed. \n\nWhen i was in high school, i looked up to my band director. I was incredibly unaware and goofy then and he got upset at me for something. I had never felt so ashamed. \n\nI get sad about people i cared about that died. I feel melancholy when i cant do something i want to, when im restrained, or when i have nothing to do and feel useless. 
18	Well, You pretty much summed it up. The have nothing to do part is the absolute worst. I usually don't notice for a couple of days, then at some point I'm just like, well I feel like shit. 
11	Possibly movies for a few minutes.
10	I just must be a very emotional istp then, because I hear that istps are generally happy or non-bothered people. Sad Movies can make me emotional , if an animal gets hurt I’m especially emotional, or if someone who I actually care about hurts me I’ll be emotional. With that being said though, I’ve never been an over emotional person. I’ll tear up or just get really quiet, but I’ll never get crazy about it.\nEdit: being lied to also makes me sad, but more of like a sad/disappointed kinda feeling 
7	Failing after giving 110% because it means that doing more than just my best still wasn't enough, which proves that I'm simply not good enough for that person, organization, etc.\n\nBeing emotionally abused or cast aside after finally deciding to open up emotionally to that person. I rarely share my feelings nor express my emotions, so it really pains me when my trust in someone is broken.\n\nBeing helpless and unable to take action on any situation.
4	 \n\nThe amount of feelings I had to deal with when someone I adored and admired died unexpectedly was immensely brutal. I grieved for 2 years and on two following relationships. I am still feeling the leftover pangs of the wound. I didn’t know I was capable of having those feelings. It’s the opposite of Nietzche’s illuminating question against the world when his father died. I loathed myself for being so incapable of saving one person who meant the world to me, even if it’s irrational to think anyone could, really. It was so deep it changed my perception on human connections. All other feelings paled away. Worse, it’s harder for me to love after in a selfless way. It just took every tender part of me. This the reason I love the film “Goodwill Hunting”. I can relate to Robin Williams’ character. So much feels in the “park scene”. 
3	Humans
2	Not being motivated to do my work and looking back on the day in the evening seeing i havent done anything. Worst feeling. This gets me in a loop pretty often because i stay up all night hoping to do anything productive but it ends up watching videos etc. The next day will be even worse because my sleep cyclus is fucked up and i wake up when half the day is already over. It takes me a lot of energy to get it back to normal then.\n
2	The thought of not doing more skipping class in school to do stupid stuff with friends makes me sad.   \nHaving nothing to do but look into a screen makes me sad.   \nWaking up in the afternoon makes me sad.   \nHaving a lack of motivation really gets me down cause I want to do so much like work on my art for my tattoo flashes, try and build something, do some stuff with my guitars and amps but I can rarely get these highly motivational feelings that just make me high and have me do shit for a solid week and that just fucks me up.

23	Any other ISTP females find it a lot easier to open up about their problems to men rather than women?	I've been dealing with depression for the past 6-7 months or so. I recently started taking meds which is helping me a lot but during that dark period I found it way easier to communicate how I felt to males than females. Admittedly, it was very difficult to understand and articulate how I felt to anyone, and I spent most of my time alone for that reason, but when I did open up, I preferred it to be to a guy.\n\nI can't really put my finger on why exactly, but it was just easier. I think it could be because males tend to (with exceptions of course) be more to-the-point and practical. I also feel like they tend to be more casual and aloof about it, whereas in my experience females tend to (again, with exceptions) make a big deal over it.. When I tell someone I'm depressed and they get all emotional and sympathetic and keep apologizing for my situation, I just feel sort of uncomfortable and guilty. I don't like being pitied and worried about.\n\nI also don't particularly enjoy being treated like a poor lost soul who needs guidance. I would say I approach depression in a very practical and methodical way and I'm able to think through and overcome my depressive thoughts well. Most of the time when I go to a friend I'm not really looking for advice, I just need to vent. Since I'm pretty independent, I'm inclined to think that I can solve my problems myself and I don't need other people's help, which some people might call a toxic trait but idk it's just the way I am. It's not that I don't appreciate helpful suggestions, but I rarely put them into practice. Usually I know what I have to do, I just have a hard time finding the motivation and energy to do it because of depression (and medication has helped give me that extra push I need).\n\nAnd when I hear things like "you deserve to be happy," "make time to do the things that you enjoy that make life meaningful," or "value your mental health above all," I tend to think, "well no shit." Idk, that probably sounds really cynical but I just feel like those statements are really obvious and not really helpful to someone going through depression.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I just want to say that these are obviously very broad generalizations of men and women which don't apply to everyone. And I also want to clarify that I'm not an "i'M nOt LiKe oThEr GirLs" self-hating female seeking male validation. I have two sisters, a mother, and many female friends in my life who I absolutely love and greatly appreciate and honestly I don't know what I would do without them. It's just, when it comes to talking about my feelings, I tend to gravitate to males.
28	I’ll have to get back to you after I’ve experienced a problem that needed confiding.
12	I feel you.  So much of what other women say is wrought with nuance, not necessarily in a bad way, but in an unnecessary way.  Like if I wanted a circle jerk of sympathetic feely shit I know where to go, but if I just want to unload and get a "That sucks, man" I also know where to go.  Like you, most the time I'm going to just deal with it myself because I know I can but you don't really develop female relationships without sharing the negative shit so in compensation for my intense privacy I've learned to be a good, relatively passive listener (my advice is subjective and sucks anyway, lol).
5	You said it yourself- females- as a rule- come at it from emotional/ feeling angle, with very little useful/ practical side. You wanted to unload a bit- they come back at you with emotions- that drain you even on a good day. 
4	I’m an ISTP male and I’m the same way. I much prefer opening up to women instead of men. 
5	No. Most of the people I interact with on a daily basis are male. I have lots of superficial conversation with them, but when I want to actually open up, I turn to my female friends or mom.
2	For me I find it easiest with other SPs. Men/women doesn't really seem like a factor here.
1	What was your childhood like? Are you close to your mom? \n\nI had a very emotionally unavailable mother and I always figured that’s why I’m unable to (/have difficulties in) forming very close relationships with women. 
1	now that you mention it... i’ve confided in my guy friends more than my girl friends. but i mean, i barely talk to anyone about my issues lol
1	Can confirm. Had a female psychologist, way too soft. It didn’t help that she was pretty either 😂
1	Yeah, I can be the same. Most of my friends are guys. My husband (INFP) and I talk about everything and are also incredibly close friends, and one of my other closest male friends is an ISTP also. The females I do talk to about problems are an ISTP and an ENFP lol.
1	i think it depends. for sharing my opinion or an idea guys usually either aren't interested or want to debate it, but women are more likely to just listen, which can be nice if i just want to share something i thought about. i think about things way more than i feel complex emotions that i feel the need to share to other people, so opening up to women is easier for me. most problems i have i communicate as thoughts, not emotions, and people usually respond without the usual supportive comments. but i can tell women are actually supporting and being empathetic, whereas with guys it just sounds like i'm complaining or like i expect them to help me or something. in general guys are a lot easier to have conversations with but women tend to be much better listeners
1	In reply to your question: Yes. I'm an infp. A lot of woman tend to be kind indimadating to me. Sorry, I know you specifically asked about istp people but just thought I'd let you know.
1	Sorry to hear that you are dealing with depression. It sucks and the only thing that works is just taking it slow, day by day. Hope you can get the strength and support system that you need to handle it.\n\nI agree with you mostly because females (at least the ones I know) usually operate on sympathy and emotion. It seems the women I know want to fix every emotional problems so badly to the point they want to eliminate negativity. This way I personally see pressure to be okay at all times when I talk to women and it can be overbearing. Unfortunately it is not rational to never feel bad and I find that the men I talk to acknowledge that more than the women. I am not saying men are better at handling depression, but I do notice that their approach usually focuses on finding a solution and identifying facts. The women I know seem to worry mostly on making me feel better to the point they are telling me to be happy without suggesting how. 
51	I have to pause movies/shows because of second-hand embarrassment	Just like the title says, I feel like i physically cant continue to watch and I have to tense up muscles to get rid of the feeling. That said, it makes me much more invested cause it makes me experience that emotion. I can't remember any examples right now, but the character's inconvenience that I'm feeling for isn't even that harsh.
18	Add family members to the room and it's even worse. I swear second-hand embarrassment as a child caused permanent damage to my posture.
14	Do NOT watch The Last Man on Earth 
11	[You will love this](https://youtu.be/dVVRlthVR0U)
6	[deleted]
6	Oh god me too. I have to keep telling myself that it’s either fake or it’s just not happening to me so I shouldn’t be embarrassed but it doesn’t work. 
7	Yeah cringe makes me die
5	I am the same way. My friends don’t understand- I literately can’t handle the cringe 
3	I can't say I have the same problem
5	I never knew this was a thing that happened to anyone else. I HATE Michael from The Office because he makes me so uncomfortable. The Scott's Tots episode in particular is so bad. 
3	I hate cringe, my wife loves it.
3	I stop watching shows sometimes because the drama gets too intense and gives me anxiety.
3	Yeah, I can’t watch sitcoms that rely on people doing stupid things and not communicating in the most basic way.  I just won’t watch.
5	I pause movies all the time, but for a different reason. I just get bored. 
2	Interesting. 
2	The number of sxenes I've just skiped over because of this...
2	You should try watching the show "Monk". Can be tough at times. 
2	Same. Nathan for you is a guilty pleasure ...
1	omfg I'm the same way. I once joined my sisters when they were watching riverdale and I watched about half an episode with them and then left because the acting was so cringeworthy.
1	Fremdscham
1	in movies i hate it because i have time to invest in the character and empathize with them, so my brain feels like i'm the one in the awkward situation. i like a lot of cringey/embarassing videos though
7	Does any of you have anger issues or a short temper?	Cause I definetivelly have and I really can strugle with it. Any solutions for being more moderate ?
34	I have a very long fuse, but when it reaches the end the fireworks are spectacular.
5	I'm really good about controlling it, but when I'm alone stupid things set me off. I wanna break stuff, but know I shpuldn't cus it will just cause more problems, which in turn makes my anger worse...
13	It's definitely an ISTP thing and yes I have anger issues. The best thing that helps me is to not engage in the offense. Walk away until you have time to process. It helps. Trust me. \n\n\nAlso... *Do. 
3	I have a slow burning fuse that leads to an entire mountainside of c4. 
8	That’s not an ISTP problem. That’s a you problem that can be solved with mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acceptance of the world.
2	All my life and it's never brought about anything good.  I had to teach myself how to be less reactive, which meant stopping and thinking about both the situation and my knee jerk response for a minute.  Yeah, some anger is healthy but a short fuse is decidedly egocentric.  
2	yep, definitely. I've been told that I am hot-headed.\n\nI guess it depends on the situation. In some cases I am able to control my anger and not let it get to me. It is a lot easier to go over the issue later and figure it out once you've calmed down. However, many times I get irritated pretty fast and the fact that I'm not afraid to speak my mind doesn't make it easier. I've definitely said things that I shouldn't have and ended up regretting it later. \n\nI try to be more aware of my actions and how these actions affect other people around me and not act prematurely but I guess it's a work in process...
2	I'm fairly patient, though I do a lot of internal screaming when annoyed. Anyhow, I have an extremely low tolerance for incompetence, both in myself and others, and any demonstration of incompetence without implied or direct statement of a desire to improve competence is the easiest way to make me hate your fucking guts. 
1	i'm usually very calm and don't respond emotionally in arguments, but when i do get angry i'm pretty much completely controlled by my anger
1	I liken it to going super saiyan where I transform and after all my ki is depleted I revert to my base form. So it takes awhile to build up but when it happens it’s explosive but only for a short duration.
1	It takes a lot to get me to an expressive anger stage.  A lot.  I usually just disengage.  But if it happens- cold seething precise delivery happens. I'm not a fan. \nI am 99% successful in intercepting it. 
1	Do not do anything when you are angry. Walk away, put on the mildest expression as much as possible and put it aside. Then go to your safe space (internet, people you trust, journal, etc) and vent the hell out of it. Then confront the people involved if it is worth the trouble after you calmed down and solve that shit out. This last part very rarely happen to me though because after I vent I forget all about it usually.
5	I have a question about ISTPs and inferior Fe dom Ti and social norms.	Would inferior Fe and dom Ti in ISTPs and maby INTPs, lead to alot of trouble with people in relationships and in different groups, like work,school,church, and maby stores etc? Every where i go it seems like people like me because of my Se maby,and think im cool but im always bumping heads with people subtly though! And i dnt hear about it directly because maby there scared i dnt know but i hear it from others, or i can just tell from how people act but i dnt really know exactly ehat im doing wrong. And with relationships and dating im wondering if women find it unattractive that i dnt adhear to social norms maby? And im just not noticing them. 
8	Women find stupidity and laziness unattractive.  I'm not saying you're stupid or lazy, but if your writing is any indication, you probably come across that way. \n\nAt least learn how to put forth a coherent thought and pay attention to spelling and grammar. Shorthand isn't appreciated unless you're talking to your buddies. \n\nNow what exactly do you mean by social norms?  Because anything beyond being polite and saying please and thank you and using your manners when eating is wildly subjective and has nothing to do with being introverted. 
5	are you on bars or just hate spelling? maybe you're dumb and that's why you can't get along with people very well. introverted thinking is not a bad trait to have, although people who have it as a dominant function tend to be more independent and not fit in with the majority as much as Te or Fe types, Ti has many positives. inferior Fe isn't a bad thing either, it just means it's your least developed and least conscious function, not that you're bad at feeling. lots of women are attracted to istps, that's one of the reasons action movies are popular with women too. personally, when i engage people they usually like me, not that there's many people i want to talk to. there has to be something other than your personality type that's causing an issue, cause there's nothing wrong with istps any more than any other mbti type
4	I think he’s referring to people being attracted to Se, but put off by Ti as we can be blunt and inadvertently upset people because of it. \n\nI know that some are put off by my bluntness but some people like it as we don’t BS or beat around the bush. We also don’t have a thin skin and while some may initially be put off by it they learn that I mean well and either accept it or don’t.
2	I know what you're talking about about and yeah p much All your suspicions and worries are valid. Not knowing how to get along with and understand other people WILL fuck you over very badly in every aspect of your life, dating, personal, work and more. That's weak Fe.
4	How do you think ISTP and iNFP individuals can relate to each other?	I'm probably an INFP. I am visiting random subreddits (via the random link).
7	My best friend is an INFP. She has hauled and saved me from a lot of emotional devastations I wasn't even aware I was in. 
8	I’m an INFP who’s been in a relationship with an ISTP for over three years. We definitely “relate” to one another, especially when it comes to values, morals, and ethics. How we approach those values is different. Having a general respect for one another lends itself well to being able to relate on some level, regardless of topic.\n\nEdit: a letter
7	I have a person I am willing to call a friend who is an INFP if that means anything
3	Well, there is one INFP I know and I can’t a conversation with her without her getting sensitive and offended every 2 minutes 
1	i've met a few infps and never liked them, not like they were bad people but i don't really feel like i could connect with them. i know a few infjs and isfps and i like them, probably because we share se and ni. obviously your type isn't everything but i don't think istps and infps are compatible for the most part. we share nothing in common, you guys have Fi, Ne, Si, Te; istps have Ti, Se, Ni, Fe
1	I’m not in love with NFs. More thin skinned and sensitive than I care for. 
11	Qnyone else find it hard to type fellow istps?	As an istp I find it hard to type other istps, because I just like assume they are different by comparing them to myself, but later on after someone else types them I see the similarities and know without a doubt they are also istp. Another else?
11	Yes it is pretty hard. There is a girl I think she is an ISTP, but she refuses to pass the personality test. Also ISTPs I met are extremely closed, it seems they hate new things. At the same time it seems they constantly look for new things, it is really contradictory about ISTPs. 
14	Probably because typing people is stupid. You don’t know what goes on in their head. Only they do. I could be typed several different ways depending on who you ask. But when I type myself based on my true nature, I’m ISTP. \n\n\nSpend less time caring about someone’s type and more time getting to know them as a unique individual without labels. 
3	No. I don’t assume other ISTPs will be that much like me (in interests, hobbies, career, etc). I notice it in their behaviors and how they present themselves. That said, i find some types much easier to spot than others; ISTP is not an easy one to figure out quickly imo.
4	Typing is hard because you don't know how to do it. It's very easy to type Ti doms because they are argumentative and opinionated, especially if they are not very mature. Go read [Psychological Types](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm) cause if you can't type someone then you lack understanding.
1	Same, also I'm biased, only cool kids allowed
1	I act far more like an INTP in school (poking holes in someone's argument is the most fun part of a debate), and have typed as both ISTP and INTP through various tests (and on the same ones, too). If you simply met me on the street and struck up a conversation that I am interested in, you'd probably be more likely to type me as an INTP. However, I have a strong appreciation for the physical, and am decently outdoorsy. I am also decently musical. While mine is probably more of a fringe case, the truth is, people have 3 faces, according to an old Japanese saying, and I do believe it. The face that people show to a stranger is vastly different from the one they show to their close family and friends, and even further from the person that only oneself can know. 
1	Well I usually get istp but i have gotten intp here and there i could relate to both but definitely more of an istp
26	SELF IMPROVEMENT GENERAL	No self-improvement thread? Let's change that.  \n\n\nWhat do you guys think about self-improvement? Is it just a meme or sth more than that?  \nLet's discuss how ISTPs go about improving their lives.  \n What are the areas where you struggle with and want to improve? Addictions, Impulsivity, procrastination, don't know how to turn off the auto-pilot? Have you tried anything which helped to get your life back on track? Nofap, Motivational videos, scientific explanations for the areas you're lacking in, idgaf? What have you tried? What has worked? What hasn't?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/jftqe3cilpd21.jpg
27	I have huge procrastination issue.\n\nNeed to update my skills and finish/begin a project before searching for new work? It can wait - let's research silversmithing tools, order a dozen new books, watch every documentary on ancient megastructures, research fasting, set running goals, make my own bnw development fluid, clean house for fifth week straight, sharpen all knives, watch 12 hours or Zizek lectures, research Chinese chef knives, make a picture frame, carve a chicken out of old pallet wood, I bet the stellaris update is great, clean Firefox bookmarks, reorganize photos, weed out minimalist wardrobe - you got the idea.\n\nDiscipline is extremely important but it suffers a lot when you snap out of another existential crisis. Now I'm setting tracking apps to see where my time goes, allocate only 30 minutes for social media, place dates on the calendar for my project. Great Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said - your mind is painted on the colour of your thoughts. Use your resources well. Make a plan. Limit distractions.
18	You could stop correcting people when what they say is only 92% accurate.  \n
9	I had huge self-esteem and social anxiety issues. It helped a lot to watch some TED talks. I'll give the link if someone wants.\n\nEdit : https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en\n\nhttps://www.woujo.com/blog/2017/8/9/how-to-have-fun-and-be-an-interesting-person\n\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve/up-next?language=en\n\nAlso read the book  "Subtle art of not giving a fuck"
8	The focus feature on this [app](https://tide.moreless.io/en/) has been a lifesaver(uses the Pomodoro technique), I struggle to stay focused on one task and it's kinda embarrassing how much this has helped me.\n\nSomehow, just putting some headphones on, turning the timer on, and some nature sounds just helps me instantly focus. Feels kinda like magic sometimes lol.
6	Stopped smoking pot and drinking in December and I find I am able to be productive naturally now, where it used to be a struggle for many years. If I see something that needs fixing around the house I just do it and enjoy it. \n\n\n\nVia Negativa "Addition by subtraction" -  Subtract the bad parts of your life (drugs, alcohol, fap/porn) and the good will come naturally. \n\n\n\nOther than that I enjoy gathering information from audio books while I work with my hands. The information just flows in.
13	I was getting tired of how messy and unorganized my life was getting so I just spent 8 hours cleaning my entire apartment. I freaking ironed my clothes for God sake I hope this sticks. 
4	[deleted]
2	lately i’ve been journaling and reading about psychology to develop my Fe. i got sick of getting stuck in the same bad relationship patterns and eroding my mental health because i was afraid to really explore my emotions. it’s scary and uncomfy at times... like the permanence of writing down how i feel in a particular moment makes me so uneasy, and sometimes i end up relaying what happened in the situation instead of writing about how i FEEL, which kind of defeats the purpose. totally worth it, though. i’ve found that i have better control over my emotions but in a healthy way. i don’t suppress or dismiss them because they’re irrational. i give myself the time and space to feel what i feel, without judgment (which is still difficult sometimes). i don’t lash out at others as much, i’m kinder to myself and others and more empathetic, i tell people how i honestly feel even when i think it’s irrational, and i’m getting better at reading others and trusting my gut.
1	Well self-improvement isn't really a meme, the term implies that you will be improving yourself, which can only be a good thing.  \nWell the problem with the ISTP is that their ego is primarily concerned with introverted thinking and extraverted sensing, so it would be important to develop our feeling and intuition functions. So put simply, we need to stop listening to what our ego wants us to do, and stop: being argumentative dicks, stop putting other people before us, stop being such airheads and be more creative. If you can do that then you have successfully integrated the shadow into your psyche and will become a much more mature individual.
1	Thanks man I appreciate it. Do you have anything for finding a job in your career field? 
1	Social issues as fuck. Learned communication through self study, acting, and it rocked my world. Now im hot as hell. 
1	I focus on self comfort and living at my own pace. Being in touch with my own comfort zone actually helps me to improve. I used to procrastinate a lot because I enjoy watching netflix and youtube. But in reality, when I am doing that I am also stressed and highly uncomfortable. So I try to make small changes, like setting up my deadline one day earlier than the original in my mind. I also acknowledge that I like long breaks (because life is to be lived with loads of self indulgence!) so I start a day earlier than I would. It takes time but it has been rewarding so now I procrastinate less. I still have the tendencies though, so I still satisfy that by procrastinating less important things.\n\nI also punish myself less and less for not being perfect. Why do I need to do it? Who is it for? Do I really care? If I don't really care and nobody is hurt I take my liberty to be efficient and spend more time on having fun. I am also shifting my comfort zone from stress (from overthinking) to having exciting and varied experiences. This way I actually perform better at my job and study.\n\nI take very long social breaks now, that way I can improve my energy levels when I meet my friends and share a good experience with them. I have been off social media for a while and cut out toxic people. That way I have been having more genuine and positive interactions with the few friends I keep.\n\nI continue focusing on showing respect to others. I struggle a lot to keep up being nice and caring because I just can't with the emotional burden. But I try to make that up by respecting people no matter how insensible I think they are. It is rational and it works better for me than focusing on being 'nice' and 'friendly'. it helps to build good rapport with others which helps when I say no a lot on social interaction and responsibilities.\n\nOverall I try to focus on rational thinking to seize my liberty to live as I want by apologising less about what I do differently. It is not always easy socially, but it has been very inwardly rewarding.
5	Created a subreddit for SPs	I think there about 20-30 of us SPs who regularly comment on mbti related subs, so I created a new sub for us.  \n\nPlease subscribe to  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArtisans/ \n
4	Right on.  I like it.
1	Sub! Great idea :) 
24	Relationship advise for me ISTP.	ISTP male here. 23yo. decent looking lad always get attention from chicks don't know how to capitalize on that. (Can get along with people but can sometimes be too insensitive/impulsive and am capable of being a social autist from time to time)\n\nI've never had a proper gf but have had a few flings in college which did not end well for me. I caved into the idea of having a FWB without thinking it through. Later on, realized that it's not for me and that I needed a commitment/sincerity on the girls part to be satisfied and ended up abruptly breaking up with her over a fucking text message when she wasn't expecting it at all.\n\nFast forward 2 years. Still, don't have a girl and tbh I didn't care to have one. But something changed for me and now I kind of crave female company but don't know how to form long-lasting relationships with girls. \n\n  \n Does anyone else have a similar life experience? How do I deal with this? How was your experience with a FWB relationship, if any?\n\n 
19	Yo \n\n1/ good on you for caring about this. It’s good to develop that softer side\n\n\n2/ I can relate to this even though I’m a different type. I would say what an older friend said to me though - have you had a look at your social life? Do you have meaningful friendships? One guy to another, it’s always good to have some brotinis (shaken not stirred). Plus, if you’re “happily single,” your chances of attracting a good mate are higher IMO.\n\n3/ If you’re in Australia DM me I could use a good looking wingman to be the bait when we go fishing 😂
6	We want what we don't have, right? That's human. I mean, not *just* human, but human regardless.\n\nOh, I've been drinking. Fair warning.\n\n23's better an age than most to try out a long-term relationship. The thing about things is that to be good at them, you need practice. Or you can both agree to be bad at them and endure, and that works for a whole bunch of people, but do better. \n\nI'm not saying to force a long-term relationship or anything, and I'm not someone who's experienced in being "a decent looking lad always get[ting] attention from checks", but I am 28 and have had one 3-yr relationship, one 4-yr, and one short-term FWB over the years. From each, I've learned important things that will (i desperately hope) help me and my SO in whatever relationship comes next.\n\nIn particular, I've learned things that I'm bad at and need to work on, and I've learned about things that I don't want to deal with in a relationship - red flags.\n\nNow, where am I going with this? Good question. I'm not sure. I think it's that if you are subliminally scared of getting into a long-term relatifonship, remember that every relationship is something to learn from. \n\nAs for FWB, as I mentioned I've done it once and, as mentioned, I'm not really the rooster in the henhouse, but still it worked - especially because we both knew she was moving to another state within a month. Having a terminal date really helps with the "not developing feelings" bit - although again, not sure if there's a takeaway there, other than "try to find girls who are leaving the area". I got the distinct impression that she was more experienced in the "fling" department than I was (see above: not the biggest cock in the coop).\n\nOh, and don't break up over text message.\n\ntldr: read /u/Joego8989's message instead, it's great.
5	No idea. Older female ISTP here. But good luck! 
9	FWB can be okay for a bit but ultimately someone either catches feelings or gets jealous. \n\nI am the same way as you, I feel totally fine being by myself and then all of a sudden I want company. \n\nThe key for me in prolonging a relationship is being patient. Sometimes when you start something new and are in a position where your craving that company, you come off too eager without realizing. I have had the most success when setting dates and otherwise staying off the phone. Also, I usually date multiple people at a time so I am not focusing on one girl and being let down when she isn't as enthused about the relationship as I am. This in turn keeps you busy and keeps her wondering what you are up to. \n\nI think the most important thing to do socially when out with a girl is to ask questions. Ask a lot of questions. People like talking about themselves and feel a closeness to the person they open up to. I generally start with a topic and then ask specific questions within that topic about their experience. Kind of dig deeper. You will be using a lot of Ni/Fe here but this doesn't need to be continued throughout the relationship, just the beginning. The deeper you go, the more topics will arise so it will be easier to keep the convo going. Also, drinking alcohol helps a ton.\n\nCorey Wayne on youtube has a lot of good info on how to behave with chicks socially and I think he provides the best content I have come across. 
1	I'm also 23 and I've been in your shoes before. I had two proper gfs which lasted a year each and would've probably lasted more if one of the parts didn't move away. Nothing beats emotional intimacy and truly passionate sex.\n\nAfter these, I jumped from FWB to FWB until I met my actual gf and we stuck together.\n\nIf you don't feel emotional connection don't waste time about it and move on. You don't get in a relationship expecting it to last a long time.\n\n I had a FWB which started off with great potential until I discovered more about her personality and life goals. I cared about her but not enough. \n\nThe only way to have an honest and fulfilling relationship is to put yourself out there and open up. People will hurt you. You will have feelings which won't be reciprocated. But when you find someone that you're truly intimate with (and I'm not talking about sex) it's freaking incredible.
1	Go out and look for the girl. You can see this as a problem that needs to be solved and do it methodically. Move on fast when a relationship does not work for you, because that means you are getting closer to the person that will work better. As long as you are fair and respectful, it shouldn't be too much trouble. It is a long process and labour intensive, especially on the emotional part. Take breaks whenever you need it and remember to explain yourself from time to time because even though you know your own mind inside out, the other person doesn't. If you want sincerity from the girl you need to also put the work in including caring about her emotional well-being. Good luck!
13	My type is ISTP, but id like some more examples of how Ti actually helps Se in the real world. Basically like a better understanding of how Ti works, and analyzes and takes thing apart logically i guess in the real world.	
12	My SO is istp.  In our life it's usually just him enjoying himself or fixing things.  When we got our house I was the one to do the research and give him a list of options I thought he'd like.  I didn't pick the finished, brand new, cookie cutter houses.  I picked ones that had a good foundation, had the essentials, but needed some work.  He hasn't been bored since, and he enjoys it thoroughly.  He will always have situations in which he's identifying problems, making it better with his own two hands (especially at a moment's notice, without making a fuss) and having the satisfaction of seeing good results while learning something new.  While you'd think everyone has the capacity for this, most people just don't have the desire or motivation for it.  People may never attempt such things due to fear of failure, or lack of discipline to work through the stress, or lack of ability to handle the inevitable surprise problems as they come.  Often, people will opt for an easier way out like paying someone else to do it.  While there is a whole sub of impressive DIY house projects, compare that to the number of people who won't pick up a hammer, and you'll find the DIYers are actually quite the minority.\n\nSometimes it's hard to imagine that abilities that come so natural for you is no average joe ability that everyone else is just as adept at.  Now let's compare this to the esfp.  My brother is an esfp and while he has energy and motivation in spades due to shared high Se, his reasons and reasoning is something else due to the pairing of it with Fi.  He's not interested in fixing or working with objects.  Ironically, that high Se makes him especially impatient when it comes to these things even if he enjoys dipping his toes in it once in a blue moon.  The result in just not instant enough for him, but he has a huge interest and tenacity for people instead.  The amount of effort he puts into trying to fix people makes my istp stressed out just thinking about it.
8	I'm kind of new to the Ti and Se processes, but I think this one may be an example but maybe not?\n\nWhen I'm driving somewhere, especially in an area that I know, I'm thinking ahead by three steps. My mind is watching the traffic, the lights up ahead, and I'm plotting out my path. If I know that I need to turn left in two intersections, but the traffic seems a little heavy and obviously turning left in heavy traffic can be problematic, I'll instantly pick an alternate route that doesn't require turning left at intersection A, because I know turning right then going straight at intersection B is going to be easier.\n\nThis does cause issues when I'm the passenger and when my boyfriend (ESFP) is driving. At the beginning he took me directing him as a slight against his driving, when it wasn't at all. And I suppose in a lot of those instances, shaving off two seconds is not a big deal, but for me at that time it is. I'm all about that work smarter, not harder life
5	I'm sort of newer to functional stacks and I'm not entirely convinced I'm ISTP yet, but examples like the one below are starting to win me over.\n\nSo we got a new printer at work, and it was my responsibility to set it up. Cool. The assembly and initial start up - easy peasy. But now I have to connect it to the wifi/wireless system. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE INTERNET WORKS. Is this thing wireless? Where is the router? What's an IP address? I start googling this stuff like mad, IM the manufacturer support line, flipping through the owner's manual. As I'm gathering all of this information I'm building "the system" in my head. Literally trying to picture the internet with all of the "wifi tubes" connecting all of the computers to the router, the router to printer. I end up with just enough knowledge about the internet to get the thing to work, well enough anyway. Through a bit of trial and error and according to the "system" schematic I built in my head, you just had to be on the guest network, which was fine printing from the computers but not from your phones. \n\nSo as I'm trying to explain how to connect to the printer to one of my co-workers who clearly understands the internet better than I do, he says something along the lines of "we don't need to be on the guest network *something something I didn't understand bla bla bla* the IP address changes all the time". \n\nWait what? \n\nSo after all that I still have no idea how the internet works despite being able to fix it "gud 'nough".
2	I work with data analysis, and often I analyze an entire business. All departments, processes, etc. (All this is SE trying to understand how things works as it is)\nwhen I think I gathered enough understanding of how things works, Ti kicks in, and start thinking how I can improve, or is possible to drop something that is not working...\n\nSometimes people get impressive how creative I come up to so solve a problem....but the truth is I just took sometime to understand how each piece is connected, and I find unbelievable how rare is to find people like us in the market...\n 
1	I'll wait with you.
1	Yea i do that same stuff when im driving lol what type are you? And yea Se Fi prob isnt the best for driving ?
1	I see what you mean,i can see that as one example that requires Ti and Se, but i meant more like how Ti Se would for instance help someone take a tv apart!
1	we're good at driving, hands on work, building something practical (nothing innovative for the most part), video games, etc. all things that require both se and ti. sensing is much less conscious than ti for istps; we're always in our heads and thinking about something (if you see him looking into the distance with a blank expression, he's using ti). an example of one of my examples is hands on work; i use se to see what needs to be done, and ti to think of how to do it best
175	makes sense to me	
22	Yup
15	So this happened to me a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, one guy kept on insisting and one of the other girls, whom I unfortunately kinda have a crush on, was really worried... I relented to meeting up at a bar to talk about it and honestly, I barely feel any better.\n\nI absolutely hate emotions and developing feelings for someone.
11	NANI?!!
20	Friends? 
12	Solution: make ExFJ friends who will relentlessly pry your problems from your cold dead hands.
15	This is a personal attack. 
5	More like I open up and they don't help me
2	Patrick, that is a legitimate question.
1	This doesn’t really fit with that meme at all. It makes sense, it’s supposed to be completely contradictory. 
1	i don't think the issue is that i don't think they want to be bothered, it's that i enjoy solving my problems independently and don't wish to seek help
1	That's where you're wrong, kiddo. Can't open up to friends, even if you have any, if you don't recognize the problems yourself and deny their existence. 
0	Seems more of a symptom of depression than a nature of ISTP..... 
8	Do you guys like people?	I go through phases of hating people, then being somewhat ok with them lol.\n\nHow about you guys?
25	The majority of people are disappointing.
10	I prefer to think of them as homunculi. At least until proven otherwise. It keeps me sane.
9	Yes?\n\nFor the most part, most people are like me. And like you. It's the differences that stand out, like the people who pause too long at stop signs or support the US president.\n\nI can't imagine myself painting with such a broad brush as to say that I "hate people". If I ever do, personally I'll see that as a sign that I need to examine my own psyche and not that of humanity's.
6	They’re mostly just in the way.
6	Like some, hate some, most are just people neither good or bad.
4	People. What a bunch of bastards.
3	Depends on the people I'm around and what they do. Overall I'd say I'm indifferent, where I would honestly prefer to spend time alone doing what I want to do instead of gambling on whether or not I'll have a good time.
1	I wouldn't go as far as to say I hate people. I just find the majority of them annoying. 
1	all the time
1	yes, i enjoy being around other people almost always. i only like a very limited number of them, but i still enjoy interactions with the general population (even if i dislike them entirely)
1	[deleted]
1	Most people are overly loud and boisterous at my age, but there is the rare specimen of a thoughtful person who shares interests with me. Unfortunately, I have yet to find someone who is both somewhat outdoorsy and philosophical. 
1	Ok I got some really good responses for my really un-detailed question! I'd have to thank you guys
1	I know why you think the way you do, and I'd agree if it wasn't for the fact I'm so disinterested in the lives of others.\n\nIndividually people are mostly ok, I guess. The overwhelming majority are boring, vacuous and avaricious, but relatively harmless. However, taken as a whole, humans are a plague. Large numbers of them can cause quite significant problems.
1	I'm mostly indifferent. I love my friends and family, but have few friends and distant family sooo... \n\nI hate almost everyone when they're behind the wheel of a car, at least in this city. 
7	ISTP parents?	“I'm not really into kids. I don't connect with them emotionally. It's not really important for me to have kids. If I had them some day - OK, if not - OK too.”\n\nDid you bond with your kid right away? Do you feel an emotional connection with them? Anything you want to share etc..
11	Actually yeah. I didn't think I'd bond with my kids either but there's something about holding a version of you that you're ultimately responsible for that makes you feel something. It's pretty incredible. 
9	I love kids. I remember when I was a kid and I was frustrated with adults I would think to myself "When I'm a grown up, I'll remember what it's like to be a kid!" and somehow that stuck with me. 
10	My oldest and youngest - I don't really have a connection.  Never did. \n\nI bonded instantly with my 2nd.\n\nWhile I never had that bond with my oldest and youngest I am the best Mother I can ever be with them.  I don't ignore them or overlook them.  Just that emotional bond isn't there.  I don't feel it.\n
5	I love parenting.  It's tough, but great.\nMy biggest issue is that my 10 year old is an extrovert.  She loves other people.  She wants to BRING other people INTO my house.\n\nIck.
3	I don't care for kids in general.  However- i'll give my life, my breath for my own. That connection probably developed while i was carrying him, even before he was born. \nHaving said that- i never imagined wanting many kids.  Raising a child was a hard,  never stopping emotional and physical labor. I don't have large reserves when it comes to emotional energy. But i wouldn't change it for the world. 
3	I love being a parent. I’m sure at suck at some aspects, but I’m really into it. I’m lucky to have a super responsible INTJ partner, so I can check out whenever I need to and don’t have to worry. 
2	I have a deep connection with my ESTJ daughter.  My ENFJ son is much harder for me to “get”.
1	Your kid is different, close relatives like niece and nephews are okay, not really a fan of the rest. 
4	Most and least annoying extrovert in your opinion	Most: ESFJ\n\nLeast: ESTP, ENTJ\n
13	how is this useful?
3	Kristen Stewart 
3	Most: ESFP (by a long shot)
1	i like estps and entps\n\nenfjs are okay\n\ni find esfjs annoying\n\ni dislike esfps
1	Least:\nENTP\nENTJ\nProbably ESTJ\nMost:\nESFJ\nESFP
1	Most: ENTP, ESFP, ENFP\n\nLeast: ESTP
123	Spot on	
20	Holy shit. Yes. I actually deactivated my Facebook a few weeks ago and really started getting into Reddit. I feel exactly like this. 
14	True. Reddit is the first (and up until this month the only) social media that I voluntarily signed on to.
8	Word, can stay anonymous and say whatever the fuck u want, and no pics
3	I completely agree, I used to use Facebook to look at memes and so. Since I started using Reddit, I haven’t opened Facebook as much.
3	Nothing wrong with being introverted 👍🏻
6	Why is this a fucking image?
1	I'll one-up that. Even having a username is hassle on occasion. I spend the vast majority of my dicking-around-time online on 4chan. I could never even kind of get into Facebook or Instagram, they're repulsive to me.
3	Is there a difference between when men and women use cognitive functions, or if their the same mbti type ?	
9	I don't know if there's ever been any studies of that and I'm sure there is some difference based on socialization such as women needing to develop Fe at a younger age than men to be more accepted. The only other thing I would think is that men are more likely to do risky activities because the part of their brain that says "you"ll die if you do this" develops at a later age than in women. So that said, women and men might engage Se differently especially in younger ages but I don't think there's that big of a difference otherwise.
2	There is no way to empirical test this, only "theory."\n\n8 Function Models such as John Beebe, Linda Berens, Socionics, etc say that we all use the same 8 Functions but where they are in the hierarchy modifies how we use the 8 different things.  \n\nFurthermore which of the 4 functions we "value" modifies how we use the 4 functions we "subdue."  What I just said in the previous sentence can be said another way.  Your MBTI type is your four functions that you value, and then the organization of those four functions.  While also your MBTI type is telling you which of the 4 functions you "subdue" aka keep in shadow.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote though your 8 cognitive functions are not the entirety of your personality, it is just an aspect of your personality in how you take in information and how you try to organize the information in a meta-cognitive sense.  That said lots of other things matter with your personality and temperament and these things can be stuff like life experience, stuff like your startle reflex, so on and so on with over 400 different traits we have measured we often consider personality / temperament based and MBTI only tries to examine a small corner of those things.  In fact those other aspects of personality / temperament are often far easier to test for, and are often have high replicability with test / retest months later, and even years later.\n\nYet those things may not be the most important things to figure out, easy to measure does not mean it is the most useful thing to understand.  One is looking for the details of the tree and one is trying to understand how forests are formed and create a very large naturalistic system with dozens of feedback loops.  All these personality things do have some value but you have to understand what you are searching for.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn sum according to theory \n\n* ^1 gender / biological sex is not going to modify how you use the 8 cognitive functions.  But your MBTI type will change how you use the 8 cognitive functions.\n\n* ^2 gender / biological sex will modify under personality / temperament measures.  But how much of this is biology and how much of this is a social construct?  As the famous saying goes.  One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.  But I personally prefer this version.  http://existentialcomics.com/comic/139
1	So basically what your saying lmao is the worlds complex and just take people as they come 
1	Yes, men use it to do all sorts of stuff, women use it to determine which pair of shoes go with which purse.      
4	How aesthetically weighted are ISTPs?	A lot of ISTP responses from previous posts have specified that you guys generally high prioritise physical attraction to your SO as an important factor in your relationships.\n\nI am in a relationship with an ISTP and I am feeling slightly self conscious because we are going on a beach holiday next week, and I have a lot of (bad) cellulite on my legs that will be glaringly obvious on the beach. \n\nI am not overweight, generally fit and healthy, just have been dealt an unlucky hand in terms of a Donatella- Versace level of cellulite. \n\nHonestly, my SO and I have a great relationship otherwise, but he has never seen this before and I’m wondering if it’s kinda a deal breaker for you guys? (He really does generally appreciate beautiful things and has a rocking body himself). \n\nThank you for reading!
24	I mean. Aesthetics play a role, no doubt. I couldn’t imagine sleeping with somebody I don’t find attractive. Well, correction, I couldn’t imagine sleeping with somebody I don’t find attractive continuously for long periods of time. \n\n\nHowever, there has to be a balance. I’ll take a 6 with a perfectly meshing personality that gets me and loves me over a 9 that’s stuck up and narcissistic any day of the week. \n\n\nI don’t require a girl to be smoking hot to “qualify” for my lovin, I just need to be attracted to her. 
19	I wouldn't give a fuck. If he does then he is probably immature.\n\nI care more that my SO puts in at least some effort to look attractive more than I care about any less desirable physical attributes.
7	i definitely wouldn’t think twice about it. you already said the most important thing, which is that you are generally fit and take care of yourself. my SO has really long, skinny legs with a tiny little butt at the top. i noticed it when we first hooked up and thought it was odd/funny, but now that we’ve been together about a year i find it absolutely hot and somehow adorable at the same time. lol. he’s awesome. 
7	Son’t think most would care. Also, hasn’t he seen you naked before? If so, I’d have zero worries. 
6	ISTPs do care about the looks, but if we go beyond mbti, men mostly don't give a single fuck about cellulites. It's women who shame themselves and each other over it. 
5	You're fine. If it turns out you're not ill give you your money back
7	I wanted to type some words to give you confidence. \n\nBut then I remembered that time I got disinterested in a gf because i saw pictures of her as a kid being really fat.\n\nProbably not ISTP related and I’m just an asshole tho. \n\nHappy holidays 🌴
3	I put in a lot of effort into looking good so I would want a fit partner as well. Doesn't mean I'm shallow I value all a good fit in all the other psychological compartments as well...which is probably why I'm single 🙃
3	My money is on you're making this way more of an issue than he will. He probably won't notice or won't care.
3	i think it's sweet that you'd think this is a problem but don't be ridiculous. regardless of personality, men like seeing women they're attracted to (which he is, physical attraction is required to be interested in a relationship with someone, especially for guys) in bikinis.
3	You’re in your own head. If you are in a longterm relationship with him, he find you physically attractive. Has he seen you naked? You don’t have to answer. But, odds are, he has noticed your “imperfections” and just never said anything (because why would you?). \n\nMy wife is sexy. Maybe not a 10 by Hollywood magazine standards, but she is hot to me. She has cellulite (she actually explained to me what cellulite really is and how you cannot get rid of it, might be worth doing to your guy, cause I didn’t know that), I still thinks she sexy. When she eats healthy and goes to the gym, I about lose my mind with sexual attraction and desire. \n\nThe point is, you are doing everything right (you take care of yourself). If your guy has a problem with cellulite, he is dumb. Explain to him what cellulite is and how simply exercising doesn’t make it go away. If he still has a problem, then that’s his problem and he should go date a photoshopped picture. \n\nI’ve got stretch marks on my thighs from growth spurts. They look nasty as hell to me. Nothing I can do about them, no matter how toned I make my legs. My wife has never once said anything, but I know she’s noticed them. We’ve all got shit. A good partner is accepting when they need to be. 
3	If he likes you enough to ask you out then you have nothing to worry about. I once dated this girl who isn’t what I normally go for. She was actually surprised I asked for her number but she had a cool personality and she was pretty in the face. I honestly wouldn’t stress about it.
2	I wouldn't worry.  He wouldn't be with you if he didn't find you attractive.  Besides, I doubt they're saying 'only stereotypical models for me' when they say physical attraction is important.  They're often times just pointing out the obvious like, of course they need to find you physically attractive to develop any interest whatsoever.  Mainly that means valuing your body and maintaining it like a healthy person, not sitting on the couch all the time getting greasy eating junk food and gaining weight.
2	if you're really worried about the cellulite, try a coffee scrub !
2	He will probably care more if you make a big deal out of it than the actual cellulite itself. 
1	aesthetics is a small part of the whole experience. are you enjoying yourself? are you guys having fun? are you living in the moment? are you comfortable with your own sexuality and with his sexuality? are you cherishing the fact that you are on a holiday on the beach filled with sunshine, the blue waters and the gleaming sands with him? if yes to any of these, cellulite or no cellulite doesn't really matter.\n\non a side note, if cellulite jeopardises the relationship for him that is probably not a good sign.
70	Solo road trips are the best	I needed to get out of my town today. So I picked 6 cities to drive to, rolled some dice, and got Baltimore. So I drove there, ate crabs, explored the city, and had a fucking blast!\n\nJust pick a city and start driving
24	i do similar stuff sometimes when i have a day off. i don't even choose a destination town/city though. usually just drive randomly in any direction and come back home in 4-6 hours. so many neat places. \n
16	Even better on two wheels.
7	I had a job for four years driving up and down the East Coast solo. NY to Annapolis and back, NY to NH and back. NY to Boston and back. Best job I ever had in terms of happiness. Pay was shit though. 
7	I left for breakfast once and was gone for 4 days. Every time I got to a fork in the road I took the “long cut” as I call them. Went from Phoenix to Payson to Winslow to Holbrook and then back. Taking as many non highways as I could. It all started because the Denny’s was busy. So I went looking for another and next thing I knew I was driving across The Bloody Basin road to I-17. Instead of going left and heading back to town I went right. When I got to Camp Verde I got a cheap motel room. The next day instead of heading back I took the General Crook Trail to Payson and had lunch. I saw snow up on the rim so I drove up to check it out, well it was only 50 miles or so to Winslow so why not. I was almost to town when I got the idea to surprise my sister over near Holbrook, only 40 miles from Winslow. Well it turned out to be 80 miles east of Holbrook to her house. I spent a day or  two  with her and my Grandma before I realized I told my roommate I would only be gone an hour or two. So I headed home to Phoenix. One f my best adventures ever and it was only me and a bunch of random music,. \n\n
6	SOUNDS like a fucking blast indeed, will do.
6	Lemme just get in the car for 5 hours so I can eat worse food in Dallas.  woo! lol\n\nYou totally take your city-proximity for granted.
3	I once took a random trip to LA. I had no plans at all, took my time and had a great time. I have an Army friend who lives in Long Beach so I visited him for a bit.
3	Love solo traveling.  Drove through Utah a couple of years ago.  Took my time, explored Zion, Bryce, Arches and took every scenic road that called my name.  Priceless! 
2	just like Monopoly
2	Damn next time you roll up Bmore hit me up
2	I hope you went to Maxs.
2	I drove 26 hours across country. Several people tried to fly out and meet me to help me. I told them all to fuck off. I haven’t been so happy in years as I was driving alone with my thoughts. Far away from work, family, and responsibilities. 
2	You need to get yourself a motorcycle. Even with 1-2 friends that can be fun as you are still sort of on your own when you are riding.
1	Ahh to have that kind of freedom...
1	idk that sounds terrible imo lol. 
1	Always wanted to do this. Not sure why I can't (INTP here)
191	When an ISTP has feelings	
22	Dude, yeah. I totally laughed at that.
17	That's exactly my reaction whenever I notice I'm feeling/caring about something a bit more than I was supposed to lol
7	Do you guys ever experience that these feelings are too intense? How do you handle them? 
4	Yuh
3	I don’t understand why it is so hard for you guys to handle them haha
2	Yeah, i can totally relate to this.
14	I found out im istp as fuck	I read some articles on intp and i kinda saw myself fitting into some of the aspects but not really but i thought it wasnt perfect i was part intp part other. Then i actually took the test for myself and i am istp as fuck. Everything. Down to my like secret impulsivity. My level head no matter what. My like difficulty with emotions and expressing them. Im finally home. 😭😭😭
48	Welcome home. None of us really care. Continue on with your regularly scheduled programing. 
14	secret impulsivity? we're supposed to keep that secret? I'm pretty proud of mine and show it off to anybody who will listen
4	Same for me, figured it out last week. \nThe thing i don’t get is, it is not really rare to be an ISTP yet I dont know any. 
7	ISTP males’ dream/perfect woman qualities?	I just love learning about ISTP’s, I’m always super attracted to them and I love to find out what turns ISTPs on or what they value. Obviously not going to change myself about it, but genuinely curious as to what qualities are looked for, both physical and non-physical in an ISTP male’s ideal lady. \n\n\nEDIT: It appears that physical attraction, authenticity, independence, smarts, confidence, adventurousness and a good sense of humour are the key traits that you guys look for in a SO. Thank you to all for answering!
29	- Physical attraction is a must\n\n- A good sense of humor\n\n- Being independent yet liking to be together\n\n- Open-mindedness and willing to try new things\n\n- Similar hobbies to enjoy together\n\n- Mutual trust and respect of boundaries\n\nThat's the idea at least.
13	authenticity is the most important thing. anything fake is a deal breaker for me. I honestly don't care about "flaws", I'd rather see them than have her hide them, because that's disingenuous to me. Trying to be someone who you aren't in any regard is annoying. \n\nSelf confidence is sexy. Dumbing herself down is a huge turn off. If you're smart, flaunt it. I guess you could say I'm a bit like Ron Swanson in that regard. Confident, intelligent, powerful women are sexy, as long as they're not mean spirited.\n\nI don't think I could say any specific physical features are better than others because you really can't control your features (generally), so it's kinda stupid to say "oh I like this but not this, so I can only be interested in this person over this person". \n\nThis is all of course, a double edged sword. I value a person for who they are, authentically. But if who they are, authentically, is someone I'm not attracted to, well then, it honestly can't be changed. 
12	Too easy:\n\n- Be hot\n- Be smart\n- Be confident\n- Don't be an Instagram hoe.\n- Don't be clingy
22	Not dumb
7	I want someone who i can share anything with \nSomeone super jokey goofy and silly\nNot overly emotional or angry\nSomeone interested in learning new things \nSomeone interested in pushing me to become the best man i can be and not being afraid to be pushed to be the best woman you can be \nAnalytical \nAnd most importantly confident. Idc how you look if you sound sure and confident you are so sexy
4	authenticity, honesty, a sense of humor, adventurous, daredevil, but also not too clingy because that shit scares me off quick lmfao\n\nessentially, as long as the person is chill, gives me my space, and doesnt try to schedule out my life, ill probably get along with them well
3	kind is the top of my list.
2	Has a dick
3	It's not a shopping list.\n\n  \n\n\nPassionate about life is enough
1	Confident\n\nSensual\n\nPlays along with my over-the-top lame jokes\n\nNot loud\n\nNo tattoos
1	gotta be different than the 99%, i like the artsy type. pretty heavy on the physical attraction, though the *mainstream* hot is not my type of hot, for me it means they're dumb. if bich be bending over to look at her ass, that's unattractive already
1	Thick skin. Kind of an asshole but has a kind heart. Open to adventure and wants to be outdoors. Positive and more social than me (I.e. extroverted). No codependency. 
1	Just a question, but what type are you?  
1	It's not a shopping list.\n\n  \n\n\nPassionate about life is enough
1	Must be very attractive (to me). My ‘type’ seems to be: Heart shaped face, blonde or brown hair, blue or green eyes, porcelain white skin, skinny, kinda androgynous. \n\nHeadstrong, able to argue her opinions without just expressing her feelings and shutting down conversation when she’s disagreed with.\n\nActive. Likes doing things that are physical, even if it’s something I’m not actually interested in. \n\n
4	Question about ISTPs and bordem	Do any of you ISTPs get bored easy due to Se maby? And by bored i mean like i get bored at work or out with friends or visiting people if there just talking and not doing certain fun things or we arnt in fun enviroments or crazy situations ? When im at home i dnt that hard of a time not getting bored and keeping my self occupied though with video games music and shows.
25	If you are that bored, why aren't you taking this time to learn how to spell?\n\nI don't have time to get bored when I'm practicing whatever it is i am doing. 
5	Yea man I get myself in trouble at work if I don’t stay busy
5	I'm bored when I am to do things that I don't want to do. I like it when my Se is engaged. That makes me unbored. But when it's not engaged and I'm left alone with no inputs, and I'm not particularly busy with anything, I'm bored. Like, I like going out with friends. They always keep my Se engaged. Or I engage my Se when I'm with them. When I'm alone at home, even after a couple of hours of video games, I get bored. Because it becomes mundane. It's like my Fe seeks social interaction. It's weird. And I've just turned 18.\n\nEdit: and usually when I'm bored, I get REALLY bored. And boring and sorta depressed if it's prolonged. Like I got nothing to do.  So it's always important to keep Se engaged, whether it's in work or anything worth spending time on.
3	I get bored when I know that I could be doing something more fun than whatever I’m doing at the moment.
3	Almost always bored, gotta be doing something all the time but don't have much to do. Need to start working out more when I'm bored. Wouldn't mind a job with more hours, but businesses here are stupid and expect a high school kid to work from 4-10 or 11 regularly. I'm good. \n\n&#x200B;
3	I got bored three times in the time it took me to get to writing this. Always so bored.
2	I get bored when there’s too much talking  especially small talk that either isn’t going anywhere or isn’t exciting. I will casually excuse myself and do something else.
1	I know what you mean were do you work and how old are you ?
27	istp female - how to I become nicer/more social????	So basically, I'm an ISTP female who is trying to make friends.\n\nHere's the situation: I've moved into a flat with 2 boys and 2 girls, however only one girl really likes me (I'd say very extroverted, open and conciously friendly) but the boys dont engage with me and the other girl doesn't address me either.\n\nNaturally, I make friends with women better than men, but either way it's usually specific female personalities that I've encountered before that I make friends with and know how to talk to & build a friendship with. With men, it's a barren land (Except for the 1 or 2 in different social groups).\n\nTo my flatmates, I come across very opinionated, strong minded, and they have joked about me (they didn't know I heard) as dry, reserved and uninterested, as well as having "no-friends" and "extremely intellectual". They never invite me to things, or go out of their way to knock on my door- and the boys (who have an extended friendship group of about 10 other boys) always stand up straight when I walk past, or don't address me or make small talk. It's almost like they're scared or something, but I've tried to request them on Facebook (half of them have added everyone else but me) or make small-talk back when I see them (to show I'm friendly, still don't get invited anywhere though). I don't like all of them but still... ANyway....\n\nI feel like being the ISTP I am really plays into why they think this, I'm reserved and don't speak to people unless I want to and do stay in my room sometimes, don't party, don't drink, I dont eat meat and am lactose intolerant so I can't share food with them... But I'm looking for advice on how to seem nicer to people without breaching my principles. Like, I can be nice without telling them about my private life, right? Any advice will help, I can clarify if needs be...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSateriasis
18	>go out of their way to knock on my door\n\nLeave the door open, in my experience with living with people is the door closed means do not disturb.
13	My advice on how to seem nicer:\n\nDon't seem nicer. It's fake. Be yourself.\n\nPeople with our personality type tend to be strong personalities in social settings. The fact that these people aren't willing to engage you to your face tells me that, first of all, they're not people you should associate with, and second of all that they either don't know themselves or are scared to project themselves.\n\nEmbrace your strong personality. I don't know how old you are but I'm 30 and at this point in my life if I sense a problem with somebody I walk right up to them and address it. I think you should do the same. Talk to them in a way that demands answers - ask their opinion on things. "Ya know, I've thought about this, what do you think?" Shit like that. Your personality allows you to lead the conversation when you want to.\n\nSo my advice is to not be "nice" first of all because it's not one of your strengths and second because it's usually a fake facade anyway. ISTPs present themselves as they are, and if somebody doesn't like it then that's their problem because I'm perfectly comfortable sitting in a room with somebody who doesn't like me. I like myself and that's what matters. It takes me a very long time to make new friends and I'm perfectly fine with that.
8	Don’t be nice, nice is superficial bullshit. Be kind. Work on loving everyone as they love themselves which means you need to love yourself the way you would want someone else to. Start with yourself first, be the kind of person you would want in your life. Take responsibility for your friends and show them you want them in your life.
9	Congratulations on your desire to grow as a person!\n\n1/ get more ENFP friends, we are cool and also considered one of the nicest / most social types. It will rub off on you (I hang out with a lot of ISTPs because I wanted to learn to be more independent, chill and efficient like you guys) \n2/ don’t bother with people who can’t be bothered with you (your flatmates). Your flatmates sound childish... not that trying to bring this up w them is a good idea
5	In your place I wouldn't bother. Being social is a high maintenance activity. Just stick with the people who accept you for who you are and let the others think/believe whatever they want.
6	The way I usually see ISTPs bond with people is by engaging in physical activities together (not just sex, but also sport and dangerous stunts)
4	Honestly, it seems like you made the effort and they're ignoring you. If you tried to have small talk and friend them it shows your making an effort and it's on them to accept it. You can try to invite them to an event or something and try to spend more time in the general area, maybe talk to the one female that is friendly and have her invite during the next group outing but it seems like this is really your roommates not wanting to get to know you.
3	They probably think you want to be left alone. If you're really introverted and need your alone time, they may have misunderstood you.\n\nMost of my friends I've won through doing activities and things I enjoy doing. I suck at small talk and I'm not even that great at having flowing conversations, but give me a hobby or objective and people flock towards me.
3	I have lived in an international commune of 30 people.\n\nAs much as I like my privacy I left my door open for everybody. I also organized small food sharing evenings when 5-6 people pool money to prepare dinner. Later I exchanged my mechanic/it skills for food and services. I really went out of my way teach, help and be useful. I made many great friends at the time, I usually was the only one with tools and skills to use them. Just being friendly and available goes a long way
2	When you stop caring about what people think about you on a MACRO scale life gets a whole lot simpler. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't beat around the bush. My advice, do with it what you may, is to not associate with people who are drama heavy and find people who naturally understand you. You should still continue to improve yourself by becoming more social if that's one of your goals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I think you should change your perspective. Instead of being *nice* (which imply all these social niceties) start being Kind. For me that really changes my perspective from trying to please everybody (which is IMPOSSIBLE) to treating everyone fairly.
2	Don't fake it. They don't sound all that nice themselves (joking about you behind your back, not making small talk even though you do), are you sure you want to be friends with them? Being reserved is not always a bad thing, sometimes it's a great filter to keep incompatible people away.
1	Trust me, give it some time. I had the same issue when i was in the army. It will take time, a lot of people feel that we ISTPs are mysterious and reserved, so they really don't know how to act around us. I'm pretty certain that they actually might admire/respect to such an extent that they don't know how to deal with you, since they fear they aren't good enough for this person(you in this case). My recommendation is to one day just randomly to chat to one of the guys you don't get along with, and this will create a domino effect, and the other one will want to get to know you, since he will feel left out.
1	Since you are focused on what you can do, I am going to list a few things off the bat.\n\nIf you normally just pass by them all the time without acknowledging them, you will give off an impression that you do not want to engage with them. \n\n-	when you enter the flat or go out of your room, cooking something in a kitchen, etc and you bump into one of them, say “hey” and greet with a smile. You can even ask how their day was, if your feeling up for it. \n-	a smile and greeting can go a long way.\n\nYou seem reserved and although you are being “yourself”, is it your best self? You said you initiated small talk, but what kind of impression did you give off? Did it seem like you were genuinely interested in what they had to say? Or are you just responding back for the sake of small talk? We tend to treat others differently based on social context. \n\n-	Example 1. My friend is softer with middle school girls because she was a Sunday school teacher. She would smile much more and respond to what they say with enthusiasm. When I said that’s a cute puppy, she would go “oh.”  When a middle school girl did that, she would go “yeah that’s really cute!” Maybe she is nicer to them because the girls are cute, young and sensitive. But I would also appreciate that response, just saying.\n-	Example 2. Another friend of my mine was telling me how her date went. When her date said he went snowboarding, she told me her initial thoughts were ‘why is he telling me this and I hate snowboarding.’ She said he was boring. I asked her how she would have responded if that was her boss, she said she would reply with enthusiasm and ask how the trip went. 😒 I am sure her date felt the lacl of interest from her. \n-	Try to visualize someone you would be more open to engage with and are more responsive to. Gather that energy and give some to your flatmates lol. \n\n\nYou do not have to fake anything or approach people with vigor. But when you do engage, your mindset matters. It’s okay to be awkward or feel awkward, what matters now is that you desire to engage and that you follow through.\n\nHope this helps OP. Good luck.\n
2	Are ISTPs jealous people?	ISTPs appear very laid back and cool, and very “no-fuss”. Just wondering, when you really care about/love your SO, do you become jealous at all? For example about your SO’s exes, them being friends with opposite (or same in homosexual relationships) sex. If so, is the jealousy something that just twings at you occasionally, or could it be a strong and powerful kind? \n\nI ask this question out of curiosity, as I’m in a relationship with and ISTP and I’m getting jealous about his past, and he seems totally cool with mine. (He has told me he loves me and we have a good relationship). \n\nThank y’all in advance! 
32	In relationships I get jealous but I keep it to myself and I’m pretty good at hiding it. I wouldn’t be surprised if most istps were the same way
6	yeah i get jealous sometimes but it's not to the point of being problematic. if their partner count or current relationship with an ex or whatever is an issue for me then i just won't (continue to) date them
6	The older I am the less I care.  I refuse to waste time and energy on jealousy.
4	Jealous feeling? Maybe, but I treat feelings as an “input.” — I see it as a sign of a lack of confidence, saying “I may not be good enough, and may lose the other person,” and hence the feeling. Rather than being frustrated or trying to control the other person’s choices, I would put effort in bettering myself, to become the best version of me. I value everyone’s autonomy, so I reject the notion of “owning” another person and refuse to be possessive. Who the other person chooses to be is ultimately out of my control — at least I do the best I can.
3	When I was younger, probably, but now that I'm older, I just don't give a crap. If my SO does something behind my back and doesn't want to be with me, then I'll just move on. I have zero interest in being with someone who doesn't want to be with me.\n\nHowever, if you want to drive him crazy, keep getting jealous. It's going to come off as controlling and that **IS** going to piss off your ISTP. You won't have an ISTP much longer if you can't get it in check. He's with you, now, because he wants to be. Just go with that.
2	I get that feeling but I immediately try to reason myself and ignore the feeling. But I twinge and it makes me irritable (not sure if noticeable cause I always look angry anyway) if mentioned and/or see the interaction in front of my eyes. Most of the the time, I forget the feeling and not dwell on it too much in my spare time
2	I can be if my self of steam is low.
26	Misinterpreting Emotion	Does other ISTPs experience that some people are frequently attempting to attach emotions to you, the majority of which you hardly relate to at all? How do I present myself better in social settings as to not get misinterpreted? 
13	Like people think you're being really intense when you're just doing your thing?  Or think you're mad when you're not?  Idk, man.  Some of it's simple self awareness and some of it you can't help.  I worked with a gal who thought I was on edge 24/7 and I could not convince her otherwise.  The fact is, not everyone is going to know how to receive your energy and you're going to need to make peace with that... It's part of what makes us, us.
9	what emotions are people attaching to you? people will either tell me i look like a robot with no emotions or that i get aggressive easily. i’m not sure if that’s the experience you’re looking to relate to though
3	Yes. It took my wife a long time to realize she cannot trust my face lol. 
2	i know when they try, i reject
2	I have the misfortune of having contracted chronic RBF syndrome at the age of 11. Generally IDGAF if people attach emotions to me, as it drives away those who would probably annoy me with their constant chatting. 
1	For the most part I have one expression and I think people who don’t know me think I’m always sad or depressed or tired when in reality I’m usually happy or just don’t care at the moment. Also people who do know like family or friends also have no clue how I actually feel they just learn I’m not sad all the time lol
8	Im a ISTP and im wondering if theres a huge difference in Se with ESTPs and ISTPs	I know that obviously ESTPs have stronger Se than ISTPs, but since thats a ISTPs first perception function would ISTPs see the world as vivid and be as in the moment as ESTPs? Or would it be toned down and kinda foggy if thats the right word like how a INTJ or ENTJs Se would be? 
6	both types are very perceptive and in the moment, more so than any other types other than esfp/isfp. the difference is esxps have se as their primary function, and isxps have se as their auxillary function. istp's dominant mental process at any given time is most likely ti and is usually supported by se. estps use their perception of the world around them more than any other function, supported by ti. the main difference between the primary and auxillary function, other than how strong of a force the function is on your overall psyche, is that the secondary function is mostly subconscious. istps mostly take everything in without thinking about it, whereas estps consciously sense their environment. istps are consciously in their own head most of the time; estps also use ti but it's more of an automatic process and not as deep
2	Pretty much what the above poster stated. We use it but it’s more of a behind the scenes type of thing as in we generally use it consciously. \n\nBoth types search for or have Se related activities and hobbies. ESTPs are more prone to seek Se than ISTPs are generally are involved in group activities. ISTPs can be found in these as well but typically seek individual Se activities.
13	How to duel with emotional people?	I am a 20yr old female istp, this is a long post and English is not my first language so bear with me:)\n\nI am currently sharing a living room with a very emotional roommate. She reacts very emotionally to trivial things like whining because of a rain. She tends to over reacts to sudden sounds, she will have a little shout if she drops anything on the floor.\n\n She is always so moody. I get that bottling up your emotions is not a good thing but just throwing it all out and let the emotions getting into your head does not make things better. I am starting to get disgusted by her reactions.\n\nThere is one time when the washing machine ate up 10 quarters, she came back like a child throwing a tantrum. She screamed and yelled and banged the door. Then she screamed"I've never used such an angry voice in my life before!" \nI knew it was not a good timing (my mistake in handling emotional people) but I told her to calm down and that we can simply call the management company to fix this. Of course that did not responded well. She told me not to talk to her for the entire day cuz she thought I'm "angry". \n\n\nSide note: Although I don't know her type, she has a strong preference for Si. She will hate on some things due to negative emotions on one specific experience. (Food, music and people) And to me this mindset is ridiculous. \n\nI know this might be one specific case but I would love to know how to duel with emotional people in general. I need to live with her till the end of August so I really want us to get along well. I'm not sure if her emotions are within the "normal" range or is just me that is on the extreme end of emotional resistance. \n\nThanks for reading it up to here, I want to show you guys the full picture as I need some advice from like minded people.
18	I’m almost 15 years older than you and still don’t have a good answer for you. \n\nIf anyone **does** have an answer, I’d love to hear about it as well. 
11	I find it best to let them just emote. I will walk away if I have to because advice is almost always unwanted by emotional types. \n\nBTW your English is excellent. It was very easy to understand!
11	I find the best way to deal with emotional people is to validate their emotions as real using your Fe and talk to them, ask them what you can do to not make them mad in the future then actually try not to piss them off, but most importantly try to creat a “aura” of peace and calm around yourself and treat them how you would a toddler having a temper tantrum, she probably just has very high trait neuroticism(she feels negative emotion very strongly) such as an Fi dom or auxiliary type would. These emotions are what guide them through life because wether it be nature or nurture that’s who they are. You can’t change them, you can try and love them for who they are as they love themselves and then you learn to just laugh it off. \n\nOr move out. That works too.
3	Depends. Emotional people usually don't expect pragmatism.\n\nIf it's pistols at dawn then memorize where their aides are standing then as you're walking the ten steps, turn at step 5, shoot the aides first so they couldn't react then shoot the opponent. \n\nIf it's swords then fake an injury. They might let their guard down which is when you stab them. (Or you can take a page from Dr. Jones' book and just shoot them. Don't forget to shoot their aides too! It's only dishonorable if there are witnesses; your aides can always claim that the opponent's aides were about to shoot you.)
3	When dueling with emotional people, I find it best to use their emotions against them. 
3	We istps naturally try to fix problems.\n\nEmotional people come to us with their petty problems (usually of their own making) and our natural instinct is to tell them how to fix the problem.\n\nThey don’t want us to fix their problems. They need problems in their lives so that they can receive emotional support. It doesn’t matter if they are the hero or the victim, they need drama in their lives.\n\nBy advising them how to fix the problem we can actually be perceived as uncaring or cold because emotional people don’t want their problems fixed. If they do want their problems fixed they want to drone on and on about how other people need to change, not what they can do to fix the problem.\n\nKeep them out of your life. If you can’t just nod and agree that they are either a hero or victim.
2	she probably has some kind of mental disorder that makes it difficult for her to regulate emotions. cyclothymia or another form of bipolar, histrionic personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder come to mind. histrionics have a pathological need to be at the center of attention, someone with cyclothymia is usually in an elevated state (hypomania) or in a depressed state. bpd is characterized by low self worth, intense mood swings with no regular pattern, a difficulty trusting people and maintaining relationships, often feeling empty and alone, and making impulsive and irrational decisions (including self harm and destructive behavior). i know a lot about how to deal with borderline personality disorder from growing up with my sister. the best thing to do is talk to them, hear them out and try to truly understand their feelings, and if you can, help them calm down and see things logically. basically just accept their emotions, you can try to reason with them but it's very difficult and is a learned process. talk therapy is, in my opinion, the only way for borderline patients to get better. that wasn't really your question and i could be misjudging the situation, but your description of her doesn't sound like a mentally healthy, albeit emotional, person. in general though it's a similar process, letting them release their emotions and accepting how they feel. i'm still not great at emotional support but listening and validating their feelings usually works
1	It sounds to me like she needs another emotional type to sympathize with and validate her.  If I were you, I'd get out of there.  
1	idk, comes naturally, it's always a fun battle, any XXFX feel free to argue it up
1	I would change my expectation and not expect her to ever change. The only way to handle this is to change how you react to her. It is probably helpful to create a distance by appearing to be busy with other things. Also don't reward bad behaviour with a confirmation. It won't be possible to just ignore her of course, but try to limit your interaction as much as possible. Probably go out and study/work in the library or something. Sucks I know, since you pay rent but it is better than going crazy. Hope you find a more suitable roommate next time.
1	My advice is that you don't. She sounds highly immature and toxic. Completely abnormal and unjustified reactions signal either mental illness or disorder (she should be seeing a psychologist basically), and your best bet is to distance yourself.\n\nValidation may work ("that sucks"), but really, why pacify a child tantrum? She is an energy drain and there will never be anything you can say to "fix" the situation. 
3	Is being an ISTP common or more rare?	I don’t know too much about the Meyers Briggs types yet, or which ones are most popular. \nI was curious to know about if this one is very common? \n\nCurious because I usually feel so different from a lot of people, and sometimes struggle making actual friends. This isn’t to say I find it hard to talk to people, I’m really friendly and can be outgoing, have plenty of acquaintances, and a good amount of people I’m close to. But since moving to a new city, I find making girl friends super hard! I’ve been on Bumble BFF to make plutonic girl friends and it’s so hard being the only one asking questions to get to know people,  and just making connections in person beyond small talk. \n\nAlso, does anyone know if this type is more common among men or women? Are there a a lot of girl ISTPs out there? 
13	Slightly rarer than average.\n\n[Type distribution by gender](https://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation-Males-Females.cfm)\n\n[Type distribution in the total population](https://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation.cfm)\n\n100/16 = 6.25, so generally speaking ISTPs are slightly rare. By gender though, male ISTPs are fairly common while female ISTPs are approaching unicorn status.
5	Pretty rare in women but not the rarest.
5	Moderate rarity among men, pretty rare in women. 
6	The statistics people use are unreliable and biased. From personal experience(and I think that types are more or less evenly distributed) ISTPs are less common than most types
3	¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
2	Thank you for the links! That’s exactly what I was curious about. 
1	You could have found your answer faster with a quick google search than the time it took you to type that.
5	Have any of y’all ever been in an on&off relationship? what’s your attitude towards then?	My relationship with an infp is somewhat like this, and it’s mostly due to my fear of commitment. We are in an off-period [(im pretty sure he would take me back¿ and it’d only be the second (and last) off-period]\n\ni rlly care about him and if i decide not to enter the relationship again it’ll be because i don’t want to hurt him like i have.\n\nI suppose most istp’s would have no trouble walking away or at least that’s my impression
3	Nope. Can’t stand on off. If I break up with someone, it’s over. I could see myself taking a “break” if I ever had issues with an SO. But it would be explicitly stated that we’re taking time to think through our situation and reevaluate our relationship. It wouldn’t be breaking up and then getting back together. \n\n\nIn my opinion, a relationship either works or it doesn’t. Getting back together once is one thing. But continually goin on off on off on off seems like a massive waste of time and emotional energy. 
1	I had an an off with an ENFP a long ago. When we were together we were great but over time we would get sick of each other. I’m guessing it’s the Ti Se vs Fi Ne combo of not really understanding where the other is coming from.\n\nNowadays I won’t put myself through such turmoil and prefer to end it if it’s not going to work out.
1	From what I've read online, an on-off relationship between ENFPs and ISTPs isn't unusual. INFPs are close enough to ENFPs so I'm not surprised that you have this going. 
9	Do any of you ISTPs find it easier to learn hands on stuff from multiple examples and is that a Se thing ?	
12	Yes, but unless you're an expert on the subject don't argue with my way of interpreting the task unless you want some digits removed 😚
11	It drives me crazy when someone documents something but doesn't give an example. Like a programming function or something. I don't care what the documentation says about it, show me an example or two and I have it. On to the next one.
8	Yes. As of late it's been board games that make me notice this. I say "give me the goal of the game, give me how a turn goes, and let's go". I'll figure the rest out through actual gameplay (multiple examples); this usually results in a loss the first time but the second I've got it and am raring to go.
5	Yes to both. 
1	Yea I prefer to get a general idea of what I’m doing and then just dive in as I will learn as I go.
9	ISTPs and using Se in relationships and dating instead of Fe	Im a ISTP guy and im wondering would it makes more sense for ISTPs to use Se to connect to a person their dating or like or are in a relationship with, instead of FE, and just do physical activities together instead of talking and all the emotional stuff? Because Se is our closest extroverted function and we have more control over it then Fe which is our weakest ?
12	I think so. I'm a female INTP dating a male ISTP so the inferior Fe is strong. We spend a lot of time together just doing different random things (laser tag, bowling, etc) or sitting at home playing video games. We never really talk about our relationship or the future. But if there's a problem between us usually one of us brings it up...eventually....and we come up with a solution and resolve it fairly quickly and diplomatically. \nThe downside is that sometimes communicating our needs in the relationship is difficult. But we both recognize that and have been working to do better about it.
7	That would be nice.  But I think women in general value talking and emotional stuff regardless of type. So probably can’t skip that part. 
4	The way I understand my mind is I wired all the functions as a three phase system where fe won’t be used without Se or Ni all the while being controlled by Ti and it seems to be working also seems to stop my Ti-Ni  loops because Ni can’t be used without Se or Fe. Idk if that made any sense.
5	In order to develop feelings ( of any kind, for anyone) i need to get to know them- through doing stuff together, spending time, observing them, experiencing them.  My feelings more often than not expressed through doing, spending time with etc and generally not in a verbal manner.  \n
1	Is that a response to my post or what i said above ?
1	Thankx i thought that made sense when i thought about it that way
15	Why do most ISTPs hate Math?	I’ve seen that many ISTPs dislike math, but of course not all of them hate it.\n\nEdit: I see that many here actually like it. Mainly when it’s applicable to the real world. 
50	For me at least, I hate math when it’s not applicable to anything and we’re just memorizing formulas for the sake of memorizing formulas. \n\nThroughout high school I absolutely hated math, especially calculus, but when I got to college and started taking statistic courses that paired well with my interest in Economics, my perception of math changed. 
21	Most ISTPs hate the structured environment that comes along with learning math but I think those of us who do care about academics find it very doable.\n\nI like math but mostly just bc I'm good at it and I like anything that comes easy to me. 
17	I am an example of ISTP which do like math. Few of my ISTP friends prefer math and scientific subjects comparing to learning languages.
10	Math is a great subject when it’s applicable to the real world. Can’t say I’ve ever needed to use the Pythagorean theorem to solve anything. Have needed to figure out what something is going to cost after figuring taxes and APR. 
10	I’m ISTP and I fucking love math. My entire degree path revolves around it lol. 
8	My only problem with math is that it's super boring and tedious, specifically talking about calculus though. Derivatives, integrals, sure I can do them but I don't enjoy them, I don't feel I've accomplished much when I solve them. I don't necessarily hate math though, I'm just not particularly fond of it.
7	It's too abstract. I prefer problem solving physical things and using my intuition and gut feeling about what a solution would be. When it's just symbols on a piece of paper and there's only 1 right answer, it's way too abstract. \n\nThere's no room for improvising which is what ISTPs do best.
5	The only thing I don’t like about match is when a teacher makes you do it in one specific way, even though there is better and more efficient ways
6	Wut? It's pure logic, it's the best subject aside from music (which is really just fancy math)
3	I don't hate math. I hate rote for rote's sake. After I got out of highschool, where I abandoned math because although I was great at it, it was taught in driest way possible, by a guy who considered himself very funny and wasn't, I began to realize how much application it has and how fun it is to use- almost to the level of an artform. I also began to realize that guy was a pretty cool human being, but not the teacher for me. Woe is me though that that sidetracked my STEM career in college and the next decade. Fuck.
3	I've loved math and numbers since I was a toddler playing with the TV remote.  I learned to count by sixes before I could talk clearly and it freaked people out.
3	I don't hate it, I'm just bad at it.
2	It doesn't happen in my head and makes zero sense past simple arithmetic. Calculus makes no sense to me at all. I need a calculator to do any math I didn't memorize. I don't see math in my head at all. I think just see mostly shapes or thoughts with no visual representation.
2	I love math. Math is magic that predicts and allows one to control the future.
2	I always liked Math and still do. 
2	Um i love math and science. 
2	I am brilliant at mental math. I have a thing for phone numbers as well. But when it comes to calculus or anything involving formula’s I’m screwed. I did excellent until about grade 9 and then hardly passed after that. I think it’s because I need to see a practical use for it before I deem it worthy of my time to learn it. 
1	I don't personally hate math. WHEN I was taking math, I found it kind of satisfying to get the right answer, then I took a year off and totally lost all my higher level math skills I had grown. I didn't go back after that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking that when I problem solve, I don't like being constricted. when doing math, there may only be one "right" way to solve something, so I can see that as a negative. 
1	I find it interesting in a way, but I have a hard time wrapping my head around the calculus concepts as it’s very abstract. Also it has no relevance in my day to day life.
1	Math is beneath me and my high intellect. (Jk)
1	Math isn't bad. It's extremely useful, and is applicable in a wide range of high paying fields. Personally, anything up to \~Algebra 2 level is decently enjoyable, and anything past that is somewhat tedious and stuff I'm probably never going to use realistically, aside from maybe calculus. My interest is in science, and math is very close to science, but there are massive differences between the two. To me, math is a prerequisite and conductive to my career rather than the primary basis. 
1	In college I would pick physics over math easily. Now I do economics, there is a lot of graphs and calculus, I cannot say I like it, more like I do not bother with.
1	I really like math.  I don't like physics.  Most people that don't like math never had a teacher that could captivate them with it.  Not very many people know how to engage students with math because it doesn't have a story with it.  It's just numbers.
1	I love math
1	There are a few "types" of math that I see. The type that I did in school was just a bunch of useless formulas that I knew I was never going to apply in the real world. Whenever I completed a math problem, I didn't feel accomplished. I just felt like I wasted a bunch of time on something that I didn't need to do. I was just forced to memorize this kind of stuff so I could get a good grade on my tests.\n\nThe math I enjoy is if I'm actually working with something tangible. Stuff like measurements in woodworking or figuring out things like distance feels much more useful. Whenever I solve what I'm actually trying to fix while using math, I feel *much* more satisfied and accomplished. It feels real to me compared to a bunch of numbered strung along in a textbook.
1	I was always good at math, but just never got jazzed about doing math. It's boring. 
1	I hated math until I became an apprentice electrician and math was actually applicable to my job and life and now I love it. 
1	I actually really like math, but that's cause my Ti is much more prominent than Se, so sometimes I behave more like an INTP especially when it comes to academics
1	lmao im a high school senior looking to major in applied mathematics. I don’t enjoy working with theoretical stuff, but i think that’s due to my experience with it in my physics class.
1	The repetition and structure of learning and math and languages in particular frustrates me to no end. Meanwhile I spent years training to fly planes, but that’s obviously a practical application and hands-on.
1	I love math i love numbers and how they work together i hate memorizing formulas that mean nothing to me besides the right answer on homework 
1	I don't hate math, but i confess that i don't like it that much, i've always liked science much more.
1	In my case, the abstract explanations don't make sense quickly enough to be enjoyable. In lectures I would inevitably tune out rather than listen, and in textbook learning it's frustrating to keep working at figuring out the formulas and getting at it the wrong way. I work very sloppily and cannot describe things elegantly, so there's not much beauty in doing it. \n\nWhen I can do the math it's an okay way to pass time with pen and paper, and I'll sometimes calculate or make algorithims for things that I reckon I could, and it seems kind of ridiculous when I think about the effort put into it.
1	I am not the only one. Good to know. 
18	Istp career advice	I am extremely logical, and efficient in my work. I never stop until I finish what I started and I like risky activities such as motorcycles \n\nI despise math, and dont want to be a mechanic or engineer \n\nAny advice would help! 
11	I did construction for several years. It was very fulfilling. 
10	I'm 25 now and when I was 18 I started a mechanical engineering course at university before dropping out half way through the 2nd year. I liked machines and thought it would be the logical thing to do, I struggled with imagining how the sheer amount of theory could be applied in a physical sense - which led me to becoming extremely bored.\n\nI learned quickly that whatever I was doing had to be something in the physical world with tangible results to be fulfilling and to stop me from becoming overly-bored. \n\nI was always interested in aviation as a hobby and pursued a career there, I've been an Air Traffic Controller for 3 years now. \n\nLong story short - follow what you're interested in and don't be pressured into doing something that you know in your gut you don't want to be doing.
7	I work as a research assistant at a university, but my job description is pretty much miscellaneous. Usually that just means keeping the lab running, stocked, and efficient, but I also have the pleasure of fixing all the "oh shit, it just broke!" moments so INTPs can continue to INTP with minimal interruption. This gives me the flexibility to make my own schedule and choose my own projects, but also prevents me from working myself into a repetitive rut.
7	You'll find the right job for you eventually. As you keep swimming in lots of offers (or the lack of it) remember to follow the money, especially when in doubt.. that's logical (and practical) enough.
5	I'm an investigator which allows me to fully exercise my strong sense of logic and problem solving. My job allows me to constantly think outside the box and come to conclusions as how someone or something got from point A to B.
3	Fabrication is pretty satifying
5	Become a geothermal dartist gyroscoper
3	Follow your heart, bro.
3	Software developer. Build fun stuff, very little math. 
2	I've been struggling with my career path for the last few years. I'm currently working in construction as a Project Coordinator and I'm also a Ski Instructor part time. I live in the mountains and love skiing and photography. However, I'm considering either moving into aviation or the air force. I need more hands on, task based work.\n\nSpeak to people in industries you're interested in. Try get some work experience. Speak to a careers counsellor and take some of those personality tests that align you with certain professions.
2	Just do what you like
1	Swamped on a picker truck lots when I was out of high school and really enjoyed that. Was going to go get my lift ticket (40 ton crane ticket) and class one drivers license, but then i got a job offer to be an oilfield battery operator. I really enjoy it now as well and I’ve been doing it for 5 years(I’m 24). \nIs the oilfield an option?  If not I always thought power lineman or electrician would be cool. 
1	I'm a screen printer in a very specialized field. It is rewarding and allows my brain to do a lot of problem solving.
1	Depends what side of it you get into. The production side is always steady. Maintenance truck is a good one, you might enjoy. Or look into battery operating. It’s shift work and guaranteed hours. 
1	I was a materials scientist for years.  Boring as hell.  Made the move to be a professional skydiver.  It was a blast but I found I like money too much to pursue that.  Now I'm a professional firefighter and I'm perfectly happy and fulfilled.  The job is a ton of fun, I love my coworkers, the schedule is amazing and the pay is actually pretty damn good (at least in my city).  And I'll get a pension after 20 years.  Can't beat that.
1	My fallback has always been a Fireman.
1	Military! It was fun, I got paid well and got to see the world. 
1	[deleted]
1	Ask your self if the current expectations of society fit you? Maybe you need to break the law, maybe you need to live an extremely different life. I don't know but you do.
1	Drafting is what I currently do. I just recently got into it so I have yet to see any projects I've worked on constructed, but when I do I believe it'll feel great. Also, there's not too much math involved, as most of the actual math is done by the engineer who approves the plans for permitting. Logical thinking is definitely required for drawing something like elevations, because you have to be able to imagine you're own 2d drawings in a 3d space. 
1	be a owner-operator truck driver, if i fail out somehow, that's my next career path
2	ISTPs in Los Angeles	Any of you guys living in Los Angeles? If so, what do you like or dislike about it? It seems like the abundance of action sports at your disposal would be great for an ISTP (especially one stuck in a particularly harsh Ti-Ni loop ahemmm). Do you like the culture? I know a lot of people complain about how fake everyone is, but it seems like that's usually people who don't live there and that it's not too hard to steer clear of that if you're looking in the right places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Looking specifically at DTLA. When I say sports I am referring to things like mountain biking, dirt biking, hiking, etc, not team sports.
9	I grew up in SoCal about 65 miles away from LA, then went there for school, then worked there for a few years. Then moved to NYC for a job transfer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings I hated:\n\nPeople can be fake. Depending on which part of LA, you'll notice people flashing their money (usually in the form of expensive cars) and act like they're the hottest stuff. It can be hard to meet new people sometimes if you're not proactive, especially with the superficiality. And the traffic sucks up your time but that's a given, you learn to try to avoid peak driving hours if your schedule allows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings I loved:\n\nI loved my school. Love the beaches. Love how the people there, despite the fakeness, are actually driven to succeed in life (again, you'll see this with more prevalence depending on which part of LA you go to). LOVE THE SPORTS (Lakers, Kings, school team, etc.). Love the huge diversity in cultures from one area to the next. Love how to this day I can still explore a new area of LA and find something new. And in my opinion the foods in LA are better than anywhere else I've been once you find the best restaurants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're willing to be proactive and get out of your comfort zone to pursue what interests you, you can find a lot of great things and meet a lot of cool people in LA. Just ignore the superficial people, find some good friends, do the things you enjoy, and you'll love it there.
5	I live in Detroit but one of my best friends live in LA so I'm there at least once a year to visit him. I really can't stand LA and wish he'd move somewhere else.
3	Born and raised in LA county. I don't bother going into the city much, but one of my favorite things about LA is the diversity. You can drive 30 minutes in either direction and be in a completely different culture. Go to Hollywood and you can surround yourself in homeless people, tourists, transplants, clout chasers, movie stars. Go towards the valley and you'll either meet super rich white people or incredibly poor Latinos. Go towards the south... wrong hood homie! Mexican food, Korean food, Indian food, Filipino food, whatever you want, it's here but your girl still won't be able to decide.\n\nThere's always something to do. At least 20 different concerts going on a day. DIY punk scene, indie rock jams, metal dive bars, hiphop night club, EDM warehouse rave, soundcloud rap release. There's movie screenings, bar crawls, nightclubs, conventions, workshops, so on and so forth. Tons of subcultures for you to find your crowd.\n\nThere's also many things I don't like (besides traffic and rent, that's a given). People aren't outwardly nice and if they are, they're trying to get something from you. People are pretty superficial, how they treat you depends on how you look. Dating is on another league here, beautiful women but they regularly get hit on the world's best pickup artists. A lot of guys like to put on a tough act and try to size you up with aggressive banter.\n\nOverall I like it, but it's very dependent on what neighborhood you live in.
6	LA is gross and crowded.Don't like sports.
6	I'm an ISTP, I don't live in LA, but I visited once and I absolutely hated it. I mean I love California in general, but Los Angeles proper was a barrage on my senses I'm not keen on revisiting. No grass, nothing but asphalt and concrete, and literally "stuff" everywhere. Not only everywhere, but double and triple levels of everywhere.\n\nGet a little South like San Pedro or Sunset Beach, now we're talking!
2	I visited LA a couple years ago.  Hands down it was the worst place I have ever been.  Some highlights: the weather was atrocious.  80s and 90s in early April?  No thanks.  The traffic.  There's a persistent brown haze hanging over the city and a fine layer of soot on everything and everyone in my group developed a cough after a couple days there.  It's overcrowded AF.  The traffic, seriously.  \n \nOne day there I took my kids through the crowds at Santa Monica Pier.  They were hungry and asked for corn dogs so I obliged.  They were sitting, quietly enjoying them, minding their own business when some random bitch got in my face and angrily asked "how the FUCK can you feed your kids MEAT!?"\n \nAnother day I was driving on the freeway and got to my exit.  I signaled to get into the turn lane, but there was an Audi not letting me in.  I kept signaling and inching over until I was finally in the lane.  The steroid abusing, tiny dick compensating piece of shit in the Audi proceeded to follow me off the freeway, got around me and boxed me in.  He got out and tried opening my door (which was locked) then tried to punch out my window in an attempt to kick my ass or murder me in front of my kids.  Luckily I kept calm and manged to get out of there before things escalated further.\n \nMaybe it's because I'm an Appalachian country boy, and I'm not used to places like LA, or maybe it's an ISTP thing, but **fuck Los Angeles**.  If it could hurry up and fall into the Pacific it would be just fine.  They skydiving is better in Eloy, AZ and Z-hills FL.  The climbing is better in Colorado.  There are lots of great MTB trails in lots of other places.  You can actually ride a snowmobile in New York and New England.  The LA County Arboretum is top notch though.  I've never seen one nicer.
2	Currently living in LA (2-3 years), NorCal / SJ born / lived in SF for a couple.\n\nWhat I like: There's plenty to do, especially in a couple mile radius. Currently living near K-Town but I'm about 10-15 mins away from DTLA and Little Tokyo, 30 mins or so from Pasadena, 20-40 mins away from NoHo (depending on traffic). Location is incredibly vital living in LA, this is what I've learned from my time here so far. Used to live on the west side (near UCLA) but had a commute to Glendale (roughly 22 or so miles) which took me anywhere from an hour to hour 45 maybe 2 if it's really shitty traffic. Diversity here is insane, seriously being near K-Town you see the mix of Latino's and Koreans (businesses, people, markets, everything), I find that fascinating (Sociology major). Food is great here, I never had a lot of Latino food before until I moved here, also would never think about eating Ethiopian food either until this month. If you're into arts / museums or even music, there's plenty of events happening in and around LA.\n\nWhat I don't like: Because there's a lot to do here, you get stunted by the options and possibilities that I get overwhelmed by just being comfortable being at my place. Traffic, a lot of it and quite frankly just gotta suck it up and deal with it, because there's a lot of traffic also creates an insane amount of noise (I've lost count to how many honks I hear in one given day), weather can be a pain like for example sweating balls in the middle of November, just doesn't make sense to me and the weather we're experiencing now is perfect. People, they can be fake but it's all about finding your "neighborhood" where you are near / around like minded folks. They're hard to come by but once you find them they're great.\n\nYes, plenty of action sports to do just depends on location, traffic and if you're willing to go through that traffic to do "X" action. \n\nI enjoy the culture, though if you don't find your click it can be frustrating. Again coming from the "fake-ness" of people it's amazing you see the differences coming the westside to East LA for example. If you're not up for the rat race or the appearance of money, status, cars, the glam then the culture can be difficult. Though if you're into the arts, music / concerts, out doors then I feel like it can be a good culture fit. \n\nLike any big city it has it's pros / cons, I used to feel NorCal was better but honestly it just depends on where you're at in your life, seeing if LA is where you fit in and if not what neighborhoods do you fit in is the question.
1	Been living here all my life all i want to do is find a cabin in grass valley with a few acres of land and have a bunch of pets with my wife.\n\nThings i love about LA:\n\nGetting out of it
-1	I live in Berkeley. Much more pleasant than LA. Can’t stand the sprawl. Plenty of nature trails in every direction here, can smell the sea instead of smog. 
-2	I feel like the general consensus here tends to be that ISTPs don’t really care much about sports. Not that we won’t watch it, just that we aren’t as invested as most people. 
0	What is it about ESFJ’s that make them so irresistible?	I usually lose interest within a few weeks, but this ESFJ hasn’t quite left my mind ever since I met him. 
10	I’m guessing it’s their high Fe and skipping the bullshit questions and going for the meat.\n\nI worked with an ENFJ for one day and I told her more about myself in that day than I’d told many of my other coworkers who I’ve worked with for years.\n\nBasically they get us to open up easily.
3	I can't understand what you all like about ESFJ's, everyone is talking about them
2	my mom's an esfj. i'm not romantically interested in this type, which is probably a good sign
2	dat Fe
13	Role Models	What has been your experience with role models throughout your life?\n\nI've seen a few articles/videos pop up these past few days about, "finding your true self." This article I just read, talked a bit about how people naturally look up to others and aspire to be like people they admire. It said that people often take pieces of others, whether characters or real people, and use them to build up a persona. \n\nIn my experience, I've never really looked up to anyone. I remember seeing superheroes like Spiderman, and wishing I could sling web and climb walls, but I never wanted to be like him. Same goes for real people. I might've seen an athlete pull off something cool and think, "dude, I wish I could do that," but I can't say I ever wanted to be like them as a person. It just never really occurred to me.\n\nNow, Im not saying that I haven't had respect for anyone. There are loads of people that Ive known, who've had to make tough decisions that Ive got a ton of respect for, but even still, I can't say I've ever really wanted to, "be like them." \n\nDoes anyone relate?
39	Have no gods, no idols, no masters. Practice your craft, perfect your skill, learn from people who had more opportunities and experience. You will have to spend most of your time with yourself - make it inspiring.
8	No role models per se; but sometimes I see someone doing something a certain way and want to imitate that specific way of doing it.
9	My father.\n\n He's not perfect nor famous and much less rich, but if I could be half of what that man is in terms of being a good person and father I'll be happy. \n\nHe's an ESFJ and he does get on my nerves sometimes but the only complain I could have about that man is that he's too good. People take advantage from him and that deeply upsets me knowing the amazing man he is.
6	I didn't have any 1 specific role model, but I did learn to take pieces of character from people I admired for one thing or another. I could go into a bunch of examples, but I feel like focusing on one thing I learned from watching success from afar.\n\nArnold Swarzenegger was big in movies when I was a kid, and while I never felt "I want to be like him" I did internalize a piece of wisdom from observing him from afar. He knew to enjoy not just results, but the process of working hard. I'm a big Patriots fan, and I see the same thing in athletes like Brady, Edelman, Troy Brown, Tedy Bruschi, Willie McGinest and many others. The guys who really outshined what their potential seemed to be athletically, because they didn't just outwork their peers, they loved putting in the time and dedicating themselves to greatness.\n\nI don't really feel a need to be a world class athlete or anything, but I struggled with my health and fitness for a while until I was successfully able to internalize that mindset. I don't need to focus on the results. I need to see showing up and putting in work itself as a something to relish. That's done great things for me. \n\nI feel better and look far more fit at 39 than I did at any point in my 20s, because I now have years of consistency that came from just loving the process instead of obsessing over my physique and hating where I was at.
3	I can get easily fascinated by anything. Not only people. But I also get easily bored. \n\nFor a counter-statement, I have an INFP friend (friendship almost 15 years) that I really adore and respect, and have influenced me greatly to be a better person. I don't think I see her as a role model for her life isn't what I aspire to have.
3	No role models.  I don't have a tendency to idolize. 
2	I’ve had lots of role models in my life who without them there I wouldn’t be here today like as in I would’ve offer myself a lot time ago, one mentor was an ESTJ who introduced me to all this and taught me how to control my emotions, learn body language and social queues. I was also kid with a good heart but who had been hurt and was very miss understood, without those who saw the real me and coaxed it out Idk who I would be today
2	my ENTJ mother. she’s somehow kind-hearted and thoughtful, but also kicks ass and fires people when they refuse to do their jobs. 
2	Lacking.
2	If I could choose a role model I’d choose Jimmie Åkesson, a Swedish politician. I really like the kind of person he is, he dresses nice, argues like a boss with amazing rethoric, and the way he leads his party and his voters and fans are just amazing. I even have his autograph, and that is a very prized possession of mine.
2	Never had any real role models. I've always just been my own individual, and my parents nudged me along the way.
2	 I also don’t have any role models. Whenever I get asked who my role models are I have to make something up because I truly can’t think of one and I thought I was the only one. Must just kinda be an istp thing 
2	Same.  There are certain things I've wanted to do and ways I've wanted to be, but no human I've ever aspired to be like.
1	I have few role models but not they're fictional characters. I admire and aspire to be like them. Even though I feel like I won't be like them, it gives me some kind of belief and hope to better myself\n\nVideo Game: Dante and Vergil (Devil May Cry), Kiryu Kazuma and Goro Majima (Yakuza)\n\nAnime/Manga: Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando (Jojo's Bizarre Adventure)\n\nThese characters have gone thru shit in their respective lives and seeing them just have fun with it makes me realize not to take life that seriously and just believe in what they believe in. Even though they have more reasons to be depressed (they did have their moments) and broken than me, I really admire them for keeping themselves together all these years and actually look cool doing it. They grew wiser and stronger as years go by and I really want to be like that too esp when I hit my late 40s. Im still in my Ti-Ni loop WTF Years and I have 15+ years to go\n\nAlthough Vergil and Dio are villians, I admire them to not give a shit about anyone and just believing in yourself
1	I admire when people do great things, but I don't see anyone as a role model. I find having a role model to be a negative trait because when you look up to someone, you are more likely to overlook or even excuse the really bad things they do. I don't worship or look up to anyone. I admire the good aspects of people rather than people themselves. I don't see people as completely good or completely evil, so I see no reason to worship anyone or have a role model. 
2	Why is the Ti SE Combo best at being things like an assassins or driving, fighting,shooting and in the moment stuff then SE Ti, NE Ti,Ti NE or any of the other combos ?	
11	lol come on, how do you know that? know a lot of assassins? 
9	Maybe those things make you be able to decide better at the exact moment? Helps you to decide and take act faster?
7	Ne is too philosophical. Get a gun pointed at my face and I wonder about the meaning of life. (ti-ne here)
3	Se is focused to the immediate and not busy spacing out thinking about hypotheticals while driving or doing something in real time (like my INTP friend does)
2	extraverted sensing is being cognisant of your immediate environment, which is obviously very important for high pressure, fast paced action. introverted thinking is also much better than extraverted thinking (or either feeling types) because it's analytical, in depth, and inward focused, making quick and independent decision making much easier. estp is the best type in that sense; it has all the same cognitive functions but in the order of sensing thinking feeling intuition instead of thinking sensing intution feeling. istp is the next best type, and none of the others really compare (maybe entp/intp or esfp?) 
1	I guess an ESFP could but i dnt no about about NTP and NFP thats why i asked on here but i guess they could. And thankx for your answer
18	Which picture would you say most represents your work space the majority of the time?	
44	1 is the goal, 2 is the reality. 
25	1 when I’m in between projects. 2 when I’m in the middle of a project. Sad part is I know where stuff is better in picture 2 then put away proper...
18	1: beginning of the project\n\n\n\n\n2: how it looks when I’m done
8	2.  But, although it looks like a chaotic mess to the outside observer, I actually have a system going and pretty much know where everything is.  It doesn't have look organised to be organized if I'm the only one using the space.  And God help anyone who comes in and tries to "fix" it for me or tell me to clean it up.  
6	I’m mostly asking because as an ISTP I didn’t think I was a perfectionist but I’m finding out a lot of ISTP’s are.
5	i always organize my shit and clean up once in a while but it always devolves into a complete mess pretty quickly
4	I should clean my apartment at some point.
3	1 doesnt actually exist does it?\n
4	https://imgur.com/a/DJ0O6Gg\n\n🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
2	Used to be 2 but now I'm 1 after learning mise en place and the value of having your environment be structured and efficient. I would have to say this is more of a mental health/bad habit problem than anything. Procrastinating on doing your chores takes hard work to reprogram. The best way to structure your environment is to make it so that you require less effort to keep things clean.
2	Sort of both.  I'm about a seasonal cleaner and I put everything in its place.  Then the mayhem begins....
2	Number 2. For sure
2	Option 3, car parts in a muddy field with a pop up tent
1	If I’m working on something, 2. I try to keep it as clean as 1 the rest of the time. 
1	Both, depending on the day and how interested I am in what I'm doing.  I often find myself setting out to do something that I've not fully planned or prepared for and just making it happen by what feels like sheer will, and my workspace looks just like 2 when I'm done.
1	My workspace is 2. The rest of my space is 1. I'd probably snap if someone else made the "rest of my space", like my "workspace". Lol.
1	My boyfriend is an istp and 1 is more like him.... Well his work space is 1 but everything around him outside of that becomes chaos. As a person whose entire existence is 2 but loves the idea of 1, I find it oddly charming. 
1	2 in the process of becoming a 1
1	2
1	2
1	Workspace 1, life 2.
1	2
48	I’ve always seen them as good examples of ISTPs in fiction. Maybe there’s a reason they’re grouped together?	
46	Obligatory “and they both wear the same clothes.”
18	Shreck talks way too much to be one of us
3	I thought the same when I saw that post a few days ago.
4	Wrong,Shrek is ISTJ and Han Solo is ESTP.
3	They might have ISTP traits but only them, can take the test and and confirm they're exactly ISTPS. 
-1	Shrek's an Fi user. And Han Solo is a stereotype, . If you want true ISTPs the only ones I've found are Sai (and maybe Kakashi) from Naruto and Mob from Mob Psycho 100. Yes I only watch anime.
9	How to help 16 year old ISTP daughter	She’s super smart, super athletic, super competitive, and super stubborn....like the most stubborn person I have ever met in my LIFE.\n\nThis wouldn’t be such a problem if she didn’t also have anxiety and depression.  I mean, that’s what the MDs think she has based on her behavior with them (uncooperative).  It may or may not be that...I don’t know because she rarely tells us how she feels.  \n\nWhat I do know is that she self destructs when  she is unhappy about something.  Her team lost an important soccer game and the few words she shared after were telling us to F off and then telling her coaches she didn’t want to play anymore.  She got mad at me for trying to parent her (aka “control her life”) so she started flunking her classes.  She is trying to convince me that she was never really smart and that’s why she is getting Bs, Cs, and  Ds now.....but  she placed in the top 10% on SAT scores.\n\nShe acts like we are 2 levels below her sometimes.  She is super bossy with us....borderline bullyish.  The more stressed out her dad and I get about how she treats us, the more she says that we are stressing her out ...leading to her irritable attitude and theres the loop.\n\nI know some of this is teen girls stuff, some may be anxiety/depression stuff, in addition to ISTP stuff.  The reason I’m here asking instead instead of on the anxiety/depression boards is because 1) I already asked them and it didn’t help and 2) my daughter has been like this since birth 3) meds haven’t helped and she spent 7 months running circles around the counselor who basically gave up.  \n\nSo my next strategy is to just try and work with her and her ISTP personality.  I need her to take some advice or listen to me because she self sabotages when she is angry so much.  This isn’t going to work in life.    Case in point....when her boyfriend broke up with her she lost her mind but the result wasn’t so much sadness as it was rage and how dare you.  She made herself feel better by sending him and his mom terrible texts and cutting off all her hair...like GI Jane short.  So obviously there are some emotional regulation issues which look to be personality based.\n\nHow can I help her?  She has told me a\nMillion times that she doesn’t want my help...but it breaks my heart to see her struggle and also, it seems  like a total parent fail to stop trying.\n\nBtw, I’m an INFJ.\n\nI appreciate any advice! Thank you.
10	I'll be honest, I'm an ENTP and I've done all of this, I've said the same things to my parents, I've flunked classes. \n\nI'm now 19, I just about managed to get through school and I'm going to university and have a great relationship w my family. I know you don't wanna hear this, but your daughter's behaviour is really common for teenagers, eventually her frontal lobe will develop and she'll be fine.\n\n\nYour daughter being an ISTP, I'd say encourage her to do sports and engineering/DIY work, and adrenaline-boosting hobbies like extreme sports.\n\nUltimately, she'll be fine, and she's lucky to have an INFJ for a parent.
11	What's her diet like? For years I was super depressed and angry, turns out a big part of it was being in constant pain from being undiagnosed celiac. And also the lack of nutrition balance from the same problem.
5	Im similar in that i get super competitive. When things are not going my way i used to get flashes of extreme anger, when that happens i go blind and feel nothing but blood rushing to my face. It sounds like shes having anger issues. I recomend addresing that. With all the anger comes regret and depression and with the istp on top of that we dont know how to express ourself exept with our current emotion (anger), so its flushes out. With all the anger compitition gets more stressfull and i started to get anxiety and fear when competing, i started to fear competition and everything from a football match to a boardgame became a hazzle. I started to hate loosing not for the lose it self but for the emotions that came with it. \n\nBeing an istp it didnt know how to handle that in any shape or form so it all just came out with no controle, like rage quitting and smashing a remote or kicking a ball of the field. I can relate to your doughter not wanting to play anymore because quitting removes the emotions of loosing. Now this is not all bad, winning becomes even better and gives you drive to do well in compitition. I dont personally know how to fix this because i didnt fix this for myself, but i did grow out of this with age and emotional maturity. \n\nNow impotantly for me is that i hated critism and people pointing out my flaws and it did not help. If my parents started to engage me with questions like, are you depressed or feeling bad i would just shut down and denie anyting. To deal with this i had to be alone and simmer down by myself. Im sure a professional would tell you other things and i dont know how to fix this but i hope you can have an idea about whats happening.\n(Sorry about my spelling im not a native english speaker)
4	Oh wow, reading through this I thought "oh, my poor parents, so that's what they went through with me". I wasn't this extreme, though. No hair cutting out of anger, and not that many emotional outbursts I would say, but my parents might disagree. If I'm brutally honest with myself, I can see myself in your description of stubborness, and also the being "bullyish" part. I can only speak for myself, not for her of course. \n\nYou write that you want to try and work with her, and then next you write that you need her to take some advice, or listen to you. I understand that this is your position as a parent, but seeing myself in the role of the daughter, language like that immediatly makes my hackles rise. It is well-known that ISTPs are extremely independent characters. The situation between you and your daughter is already strained. She probably already enters every conversation with you with the preconceived assumption that it is just about you "controlling" her live, no matter how you start the conversation, or what your intention is. (I'm not judging this, taking care of her is part of your job, but this is what it would feel like for me). Again speaking from my own experience: Every attempt at a formalized "serious talk" will backfire, because it will only aggravate the feeling of being controlled and misunderstood. I don't know if I have a solution for you, tbh. She's only 16, it is very likely that she will be mostly over this in two years. What I can say is that I am much more open to a conversation. when I feel like it is about genuinely understanding my position, and not "just" about telling me where I'm wrong, how I should be different, or better. I love just spending some relaxed time with my mum, sitting in a cafe, or doing sth. else together. We automatically start talking, and the important thing is that she just listens, and asks questions. The more she started doing this, the easier it became for me to talk openly about how I'm feeling. It was a process, though, it did not happen immediatly (talking with my dad is MUCH harder, because he will ask two questions, and then start judging what I'm doing, or give suggestions how I should behave instead. It  makes me defensive immediatly, and I am extremly sensitive about it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout the part where she is super bossy.....does she realize 100% that this is what it feels like for you? Because an ISTP at 16 is probably impressively bad at understanding other peoples' emotions. I remember that my dad told me at around that same age that I treated my mom very badly, and that she wouldn't even dare to ask me questions anymore, because I always reacted rudely. The important thing was: He didn't make an accusation, he explained it to me understandingly, and calmly. I felt really ashamed when I realized this. Of course I knew that I wasn't very nice, but I hadn't fully realized what kind of effect it had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, this is just a long post with some impressions from my side. I'm quite a few years older now, my parents still think I'm stubborn, and we still fight sometimes, but overall I would say I turned out fine. She probaly will, too, 16 is just a rough age.
3	She sounds so much like my own daughter who I strongly suspect is an ISTP. My own approach to her is leave her alone and to let her learn by her mistakes. I don't know whether you'll be able to do that though. In any case you already know that she won't let you help her even if you tried.
2	I am an istp and I found this site so affirming. It has a few categories where they cover the “istp parent”,  “istp teenager” and so fourth. I would highly recommend going through these; I wish my parents would have had this resource when I was growing up. 
2	It sounds like you want to help her by controlling her or suggesting what to do. She might find comfort if you backed off a bit. To be honest though, she sounds like she could have an undiagnosed mental disorder of some sort like ADHD? Hard to say but I wouldn't have done those things like cutting my hair off in anger.
2	I am a female ISTP and I don't have children, but probably I can help give my perspective based on my own experience during my teenage years. Sounds like she is under great pressure to fit in and feel at home as herself among her peers. This can be really limiting and stressful for ISTP. Unfortunately this will drive them to take on more to work on by themselves and add more stress, creating a downward spiral. Probably it is a good idea to give her space and let her take care of herself for a while at her own pace. Also add more recreational activities that she enjoys when you spend time with her, without pushing her to take on new achievements or goals but purely having fun. That way she would relate your relationship with her with a good time. Also give her a sense of freedom to be herself when she is at home. When she is being mean let her know that it is not working and she will not get what she wants that way, appeal to her rationals. Lastly, don't tell her that she is smart she is good etc too often because that can add pressure, since it seems that she does not believe in herself yet. Let her discover what she is good at at her own pace and she will appreciate the liberation. I hope this helps and I hope her anxiety and depression gets better soon.

1	First you should take this to mind that "It's up to her". It's her life. \n\nI had a rough relationship with my parents because they were very controlling. This "You should do this" type of parenting, I hated it. So I rebeled, thought of my escape for a long time, and left my hometown. \n\nI am not sure if this will work, but maybe just keep asking her what she wants instead of providing for her what you think is best for her. Help her think through whatever is going on better. If she gets stuck in one thing (be it feeling, depression, source of anger, whatever) ask her if she has thought of other things... "possibilities". Ne is our horrible function,  like we can't think of other things but the one breaking our head..\n\nAs for her rage and emotional outbursts, it's normal for an ISTP. The thing is not to amplify it or you becoming the "problem solver" as a parent. Use your Fe as an INFJ. It's a pessimistic function for you, but maybe use it as an ENFJ would... the most soothing way to use that function. \n\nMy parents aren't Fe-users. I wish they were. It would have been comforting to be around them. \n\nAnything happening outside of the house, that's not within your control. But you have her as her home. Remember that!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Don't try to micromanage her.  Avoid being overly emotional/ appealing to her emotions/ using emotional approach. Give her space.  Give her options. Let her know you are there when and if she needs you.  Intervene only if you must. 
1	I disagree with everyone about leaving her alone.  I have watched plenty of unpleasant kids become unpleasant messed up adults. reaching age 18 won't magically cure emotional problems. I don't think you're being too controlling. it would be one thing if you were micromanaging, but encouraging your kids to do well in school and look after their mental health is exactly what a parent is supposed to do. \n\nyou say your daughter won't tell you about her feelings. could it be that she doesn't trust you? I don't tell my own mother about my feelings because I don't trust her. stuff that guarantees I won't talk are: telling  my personal stuff to others even if its not a explicitly a secret, telling me other people's secrets or gossiping to me or if I witness you doing it with someone else, using something I told you against me like in an argument, pitying me, judging me, if I feel you don't actually care or have some other motive, and lastly if there is the slightest chance you will have some kind of emotional freak out  even if its positive.\n\nespecially when I was younger I had a wouldn't listen to or take advice from people I didn't respect and to some extent still do. so I don't listen to people who do stuff like having no self discipline, not being trust worthy, being a hypocrite, arrogant, making emotional instead of logical arguments, being emotional in general and not doing what they say they will. \n\nif you do any of this stuff your daughter probably doesn't trust or respect you. without that you won't get far with her. it sounds like she could use some help right now, but it can take a long time to gain trust and respect. you might be better off finding someone else to help her like an istp family member, friend of yours or teacher. she might realize she needs help to is too proud to admit it. if you leave journals, art supplies and self help books around the hose she might use them. just don't go prying through sketch books or journals and don't say anything about her using them if she does. \n\n
1	I'm ISTP but I've never had emotional issues to this extent, so I can't speak from experience. The only thing I can really think of to suggest is to try your best to remain calm and avoid getting upset. People tend to subconsciously mirror those around them. So she may unexpectedly calm down and relax if the people around her are calm and relaxed. Also, ISTPs generally learn best by observing and trying things out rather than being told what to do. So if you show her with actions - not words - how to deal with stress without getting frazzled or blowing up, she may even learn it for herself. You don't need to lecture her or make suggestions about new hobbies or healthy habits (she wouldn't listen anyway).
1	Brilliant advice. Thank you so much for the insight.  
18	ISTP i feel like when ever i use my FE to try be nice it ends bad	Its like most times in most situtions people almost like me better if im not using FE and being nice then when i do. I usually come off to strong or say or do something weird, especially with women but even guys and my fam or they try to take advantage of me sometimes. It seems like people actually like me more when im unemotionally and uncaring.
5	I (INFJ) love the sarcastic and blunt nature of my ISTP friends, it's them acting from their strong points which is perhaps what you're referring to when you say people like you more when unemotional. I've seen some of the ISTP Fe examples you gave (being weird about hugs, not texting goodnight, not being attentive in conversations) and in my view the problems seem to stem from the ISTP's uncomfortable reactions to all those things which makes their gestures of friendliness appear unnatural and guarded. If you're going to be nice to someone just fucking do it, don't get all self-conscious about it and worry excessively about what the other person may think! It can actually be quite endearing to see someone not normally "nice" do something caring (if their intentions are genuine).\n\nAs for feeling taken advantage of at times, I've seen this when the ISTP cares too much about what another person thinks about them and gets afraid to upset them in any way. This only seems to happen on an unconscious level though, not something the ISTP has control over, so probably something much more difficult to deal with than a simple Reddit post.
4	Any examples how  you show your care and being nice?\n\nAlso- are you actually * uncaring* or just emotionally inexpensive? One can care and act upon it without effusive emotional displays. \n
3	Just like maby giving a hug or when leaving someones house instead of saying ight im out il say ok bye see you guys later and it seems weird to them or helping someone do something like shovel snow or being nice in text like saying goodnight or goodmorning or even like simple fist type handshake or calling someone to see how there doing or being attentive in conversation just little stuff like that it seems like people dnt like it from me i know it sounds weird !
3	Maybe you try too hard. Trying too hard may come across as hideous , desperate or just fake.
3	Trust me the act itself isn't what's weird, your antisocial ass is just awkward about it. Been there, you're going through all the motions without any ACTUAL emotional intention behind it, ie do you really ACTUALLY want them to have a good morning?
2	I think I get what you mean esp when meeting people for the first time. A lot of people I talked to online dont talk to me after the first time we interacted. Might annoyed them or scared them away by using Fe. Im scared of using my Ti since I wanna leave a good impression but I often forget how it turns out most of the time. I cant really fake myself thru text and emojis because Im socially retarded\n\nAlthough in rl, most people often times are the opposite. They become attached to me to the point I cant be myself anymore. I cant use my Fe but if I do, it becomes a Freudian slip and shock people. I say nasty things but in a joking way in order to get away with it. I wanna say it in a serious way but damn I made it harder for myself\n\nIm usually aloof and antiocial as hell so I compensate alot with using Fe. Cause nobody would try to be friends with me if I didnt use my Fe. Im still trying to balance them since I get in trouble with using both. I get lonely with Ti and trouble myself with Fe\n\nOnly my family knows how I really am and they hate me for it
0	Idnt no About emotional inexpensive do you have examples ?
1	Noomi Rapace acts as an ISTP (again) in a new movie called Close	
3	Shit, sorry. I was supposed to include inner text in this post. I messed up !\nHere is a summary : she's doesn't talk unless it's necessary, seems very independant and private, remains calm and effective in deadly/stressful situations. \n\nMaybe the movie is not among the best you'd see this year but to me it's a pleasure to see such a character in action. What do you think ?
0	I think this was an ISTP’s doing.	
24	No.\nThey would have wired directly into the socket.
12	No way. ISTP's are too particular to let that shit slide. 
12	I’m more of a perfection person but maybe that’s just me.
9	Maybe if we are screwing with someone
3	Yea, that's a super shitty solution. I'm more of the mind of running the cord to the floor and running it along the floorboard, but maybe I just don't want my house to look like utter shit.
3	We're more technically minded than this bs
3	I think what happened was there was no outlet on the wall so they sent it thru to the other side and made it work
2	That’s garbage. Had the same thing in my house for the oven range. Went to wire it into the plug in like a normal person, but whoever wired it before didn’t leave enough to pull the plug. I now have a moved socket, a bunch of fixed drywall and a new junction box behind my stove. 
2	Shoddy work? I thought that was very anti ISTP.
2	lol, not at all, dude. not at all. 
2	This offends me.
2	It ain’t pretty, but it works.
1	I would have bought another plug and enough wire for the width of the wall. If I wanted to be lazy, I would get an extension cord, or a power bar(depending on circumstance). If I was desperate enough to do this, I would remove the face plate and run it through the side of the plug. There was no reason to make a hole there..
1	this pains me. 
0	this wouls be fine if they knew how to use spackle correctly
5	Why is my INTJ friend so much better at coming up with ideas and ways of thinking about problems than me ISTP ?	
13	Ni Dom > ni tertiary\n
15	Because N basically equals imagination. We need more external stimuli to come up with ideas. Really depends on the environment and situation.
12	Maybe he is smarter than you? 
3	Damn i wouldnt think it would be that big a difference lol !
3	If we are given a specific set of components (conceptual too), we can easily fail-test them, refine them, tweak them and optimize them. If you want us do create something entirely new though, you're more often than not just going to hear a collection of pre-existing knowledge deconstructed and put into mental structures meaning. We organize and clearify our thoughts more than we produce new ones. However our capacity to weigh in multiple subjects to find how different pieces of information paralles and entwines is something I've find myself to be very good at as of late
3	He's smarter
3	Nothing to do with mbti, exposure and stimulating events make one creative
5	Because we come up with solutions to possible outcomes in addition to probable outcomes. I've noticed istps just go for trying to solve the most obvious outcome in the most linear way. Or they don't bother and go back to whatever they were doing before the problem occurred. 
2	Well the main problem was a girl and so that had to do with emotional relational stuff Inferior FE and different angles to a prob intution 
4	Because INTJs are gods
2	if you cant think your way out of problems and are not one step ahead...then I doubt you are a true ISTP, dude. 
1	Yeaaa i guess were just good for Ti SE stuff in the moment lol
27	I've found that meditation does wonders for my mental health, I was just wondering what other ISTP's experiences with meditation is like and if you practice any particular methods.	
5	Wim hof breathing is good. All experiences are personal and soothing. Meditation made me in to a nicer person.
4	I tried it a few years ago, my mind is a lot quieter now. I hate it
3	What does your usual meditation practice look like? I have tried to meditate but find it hard to commit enough to make it a habit. I guess something in my subconsciousness screams "bullshit" to things like this.
2	yessss. meditation, yoga, and breathworks therapy have all been very useful to me. 
2	I start hallucinating when I meditate, it's fun!
4	My preferred method is to first smoke a bowl and then turn on some sitar music and just close my eyes and feel. Focus on the breath and embrace any feeling. Another method I do is open eyes meditation where I basically just try to be my awareness and forget about being a human.
2	Usually ISTPs meditates naturally - Se being the function we use to gather information with the senses. But it depends on what you mean by meditating. Is it to empty your mind of thoughts? To be aware of your surroundings and your own body? To control your breathing?...  \nApart from body scan meditation which is what Se is all about, an Se user might find value in actually experimenting with their breathing. The breath is your gateway to controlling the autonomic system and breathing a certain way teaches you how to relax your body and your muscles, which also has an influence on muscle length-tension relationship. Who knows how imbalanced your kinetic chain gets when you stay stressed and tense all the time. Heck, this tension may very well be what causes people to be stuck in their heads all the time (using Ni)... just a hunch.  \nIf you've ever been in fear or very angry you might realize how tight your stomach gets. The best thing to do is not to hold onto that tension but to relax and let it melt away. Your muscles might even begin to spasm.  \nI personally think emptying your mind of thoughts is a pretty dumb idea and definitely a waste of time. If you have negative thoughts, these can definitely be fixed through relaxation but there's no point in forcing yourself to control them. But then again, I've never trained like Goku. Though if you do want to stop the thoughts from coming I've found the best thing to do is to just hold your breath. This is something they teach autistic people when they are too stimulated.
1	Never understood how to do this. Tried some apps but after 2 mins I’m like wtf is this shit. 
1	I tried it, bores me to death.
0	waste of time. 
19	ISTP woman and a victim of emotional abuse (without even realizing it!!!)	TLDR: I’m an ISTP woman that’s so emotionally detached that I didn’t realize I was in a fucking emotionally abusive relationship for 2 years.\n\nI only realized it 6 months after breaking up with him. \n\nIt takes me so much time to properly ‘take stock’ of how I feel - and after much analyzing and reflecting I finally realized why I pulled the plug. \n\nI fought like hell to stay in it but pulled the plug when I saw no way out. \n\nSo my question is...is this emotional detachment part of our personality potentially unhealthy especially in the relationship department? When we’re not able to properly verbalize or even realize what we’re feeling - and just always trying to take the logical way out when conflicts arise, without knowing that it was fucking abuse? \n\nSince then I’ve been keeping a digital journal where I force myself to write how I feel - in attempt to be better at verbalizing my emotions/thought processes. I shudder at the thought of being unknowingly trapped in another abusive relationship again. 
11	I’m not too sure that our type played much of a roll in this.  I do think we have an amazing ability to learn from our mistakes and stay cognizant of it in the future.  Good luck working through this and know healthy SO’s are out there.
8	I figure its just another stepping stone to become more balanced as an individual. \n\nWriting it down is good. Gives us an outlet to process your emotions. \n\nI used to go on epic multi-week moto road trips And write down my thoughts and feelings.\n\n\nReading it now, i see how twisted my thoughts first were, but saw how my mental/emotional state improved with each trip and during the course of each trip even.\n\nIt helped me be more emotionally mature.\nNearing 50. I don't write anymore, but I'm desperate for another epic adventure and wipe my thoughts free again.\nQuite liberating.
7	ISTP (32M) here, this definitely resonated with me.  I think ISTPs definitely are extremely prone to this during...maturation for lack of a better term.  Throughout my 20's I used to be very permissive of others' behaviors, dismissive of their ill intent, and process very poorly my own emotions.  I not only found myself willingly taking emotional shit in the face whilst also accidentally being a devourer of women of sorts due to just being emotionally autistic at times.  I stayed in emotionally shitty relationships while again myself being guilty of dragging around some poor girls. It's taken me years through a number of experiences to really nail this down and see a lot of emotional pitfalls coming early and become effective at avoiding them.  One of the best ways I've been able to protect myself (and others) in my late 20s and early 30s is to be completely frank with people.  ISTPs live in the moment, and for me if I don't explain what I'm feeling right when the thoughts come to mind, then post-moment I won't feel those feelings and will fail to process and communicate them.  It's hard to communicate thoughts/feelings in the moment, especially since some may be unpopular or even offensive or hurtful, but it's truly freeing and helps keep everyone, especially myself, on the same page.
5	I am also an ISTP woman and this isnt an ISTP thing but rather a "you not paying attention" thing.\n You CANNOT be trapped in an abusive relationship and not fucking notice...cmon now. 
3	You dodged a bullet! Not too many people have the chops to do so. 
3	Imo difficulty recognizing abusive actions is not in emotional detachment, but in not being clear what your boundaries are.  Knowing and defining aaand then respecting and enforcing your boundaries is work that is done over time.  By recognizing patterns in your past that you didn't like/ didn't serve you well you are getting to know yourself and defining your boundaries. 
2	Istp female here, also was in an emotionally abusive relationship and didn't realize it until my sister told me to stop hanging out with this person.\nEveryone handles emotions differently. I don't think the way we handle emotions is "unhealthy", it's just different.  We just have to tread carefully and practice identifying and dealing with emotions before a problem arises.  \nIf anything our ability to stay emotionally disconnected allows us to see multiple perspectives others can't because their own emotion are in the way.  This is super useful when making important decisions. \nBeing emotionally abused sucks, hope this helps.
3	Eh? This isn't an ISTP problem. All types of women go thru this believe it or not. I doubt they're all the same personality type.
1	Glad you got out of time!! It’s important to be aware of your feelings. I’m so fascinated about how you ISTPs are so unaware of it. I’m a INFP and I’m so in tune with my feelings that I get sick off it. It’s like I have a voice inside me that’s always telling me ”you are feeling this about that because of this reason blabalbalbsa”. I want to be more rational like you guys.
1	When there's so much abuse, either we stay and get emotionally numb without knowing it, or we leave (which is difficult to do when we care about someone so much) and realise that the abuse only after... I was in a relaitonship with an ENFP and followed by an INFP. I learned so much of my weaknesses and blindspots from these connections. I also lost everything. But I'm afforded with self-awareness, so I guess I just need to take my time and know the person more before I risk again. \n\n&#x200B;
1	I just yesterday realized I might have been emotionally abused by my mother growing up. Apparently Narcissistic abuse is a thing, and she fits the description to the t. \n\nAnd the main thing she “taught”  is how to ignore my feelings and suppress them WAY down (mainly in my teens)  because we would get  into fight almost every day and I had to calm down first to go comfort her, otherwise it would never end. And she was so hurtful, she would say the nastiest things towards me, and break me completely every time we fought. \nAnd main thing that hurt me the most is her lack of empathy. Which taught me my emotions were wrong, they were not be expressed. If she wasn’t yelling at me, she would smirk or chuckle  at my distress
2	ISTPs do you often need to reset	Hi Guys \n\nI met an ISTP guy in summer and things started off really well. We had good chemistry and saw each other 1-2x a week. Things fell apart about 2 months in when I wasn’t feeling urgency from him (didn’t know he was an ISTP at this point) because he wasn’t blowing up my phone or wanting to see me all the time. I felt there was no growth so I ended it. \n\nHe would always try to get me back though and we did this back and forth dance a few times. The last time was different though as it felt more sexual and left me feeling quite hurt. So when I saw him after that I didn’t want to sleep with him. \n\nHe said after this that he didn’t want to see me and wanted to reset (apparently he had felt dirty as I didn’t want sex but he did) because we were heading to friends with benefits. He wants us to keep talking  but not to meet for a while so that it would not all surround sex. I asked him if he wanted to be friends but he said he didn’t want to define it, just see how it went.\n\nHave you ever needed to reset with anyone? \n\nIs this a nice way of cutting me off?\n\nHe doesn’t seem to know what he wants, is he keeping me on the back burner till something better comes along?
8	If he wants to reset it's a good thing. We ISTP's will try anything to make a relationship work before we walk away from it. Thing is once you broke it off, he should have been happy, but the fact he tried to get you back means he actually cares for you. When it digressed to a sexual relationship, he was just trying a new approach. I don't think he meant anything by it. We're very logical and sometimes we forget to take emotional aspects into consideration. The absolute best advice I can give is to sit down with him and tell him what you need out of the relationship to make it work for you. We compartmentalize well and respond to forwardness over assumptions any day. \nGood luck! 
2	I am a female ISTP. I agree that if he hasn’t disappeared and still reaching out to you he probably still cares.  When I was dating my now husband, I was so reticent with showing my feelings that he wasn’t sure if I was going to go out with him on a fourth date but I was mentally planning our wedding by then. I don’t bother spending time with people I don’t care about.  However, once I knew he cared, I was all in without any games. 
2	I always say watch their feet as well.  But I don’t pick up on subtlety very well.   I need someone to verbalize how they feel.   It is a double standard because I believe my actions tell my truth, but I want you to verbalize yours.  
1	Two months in and not blowing up your phone sounds healthy. Things settle after a while and you know you’re gonna see eachother again soon so why keep texting all day?
57	Do you ISTPs ever feel like you wish you had friends and people cared about you but then when they text or call you push emm away and when they come around you want to get rid of them ?	
35	I don't wish that very often but I often push everyone away. 
22	In a way.\n\nI’m pretty bad at maintaining friendships outside the moment. And I don’t always reply to messages. \n\nBut organising to see people just to do nothing is kinda, what’s the point? I need it to have some kind of activity or function, not just ‘hanging out’.\n\nI don’t like people randomly showing up on me, Cos I’ll usually be doing something!\n\n
15	I have an INFP friend who never gives up on me and always initiates all our of online conversations. It took me years (a decade) to realise she's been an important person in my life. An anchor, really. Lately, I decided to see her often. She lives in the capital. I booked flights twice a year, and a weekend with her is enough for me and she understands how I'd retreat again into my own kind of life. 
13	Most of friends realize I only have a set amount of time I can socialize before I need a nap so it works out. 
9	I did when I was depressed. But I’m not depressed anymore. Filling your quota of social activity is crucial to mental health. 
9	Yep, I sometimes wished I had more friends, then I realize I would be asked to do a lot of things with them and as an Introvert I guess what we wish for are significant friends, not just regular friends
7	Absolutely. All the time. I honestly just wish I had a friend that understood that. 
7	Always
3	I do feel that, so those times that I don’t really want to go out and socialize, I force myself to go. And if I’m having a bad time I’ll go home early, but I almost always have a good time! 
3	Yes and no. I like a hassle free connection. Friends that I can plan hang outs and activities easily with (no tendency to cancel plans) are the one I keep close. Friends I push away and get rid off are the kind I can't be myself around, flaky, pushy and doesn't understand boundaries. Once I've slammed the door, they're really gone. Any attempt to insert themselves back into my life would be futile. \n\nI have four close friends atm. These are the people I'm comfortable with and can spend a longer time around before the need to recharge. 
2	Every day
2	This is extremely accurate. Almost every day, including my wife, lol.
2	This is my life. Not necessarily having friends, but pushing people away and not liking those times when people randomly show up on my door step. This is a bit of a contradiction since I’m usually the one to randomly appear.
2	Idk I mean I want friends but, "real" friends where I feel real connection to. I never ran out of friends but it just feel like a responsibility where I gain nothing back. Purely just exhausted me and no emotional satisfaction\n\nSometimes I feel like I took my friends for granted for hanging out with a fake ass bitch like me but sometimes I just so wish I had friends I can be comfortable with around where I can show how what an asshole I really am that wants to be alone someties and can be harsh on things. Cause sure as hell I tried my hardest to hold back what I think about stupid things my friends did by laughing with them or going with the flow even tho I secretly judge them and hate them for making me this exhausted. I dont really like showing who I really am when I know Im an asshole and dont wanna be judged for being an ass but I wish someone knew what I really am like and understand. That way I can finally genuinely call someone a friend
2	Yep.\n\nFor example I had a friend that I would only see when he had his famous bbq cookouts/parties or was at a nearby brewery and texted me.\n\nThen some I met at one of those bbqs texted me the day before memorial day(which is his biggest party of the year) and asked if I was coming(I think she had a crush).\n\nBut I had not been invited, despite not knowing of any issues between us.\n\nThen I heard nothing from him until 2 weeks ago(January) where I got an invite from his gf to their bbq/baby shower and later that week he messages me on steam to play a game together.\n\nNow, I know other personalities might ask what happened etc and make up, but not me.\n\nIf I ran into him I’d be friendly but the trust had been severed.
2	No because I’m good with where I’m at and slowly getting over my insecurities 👍🏻👌🏻
1	Yes
1	depends on day and mood
1	Yeaa i hate that when people come around its like i just dnt see the value of investing time on a friendship unless were doing something at the moment !
1	Im lucky in a way that I've got friends who stuck by me despite my ways of falling off the face of the earth on a regular basis. But they also know that if it's a serious matter- i'll be there. ( not to hold hands and cry, but for tangible help). \nThey know i'll kinda a cat and will come and go on my terms. And they know there is only so much socialization i can take and ok- with my need for solo time and very little chat. I don't want to hear minute mundane details of your day. Not gonna bother you with mine either. 
8	Have any of you ISTPs never been in a relationship before ?	Does it have something to do with inferior FE ?
19	lolol are you really young i’m guessing? i’ve been in more relationships than i wish i had been in. but i think ISTP females are sort of viewed as unicorns to males, because we tend to be really chill and aloof, something guys THINK is awesome.. until they are bitching about it. i’m not great at feelings, but i have many other cool qualities, so i’ve had several multi-year relationships. 
13	This thread is an embarrassment to our type.
9	Not necessarily. I managed to attract girls as a teenager by being a brooding mystery, apparently. That was probably related to inferior Fe in some sense. \n\nI’ve been in more than a few long term serious relationships since. 
9	Only been in one relationship, it lasted about 4 hours and she cheated on me with 3 other people . No joke. I wasn’t at all sad because I knew what I was getting into. All the other girls that liked me I had no Interest in.  
3	I’ve been but they lasted maximum 2-3 months then as a rule I lose my interest
3	I only had one when I was 21. Only lasted for 6 months. Im 25 now. Been single since
3	Nope, not ever
3	I'm 28 and I've never been in a relationship. It's not that I'm trying, but I want my life together and independent before I pursue that.
2	Yea i lose interest after about a month but thats usualy because of tired of puttin up with crazy shit
2	I've been in one when I was 6 years old does that count ?
2	Yea, 7 years ago. Ive had 2-3 potential partners but i lost interest in like a 1-2 weeks. 
2	technically yes, but in the *mainstream* terms no. 
1	Oh well thats good you could be around different types of women then me to !
1	Yea that sounds like a smart hoe or a hooker not crackin jokes or nuthin that does suck iv had a hooker trick me into thinking she was so called talkin to me or dating and some how justify her being gone 24.7 which lasted for about a week amd a half but she was 28 and i was 23 i chalk it up to inferior FE
1	Yea i no its sad but its the truth i think for alot of ISTPs and INTPs
1	Nope 
3	Hunt for the Wilderpeople	That movie is a great example of what happens when an ESFP and an ISTP spend too much time together. 
0	It’s actually a great example of a fictional person with a fictional personality in a fictional universe interacting with another fictional character and having a fictional outcome. 
4	Any of you watch AvE on YouTube?	He’s an interesting dude and I enjoy his channel. What is his type do you think?
3	I just found him a week ago 
2	Dudes hilarious. I got the tool bug this summer and bought a bunch of teal theft deterrent tools and a few borsch ones. r/skookum
2	Never heard of him. What's his channel? I'll check him out. 
1	He is definitely way too funny to be an ISTP :D\nESTP?
1	stopped watching after he started to spout his lefty bullshit. don't need politics in my tool "review" videos.
27	Maybe	We don't talk to others, because we've already had the conversation in our head.\n\nI feel like I've had pretty much every conversation, in every permutation (except the one that would actually happen) in my head. 
16	You think too much. Are you sure you're not in Ti-Ni loop?
13	> I feel like I've had pretty much every conversation, in every permutation (except the one that would actually happen) in my head.  \n\nYeah, when it comes to actually having the conversation by then you've forgotten all of the possible outcomes and you end up saying spurting out some unformed sentence that makes you look like an idiot.
7	That's exactly what I thought when I saw the inner monologue thread a few hours ago! People always wonder why I don't talk, but they just don't know that we've already had a conversation in my head lol. It mostly work when I'm angry or something like that.
6	I find it partially true.  I don't need to voice out my thoughts- quite the opposite. So ive already thought it through and i know my potential audience- so most likely i don't want their thoughts on it- or i would have explored it. \nHearing mundane detailed  ccounts of other's day bores me to death- because it's a very slight variation on yesterday.  I don't want to talk about mine for the same reason.  It's very much like yesterday- and I've probably shared it once or twice already.  \nUnless there is an actual information to deliver- why waste time. 
5	Hmm. I disagree. The reason I don’t talk much is because I generally either don’t feel like talking or because I don’t want to. I guess it depends on the person and the energy they give.\n\nLike many of us, I abhor small talk and like to steer clear of it as much as possible. I’d rather just get to the point and skip all the BS. Unfortunately I work in a place where it’s required. Just the thought of having to do it already tired me out.\n\nI also hate those vague general questions like how are you or how’s life.\n\nTldr: don’t feel like talking and hate the thought of small talk
1	I usually respond with “chillin,” “living the dream,” “another day in paradise” or some variant. When speaking to customers this response is not appropriate so I usually respond with the default line of “I’m fine and you?” Then it dies after that
1	I don't like to talk to ppl idk well because tbh it's boring as fuck...I literally can't listen to them even when I try.  Probably a due to my combo of shit Fe and ADHD 
1	I talk to myself enough that I have my own accent lol
14	How to deal with a manager that talks too damn much	I work overnight and my leader likes to talk. A lot. I've had a few conflicts with the guy due to this and have had that bit of tension every once in a while. I feel like he is trying too hard to read into who I am (and failing at it very badly). I just want to go to work and mind my own business but this guy makes that extremely difficult to do. How can I deal with it?
11	[deleted]
7	I usually have no problem with people speaking to me as long as they talk about themselves and don't try to know every nut and bolt about me. Did you try telling him you need to concentrate or that you aren't the talkative type?
2	When coworkers ask questions I’m not comfortable answering I usually give vague responses or I change the subject. I tend to give out very little personal information. If I feel like people are fishing I find it’s better to give them something rather than nothing ie hobbies and what I do in my free time just to get them off my back.\n\nAs to your solution, I think it’s important to set boundaries. Let your manager know that you are not comfortable talking about your personal life and would rather focus on the task at hand. He/ she may not like the answer but should understand and respect your decision. If it becomes a problem then I’d suggest having a word with Human Resources.
1	I tend to brush people off a lot when I don’t feel like talking to them. Most of the time I don’t even really know I’m doing it, I guess the people I brush off over and over again kinda figure out that I don’t want to talk so they leave me alone.
1	Can you wear headphones/earbuds at work?  Maybe its time to start listening to podcasts or just put some earbuds in and listen to nothing.
37	Do you have an inner monologue?	I'm trying to figure out if I am an ISTP and it definitely seems plausible, I do relate to the description and to most of the posts here. \n\nBut yesterday I was talking to a friend who is the walking stereotype of ISTP, and I realize stereotypes aren't definitive but it's certainly a place to start. Anyway, during the course of our discussion we discovered he has little to no inner monologue whereas mine won't shut up. \n\nSo I'm just wondering if that's an indicator of MBTI.
59	I'm 33 and my entire life I legitimately assumed everyone has an inner monologue? What the actual fuck?
21	I don’t think it’s strictly type related. I have a constant inner monologue, and always have. It only stops when I’m really focused. 
17	More like imaginary dialogues with other people. And not all the time but really frequently. 
15	ESTP here-\nI often do not have an inner monologue. I always attributed it to high SE where I’m very engaged in a sensory way that there’s hardly any room for my thoughts. \n\nThe way I describe it: when you’re kayaking down a river through rapids, are you thinking about anything except what’s right in front of you? There’s no time to have thoughts, it’s like full engagement thru the senses.  I feel like I’m kayaking through life the majority of the time. \n
13	I mean, kind of?\n\nI mostly talk to myself out loud, but it does turn into an inner monologue when I'm around people.
8	It might be just an introvert thing 
8	Sometimes? Depends on if I'm doing something or not. Normally my brain's constantly turning over random thoughts and hypothetical conversations and shit, but when I'm really focused on something then it seems to shut up for a while.
8	Yes, I'm an ISTP and have strong inner monologue. It speaks the language of the kind of stuff I'm going, for example if I'm cooking my inner monologue speaks my native language as I learned cooking with my mother.\n\nThe only time it goes away is when I'm sleeping.
8	I always just thought everyone did...
7	It never stops, it's like a on going documentary of my life and thoughts.
5	I seem to have an inner dialogue actually
5	Thats a human trait my dude
6	I have an inner dialogue if I'm in a "safe" space where I can let my thoughts wander. \n\nIf I need to be engaged in something, I usually don't
6	Always had an inner monologue .. it turned into an external monologue. \n\nGo figure\n\n
5	Some types might have more stronger refined inner monologues introverts obvioulsy and extroverts prob would but it prob wouldnt be as strong because there first functions extroverted !
3	ISTP - I only have an inner dialogue because I have afantasia ( no mental image), but I don't think it's related to the personality type.
3	Uhh yes. My inner monologue is reading this as I type.
3	yes, it's not constant though. the more engaged i am in the moment, the quieter my thoughts are, but when i'm not immersed in anything my head won't shut up. i have pretty bad insomnia and i think the main reason is i can't stop thinking about whatever (not related to anxiety, just any random shit that pops into my head). 
2	I wonder if this has to with language, culture etc and not just type
2	I’ve always attributed my inner monologue to ADHD. My hyperactivity expresses itself mentally and not physically. I’ve never really attributed it to my personality type. I’ve always had an inner monologue since I was a child, yet I can guarantee you my personality type has changed drastically at least 2-3 times in my life. 
2	Hmm, I definitely fall into the monologue (inner voice) category\n\nTo the extent where I should be focused more on what's around me\n\nI live a peaceful life and I guess that would spark more self reflection... I got to get out more I guess\n
2	not really tbh
2	ISTP here and I spend more time in internal monologues than actually talking with people, and i'm very social.\n
2	Always and constantly.  I either have music playing in my head or I'm talking to myself.  When talking to myself, I'm often playing out scenarios or practising conversations.  
2	That's wild! As an ISFJ, I have a constant internal dialogue... My brain never shuts up. Ever. I wonder what would cause someone not to have one...
2	Yes.
1	Btw I forgot to ask how sure you are that they’re ISTP
1	My inner monologue usually consists of “Will this person ever shut up?”
0	My inner monologue is saying that there are questions so stupid here and is wondering if the next one will be someone asking "Do you take a shit sitting down? I wonder if I'm an ISTP".
6	Best hobbies to stimulate Ti+Se?	So soccer season just ended, and it's pretty damn cold outside for most other outdoor activities!  Besides skiing/snow based stuff, what are some relatively simple yet entertaining activities or hobbies that stimulate your Ti and Se?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!
9	Lockpicking
9	Great username btw. I have a set of outdoor sports and a set of indoor sports. So when it gets cold and I'm not playing hockey I'm playing ping pong and racquetball. I used to whitewater kayak but my friends dropped it. I'm contemplating getting into wood crafts, which dovetails nicely with making sex toys out of power tools.
4	i like building zip guns. my last one was a hand exercise thing with a nail on the end, with a stock i made out of wood and a metal pipe that fits a .357 magnum cartridge. squeeze on the hand thing to open up the chamber, insert a cartridge, and slowly set the hammer down. then whenever you want, pull the trigger back, aim, and release when you're ready to fire. this is just one example, it's super easy and i garuntee you have all the parts to make it other than the right size pipe. just make sure the first time you try it, you fire it remotely from a safe distance. building something you can use with no guidelines, having to figure out how it's going to work and the basic physics behind it, is one of my favorite things to do. it's all makeshift so the longer you spend on it, the more shit you can add to it to make it better. \n\na gun isn't the only thing you can nigrig, if you don't want to mess with real gunpowder you could apply the same concept to make a crossbow or something. personally i like making huge ghetto bongs, it's a good way to get shit from your smoking buddies but if you spend the time you can make one that hits way better than a 300 dollar bong. of course you could just actually build something like a chair or whatever, but this is more fun
2	Try indoor rock climbing if there's a gym near you. Bouldering is half puzzle-solving and half physical ability. 
7	How to spot an unhealthy ISTP and how to fix it?	Hello,\n\nso my little brother, who's an ISTP, seems to be in a phase where he's seems very introverted. Kind of "detached" in a way. Doesn't seem like he's unhappy, though I've come to wonder since our family's has gone through a rough time in many ways. I was more apparantly effected by it, probably because I was older (aswell as a feeler), though I can't be sure since he generelly isn't to expressive with his emotions. I read briefly about the Ti-Ni loop which can happen, and I'd imagine he's in one of those because of he's always pondering. What I wonder is, how would an ISTP, from your own perspective, react to negative emotions, like those in a turbulent home?  \nAppreciate it
21	As an ISTP one of the things that gets me the most is *nobody gives a shit about my hobbies or interests*.\n\nStart paying more attention to the personal projects he is working on and show some interest into them. He will greatly appreciate that and it's a way to connect.\n\nAlso, you won't be able to connect better with an ISTP than actually getting involved in one of his projects and following through.
13	I think people worry about us more than they should. \n\nI know they have good intentions, but it's always strange to me when others try to reach out to me as if I'm depressed - when I'm just happy doing things alone.\n\nWe like learning from others and admiring their work, but we do not like others trying to "fix us".\n\nPersonally, I enjoy when others come to me for help with a problem or project. If you know what your brother likes, ask him about it. If you have a problem that  you think he'll be able to solve, 100% ask for his help.
11	> how to fix it?\n\nYou don't. The best you can hope for is to tell your ISTP that you are concerned about their behavior, but unless changing it becomes important to them, you won't "fix" them. The only person who can fix an ISTP is the ISTP.
6	To negative emotions in a turbulent home... My third function makes me think about things from a million perspectives, having imaginary conversations, trying to work out how things might go, screening them with my primary function which needs actual, not imaginary, information to work. That's the loop. In order to break the loop the person needs to reach out and get real feedback from an actual person if it's safe to do in the household. Give him a way to ask real questions and get real answers.
2	My reaction would be to tell you to go away and leave me alone.  I would enjoy going out for a gyros, burritos, beers, wings, pizza, etc.. though so start with something like that.  Just don't expect them to open up over a shared meal. 
1	I don't know how old your little brother,but if he's pre-teen, teen i would say just let him be, unless there are some clear warning signs of issues. Us ISTP's are mysterious and this will cause many to think that we are problematic. Now if he's a teen,  he's propably just trying to figure out things, but do what you feel is the best solution
-4	we dont need you to fix a damn thing. just back off and mind your own business. 
8	Im a ISTP but cant really recognize Ni in my self do any of you guys ahve examples of Ni in ISTPs ?	
11	Sherlock Holmes and his deduction process.From the smallest details he deduces backwards what happened to the start.Ti-Ni for the win.
5	We want...a shrubbery!\n\nOne that looks nice (and not too expensive).
3	Maby enviromental awarness im good with physical stuff lock picking driving catching stuff mid air i did alot of research of NE and SE examples on personality cafe and reddit and listin alot to djarende on youtube about comparisons
4	Ideas for a class to learn a new skill and/or hobby	I want to take a class to learn a new skill and/or hobby. I was looking into painting and mixed media classes and came across an interesting one where you make silver and gold rings. I want to do something like that, but realized that I stumbled upon that particular class and figured there might be other specific craft-based skills/hobbies that I could learn but that I have not yet come across. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, who has any ideas
11	Musical instrument\n\nprogramming\n\nwoodworking\n\nspeedcubing\n\nbilliards\n\nvideo games\n\nchess\n\nblacksmith\n\nmartial arts\n\npaintball\n\nelectronics\n\nreading\n\nleather working\n\ncooking\n\nbaking\n\nphotography\n\nmachining\n\n
4	Painting is really fun. Anything you can do that you can use your hands is usually fulfilling. 
4	Extreme sports are always great (not crafty, but get both mind and body moving)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRock climbing,\n\nMountain biking,\n\nSnowboarding,\n\netc.
2	Find one that requires more than a minimal investment. Get some tools or something you kind of need to learn to use from a technical standpoint.

8	How similar are ISTPs to ENTPs?	
23	We're both Ti assholes but thats about it
11	I'm ENTP with an ISTP mate. \n\nWe're both very logical (Ti), have a whacky sense of humour (dominant Ne meets tertiary Ni), quite fearless (although for me that's cause I don't take danger seriously, whereas ISTP is more of a classic tough guy), both enjoy discussing different options in dangerous scenarios (Ne and Ni again), both like smoking weed.\n\nI find him hilarious cause he gives no fucks in situations where others would be terrified.\n\nHe likes me cause I make him laugh with weird humour and have enough Fe to care about him, but I'm still a Thinking type so won't get on his nerves by being emotional.\n\nIt's a great dynamic between ENTP and ISTP.
2	In socionics ENTPs and ISTPs are on the same "supervision" ring of types, and have the same style of thinking called ["causal-determinist"](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Gulenko_Cognitive_Styles#Causal-Determinist_Cognition). This makes ENTPs and ISTPs be more similar to each other than to other strong Ti types like ESTP and INTP. When dating they might even feel like they are dating a version of themselves picking up on their inner similarity. An ENTP dating an ISTP might feel like they are dating their cousin.
2	[removed]
2	How similar are INTPs and ISTPs in terms of behaviour ?	
7	intps are more argumentative and interested in learning more and playing with ideas. istps are more practical and hands-on, and are often very calm in stressful situations. most action movie heroes (especially lone wolf types, think die hard, john wick, leon the professional, etc.) are istps. intps are usually very imaginative and can be great writers. they love to create theories and spend time thinking things out. both types are highly analytical, the difference is istps use introverted intuition paired with extraverted sensing to immediately come to conclusions (often subconsciously), whereas intps use extraverted intuition paired with introverted thinking to develop their ideas
2	Not at all that similar. It might seem like they should be, both are Ti doms, but even the orientation of the Ti is different.     \n     \nOne large difference is that INTP is a "farsighted" "judicious" "positivist" type that also has Se PoLR, meaning that Se is their weakest most scary and least understood to them function. While ISTP is "carefree" "decisive" "positivist" type that has Se as one of their strong functions, but Ne is their PoLR. Thus ISTPs behave more brashly and confidently in real world, but with less prudence and foresight than INTPs which sometimes leads them to get burned. INTPs try to fore-think, discuss, and calculate things in advance, so as to not end up in stupid situations, so they act more wisely in strategic sense, but less confidently and decisively within any given situation.          \n       \nYou can read about these types qualities at Wikisocion: [**ISTP**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI) vs [**INTP**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LII).
26	What are niche/particular things about yourself that you've wondered if other ISTPs have?	We see a lot of posts on here asking questions like this, so I thought it'd be cool to start a thread for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo any of you sometimes get weird feelings like someone isn't meaning what they're saying? Like someone is just saying something to get ahead/flatter/impress/etc? I get feelings like that all the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease share some things that you're wondering if other ISTPs have.
43	Yes I get that all the time! \n\nI’m also wondering, does anyone here have an incredible memory for other people’s personal stuff? Like, I can remember what someone’s said about their past, likes/dislikes, where they live etc,. if they just mention it in passing even just once, or I happened to see something they have. I also have a habit of watching people a lot without noticing, so I notice a lot about their relationship dynamics, habits and expressions. \n\nIt makes me sound really creepy, but it’s just that I store a lot of these kinds of info in my head and can draw it out and it really helps me make inferences. As in, do they have patterns of repeating behaviour? What is it? Why? Do they often mention this particular subject? In what context? \n\nThe way I see it, to me it’s like I’m building a profile of that person in my head. It’s actually really helped me in life as I’ve been able to buy them presents that aren’t just clutter to them, or even help me figure out whether a person’s got ulterior motives behind their actions. 
24	Suck at articulating thoughts. God forbid asking me to tell a story.
21	It's always felt a little backwards that I'm way better at public speaking or giving presentations than I am at socializing. Maybe this is an ISTP thing?
18	I’ve always been good at “picking things up” quickly- not necessarily concepts, but physical things, like darts, or random stupid games, and things to do with fitness like gymnastics, or building things. \n\nLike, it’s a running joke in my friends circle that if there is a party game going on for a task that no one’s ever done and we need to choose someone in our group to do it, I will be chosen. \n\nMaybe it’s also good hand-eye coordination? 
11	Sometimes or like they have some alterior motive but i think in tertiary Ni and inferior Fe prevent us from seeing exactly what it is 
6	I don't believe i do anything niche at all.\nI do not think i am a snowflake that some others think like me.\n\nI have my own quirks, but no different than any others.\n\n
2	So is not really caring what other people do, regardless of their type, not a common ISTP thing?
2	We are basically human lie detectors. \n\nI am always very self concious when walking around alone, like in a shoppingmall or on a busy street. Don’t have that when I am with someone.\n\nSometimes I also break out a sweat waiting in line in a store lol. No clue why, doesn’t happen in every store. 
1	I've noticed a lot of us are into full-contact sports and martial arts, with a few people also being into powerlifting and the like. \n\nI've read it's a constant with ISTPs, so I'm wondering if anyone around here *doesn't* enjoy any of those things?
16	Lifestyle of ISTP's.	Dear great ISTPs,\n\nI am an ISTP-T type. Since I am the only ISTP I've yet to known met(probably because they're wanking all alone at home or doing some highly risk shit on their own) I am very curious how other ISTPs spend their lifetime on things, basically what their lifestyle looks like. What did you guys like doing? How does your day look like? When you wake up? Things you find important for yourself. Tell me your stories! ;)   \n\n\nFollowed, by an example of myself.  \nI am from Germany, 21 years old;  \nISTP-T type who thrives to become more a -A type.\n\nI've started to become very conscious and self-aware after I've understood myself by this test, because I was very unsure and shy of myself, the way I think. So it helped me A LOT and don't need to waste time thinking about myself all the time! I love to improve my interpersonal skills which I believe in affects the people I surround my self with, first. Since ISTPs are known to not have good compassion and emotional skills towards other humans as I did, I've started to improve that by psychological videos and now learn by known types of my surroundings and compare them to the personalities they have to understand people. Now I do it waaaay much better and it is very funny how everyone wants something and wants to hang around with me and treat me more with respect. It started to improve many things in my life, which include happiness. Bad fucking behavior changing.. accomplished! :D\n\n  \nI love brutal fighting/ warrior spirits and watch some MMA, E-Sports and listen to Deep House mixed with Hip Hop. Underground Rap(Btw. what you guys think of the rapper "Night Lovell"?) and shit like that.\n\n  \nI am really a geek, who thinks and loves to work in the rainy night times with warm low lights.. best!  \nIn my lifetime 'til now: I have done some stupid funny shit as I was a kid(rebel stuff) or either playing video games on my XBOX 360, but I was surprisingly kind to all people(still am!). At this time, I lived with my two older brothers who was more of very skilled nerds(INTI and INTP -.-) and with my Mom(ESFJ), so I got influenced by them to some hard degree.   \n\n\nAs I've played an immense amount of video games until I was 18, where I started to decide to shift my life to a better for myself, I still managed to learn to be a web and graphic designer. \*Some appreciation for myself, lol\*  \nFirst I was mad that I had played so much video games, but after I realized that It helped me to express and show myself more of who I am and how do I act in certain situations which are not usually for normal people. So I honestly started to appreciate that because I am able to see certain things others won't and maybe found the love of my life.. Let's see.. ;)   \n\n\nI always and still am the kid who gets late to meetings, which is getting better but is still not good, which I like to change.  \nI always found it very hard to get out of bed. Either being very very early out the bed because of excitement or very very late because of boredom(not inspired by myself).. likeee fuck.  \n\n\nI was in a secondary school where I wasn't with intelligent people. The most, foreigner who did more stupid shit than me and dragged me down to do stupid shit as well. I did one year of retaking a class to get a better degree. After that, I started to take on 3 years of university about graphic design. But it failed me. Everything they tried to teach me there, I already knew. It got so boring in the last year I was not going to school properly and gave a shit. So didn't finish it, doesn't get the needed grades. Basically dropped out, I guess. I told everyone that I will never study in a government ruled system. And so I do believe in, still. I hated it so badly. It still feels like kind of 3 years wasted. But it was Okkkkkkk.  \nNow after half a year I am still not working officially anywhere, got for more than 3 months scammed by business scammers, but managed to find and worked on business possibilities with people which I appreciate and where I get a lot of fucking money by doing webshops and learning about business investments in general and Branding. My dream is develope a brand with the most awareness of all time. Maybe I will fail, maybe I will not. I don't exactly know, how I will accomplish this. But I am very optimistic about this. Fuck Steve Jobs(ISTP). hahaah :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy goal so far is to manage my life more. Get a nice GF. Do more outgoing things. Network more. Maintain my habits,  get more structure in it and stick to them. Get an attractive and powerful body shape. Get a healthy lifestyle. Be a more -A type. And be the leader and Hero/ Inspiration I would like to see in myself.  \n\n\nThat's it so far... IT. \n\nI hope you like my story so far and I would really like to get to know others of my type! \n\nIf you wish more of me: you can follow me on Instagram @this.type   \n\n\nThanks for reading! ;)
11	Alright, I’ll bite.\n\nLet’s talk a little bit about my life.\n\nI’m a 27 year old Mexican woman, currently living on her own about two hours away from my family, which is kind of an oddity where I come from.\n\nI’m finishing my Masters degree on digital communications (it’s kinda worthless, trust me.) and I’m working as a freelancer, doing video editing, voice acting, copywriting and more. \n\nMy hobbies include reading, videogames (I’m a Nintendo girl at heart) boxing and MMA. In fact, I hit the gym two hours a day whenever I can. \n\nI used to roleplay a lot, though I’ve stopped doing it since all my roleplay partners went ahead and got themselves a life. I’m talking internet roleplay here, I’d give my left imaginary nut to play D&D, but I don’t know anyone who does it and, lets be honest, I don’t actually want to go and meet new people with the explicit purpose of playing the game. \n\nSocially, I’m a huge loner (if that wasn’t obvious already) though I do tend to hang out with some of my neighbors during the weekends. Sometimes we go out to eat during the weekdays as well. \n\nI have three dogs (two Chihuahuas, one fluffy Maltese mutt) and I spend most of my time indoors and on my own. \n\nI haven’t been in a relationship in little over a decade, be it physically or emotionally. \n\nWhile I do live away from my parents, I visit often and, in fact, spend around 10 days out of each month with them. \n\nMusic wise, I will listen to just about anything but tend to like New Age and Metal more than anything else. Still, I don’t oppose a Country or Polka, for example, and can listen to a lot of different genres without an issue; it’s all about managing to come up with a good story for the music I’m listening to.  (As in, I imagine my own little music videos.)\n\nI get along with people just fine, but don’t really feel the need to pursue deep relationships with them either. I get along with everyone I meet but don’t let anyone get too close, yanno? \n\nThat’s about it. That’s my life. 
10	Um.  There is not really any "-T" or "-A" type, I guess you came from 16personalities?
10	TL;DR. You’re definitely not istp. 
5	First off I do not see how an ISTP can write that much about himself, but then again I view my life as fairly boring so maybe that's why. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, seeing as everyone else is telling their stories, I might as well too. \n\n18 year old American kid who graduates from highschool in May, not entirely sure what I'm gonna do after I graduate. Probably national guard and a trade like welding. Currently in the progress of slowly proding to see if a gir wants to date or just be friends. Hobbies include reading, drawing, and climbing stuff, but thats kind of hard to do when you live in a flat grassland void of trees and large rock formations. The rest of my life is kind of boring like the land here. 
3	22, from Turkey. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust trying to survive in this crazy world. I was raised to be in contact with my emotions, that helped me to keep calm. I had hair trigger levels of anger potential. That is hammered down to higher than normal levels for others, while it is still lower than normal for myself. I'm struggling with negative self vision problems, and it makes my life harder. Thanks to it, I've delayed my Aeronautical Eng. degree by 2 years, developed unhealthy self beliefs, gained weight, lost self confidence.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut all is not lost for me, for now at least. I'm clawing my back for the degree, going to the gym to increase my muscle mass; which in turn decreases my fat & increases my base needed calorie intake. Those 2 help me to see myself in slightly better light, but I accepted that I'll amount to nothing in the end. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut in the past I had some light in me that gave people grand expectations about me. That was caused by my brain working faster & different compared to the normal. That caused me to never fully develop proper work ethic, fueling my spontaneous bursts of working. I was attending a top 2% accepting high school & wasn't studying enough compared to my friends, but still managed to get 75+ or 80+ average out of 100, for all years. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNever had a GF, probably never will. Because I love my solitude, video games & hobbies. Besides, I'm as blind as a bat when it comes to understand if someone is flirting with me, I've friend zoned a girl without realizing it. I rarely notice the eyes on me, almost never for invitations of flirting; but my awareness is greater than normal for other things.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI've played a lot of video games & trained at a Taekwondo dojo until I was 18, had to drop Taekwondo, because I changed cities to study at college. Worked out (with non negotiable breaks) with Stronglifts 5x5, can Deadlift more than my own weight & Squat nearly 10 kilograms off my weight, if my knees weren't screwed up, I'd Squat more than my weight, too. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nPicked up electric guitar because of my love to Metal, yoyoing because it is unexpectedly cool & hard. Still mainly listening to Metal, but added more genres to widen my horizon, mainly electro, rap & other genres of rock. Night Lowell is good, but a bit too slow for my tastes sometimes.\n\n\n\n\n
3	I’m a 26F, in Canada. \n\nI moved out at age 20, don’t have contact with my parents and am happier for it. \n\nI work at a startup as the GM but don’t really enjoy it. I live for the evenings where I go to the gym to lift (Olympic lifting) and then to go home and eat. I love everything outdoors, I enjoy video games (but haven’t gotten into it too much), have a billion plants, play the violin (in a Prarietime band as a fiddler and singer) and like everything craftsy. \n\nAlso in a relationship with an ESFJ. It’s really hard at times but we’re making it work, and our good days are really good!

12	Always questioning if I'm actually crushing on someone	I've got this thing where I always second guess if I actually like someone. The way it always happens is I start to develop a crush and then my brain goes: "Am I even into this person or I'm just tricking myself into thinking I am?" \nThen if my crush shows interest in me or I display my affection and they react in a nice way I always lose interest and literally have no feelings for them like the next day and don't even find them that appealing anymore.\nIt always takes me SO long to start being into someone and then a split second to stop being attracted to them.\nAre any of you guys the same? What do you do with it?
14	I think this is a situation where we are accessing our tertiary and inferior functions in unison to create a desired outcome. And this feels kind of good in the process. So Ni is trying to attain the "crush" by carefully doing the things that will make her view you in a positive light. Fe is the driver of the vehicle and the reason you want this person to ultimately like you.\n\nThe problem is that you end up ignoring Ti and Se. After Ni is satisfied with it's planning that turned out to be successful and Fe is rewarded by the crush's interest, Ti has to make sense of the current situation. Does this really make sense for me? Do I even like her/him that much? \n\nSe also feels tied down because you can no longer explore other options. Ni was briefly satisfied but Se is accessed more often and now feels trapped. \n\nSo that is my best ELI5 of how I think the functions are being used in these situations. Perhaps when you actually find the person you REALLY like then your Ti will realize it DOES make sense and your Se will be okay being with this person.... for at least a reasonable period of time. Let's not get crazy here.\n\n&#x200B;
6	I find it hard to separate romantic feelings from platonic. When I have a very attractive female friend that I’m very close with, it’s hard for me to distinguish the two. If she’s attractive as hell, and she’s my best friend, wouldn’t that be the perfect recipe for a good relationship? But at the same time, is it also possible our friendship is so good *because* it’s not a relationship? \n\n\nI end up having thoughts like “is this how I should feel about a significant other or a best friend?” \n\n\nSo yeah, idk if that’s exactly what you’re dealing with, but I definitely get the confusion in this area. Pair that with my lack of understanding a lot of subtle social cues and that explains why I’m single lol. Or mostly at least. Too many times a girl has hit on me and I just thought she was being friendly while another girl was just being friendly and I thought she was hitting on me. Most of my relationships and sexual encounters were initiated by the women. There’s been some mutual beginnings, but I’ve never actually chased after a girl or “taken a shot in the dark”. 
2	If you didn't have at least one date, a crush is nothing more than emotional self-sabotage. It will not do you any favors. It might feel nice to be in love just like it can feel nice to listen to sad songs when you're feeling down. But in the end, it doesn't help you. Maybe it used to be useful 30 years ago but in the unfortunate age of social media and keeping your options open...
2	Before I fall into that "l000v3" garbage, I distract mind enough to avoid that shit. 
1	I can relate
1	I have this “problem” too. Dont know why or how or what the fuck to do about it lol.
1	ENFP crashing the ISTP party here - hope that's ok. I used to have the same issue, but maybe it manifests itself differently than it does for ISTPs. I just don't always trust myself because my feelings change for people so quickly depending on my mood and my mindset. I think that's changed recently though, because I've been a little more in tune with my feelings. I can tell the feeling of being physically attracted to someone and I can tell the feeling of falling in love with someone whereas before I just felt a general pull to people (and sometimes that pull is just friend based). But maybe because you don't have Fi it doesn't work that way for you? Anyways, hope it helps to know that your type isn't the only one that struggles with this. 
24	Do you guys like group texts?	I can’t stand them and almost never respond. But if it were directed just at me I would definitely respond. 
32	I always turn off alerts for the group so I’m not aware of new messages unless I look. \n\nThen I respond only with gifs. 
24	I don't like texting period; group texting is even worse. 
12	I can enjoy group text I made a discord server with my friends in it, I don't talk much in it but keeping up with friends is nice since college started 
18	Group messages are awesome. The focus isn't on me so I can just pop in when I feel like it and joke around. 
10	Hate.
9	They're the same as all texts. If there is important information that needs to be shared, mostly logistics, I will participate. Otherwise I don't mind reading them but rarely respond.
7	Same. But if it's a group of close friends I would participate. I wayy prefer text to talking. Like my mil will text me to call her so she can ask me what time I get off. Just fucking text me that. I'm gonna ignore calls
3	No they’re the worst. So impersonal 
3	Oh I hate them. The only ones I stay on are for my family and my band. And my family one is on mute. 
3	I have six brothers and sisters. \nWe live from Maine to Florida and points in between. \nGroup text is the way we communicate. \n\nI think it’s great. 
3	Hate it, be it family, work or university. I prefer small groups, especially for uni to do projects and etc. I just have one group of close friends that I participate, the rest I just interact if there is a direct message.
4	Nope... Not do I like group phone calls.
2	Hate them. Can't say that enough. I mute them as  soon as i get. I'd have missed my family's Christmas if my wife hadn't seen it
2	I don’t mind being in them but I probably won’t send anything to the group. 
2	horrible horrible stuff
2	Hate it with passion. My sister thinks she's really organised when she has group texts for everything and keep adding me. I told her if she keeps doing that, I'm going to block her. 
2	If it’s a small group of a few close friends of mine then yes. But otherwise I just mute it
2	Hate group texts, group speaker-phone, group gifts and group email threads. Soo much garbage to sift through.
2	Only when there’s a defined purpose. If it’s a group of people trying to make plans, I’m in. But the second it becomes idle conversation, I turn off notifications. 
2	I absolutely hate them. My phone doesn't need to make noise or vibrate in the first place, let alone 856,274,931 times per second.
2	I love just watching people talking in them it gives me hints on how to communicate properly.
2	I love group texts! With one-on-one texting I get mild anxiety about having to respond and the other person waiting on me for a response. With group texts, it’s aimed at anyone so I don’t NEED to reply if I don’t have a reply\n\nThat said - I often turn off notifications as well, so I manage how often my phone dings. A lot of people here seem to have a problem with that, for which there is a solution! 
2	No, I always leave or never say anything. Same goes for groups of people. The more people there are, the quieter I'm going to become. 
2	It's the only time anyone hears me in conversations, so yea.
1	I don’t hate them. If they require a response I call.\n\nPeople hate when I do that..... did you hear that? No? That’s the sound of me not giving a crap what they hate.
1	Dunno, never been in one
1	No
1	No. Especially if they’re huge.\n\nI can’t be bothered to keep up with the conversations. \n\nI resent the notifications, so I turn them off, so I never check it, so when I go back in there’s a Tolkien novel to read. 
1	No.
1	I can't stand them when they are off mute. I mute groups all the time, hate notifications that don't pertain to me. Other than that they are enjoyable.
1	NO dammit stop forcing me to turn my phone on silent!  The bank alerts are bad enough.
1	I think they are a great avenue to socialize bc I would never do it face-to-face. But most of the time the group chats stay muted. In fact, the first thing I do when I get invited(aka dragged) into them is to mute that shit forever. 
1	Oh i want to hurt those people who include me in their group texts.  God it is so irritating!
13	What are some of your hobbies?	I’m curious to see what your hobbies are.\n\nI enjoy playing piano, working out, and role playing. 
14	I recently had a phase of intense obsession with building different style houses on Sims 3.
9	My latest hobby craze has been D&D can't get enough of it
10	Lockpicking
11	I, uh, enjoy refreshing the same few websites until something interesting happens. Cooking is fun, dishes aren't. I also occasionally enjoy talking philosophy, although admittedly I'm a total pseud, and don't *really* know what I'm talking about 90% of the time.
7	Motocross, hunting, shooting, camping, mountain biking, indoor rock climbing, paintballing, working on stuff in the garage, stuff like that.
4	Writing and reading, taking insanely long walks, doing puzzles, singing, playing quiz board games, drinking beer while simply looking at the clouds and think, fast cars and motorcycles, assemble things such as furtniture and that kind of things, visiting museums...
5	Music and geocaching are my two big ones.\n\nMusic - writing and recording my own music, so I play guitar, bass, vocals, piano, drums, mandolin\n\nGeocaching - usually involves something strange like climbing trees or kayaking or something
3	In no particular order: skydiving, sportbikes, rock climbing, sex, snowmobiles, downhill mountain biking, bluegrass banjo, saltwater aquariums, skiing, traveling.
3	Music, woodworking, used to play a lot of minecraft.\n\nI like to tinker. When I was little my dad would bring home old electronics like a vcr and stuff for me to take apart.
3	Chess, gaming, competitive Rubik's cube speedsolving
2	Piano and violin, reading, gaming
2	Working out, woodworking, open world type video games, wood burning, snowboarding.
2	My newest hobby is building and shooting guns. But I also enjoy working on my cars, disc golf, various video games, working out, and of course Netflix/Hulu. \n\n\nI also recently got into actually caring about politics seeing as I’m morphing into a responsible adult. So I’ve been doing a lot of reading in various books and watching news/politics online. I gotta say though, the more I get into politics the less faith in humanity I have... such a shit show these days. 
2	Martial Arts ( Used to do boxing since hs, taking up Muy Thai atm ) and Games, usually online. If offline, Fire Emblem.
2	Video Games (Especially Animal Crossing and Zelda), embroidery, writing, nature walking. geocaching. \nI also periodically get really into photography.
2	Video games, working out, leatherworking, woodworking, and eventually when I get a shop I hope to start blacksmithing and metal fabrication. I enjoy shooting and hunting as well, but no money for that right now lol
2	Making wooden minitures
2	currently: lifting, running, skiing, golf, softball, volleyball, hiking, interior decorating, fashion.\n
1	Playing music, writing music, though they’re not so much hobbies anymore, rather, avenues of employment. But, nothing makes me feel better than bashing out some tunes on the piano for an hour or two. \n\nI also love yoga, skating, hiking, camping. Would like to get back into racket sports since my knees don’t feel so messed up anymore since I started doing yoga 6 times a week. \n\nI like cooking, mostly meat dishes. I love Thai food. \n\nLong-winded single player computer games that focus on exploring with somewhat of a story. On about 200 hours of BotW. Though I can’t help thinking I’d rather go outside and play ‘Breath of the Wild’ in real nature indefinitely. \n\nI think my best career would to be a travelling bard, shame they don’t really exist anymore. I guess if I saved up some capital and sold a bunch of stuff I could probably be a travelling busker for a few years. 
3	Are there any ISTP doctors out there/ in the medical field/ considering going into it?	I know it’s late, but I’m a senior and i’ve applied to study applied mathematics and now i’m reconsidering becoming a doctor or something related.\n\nI like math & studying so my main career idea has been becoming an actuary, but sciences besides physics are fun too
3	Istp docs are in the ER, and other specialties that tend to be less routine. Perhaps a general practitioner in a small town. There is nothing routine about that. We had a doc in this smallish town, I suspect he was istp. He was a general practitioner, who by default became the unofficial local oncologist. The nearest oncologist was a couple hundred miles away at the time. He had no intent of being an oncologist but he had numerous successes and eventually became the guy other docs referred cancer patients to. His reputation spread throughout the state and cancer patients from the big town 200 miles away began to commute to see him. All the while he kept his general practice delivering babies and dispensing medication for runny noses.\n\nI always thought he had a dream job for an istp doc. Varied duties but earned much respect in a specific area by accident.
2	hoping to get in. still not sure between geriatrician or neurosurgeon. we'll see when (read: if) i get there.\n\ncurrently an irregular sophomore (should be a junior, but life got in the way).\n\nentered college thinking i liked biology since it was the subject i enjoyed most in middle and high school, so i chose that as my major. it seemed like a win-win situation for me. it knocked out a lot of the pre-reqs i needed to apply and i liked it enough.\n\nrealized as i was starting my second year that i like chemistry more and im not that bad at math despite having almost failed both in high school. considered changing my major to chemistry with a minor in mathematics, but i had already taken UD bio classes that wouldnt transfer. if i switched, i would have to stay another year, so i decided to stick with my current program. if i could, i would switch, but instead i have settled with a minor in chemistry. im planning on doing research with my chemistry professor as well as being a gen chem tutor next semester.\n\nit's never too late. if you really like math and want to study it, then go for it. if you want to apply to med school, just make sure you complete your pre-requisites.
2	Istp intern doc. \n\nDo check out meddit. \n\nBecoming a doc is a big commitment. I won't lie that numerous times I wanted to quit. I go to work at 6am and go back home at 8pm, with no breaks in between. \n\nI won't discourage you but try out EMT and get a feel of it. Also medical field has a pretty hierarchical structure. 
5	The 7 Work Habits of Highly Effective Introverts	
12	I hate how this article calls people out for using the word introvert wrong, then uses the word introvert wrong. Only some introverts are shy and only some introverts have these qualities
4	Being someone that owns the book, I found this article very amusing. Thank you for sharing.\n\nPS: Though careful planning isn't really our thing, is it? :wink wink:
3	This seems a bit condescending and shallow. I'd be more likely trust a professional extrovert over a professional introvert when dealing with clients since they will have more social experience in a professional setting.
34	Do any of you other ISTPs or IXTPs find if difficult dealing with people and just prefer not to ?	Im a 24 year old ISTP and more and more everyday it seems like it would be easier to not focus on people and building strong friendships at all because of how complex and difficult people are. And with IXTPs having inferior FE it kinda seems like that might nake sense ? What are you guys thoughts ?
27	I think we're missing out by not being able to socialize. We're humans after all. If we can manage to get past our Fe then we truly transcend our type. So the question is not how you can avoid Fe, it's how you can get better at it. Good luck, I am still struggling. 
8	Not really. back when I was 17 I'd say 100% yeah but afters years of working on it, I enjoy being around people and would now say I'm good at it. Gotta give some credit to having an ENFJ mate to push to do things and introduce me to people when I'm socially awkward but you can still do it without one. I can guarantee you working on your social ability will greatly help your life in all aspects, work, general happiness.
9	I do not agree at all. Social interactions are crucial to human mental health. It’s been proven over and over again that those who isolate themselves tend to die earlier. \n\n\nI also want a family. And I can’t find somebody to start a family with if I’m constantly holed up in my apartment. \n\n\nI used to think like you. I went to work, went home, watched tv, sleep, repeat. Sometimes add in a hobby or two depending on the day. But life without friends was driving me insane. \n\n\nIt’s like the popular saying about women “can’t live with em can’t live without em”. Same with friends. While social matters are frustrating and complex, I find it necessary for my mental health to seek them out. The more I seclude, the worse my depression gets. The more active I am socially, the less I feel depressed. When I have an active social life, I tend to not even feel the weight of depression at all. It’s only once I seclude myself that it seeps in. 
4	If you have such a hard time with interacting with people that you avoid them you might have more going on than just a personality type. I'm in somewhat the same head space as you...but it's because I'm autistic. Not saying this is necessarily the case, just throwing it out there as a possibility.
3	good things come the hard way. I struggle a lot with Ti (34 yo ENFJ) but thanks to using it a lot, now im a great leader in software development because I know my shit and I can lead easily with Fe. \n\nAs you age yoy realize how important is to develop your 4th function. And then you develop your shadow, or accept jt so that it doesnt act on its own and you can use it for a good cause . See the shadow as naruto’s kyubi: when not under control can be devastating. when under control can help you to be the hokage. Ok you have to see naruto to understand this.
3	eh it's not that. I honestly can deal with anyone, no matter how difficult they are. I'm always the only one that can get along with the difficult coworker. \n\nIt's just that in a social situation I just prefer not to deal with people if I can help it. 
3	> how complex and difficult people are.\n\nIt's like a game.  A very challenging one.  Most people don't know how the game works before they start playing, and I find that the people who find everyday interaction difficult, unwinnable, pointless, or overcomplex are the people most likely to be wrapped up in their own head at those times instead of really letting themselves shift into neutral, listen, and try to find something to learn and appreciate.  There is so much information being passed over typically, from body language, to subtext clues, little hints of other topics or opinions, statements about how their unique mind works, stories from their side...  all of it can add perspective, even if it isn't the thing you wanted to talk about.  I make more friends by shutting the fuck up and listening and asking questions than I do trying to talk, joke, impress, or cause controversy.\n\nWhat have you read on the topic of making friends / connections / working crowds / maneuvering conversations?  There are many great resources to help you find your footing or your place.  
2	I dont think the solution is to give up and not deal with people at all,but personally i will always like to be left alone and i enjoy being alone.Still its always nice to have couple of good friends to chat and laugh with.But nothing beats peace and solitude.
2	People (especially large groups) are often easier to deal with in small increments. For example just because you are invited to an activity that lasts from 7 to 11 doesn't mean you have to arrive at 7 and stay the entire time.  Its okay to arrive late and leave early without an excuse but a simple apology to the host may be a good idea.
2	Yea, it is hell.
2	I dislike dealing with large groups of people so I prefer not to.\n\nI like my small social group, and I much prefer 1 on 1 friendships/hanging out than group dynamics, because in a group I’ll more than likely stop paying attention, start thinking about all the things I could be doing, drift off figuratively and literally and end up doing my own thing.

1	Thankx ill look into that !
1	ISTP here i made a post earlier about focusing on people and building relationships and having low FE !	I think i worded it wrong what iment to say was would it be easier for people with inferior FE to not focus on people as in trying to figure them out and thier motives. Especially when people do stupid things or are trying to maby use you, i never make mistakes when it comes to things obviously because of Ti and the acting on the enviroment around me like fighting or driving anything physical and i cant really detect Ni. But when it comes to dealing with people im always to an extent getting used or people try to get over on me especialy and dating and relationships and i usualy get used or just barley avoid it any similar experiences ?
6	Just because something is easier doesn't mean you should do it
3	am an ISTP?	..
6	You sound like a feeler to me. I can't type people, so I wouldn't try to guess your type, but I don't think you're an ISTP.
3	Don't sound like an ISTP to me
2	You don't sound like an ISTP to me at all. It's difficult to type you since some of this could be down to your nature/mbti but lots of it is irrelevant to your type. Lots of this is just who you are right now based on your nurture and your immaturity. My advice would be to learn what the cognitive functions are, specifically what they mean in each position (especially in the shadow), and type yourself from there.
1	I actually think I fit both istp and isfp. We in the same boat
24	Ever find yourself falling hard for someone only to be turned off when they like you back?	\n
25	Yep..  I think it's the "chase" and lust. And once you get them it's kinda boring. I've had many 3 month relationships as they are the best part of it and then I get bored and go our separate ways.  
12	Probably you liked them for some stupid shallow reason in the first place
3	Not ‘falling hard’ but it’s important to recognise when something is going to go nowhere. \n\nIf you like someone and they don’t like you back, why waste any effort? 
5	Never, I cant think how someone can actually fall hard for someone. I mean is it like an obsession? Idk. Maybe because I never experience it. 
2	Maybe a touch scary when it becomes real?
2	Yup, just like eating food\n\nDo you eat it because you need to? Or because it tastes good?
-5	for sure. for me it’s always a power play. i used to have a few guys i would intentionally chat up (often married) with the goal of getting them to tell me i was beautiful or that they were DTF. once they did, i had no desire to act on it, so i just ghosted it let it fizzle out. i would love to say i’ve completely grown out of this.. but i still tend to gaslight men this way when i get bored. it’s not exactly a good habit, but there are worse things than entertaining myself and a bored dude. 
30	If I'm an ISTP, why am I content with doing nothing?	It's Saturday night and I could probably go out and engage in some Se-dominant activity (smoke weed with friends, get a good meal, work out or just go for a walk).  Yet I'm chill w/ just browsing MBTI articles and doing thought experiments in my head and just think about shit.  Can anyone else relate?  who knows, maybe I'm an INTP lol
38	Because people use stereotypes too much when talking about MBTI. I know I'm an ISTP and I also enjoy doing fuck all, I also hate engineering which is another one of the major stereotypes. We're all very similar but also different at the same time
21	Saving up energy for skydiving.
16	Because sometimes there’s nothing wrong with doing nothing. It’s called being introverted. Source: Currently doing nothing and I’m happy.
14	I think it has to do with 1. Ti making you want to research whatever your interests are, and if whatever else you should be doing isn't interesting enough you won't want to do it, and\n\n 2. Our se makes us live in the moment so if it's not on a deadline or even if it is you won't feel rushed to work on it if our ti is still researching something. \n\n3. Ni is the child so your living in the moment is taking precedence over wanting to think about what would happen if you didn't do what you need to.\n\nI've been trying to research cognitive functions so this is what I think it is. Csjoseph on YouTube is a big help.\n\nEdit: why the fuck did reddit replace my numbers with ones lol
8	Was content with doing that for a few years but lately been craving social interactions a lot more recently.
5	Where does it say that ISTP's aren't content with doing nothing? I missed that meeting I guess.
2	“Nothing” is subjective. 
2	If there's nothing I need to get done immediately, I revert to doing nothing. 
2	NTs are definitely content with thinking a lot, but may need a break after a while and may have a desire to vegetate. Combining Ti+Ni gives you an NT temperament.
2	Why does an ISTP drug addict use drugs all the time?
1	I consistently test as ISTP but all of these INTP traits keep bubbling to the surface.  There are times when reading through the INTP subs that I feel more like one of those heathens than any kind of proper ISTP.   I can ISTP with the best of them but most of the time I don't feel like it. Shit ISTPs are supposed to enjoy just seems like a boring pain in the ass most of the time. 
1	Cuz that's normal for a human. Also I heard ISTPs are "lazy." Same with ISFP, we're in our dream world all day and do nothing. 
1	because the myer brigg’s system is bullshit
7	Anyone else get overloaded sometimes when there is so much disorgsnization?	I'll come home and clean my house. Is clean. Me is happy. I go to work and come home to find more messes left by my family.  I clean.  Repeat. I come home to find a huge mess. I'm frozen with frustration at how messy it is, but alas I clean. Istp thing or just person thing
11	I hate other peoples mess. But I’m quite happy to make my own mess and leave it because there’s more important things I want to do right now. 
2	Have this too but I have ADD so I am guessing that's the reason.
2	Somebody in this god damned house keeps putting god damned silverware in the side of the sink with the god damned garbage disposal. You already know what happens next.\n\nSometimes in life I require discipline, and this is one of those times!
1	I get this way about leftovers. People eat all my freshly made food, but I eat the majority of leftovers while everyone else will buy fast food or canned shit. There are 3 pounds of ham, a pot of soup, and like burgers just waiting in the fridge. Eat the fucking food in there so I can buy and make more! Drives me fucking nuts, I'm gonna come home and the entire ham that has been in there for 2 weeks is still gonna be untouched until I slice some up for eggs.
0	You are the opposite of istp.\n\nA) SPs in general don’t “keep score” and expect others to reciprocate. Every other temperament does. \n\nB) our idea of clean is what others call “messy” and we are quite content in our mess PLUS we tend to get pissed off if anyone attempts to straighten our mess.\n\nMany of us recognize that we have a mess and are ready to pounce if some do-gooder dares straighten up.\n\nC) go back to your MBTI manual and look at P vs J again and give it some deep thought if you identify more with P or J.
22	What one thing annoys you beyond compare?	For me, it's when someone assumes we're best friends. There's this girl in my life who tries to be best friends with everyone without putting in the time to gain trust and I can tell she's just a flatterer. I hate it when she expects things from me since we're "good friends" like hugging her when I leave an event/gathering, to gossip with her about other people, or to talk to her as much as my actual best friends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat annoys me really badly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's something that annoys you really badly? 
29	When people talk at me at length about something I couldn’t possibly even feign interest in, but they don’t get the hint. I don’t like telling people to please STFU, honestly, so it’s probably at least half annoyance at myself. \n\nThis coworker who I am fortunately only going to have to work with for another week or so will do this to me constantly. Like,  idc wtf kind of TVs are on sale at Costco, fuck off and let me focus. 
12	People being too nice at work, weird but it annoys me to no end. Also, people talking about meaningless things because they can't stand silence.\n\nWell, people I guess.
13	Having my time wasted for no good reason. Whether that’s because people are driving slow AF, giving me way too in-depth/irrelevant explanations that I don’t need, being stuck in a meeting because my coworkers decide to argue the merits of something we’ve discussed 10 times before, or having to wait for a squat rack because someone decided it was a good place to do curls. I just hate it! I hate inefficiency lol.
10	When people interrupt/talk over me. Or when people overanalyze something insignificant I said/did and assume things about me.
18	People that get overly emotional about mundane things and people who don't use logic. 
8	Drivers who brake at green lights...wtf. Also, people who don’t let you back in after moving over for emergency vehicles. They think it’s a time to pass or gain ground or something? I don’t get it. \n\nBasically, shitty drivers. \n\nI must be the only one who doesn’t mind talkative people. I try to be polite and direct. “Hey, you mind if we continue this convo another time? I gotta finish this” Works just fine with me. I have learned to be assertive when my patience is tested because it wore me out in my younger days and ya know, most ppl are cool and don’t take offense. I like nice people. They don’t bother me. The world needs more nice people. \n\nI have very little tolerance for types that sermonize. “You should...do. You should be...” I actually hate these type of people. Unsolicited advice. No. Go fuck yourself. 
7	I hate when people try to explain something to me in an overly complicated way, it's like some people use so many words and don't really say anything at all if that makes sense. 
13	Generally I hate when people show absolutely no spatial awareness. stopping smack in the middle of the aisle at the store. leaving 2 car lengths in front of them. driving slowly in the passing lane/pacing the car in the other lane. walking really slowly. stopping in the middle of an open space to talk. I could go on. I would get so embarrassed if i got caught being so unaware of my surroundings. People forget they aren't the only ones in the world.
8	Loud breathing. I don't know what it is about it but whenever somebody's breathing too loud I just have the sudden urge to kill everyone in the room.
8	Someone telling me that my pursuit of so-called "extreme sports" is stupid, irresponsible, or frivolous because it doesn't meet THEIR definition of fun or risk vs reward.  But they make me happy, so isn't that good enough?\n \nLike fuck off, Karen.  I think yoga and board games are boring AF and you can easily spend a ton of money on those things too, but if it makes you happy, you do you and I'm not gonna judge.
5	Intellectual smugness
4	Anything inefficient.\n\nLately I’ve noticed that my housemates don’t fold boxes before putting them in the recycling. They wonder why the recycling bin is always full. I wonder why they’re so dumb.
2	When I tell someone about something that grosses me out and they immediately do the thing that grosses me out. 
2	Open mouth chewing. Close your damn mouth, you look like you’re 5 year old.
3	People who start drama just for the sake of entertainment. 
4	People who think I’m stupid because I want to understand every aspect of a problem/action before I move forward 
2	Having to repeat myself when I'm trying to do something. Almost feels like draining my energy and I'll probably just ignore them or tell them nevermind. \n\nHard to live with my curious kids sometimes but I do my best to repeat it so they understand. \n\nAlthough I have terrible hearing so I probably ask people to repeat themselves quite often as well
1	Insincerity 
1	Emotional thinking...
16	How do you feel about ISTP's being associated with "Dangerous Activity"?	The 16personalties page for ISTPs lists this as one of their faults: \n\n**Risky Behavior** – This stubbornness, difficulty with others’ emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. [ISTPs] have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation.\n\nI've never really seen that in myself, but what do you guys think?
36	Stubborn? Yes. Easily bored? Yes. Dangerous? No, controlled risk and willingness to take them.  
29	Dangerous activities: doing 100 on the freeway, getting into bar fights, relying on 16personalitites
10	pretty accurate
9	My whole life people have told me some of the things I do are crazy/stupid/reckless. I just laugh and say "Maybe for someone who doesn't know what they're doing". 
6	Accurate 
7	Yep, my risky behavior is motorcycles
4	This accurately describes my ISTP spouse
4	Sounds about right
4	The reason my body is too broken to do anything high risk in my 40s is because I was a fucking maniac in my 20s and 30s. \n\nAnd no, I wouldn't change a thing. I have kids now so I need some built in checks and balances. 
3	Definitely accurate. I do get a rush out of doing high risk and potentially dangerous stuff, but it’s usually pretty calculated.
2	if i know what im doin, like electrical work, no glove and fuses stay hot (120v and =<20 amps), free acupuncture
2	I'd say it's right. Motorcycles, dirt bikes, racing boats, cars, then thinning normal life would be boring so I joined the military.. I could definitely add a lot of things to the dangerous activity list but I think I'll pass for now.
2	I resonate pretty well with this. At one of my old jobs I could foresee a problem before it began and sometimes I’d let it go for awhile just for the sake of my personal entertainment.\n\nAs far as dangerous activity it’s more of controlled chaos. My small talk ability isn’t shabby because I don’t know how to do it. I don’t like small talk because the standard template is boring. I’d rather shake things up a bit and make it interesting. 
2	When the ground around you is flat, dry, and featureless and you don't feel like getting a ticket for speeding, you don't do much risky stuff. \nBut if I find a tree or a boulder you can bet I'n gonna climb it and/or jump from it
2	If there's something living in Mexico has taught me, is that 'dangerous' is a completely sensationalist term. \n\nI mean, people who have never set foot in this country are straight up *terrified* of the idea of visiting and, yet, I walk around on my own at night, have never even *heard* a gunshot, have never experienced any amount of crime, etc.\n\n'Dangerous' really isn't how I'd describe my country, yet other people do, because 'dangerous' can mean completely different things depending on who's saying them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo of my hobbies are what other people would consider 'dangerous' activities: I dive and I fight. \n\nBoth activities happen in relatively controlled environments, particularly the fighting, but they're described as dangerous because they carry risks: That is, you're risking yourself by doing them, even if performing said activities doesn't *feel* dangerous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy that logic, driving and going out can be dangerous. Drinking around strangers can be dangerous. Interacting with a strange dog can be dangerous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet those activities aren't classified as such.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how do I feel about it?\n\nI feel like it's a load of bull, that's what I feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNothing of what I do is dangerous or even risky and I think people who classify certain activities as dangerous or risky should just unclench and live a little for a change. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like the optometrist I saw last year. She freaked the fuck out when I told her that I boxed and demanded that I stopped doing it because 'I was risking my sight'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nClearly, she imagines something straight out of Fight Club, when in reality I'm in a well-lit gym, wearing gloves, protections and sparring against people with my own skill level, holding back because we're not actually trying to injure each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway. Apparently I had plenty to say about this subject. 
1	Ya but i'm pretty good at not losing control, unless the consequences aren't that great, then I'll definitely do some testing.
1	Yes Yes Yes
1	yeah i can stubborn, i guess i get bored easily but not often as i am always doing something.  \n\n\nDangerous is subjective and theres a few types of danger. i hate extreme sports or driving fast, but i used to take a lot of drugs and loved making homemade fireworks and i mowed my lawn with a blade on a chain for a while. People did get concerned over the way i was lawn mowing (ha i built a lawn mower once out of a vacuum cleaner, broken trolley and a bunch of kitchen knives) but i knew what i was doing.
1	Accurate.
1	sure if you think in black and white terms which is a flaw. it depends on what the person is good at and likes doing
19	Surrounded By Idiots	I've been finding myself increasingly frustrated with people that cannot use their heads to see why something is good or bad. It's always an emotional reaction or they say need more evidence to say there's a correlation.\n\nA recent example of all this is the recent move by Starbucks to put in needle disposal boxes in some bathrooms. I'm here thinking this doesn't change the fact that you have junkies that come into a bathroom that can be entered by everyone, just not paying customers. Very few people seem to realize this doesn't fix anything and it's exhausting me from all the frustration.\n\nIt's times like these (which seem to occur increasingly often) where I just want to avoid everyone.
26	[Yeah. Sure is tough. ](https://local.theonion.com/area-man-accepts-burden-of-being-only-person-on-earth-w-1819579668/) 
16	By the way, you're not always right
15	We value logic more than other people. I'm sure there are tons of people who are frustrated by your lack of empathy. Being smart isn't the most important trait in the world so yeah, they wont think as rationally as you do but you can be damn sure they do other things a lot better and that's worthy of respect. intelligence isnt the only aspect to judge people on.
14	You do realize it changes the fact that the reason for needle disposal boxes may be for employees not having to touch biohazard materials. 
3	Let them yell at the rain.
2	I remember when they announced this and like a week later an employee was poked while trying to remove one of the needles. I cope by shorting companies who do stupid things. Find a way to profit from others stupidity. 
2	It is important to remember that most people are dumber than you while driving. Also when walking or biking near a roadway.
2	[deleted]
3	Live your life. We are all unique if everyone seems stupid may be there is a problem in you? 
1	I know what you mean. Like do you need evidence that the pyramid of Giza has something to do with Giza? And then they make their inability to understand simple shit the center of the argument by pointing out that I dont have evidence for common sense
1	its a tactic to harvest more money and to show "acceptance"
1	[Hey I get it.](https://img.memecdn.com/idiots-everywhere_o_2134687.webp) I find myself in the same mindset but I try to remember to give people space to fail and learn. 
1	Te nemesis
1	What they put needle boxes there? That‘s fucking dumb. Just encourage it more and make the world a junkie friendly place then wtf is that logic😂
1	I was definitely like this in my teens, but as I got older I started to see other people's points of views more. I still sometimes get annoyed by things I find illogical just not as often.\n\nFor your example, it is probably for the safety of people who have to clean the bathroom. It's difficult to stop drug use in public bathrooms, even if you make the bathrooms customers only, what's stopping junkies from buying a cup of coffee and then shooting up. Having bathroom gaurds might be a better option but it's probably less money to install the boxes. It also makes it easier for people who need to use insulin needles and etc. 
1	Based on personal experience, I find that the reason why some people, including me, act like this sometimes is because they don't care enough to properly think things through. I'm not saying that they're actually stupid or dumb, but they usually just don't care enough and/or know enough about the subject to completely think through the subject and just rely on their initial assumptions.
1	> Very few people seem to realize this doesn't fix anything and it's exhausting me from all the frustration.\n\nSounds like you're the one not realizing that it does fix something.\n\nDrugs and drug users will never go away. Whether they're illegal and available on the black market, or they're legal and available at Walmart, drugs and users are here to stay. However, one related problem we can address is that of disease spread and other unhealthy practices, including the general stigma of needle use and the fact that users feel they need to hide their use which leads to unhealthy methods of use and disposal. What the needle disposal containers do is give users a safe, anonymous place to dispose of needles that may carry disease. At the other end of this process are clean need programs which provide new needles to users. The whole idea here is to reduce stigma and reduce disease. And if one day drugs are actually legal, getting rid of the stigma associated with their use will be very important to convincing users to actually participate in legal methods to acquire and use drugs.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is pull your ISTP out of your ass and think the problem through before you start complaining.
1	I get frustrated by people who get frustrated by others for being idiots but are incapable of properly writing themselves
1	Pretty big leap in logic for you to extrapolate the decision making of a corporate coffee chain's bathroom policy to the rest of the world around you... Seems like one fueled by your own personal emotions towards your surroundings.
7	ISTP: The Operator?	Ultra-logical, fearless, physically skilled, unassuming, highly tuned to their surroundings, adaptable, resilient, adrenaline junkies.\n\nTo me, everything about the ISTP says special forces and I'd like to know, of the ISTPs on this thread, how many of you have been, will be or currently are anticipating joining the special forces?\n\nTo put my cards on the table, I have no real interest in SF but it strikes me that the role is ideal for ISTPs, and I wanna know whether you guys have realisesd this also. Love from an ENTP.
9	It's always been an interest of mine. Former Air Force Medic and wanted to try PJ. However, the idea of being away from my family so much has always kept me from doing it. Instead, I am applying to med school and dream of being a trauma surgeon or ER physician. Still a lot of time away from family but less than SF.
18	I have no interest in signing my freedom away or going through the unbelievably inefficient bullshit that US troops go through. My free time is mine to waste as I please.
6	I will be. Need to finish college, and a few trainings, but am planning on it. Already in the National Guard as airborne, so making progress.
6	I’d love to be in the special forces. But I’m not willing to do what it takes to get there. I’m not willing to sacrifice my free will, logic, and reason to blindly follow somebody with a higher rank than me. I’d be booted for insubordination the first time they tried to make me mop a parking lot or clean the bathroom with a toothbrush. That’s nothing other than them saying my time is worthless and not valuable. Fruitless labor is a massive waste of time. Especially when you know it’s fruitless before undergoing the task. \n\n\nI refuse to sacrifice logic and reason to follow some meathead with a superiority complex. And the second I get a command that void of logic and reason, I wouldn’t be able to keep my mouth shut. \n\n\nI have nothing but respect for the men and women in the service. But I am an individual capable of rational and creative thought. I’m not a mindless drone designed for carrying out someone else’s orders. 
3	Im looking into marsoc if i want to reup 
3	The only thing that rubs me the wrong way is just the attitude in the military, that whole sit down shut up and do as your told thing rarely ever goes over well with istps. Get me to where I’m flying something tho, I could put up with any bullshit to fly
3	When I was in the Army I was tempted to become an Army Ranger. The problem is once you’re in it’s hard to get specialized schools unless you know someone or renegotiate your contract when you re-enlist. Even then, it’s based on the needs of the Army and your occupation. For example my specialty was telecommunications. So it was based on whether or not the Army needed a telecommunications soldier who was a Ranger.
3	When your vision is 20/500, you don't qualify for anything special. 
3	Conscientious objector as an istp.   I find weapons fascinating but I find their use for killing to be rather dull minded.  \n\nEdit: also fuck rules
3	Too many rules and bureaucracy that are not practical \n\nThat's why I work in startups. the skills set are similar to those you described and I'm not putting my life at risk for tasks I don't agree with it 
2	Tried to, but colorblind.
2	Right. When I deployed to Iraq years ago I was in the 10th Mountain Division which is a light infantry unit that specializes in mountain combat. In Iraq it was pointless as our operating area was mostly rural flatlands, but I’m sure it served them well when the unit deployed to Afghanistan as it’s mostly a mountainous region.\n\nAs far as individual jobs and specialties go; overtime some jobs are decommissioned forcing soldiers in that field to reclassify to another specialty the Army needs. I wanted to reclassify into another job, but because of the high demand of my job, I was not able to. The way the Army sees it is, “Why pay to train this soldier to learn another job when he’s already skilled in a job we currently have a need for.”\n\nHoped this answers your question.
2	if i'd be able to join, i'd want to fly jets, another problem is, to fly in the airforce it's almost impossible to qualify for the average person
2	Yeah, sounds like a great job for ISTPs, except for the part where I don't like following orders I don't believe in. Many ISTP folks are prone to breaking rules they don't agree with and that is *not* a good trait for the military. Actually that's one of the worst traits possible for the military. I'd be surprised if we made it through training. Hell I never even spoke to a recruiter because that entire process sounds miserable.
1	It's always sounded nice but my tolerance for bullshit is rather low. When you figure out how the world works you tend to not want to be used as a pawn in that military industrial complex, putting your life on the line merely for the profits of someone else. This is aside from taking orders unquestioning and being talked down to by "superiors".\n\nI would think that if there are Special Forces ISTPs (which I'm sure there are) they are more likely conditioned with some sort of extreme nationalism, are probably more heavily using Se rather than Ti all their lives, just don't give a damn and do it because why not, or find it as a means to an end like getting out and becoming a highly paid mercenary/security detail for something like Blackwater (what it used to be called). 
1	Sure, murdering people sounds like fun. But then again following orders and hierarchies are not my thing. So meh.
3	I took an online test, modeled after the Myers-Briggs one. It said I was an ISTP. How accurate would a free shorter test be compared to the actual MB one?	
6	I took the 16personalities test 6 times and got INFP, ISFP, and ENFP. Those were all incredibly wrong and it wasn't until I learned what each letter individually meant. I came to the conclusion that I was an ISTP that way. If you don't feel confident that you're an ISTP, try swapping one of the letters and reading up on that personality; It's often just one letter that's out of play if any are.  
6	The fact you're looking for a more efficient way to take the test is probably a good sign you're an ISTP. Haha 
3	The test is only as useful as the test taker is able to be objective about themselves.  \n\nWhich is, to say, not terribly so if you aren't going to try to *do* something with this information.  And if you are, you will need to learn more about the system and more about yourself.\n\nAnd if you *do* continue to study type in any capacity, you'll outgrow the need for a test to point you in the right direction.
2	1 or 2 freebies out there are actually decent, but I agree with other statements. Any of the MB tests, actual or facsimiles... they're only as good as you are at being objective of yourself. And I would certainly read up on the differences in each letter and try to assess yourself that way as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough, I went at it from a different perspective. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn recent tests I mostly got ISTP and INTP. Pretty close for each, but mostly leaning toward INTP is what the tests told me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, then I looked at the recommended careers for people in either personality type, and was surprised at how many of the careers in ISTP that I'd actually considered in my life. A LOT. I love technical fields and practical applications for the sciences. I also considered a few careers in INTP, but not nearly as many. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I discussed it with my wife, to get an external view on my personality type. We agreed I was definitely ITP, but she also believed that I was mostly a Sensory type, in that she often sees that I enjoy doing projects with my hands,  more than just simply conceiving the ideas of those things. I get a sense of pride from building or using something technical. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I settled on the fact that I'm an ISTP-type and went from there. 
2	i have found this one to be super accurate http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp
1	Take it again with a friend. I'm ENFJ and I always got ENFJ but my best friend was getting a different answer everytime he did it. I finally did the test for him and he got ISTP. The test is good for a starting point but I recommend researching the different types in depth those letters don't mean much its the functions that really matter.
14	Dating an ENFP	I love my girlfriend (even though I rarely say it unprompted). We've been dating for 3 years. We have fun together when we go out and I'm proud of her for being successful at her job. We moved in together about a year ago and things have really started deteriorating lately. I've overlooked and gotten used to things like she's not a very good housekeeper or has much knowledge about culture, because I understand I have quirks that are probably annoying to her. \nMy problem really lies in the fact that she doesn't understand I need space sometimes. She's very clingy and always wants to be touching or hanging out together. I feel like I give her that a lot, but she's been willing to give me space less and less. I even try staying up late just to get some alone time, but even that has been causing problems lately because she wants me to snuggle her. Ugh\nShe's also highly emotional. She wants me to think she's a strong, independent woman, but her clinginess and high emotions prove otherwise, to me. \n\nI don't like walking away if I feel like something can be fixed, but she's wearing me out. 
5	My marriage to an ENFP didn’t work out for exactly those reasons you stated. They’re great fun, but ultimately our interests diverged a little too much for us to maintain the relationship. 
3	I know I'm going against my type here but I don't think "highly emotional" disproves strong and independent per se. Clinginess on the other hand....that's debatable. \n\nHave you told her what you told said in this post? I'd say it pretty much verbatim (except the part challenging her strength and independence, that's going to cause hurt feelings and will distract from the main issue anyway). Then you can determine together whether you guys will be happy compromising. You could try to arrange specific time together where you give her 100% undivided attention and she in turn could give you space at arranged times where you are 100% free from having to do any of that, something along those lines. If you guys can't come up with some sort of compromise that you're both content with, then it's pointless to keep it up.
4	I’m an ENFP and the times that I get clingy and overly emotional with my boyfriend are the times I feel out of control / unhappy with ‘us’ / not emotionally close at all...\n\nwhen I’m/we’re good, I’m happy to go do my own thing and have space. she also may be unhappy and projecting it onto you because you are steady and stable and supportive? \n\nThe more you back off, in my experience, the clingier she’ll get.. so try hard to nurture the relationship / find out with wrong with her... or if you don’t want to do that (or if you simply don’t care) then perhaps you aren’t as well equipped to fulfil her emotion needs and should rethink your relationship with her..\n\nif you’re bothered then read: men are from mars, women are from venus (chapter 5 might be handy) cos think it might be relevant (you can get free pdf just type on google)
6	Enfp here.   If she's real clingy then there's like an anxious attachment or anxiety.   None of the main enfp stresses are related to some clinginess and most of us are really really independent and hold multiple realities in our heads which makes it (usually) easy to accept if our bf says he needs his own space to process things.   \n\n\nEnforce the boundary and she will get used to it and her si would calm down.  Otherwise you're dealing with something not related to a normal enfp
3	May I ask the age range of you two.
3	Think /r/enfp might be of better help. Hope it works out.
3	Clingy girls(people) in general are a huge turn off. This is why I tend to date introverts now, they give you some space. I used to think I needed an extrovert to keep me interested and invite me places but then I grew up and realized I can plan and make time for someone I care about. I dated an ENFP and she was similar to what you are experiencing but it has been the same with other extroverts I've dated. Not to say all of them are clingy but they tend to *appear* clingy to us introverts more easily.
3	Take this with a grain of salt.\n\nSome people get attached to ISTPs because we rarely complain, have patience of an elephant, and can think through the problems flawlessly, even though we know we aren't really feeling good already. I'm not sure if you have an honest conversation together about your needs and healthy boundaries, but you two should.\n\nThings that you've expressed can mean you've also allowed her to behave like that, and that you've probably been an "enabler". Same things are stressing you out, have filled your cup and you know that this might lead to a very dangerous outburst. And ENFPs I know are horrible at being confronted. \n\nBe honest as early as now. Take her into a level-headed two-way conversation, and maybe you'll also know what exactly she needs and can also work on them. \n\nYou'll know whether you need a person in your life if they can handle conversations like this.
3	Communication is key. Just be open an honest about your feelings and requirements. Early in our relationship, when we first moved in together, my INFJ girlfriend an I had a few similar issues but they were easily resolved by being honest and open with one another.
2	In socionics, you'd either be LSI or SLI. LSI would mean that your conflictor is ENFP, if SLI it would mean that ENFP is your duality type. Meaning it is either the best type you could ever date or the absolute worst. I recommend you review each type relationship. LSI conflictor and SLI duality, see which one fits the most and then you can get a better understanding of where you're currently at with your partner. Many say that duality is bullshit, in reality it's just bullshit in MBTI. This is socionics intertype theory 
1	I \[ENFP\] can only speak from personal experience, but my partner \[ISTP\] and I had a very tumultuous first 3 to 4 years of our relationship. We had very different expectations of what a relationship should entail and should look like, and were not equipped with the understanding that we needed to communicate them to each other - in the other's language. So I resorted to passive aggressiveness, bitterness and insecurity in an attempt to get from him what I needed in a partner; he responded dismissively, with a vengeance not to be 'tamed' by my 'rules,' per se, and a blatant disregard for how I felt. It inevitably came crashing to a painful halt, where we took away our titles of 'boyfriend' and 'girlfriend,' remained friends, had the space that we needed to see the other as an individual (not as our partner), learned to appreciate the other as a person, and understand what was needed to better communicate and thus be better to each other, in general. We got back together months down the track, and now we are a little over a month from celebrating nine fulfilling years together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe difference now is that I openly and respectfully tell him how I feel, instead of tell him how he is the one responsible for making me feel how I feel. I have translated the 'me time' that I use for myself to recharge my batteries to equate to the silence and space that he needs to process stimulus/his surroundings, and ground himself. I know how much imbalance I feel when I am not left to indulge myself in 'me,' so I interpret that he would very much feel the same way when I don't give him the space that he needs. Our idea of 'me time' is now religious in our relationship, sacred to the health and success of our relationship, and we both appreciate and identify the need to be our own people, who then can grow together as a couple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an ENFP, a signature trait for us lies in authenticity -  I don't function well knowing that I don't have the time to authentically reconnect with me and get back to my roots; spending the time doing the things that ultimately make me, me. It's important to me to be my own person with my own identity who invests my time in me - so, understanding that he also needs his own time to re-center, to find himself again after a long day by switching off from an 'us' into a 'me,' is a really healthy thing for him to maintain who he is as an individual, and consequently a really healthy thing for us as a couple as we are still whole as people, and not halves that constantly need the other to feel whole again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you'll be able to take something from my own experience that will be helpful to the health of your relationship. I think ISTPs and ENFPs can have very lasting, healthy, strong and enviable relationships when they tap into communicating openly and honestly with their partners - in the other's 'language.'
1	Sounds 100% like my ex. Relationship did not survive.
1	Sounds like my ex. The more clingy she got the more I started to resent her and found things she did that made me resent her. Your mistake, loosely used here, was moving in with this person. This tends to kill a lot of relationships as mystery wears off. It's not just some MBTI thing. \n\nWorst part is the more you push away in needing space/alone time, the more she's going to want to be near you and then you're going to resent her more.
2	If You Had A Do-Over	1) What is your current occupation?\n2) Are you 100% satisfied?\n3) If you could go back and do something else, what would you do and why?

3	1) still in college, doing cs\n\n2) somewhat, still cant decide what i should major in, cs or ce\n\n3) doing the things i am now, except not fucking around in college, add meds helped me curb trolling professors and leeching assignments from others. and not going to university, but instead going to community college.\n\nhell if i could redo the past, i'd do it, though you learn a lot from mistakes

2	1. Information Technology, corporate Help Desk, dealing mostly with company employees instead of external customers. \n2. Hmm...not 100%. But I'd say mid-to-high 90 percentile.\n3. This is what I'd do. But I'd try to get an earlier start. I've only been in the IT field for about 2 or 3 years. I was interested in getting into it at one point earlier in life, but never did. Lack of higher education, lack of knowledge base, and lack of connections to people who were in those sorts of gigs. But since I'm here now, I'm also starting my education with computer programming and software development on my own time. So, it is what it is. 
2	1. Client relationship manager. I have 1100 clients that I regularily sell marketing and promotional materials to.\n2. I am about 40% satisfied. It's close to home and I am good at it. \n3. I would make a damn good PI.

I still work full time tho so I’m very busy. (The opportunity fell into my lap to start it) so learning that from ground up will give me more freedom. I eventually want to leave my job for full self-employment. 
13	How tough is your skin?	I feel like idgaf about what anyone says most of the time, and like my confidence is high enough to block most negativity or hate, even though I hate being judged or the thought of it? Despite being seen as "tough skinned", when it comes to people I actually care about, specifically my SO for example, I feel like I take things to heart too much and can go from having a really good day to a bad one quite fast. Is anyone else like that? 
19	I'm thick skinned in the sense that I can choose to let stuff go. But I grew up as a depressed kid, and some of those tendencies to feel defeated or disliked and wanting to be liked, are still present to some small degree in my head. I'll get home at the end of the day and sometimes dwell on whatever was said. On a rare occasion, I'll have some restless nights. My toughness, to me, is that I can keep pushing through. Logically, I know the feelings will go away or numb at some point. And I'm not usually emotional, and a lot of times I really don't care what people think, but sometimes I'm caught off guard on an already bad day. So I can't say that I entirely relate, but I get where you're coming from. If I'd had a different upbringing, I'd probably be much more like you. But my childhood was pretty rough.  
4	If somebody insults I just don’t care. However I won’t do anything about it either which I think is seen as externally not confident but internally I’m confident enough to not care what somebody says about me 
6	When it comes to generic insults, I'm a rhinoceros. When I say "I've been called worse by better people", I'm not even exaggerating. Hell, external sources probably can't even top my inner monologue.\n\nDon't insult my competence in my chosen profession though.
3	About a 4 or 5 on the Mohs scale. 
5	Oh man. Yeah I hate that about myself actually. I get offended too easily if I feel disrespected or misunderstood. It's probably my least favorite personality trait. 
4	[deleted]
4	  I'm pretty detached and logical in day to day life- so yes, thick skinned.  \nIn most cases it's not about you, it's about the insulter's struggles.  I just leave it for them to fight.  
3	Yes I am somewhat like that. For most interactions, people can say whatever they want to my face. It's just their opinion, I take note but do not take it personally. Depending how they say it, I may impose some respect or go seek people and make them tell me things to my face - not because I need that but it's because it's important to maintain a decent and respectful social environment. I do introspect about certain remarks if many people make them.\n\nWhen it comes to very close people I am very thin skinned, there have been times my girlfriend made me cry with harsh remarks. But this has been improving a lot since I crossed my 30s, I stopped taking things to heart from close people and being more logical/rational about it.\n\nI may not be the best ISTP example since I have some borderline personality tendencies, which did affect my youth but are now under control.\n\nEDIT: grammar.. 
3	For the most part I don’t care what people think unless I already think what they said might be true and especially if I have respect for them then it can hurt more
3	I'm fairly thick skinned, personal attacks don't bother me. I am who I am. If I didn't like me, I'd change it. So telling me something you don't like about me really doesn't mean anything. After all, I'm me for me, not me for you.\n\nAnyway, what does drive me crazy, however, is when those opinions are formed from misinformation or a misunderstanding. I will go out of my way to clear up the misunderstanding (which will probably appear to others as me being thin skinned), but honestly, I'm just trying to give the person the information. If they still don't like me after all misunderstandings have been cleared up, then I don't care anymore.\n
6	[I'll just leave this here.](https://i.imgur.com/ALJhXOL.jpg)
2	Same. 
2	Its pretty dependent on where it’s coming from. Basically the more I care about a person and their opinion, the more I take their words to heart. When someone I love and trust tells me something I don’t want to hear, it’s hard, but I know I probably need to hear it. If some random acquaintance says something I don’t want to hear, it goes in one ear and out the other. 
2	Pretty tough but not impenetrable. I’m actually more sensitive than I let on but damn if I will ever let someone see. I had a tough time recently after a LTR (person I thought I would marry) ended and spoke with a friend about it. \n\nI teared up. He said, “Whoa. Ive never seen you cry” Ive known him for 8 years and that kind of made me laugh and shook me out of it. “Well don’t tell anybody!!” Lol. 
1	100% accurate for me. don’t give any shits about what people say to me or about me—unless they are one of the like 3 people in my inner circle. then something simple can sometimes devastate me. still super uncommon, but definitely possible. 
1	Seems like I choose what upsets me and what doesn't completely randomely, with no process whatsoever. If the thing is not about me, I'll get over it instantly, but if it's something personal - unresolved esteem issues, probably - then I could carry that grudge for a long ass time. 
1	I'm pretty thick skinned, but I hate when someone insults my intelligence. (As in treating me like a child, not by calling me stupid.)
1	That's true for me as well-- at least right now. \n\nI have a muted, but high confidence. People don't get to me unless it's my parents. My mother is the only one who can lecture me until I cry. Though her effect is fading some now that I'm nineteen.\n\nShe's a great mom, but in an argument, she's got a way to twist every word that comes out of your mouth while refusing to believe anything she said was off. 
1	There's one thing that can trigger me but otherwise I'm generally nonchalant 
5	istps and social anxiety	anyone here have any tips for an istp dealing with social anxiety? 
5	Learn some jokes or memorize interesting facts. People love to laugh and learn. Also, don't put so much pressure on yourself to perform in an "acceptable" manner. Not everyone is as fickle as our ISTP brains tell us they are. \n\nI still get social anxiety but it's much less of a problem than it used to be because I've developed this technique. 
3	I used to have moderate social anxiety before I started my latest job that requires me to talk to people pretty frequently. Still not good at small talk but the feeling of dread has mostly gone away. My advice would be to power through it and talk to more people, unless of course you have very severe social anxiety...I don't think that would work and I'd recommend therapy. I've learned that most people really don't care if you're awkward or w/e. Just laugh and move on, you'll get better each day if you try to improve.
1	Just my two cents and personal anecdote. I had pretty bad social anxiety since I was a child and when I talk about it with friends I’ve made in my adult life they say they wouldn’t have known I had it. \n\nI’m talking full on I could barely talk anyone, much less higher authorities (teachers, and later supervisors) without having panic attacks. It took a long time and a lot of personal work to not be so broken. \n\n It was a lot of exposure therapy-basically just suck it up and do it, realize you didn’t die and it’s now a small percentage better. It took me years (probably between 5-10 years)  to be the mostly comfortable person I am today but it might have been easier or less time, or both if I had the money for therapy.\n\nTLDR: interact with humans (didn’t die-which is the worst possible outcome), repeat 
1	if you’d rather go the drug route than interact with more humans (i’ve gone both routes successfully, then once the anxiety was gone i realized i just prefer to stay home anyway), adderall helps. i used to drive to the grocery store and sit in the car thinking about how draining it would be to go inside before starting the car back up and just going home. lol. haven’t done that for ages now. two thumbs up. drugs are the easy solution, hard work interacting with people is the mature solution. 
1	I would say learn some tricks or useless knowledge. Social anxiety is something I ahve never struggled with. I got a large helping of DGAF.
1	When I’m at work and I deal with customers I have to be very PC. When I engage my coworkers however, I’m very non PC and they seem to appreciate that as I’ll say what others are thinking but no one dares to say.\n\nExample: today we were chatting in a group and my manager asked for a cigarette. “Nesko has a cigarette.” I pull the pack out of my pocket and tell him to “Pick your poison.” He responds with, “I can’t see a black guy smoking a cigarette.” My response, “What do you see us smoking?” He pauses. Someone else in the group, “Wow you really took it there.” The look on the manager’s face= priceless.
1	All about practice my dude. Exposure really helps even though it’ll suck at the beginning. \n\nProbably not the best advice but alcohol helps me when it comes to work stuff where I gotta be social with strangers... 
3	I think I wouldn't like you as an ISTP	Or maybe I'm thinking ESTP, but holy fuck we do everything for shits and giggles huh? Does anyone get a similiar feeling?
17	I'm sometimes careless with the way I say things. It's not for shits and giggles and sometimes when I look back at something I said to someone earlier in the day, I remember the way they kind of flinched, or how their body language changed, and I'm like "Wow, I'm a shitty person." It's not intentional. I'm just not always present in the right way when I talk to people. I feel bad about it, but I can't spend my life crying over "spilt milk." So I move on. 
2	Somewhere along the line I became the funny crazy guy in my friend group. I think part of it is just me rebelling against he monotony of group think. When everyone steers left we steer up!\n\nDoing things the "normal" way gets very boring, very quickly. I find myself doing and saying things just to make things interesting. 
1	Well its not unique to ISTP but some of us.
1	True. I've done a pond skim (skied down a run and tried to ski across a pond) in front of a crowd, in a blow up dinosaur costume more than once. Why? For shits and giggles.
1	is this some sort of a offmychest for a relationship you're in or am i not understanding something
21	ISTP Confidence	I've seen loads of stuff written about how ISTP's have a certain confidence about them, so I was thinking about why that is and think I may have worked it out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think that ISTP confidence is something we just have. Thinking back to when I was a really young kid, I was apprehensive about a lot. I wasn't scared to try stuff(most of the time), but I wasn't really confident I could pull things off either. I think the confidence comes from time and experience with Ti/Se. Ti gauging what is possible/figuring things out and Se pushing us to put our Ti to the test. So we're constantly testing ourselves and our ability to figure things out. Through that trial and error, eventually we get more and more successful at doing things and build more confidence that whatever comes our way, we can handle it. It's just the nature of Ti/Se, always putting itself to the test and being refined by the fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is also why, when we fall into the Ti/Ni loop, one of the first things to bleed out is our confidence. It's because we've stopped putting ourselves to the test with Se. Without testing yourself, getting tangible results and knowing where you stand, how can you be confident you can handle it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?
31	I think we just don't give a shit about the stupid crap people normally worry about, that looks like confidence.\n\nI'm not overly confident I'll be good at everything. But I'm willing to try and learn from my mistakes. That's how I do get good at everything. One of many examples of things that people normally worry about that I don't - the fear of failure.
12	I can mostly agree with your thoughts on confidence over time due to experience. Though, I feel like that can apply to most personality types. People in general become more confident in doing something, after they've done it enough times to feel like they're getting the hang of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I feel like my "confidence" actually comes down to "I don't care anymore."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was always anxious to make friends, but was generally shy or reserved. I was also a little nerdy. I read a lot. But I'd try maybe a little too hard to come out of my shell, a little too hard to try to make friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started to hit a point in my mid and late 20s, where I began to realize that I didn't want other people controlling my emotions, particularly with regard to my sadness, my depression, my anxiety and all that. I'd had enough of that as a kid. I just wanted to stop caring. And after a while, whenever I started to worry, or felt self-conscious, or felt like I wasn't good enough, I'd remind myself that those feelings have to do with wanting others to like me, not feeling good enough for someone else. Those feelings had nothing to do with liking myself. And so, I'd remind myself to forget everyone else. Who cares? What do I want? How do I want to see myself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd over time, the "confidence" got easier. Being happy with myself got easier. It takes practice and it takes time, but constantly reminding yourself that you don't have to be perfect for anyone else is the key.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing a little self-conscious, or being occasionally depressed, that never goes away for those who've experienced it, but I no longer experience it anything like how I did as a young person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I just worry about what I want to do with my future, and about how I can bring a smile to my wife's face. She's my best friend. I don't need to impress anyone but her and me.
8	I just thought it came from being too stubborn and prideful to let anyone or anything "win" against me in life
6	I'm a nervous wreck when I'm in Ti-Ni loop. A visit to the gym usually fixes that.
2	People often mistake my apathy for confidence, it seems that to the outside world they can appear very similar.
2	I’m confident in a few areas and quite unconfident in many others.
2	I think my confidence has soared since finishing an education. I now know more about myself from travelling, and working, than I ever did throughout my schooling and university life. I think a main reason being everyone is pushed into an academic system that we are not necessarily suited for. Although I worked hard in my final year of school and did reasonably well, I was never considered particularly intelligent. I had plenty of talents (music, art and dwelled in sport), but it's only since leaving academia, that I've been able to show my real personality and skills throughout my various employs. That's where I have developed confidence in my abilities, and what I consider a different kind of intelligence. I love how I am a whizz at computers, can problem solve, am quick at learning, am calm in a crisis, can think fast and act rationally.
2	Pretty much all my confidence is of a practical nature, built through trial and error. But that's more related to me doing things, rather than *myself* if that makes any sense. For example, my confidence that I can fly any airplane my workplace puts me in is unwavering; however, my confidence on a personal level can easily be broken by a cute girl or a 6 year old just as effectively.\n\nI'm terrified of heights and refuse to go rock climbing, but that's why I'm building a truck to do it for me. The fact that I can redirect my efforts to areas where I know I'm confident looks like confidence to everyone else, but actually it's just me expertly bitching out. Probably why I stay single!
2	I think it's an inherent part of our personality, but its not a social confidence. it's a "i dont see why i cant do anything" confidence. And it is actually just that straight forward. We literally dont see why not, we dont see why its not possible, we dont see why something isnt worth trying, isnt allowed, shouldnt be tested or tried or experimented with, and we dont believe or respect obstacles that would prevent this. \n\nIts like a physical belief in yourself, that you should be able to do anything the same way you should be able to walk or breathe. Our logic is extremely simple, and just applies the same logic of "okay i dropped a ball on the floor. that ball is there because of me. i put it there, i did that, it was easy, all it took was movement and effort and learning," to literally everything else. whether it be flying on our own, traveling, learning new skills, trying new stuff. We approach it all the same way. Its not quite, "where theres a will theres a way" because we dont think that our will manifests the possibility, but we have confidence and belief that our action does. And yknow what? We're fucking right about it. \n\nAction is what causes change. This is second nature knowledge to us. And because of it, so too is our confidence. So subconscious that we arent even aware its there or that it is even a type of "confidence" in itself. 
1	I think it's our Ti hero specifically that, when immature, makes us very arrogant and look at people like they're all stupid.\n\nAs we mature our Te nemesis, we realize that others aren't stupid, but instead that we are reaaallly good thinkers. So our arrogance slowly turns into confidence.
1	If I’m trying to learn something, a new skill or ability, I don’t like to do it ‘in public’ until I’ve at least mastered it in some sense. So then when I do do it being watched, I’m already self assured that I will ‘get it right’. \n\nThen, if I have a bunch of things I can repurpose to adapt to a new situation, I can improvise a solution. \n\nThat probably comes off as somewhat confident, but it’s really just situational analysis, because if I really can’t do something then I won’t do it. 
77	What people must see when I’m not talking enough	
16	Yeah, lots of people say this to me. Even people I've know for a long time. I just enjoy the silence. Everything is going just fine with me lol, no need to worry.
9	Do any of you say you're fine when you're not though? My husband does. I've learned it means "I"m not fine at all but I don't want to talk about it" which is fine, but he certainly doesn't act fine because I know him well enough to see a clear difference being that I've known him for well over a decade. 
3	Story of my life.
4	ENFP - Apparantly you all hate them	So I have done the unimaginable, and read the subreddit of a ST type: the istp.\n\nWhy did I do this? \n\nI suspected to find friendliness and compatibility\n\nWhat did I actually find?\n\nAn extreme sense of irritation for the ENFP.\n\nPlease tell me why.\n\n—————————————\n\nIn theory we are supposed to be duals, as in most fitting for a relationship (good friends/romance). But as I said I am not really finding that idea here haha, quite the opposite.\n\nI am a guy btw
16	My best friend (dated once) and ex are ENFP. Not about hate but even though we are very compatible, what traits we like about each other also causes irritation. \n\nI find that over time this relationships sours due to resentment and our core ways of being are NOT compatible. \n\nAt first, it’s all roses and refreshing and wow!\nThe best honeymoon period of any relationship I have ever been in and it lasted 2 years (5 yrs total). Great banter and humor between us. \n\nBUT the truth is, it’s very hard to SOLVE problems in this relationship, instead they just get RESOLVED. Breakthroughs and understandings don’t happen and if they do? It would cause one partner to change to such an extent it becomes unnatural for them. \n\nSo, the same problems repeat until the bubble bursts and these relationships end up with one partner trying to change the other. Or at least being very unhappy with who the other person actually is. “I love you but I don’t like you”\n\nI have found enfp’s to sort of be “users” of istps. Not necessarily negative because we like to be of help but enfp’s are manipulative (how it appears to us). Fi/Te can be very manipulative. Saying what they want while leaving out information purposefully(truthful but not honest) to get a desired result. To istps, we want honesty and when we see this behavior (we are very perceptive) we make note and over time we become suspicious of the person we love. We see the enfp as having motivation that may not be pure or out or love for us but for what’s best for them but making it seem like it’s for our benefit. 
10	> In theory we are supposed to be duals\n\nYou didn't read the theory properly, your dual are ISTJs
8	ISTPs are thinkers. We make our decisions logically. We don't show our feelings much and we definitely don't let emotions cloud our judgement. We do what needed to be done. What is right is right. What is wrong is still wrong, no matter how it makes anyone feels. \n \nI haven't read much about ENFP but a few of my close friends are so I can tell a bit about them. You guys FEEL a lot about everything. Yeah, that annoys me sometimes but it isn't necessarily a bad thing. I know you have so much empathy and you care about those around you. Our world needs this too. \n\nNow, if you've been here long enough, you'll see that some ENFPs come here just to complain about us and tell us what we should do to be "better" in their definition. I don't like the idea that you force your own judgment on people. Both of us are very different and whatever is good/comfortable for you might not make us feel the same way. Many times we try to explain, they don't listen. They're here to rant (which is fine if you tell us that's what you are here for. But do tell us first so we don't have to spend our time trying to talk to you). One thing I can tell you is that it is extremely exhausting to reason with someone who seems to but actually isn't willing to listen. \n\nHowever, I do think some comments from ISTP towards other types are too strong. We don't care much about what others think and being in our own subreddit, surrounded by our type, perhaps make some people feel too much at home. True, we shouldn't tolerate what we think doesn't deserve our patience but being an ISTP isn't an excuse to be a jerk. MBTI should help us grow to be a more rounded person and understand differences in people. If others want to know about us and pay us a visit, we as a host should give them the same respect. \n\n\n\n
7	i literally hate ENFPs. of all the types (besides maybe INFJs.. and maybe ESFJs), they irritate me the most. i’ve had intimate experience with 3 of them and they were so extraordinarily insecure and tortured by the experience of violating their “morals”, but only about random shit that no one else in the world would ever care about. but then they go on and on like a martyr, externally processing their bullshit FOREVER. just to start the loop over again when they finally finish. \ni almost feel bad that was such an outburst.. but i also definitely don’t. lol. ENFPs are dark, twisty, emotional, irrational, and selfish, and i want nothing to do with them. but i wish them all the best. :)
8	Your type doesn't matter, if you're stupid or controlling, I don't like you.\n\nEDIT - also lazy. 
6	We don't hate ENFP but almost every post about relationships with an ISTP are from ENFP's being confused about our behavior. 
4	I was gonna give an answer but it seems to have been covered. Moving on.
3	What is your type?
3	My former best friend/roommate was an ENFP and it started out really fantastic but after awhile she suddenly stopped talking to me and ghosted me. \n\nAt first we got along really well. We liked the same things and had similar life styles. We were roommates the last two years of college and then friends for another two years after. She was always very strongly opinionated about things and I always just kind of went along since I was not. She would always rant to me about her family and boyfriend and would text me to rant all hours of the night. I would say I wasn't busy so she could vent even when I was tired or was busy. No matter what she would ask me for advice but wouldn't listen to any of it. Including but not limited to breaking up with her boyfriend who cheats on her (another ISTP go figure). After awhile it would be the same rants over and over and whenever I needed to talk about an issue she would dismiss my problems as unimportant. She would also be offended by very small things but do the same thing to other people. I let her stay at my house while she was in between moving from an hour away to a town next to mine and then a week later she stopped talking to me. \n\nI thought she was just unhealthy but I have an ENFP boss who did a similar thing but with a work project. So I think because they are so opinionated we up just going along with it a lot of stuff and ENFPs just use it as an invitation to use us even if they don't realize it.
-4	why would you just downvote a post without providing any argumentation for doing so? Really childish
-2	Oh wait, I just figured out socionics doesnt translate directly to mbti. So it’s not ISTP, but ISTJ that is most compatible with ENFP. LoL
7	First post here - Just discovered I'm an ISTP	There is a TL:DR at the end, and the full post is admittedly just a rant I wrote because I felt like it. But I also feel like sharing it, so here it goes! After all, I've been thinking about this stuff a lot lately, so why not?\n\n\-----\n\nAt work they told us we were all taking this personality test to see how we all worked with each other and that sort of thing. So I took the Myers-Briggs test third or fourth in my life. The result? ISTP.\n\nBut there's more to the story. When I have previously taken the test, I've basically gotten a different result each time, but every time it was I\_\_\_\_ and usually I\_\_P. I would read the descriptions of the INTP or whatever personality type it gave me, and it seemed sort of accurate but not - it was definitely missing some major parts of my personality. But when I took the test before, even though I tried to give honest answers, I didn't quite fully comprehend the purpose of the test. There were a number of questions where I really thought it was best to answer what I "should" think as a decent member of society, not what I would actually do in a situation or what I'm actually feeling even if I go through with a social situation. This last time when I answered questions, I went with what my gut feeling was telling me (just want to hammer in how important this gut feeling is for me - as it is what generally ends up making most of my decisions, and especially helps me determine right and wrong when I have to quickly make a decision and don't have the luxury of spending a night by myself thinking about the issue) and I got ISTP. Another factor worth mentioning is my company paid for a fairly detailed & higher quality test, versus the free tests I took before.\n\nSo, I read through the basic description of an ISTP, and it was eerie how accurately it described me. It got my strengths and my weaknesses down without ever having met me! My ISTP vs INTP wasn't \[i\]too\[/i\] strong, something like 60% ISTP, but when I read the descriptions of each I fit almost every stereotypical attribute of an ISTP and only about half of the INTP. With this in mind, I'm inclined to think I am indeed an ISTP. Perhaps what convinced me most of all is that INTPs want to make the world a better place, while ISTPs are only focused on things they actually have the power to change and can accept when something is out of their control. I see no point in lecturing my friends about something none of us can change. Why would I? It's a waste of time. I like results, so I will focus on things I or my friends might actually have some sort of influence over. I'm pragmatic - an INTP is idealistic. Of course I want world peace and all of that stuff, but I understand it takes a lot more than saying you want it to actually get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, I've been pulled into this world of MBTI types, and just become totally fascinated by it. And mostly just because they made me take the test at work. It's so interesting. Perhaps as an ISTP, I appreciate that there is a system that tries to make sense of the chaos that is the human race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, if I may try to present my admittedly scatter-brained view of humanity: I find that with people, I strongly prefer to evaluate them as individuals rather than as a member of some specific religion, race, political ideology, or whatever. Every single person on this planet is way too complex to just put into a box. Perhaps this makes me sound like some sort of idealistic liberal - I think it's merely me being a realistic person (...which us ISTPs definitely are) acknowledging the complexity of our [species](https://species.So) and cultures. I suppose someone will accuse me of putting people in boxes (the boxes being the various the MBTI types), but that's not how I view it. I view it as one tool to evaluate a person, among many other characteristics (such as where they are from, how old they are, etc). I've found that a lot of basic demographic characteristics can explain a lot of behavior. I have routinely found that people from a certain type of background are more likely to behave a certain way, or display a certain kind of personality. Elderly people are much more likely to have a "Fuck you, things were better back in the day. Because we understood how the world works!" which basically happens in every country to every generation as it ages, but, if I may present it from my American perspective, the way I interpret that is that it means they're essentially defending segregation, harassment of LGBT people, and all sorts of unsavory behavior that our country has left behind. I have a problem with this because, as ISTPs often have a "live and let live" attitude as literally every website about MBTI types says we do, I take offense to people attacking other people based off of some vague demographic or cultural characteristic, when I don't see it as relevant. Does Mohammad, who is a refugee from Syria, pay his taxes and follow the laws like any normal American would? Well, over 99% of the time, people like him do, so this person is cool with me unless I am given a reason to distrust them. If you're that rare Muslim in America who advocates violence as a means to bring about political change, then sure... I don't like you and I don't want you here! But I simply see no reason to be bothered by a law-abiding and tax-paying resident or citizen of my country. I regret that I got somewhat political, as I generally detest discussing politics, but sometimes it's the best way to explain your view of the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, as I read more about the ISTP, I am continually surprised by how accurately so many different sources are at describing me. I do sense a little bit of psuedoscience in the MBTI world, but it's really not that bad, and certainly nothing like astrology, which is based on the movement of planetary bodies that have no significant affect on our lives. I mean, the sun (because of light, obviously) and the moon (because of nighttime light and tides) are clearly important to our species, but not for the silly reasons astrology-types claim. They just take random coincidence (ie, when you were born, and where the planets are or were aligned) and try to turn it into some science. It's also kind of bothered me, even if I get a kick out of occasionally reading my horoscope. But the MBTI personality types just make sense to me. I've had a couple friends take the test and I'm like "oh yeah you are totally an ENFJ!" I can usually get someone within... one letter of their actual test result. Extrovert/introvert is obviously the easiest aspect to determine, but I've also found I can easily spot the difference between judging and perceiving. Thinking/feeling is also pretty easy for me to determine in another person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSensing/intuition is where my prediction abilities fail me. Perhaps because my other attributes are all so strong (I took two tests that both gave me >95% introverted!! My thinking and perception are also fairly strong), I can easily see whether or not someone is the same. But since my sensing was more on the borderline of lean/solid, and the weakest (only about 60% sensing), perhaps that is why I have trouble determining this part of the equation. To reiterate, I have read numerous descriptions for ISTP & INTP and I definitely act like an ISTP almost 100% of the time, and maybe and INTP 50% or so of the time. For example, if I were to try to type my ex-boyfriend, I would say he is a ESFJ or ENFJ. But I can't really decide between sensing and intuition. And speaking of MBTI stuff being addictive, I immediately looked up ESFJ/ENFJ to try to figure out what my ex is, and I was amused that ESFJs and ENFJs have the lowest IQs. Granted, I personally think a lot of tests, even possibly the IQ test (but certainly not to the same extent as the SAT in the United States) tend to favor certain personality and cultural traits over others. We all know the SAT's English section favors middle-upper/upper class whites, who grow up speaking the "proper" English that the SAT \[i\]says\[/i\] is correct, even though as long as a dialect or language has a consistent set of rules there is really nothing that makes it inferior to another dialect or language. It's just a different way of speaking. I mean, could you become a rap superstar talking like an old white person from New England? No - but here is an industry where the "correct" way of speaking (as arbitrarily determined by the SAT) doesn't actually match the correct way of speaking for the nation as a whole. Here, African-American English is more important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there is one area where I \[i\]don't\[/i\] feel like a stereotypical ISTP, it is with regards to commitment in romantic relationships. I do hate to be tied down in a certain career or college or \[i\]anything\[/i\] really where I'm stuck and have to follow some archaic rules designed for INFJs or ESTJs or whatever. And when I'm initially dating someone, I may be very non-committal and tend to conceal my emotions. Which, unsurprisingly, makes dating very hard for me. I'm often told that I'm "hot" or "conventionally attractive," and that is flattering... But when physical attractiveness is matched with some pretty severe introversion, the result is frustrating! I am viewed as being an asshole, a bitch, as someone who thinks he is better than everyone. Which isn't what I think at all...If anything, I have issues with feeling inferior, and out of place. But I can't hep but think this is just what happens when you're that unusual combination of "conventionally attractive\*" and shy. (I say "conventionally attractive" in quotation marks because attractiveness is so subjective. I for example, love big hairy men. And a lot of other gay guys or women like smooth & hairless guys. The point I'm trying to make? Sure, there's a conventional attractiveness that we can all see is "hot" even if we aren't personally attracted to them, or if they're of a gender were not generally attracted to. Which to provide one more example in my giant parenthesis - you like what YOU like! And assuming you're fortunate enough to be somebody who is attracted to other consenting adults, you should be fine). Not because I'm afraid of emotions, but because I grew up believing the emotions just complicated matters and got in the way. My general philosophy in life is that my emotions are \[i\]mine\[/i\], and they can only be revealed to a lover, an immediate family member, or a close friend (you really can't maintain more than say 4-5 close friendships if you're an ISTP, but maybe 10-12 or so if you're one of the extrovert types). When discussing history with a stranger, for example, emotions often enter the equation. You cannot discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for example, without triggering massive emotions on both sides that make it impossible to find a solution to the problem. As an ISTP, I feel like I \[i\]could\[/i\] come up with some sort of solution, because I can really delve into a situation and understand what each side is thinking and why certain issues are important to them. I am convinced that if both sides just listened to me, I could come up with a fair solution that gave each side most of what was important to them. But that will never happen, because as an ISTP I struggle working with other people. This has been an issue with me for as long as I can remember. I've been employed since I graduated college, at 4 different jobs now, and I often get criticism that I am "distant" or "negative." I don't think I'm negative. I just speak the truth! If there is good news, I share it! If there is bad news, I sure don't hide it! At least that's how I want to behave. I haven't gotten any such criticism at my fourth post-college job, because I finally took the advice and just shut up & quit caring about work so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISTPs seem to have trouble getting ahead in life. Oh, we're mechanics? And plumbers? Okay, it's sort of cool that we have a lot of career choices that allow you to work for yourself. I actually like that. But I personally feel like I fall into the more effeminate side of ISTP. I am a man, but I am also gay, and I can't help but feel like the career recommendations, relationship advice, etc for ISTP men are very heteronormative. I haven't read a lot about MBTI types with regards to sexuality - but when you read about potential pairings it's usually all about gender and assumes straight relationships between, for example, a straight ISTP man and a straight ENFJ woman.  I think sexuality definitely plays a role in MBTI types and how they manifest themselves. I am a gay male ISTP, which according to OKCupid data, is the "straightest" MBTI type for men. Only something like 7% of ISTP men are gay or bi, while literally every other type is over 10%.  I find that this explains a lot, but in a way also adds more confusion. I've always questioned how I fit into the gay community, and quite frankly the answer is "not very well!" I don't think there is anything wrong with the gay community by any means, but I as a gay man have never really identified with the "gay community" (that's a vague term, but I think you should get the idea of what I mean. You know, public organizations that advance LGBT rights, major LGBT cultural movies/TV shows like RuPaul's Drag Race, social groups and clubs for gay people, gay bars and nightclubs, that sort of thing) and I can't help but wonder if my being an ISTP is a factor in why I don't really feel like I'm meant to be part of the gay community. But I also just have trouble getting along with people and groups in general, being as introverted as I am, so maybe I'm just over-analyzing it. After all, us ISTPs tend to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, TL:DR - I recently discovered I'm an ISTP, after dishonestly taking the test on prior occasions and getting incorrect results. Upon reading about the ISTP, I was kind of shocked at how closely it matched me. As I did this through work, we compared our results with our coworkers and they literally laughed (in a good way) at the ISTP personality description because it was so accurate. Since discovering that I am an ISTP, I have had no issue with accepting it, and basically did as soon as I had read enough about ISTPs to know I was truly one of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue I'm having now is figuring out where to go from here. I turned 30 years old last summer. I am employed but not really interested in my field. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. And I'm 30! I realize that is still relatively young in a long of ways, but it's also relatively old when you're talking about what you would like to do with your life. I'm also a lonely 30 year old gay man who doesn't know how to find a boyfriend, clearly! So if anyone is inclined to respond, really for whatever reason or opinion is fine with me, but if you want to know why I made this post? It's because I'm an ISTP - and I've been struggling with the social retardation aspect of it. In terms of school (which I'm past now, but still...), career, family, friends, whatever. I'm honestly just a little tired of people "assuming" I'm a jerk because I'm shy. I want people to know I'm introverted and judge me accordingly - not judged based off of some extroverted point of view. Taking this test has really unearthed a lot of information about myself, and what I actually believe in. It's helped set me on a path of self discovery, and it's already helped me (...a confused, lost, soul) navigate his way through the world.
12	Even the TL;DR is TL;DR
22	Are you sure? That's a lot of typing for an ISTP. Haha! 
8	Welcome to the family. \n\nIf it’s any consolation, I’m 32 and I *still* am not sure what I want to be when I grow up. Bouncing between careers feels more normal. \n\nAlso, LOL @ “straightest” type. Cultural stereotypes are heavily embedded in type descriptions online. 
8	Another gay male ISTP here and I'm also not interesting in identifying with LGBT mainstream culture and it's definitely okay that you don't want to either. \n\nA big reason I think LBGT ISTPs don't become part of the community is because it's based upon support and letting out emotions and feelings which doesn't come naturally to us. We want to be independent in everything, even in something like expressing sexuality or gender. 
1	Here you go, a good video on ISTPs.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zF7XyYBp8dY
7	ISTP females of reddit, where do you hide?	I've always wondered where my female counterparts hang out since I think I never met one in my life.\nWhat are your hobbies?\nWhere do you enjoy going out?\nWhat do you do for a living?\nHow do you dress / what's your style?\n\nThanks :)\n\nEDIT: added one more question
11	I just posted something similar recently! \nHobbies- I enjoy a lot of different things.  Sports definitely, art (painting, photography), love being outside and love animals and nature in general. I like playing games with people and competitive activities. \nI enjoy going out to bars but bars that have games (pool, darts) so I can do something with my hands and stay active. If I sit still too long I'll get antsy and bored.  I like doing things by myself too like an impromptu shopping trip or going to breakfast alone.  Doing things alone never really bothered me. \nI am a biologist.  It takes a lot of multitasking and you need to be very detail oriented. I started in the lab and worked my way up to lab supervisor and manage a handful of people. It can be difficult supervising people when emotions get involved and you need to fix personal issues ( it's work! Let's keep emotion out if it).
10	I basically just play video games, study languages, and watch horror movies. As for my style, let's just say I'm stuck in the late '80s~mid '90s. Really don't leave the house a ton, somehow got lucky enough to find someone and get married anyway. I am extremely asocial, I've been a semi-hermit for 15 years. Most of my socializing is done online with a small group of friends or with my coworkers (I work remotely).
6	[deleted]
6	I’m a college professor (which is still so ridiculous to me, who the hell is letting me teach anyone anything?) and academic advisor. It’s something i sort of fell into because working at the university where i’m completing my phd means the whole degree is paid for. anytime i’m not working on dissertation, teaching, or advising i am basically always rock climbing. \nthough, i do spend more time than i would like to admit watching asmr soap cutting videos on snapchat. fml.\ni used to care about curating outfits and looking presentable, but then i got busy and moved away from california (where there’s something to actually get dressed up for), and now i have a couple pairs of work appropriate black pants and a rotating sweater schedule i stick to. couldn’t care less, just trying not to get fired for looking like i couldn’t care less. haha
5	 What are your hobbies? Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, working out, lurking on Reddit\n\nWhere do you enjoy going out? I go to the movies by myself or out shopping alone\n\nWhat do you do for a living? I program things and build things\n\nHow do you dress / what's your style? Jeans and a hoodie but occasionally super stylish if the situation demands it. \n\n&#x200B;
5	Hi!! I’m 17 and I’m not a stereotypical “mechanic” ISTP\n\nHobbies: film production (awesome to work on set, love being creative & logical), makeup/style, tennis, wikipedia bingeing, and browsing reddit lmao\n\nI like to watch movies, hang with friends (but not too much), drive (rainy, quiet drives or speedy drives are my favorites) \n\nI try to dress in streetwear but I’m broke lmao\n\nI want to work in film & tv production, currently working on college applications 
3	I work in logistics and own my own business. I work a lot and prefer to keep busy. Hobbies: gardening, woodworking, I worked as a mechanic for 4 years (stereotypes!), I love to cook and surf, play pool and poker. I really like keeping my home looking great. Furniture, bedding, keeping things looking nice, all that. \n\nThat’s about what I have time for. I’m big into fitness so gym in early AM to start my day.  I’m not big into drinking or partying at all, although can let loose when it calls for it. \n\nI rarely go out. If I do, it’s alone to play pool at a bar I am comfortable in. I have a close circle I hang out with but that’s about it. \n\nWhen I go out it’s either dress to the nines. Body con dresses/heels or casual jeans, cute top. I *look* very feminine (physically fit, long dark hair, makeup) but my personality and interests slant towards the masculine. I have been told I come off as *very confident* by friends. \n\n
2	Yes, where are you all?! \n\n27, graduated with a degree in film production. I work as a server at a winery. I never thought I would enjoy serving as much as I do! The flexibility is great (I’m also a single mother) and the pay is actually pretty decent considering my part time schedule.\n\nI really like being on my feet and being able to interact with different kinds of people-I have a lot of control over how interactive I want to be so I don’t find myself getting too drained. It really seems to satisfy my Se; I’m out in the actions, but with enough control and independence to step away and do other tasks. It gives me room to observe and I feel in control. I really could care less about wine (I do enjoy drinking it) but I work with an awesome tight-knit group of girls and enjoy the feels of the small, local business.  It also works as my own little social time which is great because raising a four year old takes up most of my time. \n\nI love fashion-i probably like something that looks sexy but with a masculine flare. Baggy jean jacket over top a black form fitting tank, I like vintage, quirky, off the cuff looks. Plain colors, black, gray, white, olive green. If I do color, lime green or pastel pink, maybe red. Something you might not expect. \n\nHobbies... music. I picked up guitar in 4th grade and mastered it pretty well on my own. Would hyper focus on it for hours until I mastered a chord or a song. When I reference my childhood in those ways, I definitely see where I fit the istp profile. Drawing, singing, really anything artistic. But I also enjoyed computer games a lot and loved being active even though I was majorly adhd (anxiety and possible mood disorder to add) so found group sports overwhelming. \n\nI like going out-but have been wanting to expand my social circle. Have been desiring to integrate a little more into my growing down-town community. I really feel like a pull to start some sort of creative something in our town-whether I lead it or be an integral part of something. I just crave some type of creative, useful work and I see a lot of potential for growth in my city. But between being busy, introverted, and indecisive, I just haven’t found my niche/next project. \n\nI do freelance videography on the side. I really enjoy it but have been feeling overwhelmed by the pressure I put on myself. The work is very inconsistent so i don’t feel as sharp around the technical parts of my work. \n\nI love traveling. I love great food and company. I like working with my hands in any way. Being creative. Ya da-yada. \n\nAm I just spouting my life story? Lol It’s been so affirming learning that I’m an istp and I love the idea of hearing about other women of this type. \n\nIt’s crazy to think too how very few sensors and thinkers I have in my life. I have a lot of friends, all very different and dispersed, but my closest, longest friendships are nf’s. But truth me told, i wonder where you all are... lol. \n\nAlso I’m an enneagram 6! I think I have a seven wing... but it’s been in question lately.  \n\n
1	Hobbies? The gym. I am a competitive bench presser. \n\nGoing out? I do not enjoy going out. People suck. I am on husband #3 and luckily he is ok with being a hermit with me\n\nJob? I manage 1100 accounts and sell them their marketing materials and I deliver pizza at night.\n\nStyle? Jeans and a t-shirt kinda gal. I do have some very very nice clothes but I look out of place dressed up. 
1	Working nights at a hotel trying not to deal with ppl. Other than that I'd be playing video games, knitting or binge watching TV shows. 
1	Hi. F ISTP 20 y/o here
6	ISTP Real Estate?	Hey guys! I'm in the middle of a career change. I'm an ISTP female with strong I & P preferences and slight S & T preferences. I'm thinking about tying my new career with my long term goal of real estate investing. I haven't narrowed down the specialty yet (notes, land, rental properties, etc.) I was thinking that if I position myself in a real estate career, then I can learn enough to make smart investments. I could be wrong, but it seems that this type of work has the freedom and flexibility I need. \n\nI'm wondering if any ISTPs have had a career in real estate and if I can be successful with my introverted personality and lack of experience. I was thinking maybe home assessments, but not sure that would work with my introversion. \n\nI'm also wondering if there's something that might draw on my previous experience in the food and beverage industry (corporate quality, regulatory, procurement, production planning, with certifications in Six Sigma (Green Belt), APICS-CPIM - Production and Inventory Management, PMI-CAPM - Project Management).\n\nAny suggestions or experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
2	ISTP here and currently currently work in insurance and bought my first investment property last year. The passive income is great and I'm looking forward to buying more. 
2	my dad is also an ISTP and he is a real estate developer (think: buying thousands of acres of land to develop subdivisions).\n\nhe always seemed to enjoy it it. it's relatively independent work, it's exciting, high risk/high reward. he used to be a lawyer and initially got into real estate developing part-time, then eventually switched to full time real estate developing because it was wayyy more lucrative and interesting.\n\nyou do need to be able to qualify for large loans and maintain good relationships with banks (or investors if that's how you proceed). it can be very risky, especially when you're talking about large scale land development.\n\nedit: i do think his background as a lawyer helped quite a bit in dealing with contracts and negotiations. 
1	for a female, i could see real estate, but for a male, na, maybe an ESTP
1	Being a real estate agent doesn't seem like it would be anything an introvert couldn't handle. All careers have aspects you need to get used to. The only weird part is having to hold yourself out and have a professional public persona.\n\nBut it does afford a lot of analysis, a little bit of "exploration" if you consider seeing houses you don't live in exploration, decision making, and seemingly plenty of money to do whatever you want in your free time. I've considered it but I have no desire to change careers.\n\nEDIT: The more I think about it the more this seems like a terrible idea. I would never do it.
1	We are good at research and typically have the risk tolerance required to handle investments and deals. Learn your market, sell what sells and be ready for a learning curve (even if that means losing money on your first deals). You may enjoy the behind the scenes stuff (financing, finding good deals, etc.) more so than the person to person stuff (Real Estate Agent work). Might still want your license however. \n\n\nYour prior skill sets should tie-in well. \n\n\nLearning and understanding accounting has been one of the greatest tools I have used in my business and investments. I haven't dipped into real estate yet but the bank leverage you can obtain can make it very lucrative. Understand financial leverage and it's true power. 
1	I’ve found I am a master of data acquisition. Accurate, consistent, copious. But god forbid I ever do anything with that information. Has anyone found a career that lends itself is this MO?	
3	Competitive bar trivia or\n\nData analyst
1	university administration 
-4	So you're a hoarder? Being good at collecting anything but not being able to do anything useful with it doesn't seem like a skill to be proud of, rather something to work on.
20	Is it correct?	
35	no, pizza better
14	I spent way too long trying to find the isfp. God damnit
12	Am I the only one who has no interest in a purely sexual relationship? That's just a recipe for emotional baggage and heartache. Sex is a big part of the way we express love which makes it a more sensitive area for us. Its taken the wrong was as if you just have to have sex with istps for them to like/love you, no we have to really like you to enjoy/feel comfortable having sex with you.
7	Wtf is with INTP
5	Definitely holds true for me...
8	Send this to r/shittymbti
6	Is... is that ice in the INTJ? Ouch. We dont all have an ice heart. I'm a very loving woman. 😶
5	Ok I'm asexual so not all that accurate for me
4	I'm none of these
2	yup
2	Why do we get a broken heart??\n\nAnd can anyone tell what the ENTJ has and what's written around the ENTP hearts?\n\nTo answer the question, though, these are highly inaccurate to most of the people I know. ESTJ is on point, though.
2	[deleted]
2	Can’t honestly say that I’ve ever pursued sex at the cost of everything else...\n\nProbably be more accurate if the hearts were in the hands. 
1	Intp lmao
1	Where did you get this
1	Female ISTP. That is accurate
1	Heh heh, no. Not for me.\n\nI'm not interested in romance or sex. If I ever do find a guy I want to do anything with, he's probably going to be the only guy.
23	Illustration of the ISTP/ENFP relationship	I've seen a lot of ENFPs asking for ISTP relationship advise here lately... Its time they stop saying we're the problem and take a cold hard look at themselves!\n\nMy wife (ENFP) and I were/are high school sweethearts and have been together 10+ years, married 5. She is brilliant and has a sense of humor that perfectly matches my own and I think she'll forgive me for the (hopefully) comically picture I'm about to paint.\n\nImagine being a GPS system tasked with helping your driver get to their grandma's house in time for dinner.\n\nYou have the route to your destination, the roads clear, plenty of time and things look very straight forward. As soon as you reach the end of the block, the driver makes a u-turn (forgot something). No big deal, you recalculate.  Right turn ahead but they go left (they needed gas/coffee). You recalculate again, a little annoyed they started asking for directions from home when the obviously knew they needed gas beforehand. Finally on the freeway cruising along, 88 miles to exit, things are going smooth so you relax as the driver poorly sings (loudly) to the radio. Suddenly, you get information of an accident ahead with a 45 minute delay. You quickly advise the driver and start looking for an alternative route. Phew! You find one that's only 10 minutes longer but they have to take the exit in half a mile instead so you quickly warn them..  and again as they reach the exit... and they blow by it.  With only one more exit before the traffic starts, you again recalculate and pass along new route information... They blow by the exit again. Tail lights ahead and suddenly the music volume lowers and something violently grabs you and starts swearing at you for fucking up and not working. As you attempt in vain to explain that you warned them ahead of time and gave them two alternatives routes, you finish another re-calculation as you advise them its now too late to avoid the delay, you hear "this piece of shit thing never works" as they shut you off. While in your slumber, you stew on the fact that you did everything you could to help, did everything they asked. For fucks sake, this destination is saved in your memory as "grandma's house", its only a 2 hour drive and you've directed the driver there 37 times already. They didn't listen to any of your warnings. How is this your fault?? Suddenly, power flow is resumed! You feel guilty you got so angry and hey, I'm sure driver is just upset, you forgive them and load up directions once more... Only to hear "fuck" and again, without warning its your fault. Time passes as you desperately try to make sense of everything... lost in thought, you relax and feel better as you slowly recharge. Suddenly you are awoke again! Spending along the road just about where you last remember. What happened to the traffic? Why isn't it still slowing us down? Wait, how the fuck did we get heading the opposite direction? Did they cross the median? No time for that! If they take this exit, we can use one if the alternative routes and skip the traffic! You don't know how or why this is happening but you advise to take the next exit and as they do you start feeling excited things are getting back on track. Finally! It was a bumpy start and you'll be 15 minutes late but its going to be okay now... wait, you're being given directions to a drive-in movie theater 10 minutes from the driver's home address. Did grandma want to meet there suddenly? You decide its best to not rock the boat as the driver adds a McDonalds as a stop. The movie ends, long double feature but it all okay now. The driver punches in their home address, you sigh to yourself as you given them the 9 minute 3 turn route home. You hear the driver on the phone with their grandma apologizing for missing dinner. They tried to make it but got lost when they're GPS didn't work. Just as you think "MOTHER FUCKER..." your battery dies.\n....\n....\n....\n....\nUnknown quantities of time have passed before you feel the first bit of electricity begin to flow... You're needed once again...\n\n\nEdit: After some feedback and reflection, this story did not illustrate what I intended it too. Which was how my wife's airheadedness exhausts me at times. Not because she blames me but because to me they seem like easily avoided pit falls. I'm a numbers guy not a writer lol. Cheers!
12	Their intelligence is different from ours and that's all. My mom is ENFP and she's very logical and absent-minded at the same time. I live in the here and now and she lives in the there and now. I have to "call" her almost every time something happens.
10	ENFP wife here. This is an incredibly accurate metaphor.\n\nI imagine that no personality type is more frustrating for an ISTP than an ENFP. ENFPs are the most annoying personality type when they lack a sense of self-actualization, so any successful ISTP/ENFP relationship is kind of amazing. An ENFP’s  goal in life seems to be to change ISTP types because *they can’t possibly be happy the way they are*. \n\nThe only tolerable ENFP is the kind who can laugh at themselves and recognize the absolutely illogical way they think, take guidance from the more logical types, and stop trying to press their ways on others in a way they oddly find almost charitable. ENFPs force themselves on others and try to change them. ISTPs don’t care if you change, but when they do try to help, it’s just frustrating when people don’t listen to their well-thought points.\n\nI laughed through this whole post, because the ISTP is definitely the GPS. If mine and I didn’t rib each other for our differences, we would be never be this happy. It’s very hard to be in an ENFP/ISTP relationship, and the point is that you have to understand that, while you may offer guidance to each other, you can’t always hear each other and you don’t always listen. You need to accept that it will piss the other off and the other may not take your well-meant advice.\n\nEdit: I’m also shit at directions. I’m also the happily married and absolutely maddening ENFP of this story.
4	Holy text wall. Being concise is a useful skill for conveying an idea.
8	I thought my ENFP ex gf was just really stupid. Are you saying there's something else going on?
2	It was hillarious man😂
1	So basically what you're saying is I shouldn't have a relationship with these people because it's doubtful the sex is better than the stress?
1	I have two ENFP friends. Indecisive, easily unmotivated, slow processors, easily overwhelmed, emotionally unstable people. I like them though. They’re caring and have good senses of humor.
1	Sorry, I got to the first GPS line, saw a wall of text and stopped. is there a tl;dr for that?
6	hey! newbie here.	i was recently "diagnosed" as a ISTP. any tips?
29	Can't spell tips without ISTP
29	Why do people keep showing up here saying something that makes it sound like they have a disease?\n\nFinding out you are an ISTP is more like finding out you are part of an elite part of society of warrior monks, more than likely destined to a life of solitude except when the rest of society wants something from us...Ohhh, now I see it
10	One of us, one of us
7	Have fun lurking!\n\n*Now, to get back to my usual lurking*
6	Do it to it.

103	Do you guys feel like a combination of jock and nerd?	I constantly feel these two sides of my personality competing.  I'm an athlete, and sometimes, I have a tendency to be reckless, somewhat abrasive, direct, and sorta rebellious.  This is all my Se on display, with some pretty underdeveloped Fe as well lol. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n But I also have a very prevalent side (which only my super close friends can tell) that browses reddit for hours, is super socially awkward, quiet, hyper logical and always teaching itself random scientific facts and shit.  This nerdy side is pretty intuitive as well.  Y'all feel me?
43	Haha, I've always felt this way. Growing up, I generally had two groups of friends... the ones I'd play sports with and the ones I'd play computer and video games with. 
23	Yup. I wouldn’t describe myself as a jock, but in high school I played water polo, I like sports, I scuba dive. However, I am incredibly nerdy. 
33	yes
11	I started Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (years ago, not yesterday)  so I constantly do both of those things at the same time.  Its like high speed human chess and its amazing.  I spend hours trying to find good series of moves and solve the puzzles as well as getting to do all the athletic grappling stuff.  I'm also a computer programmer so if that's not nerdy I don't know what is.
7	don't view it as a competition, view it as being a superhero with nice nerdy gadgets 
5	You just described my husband. Some of my favorite things about him being an ISTP. I also agree, he can have some great intuitive insights into people and things. Love it.
4	Yes 100%.
8	> two sides of my personality competing\n\nWait until you arrive at a place where you'll realize this "competition" is just a social construct and 100% BS, leading way to fully embracing the authentic you. It's pretty cool.\n\nBut everything you said is me. I especially like the description of "reckless" I've read, I know I won't be able to do it justice, but it said something like ISTPs are so in tune with their environment, everything that is happening around them at all times that they can operate at a much lower margin of error. This appears to others as "reckless" but to the ISTP, they are always in control.\n\nSocially awkwardness gets better as you get older too, when you stop giving a crap what others think.
10	Yes, this has manifested me into a religious gamer for a certain fps, super competitive love technique and strategy love to watch my skill level rise and love to display my skill by destroying the competition.
4	Jock and nerd are both labels, and I don't like labeling myself more than necessary. Self-identifying as one or the other is frequently the only thing keeping people from doing something they'd enjoy doing otherwise. ("I'm a nerd, I can't go to the gym!" vs. "What would the others on the team think if they learned I like astronomy? I better hide it.") Which is quite fucking sad.\n\nThis is also true for being an ISTP, btw. I have some decidedly non-ISTP-like skills and interests (I'm pretty good at understanding highly abstract mathematics, for example) and It would be quite idiotic if I refused to indulge just because it's stereotypically associated with INTPs.
2	Not really. I don't think I'm that stereotypical (no offense intended), as I am totally not athletic at all nor what is perceived as "nerdy".\n\nThat said, I do tend to be reckless and other than being an athlete, the rest of that description does somewhat relates to me. Also, although I am not exactly seen as a socially awkward nerd or anything of that kind (I suppose), I do love reading, am curious so it's always pleasant to learn new things (although I'm generally too lazy to do so), and am rather quiet.
2	Yes absolutely. Had both nerdy and jock friends in highschool. Currently a biologist that plays a lot of ultimate Frisbee year round. Best of both worlds!\n\nI read somewhere that istps tend to have really good hand eye coordination. 
2	I guess I’m in the minority here.  I can be competitive or reckless in certain limited situations but I have zero interest in sports.  I mostly relate to the second nerdy description 
2	Definitely, it's pretty bizarre and almost as if I have two personalities. I even have different groups of friends for each personality.\n\nIn the front I have my "business" personality. Very quiet, introspective, analytical, and nerdy. My interests under this category include cloud administration and security (I work in IT), automation, systemic thinking, entrepreneurship, and philosophy. Most friends in this personality are nerds, gamers, weebs, and engineers, who would describe me as eccentric and short-sighted.\n\nIf you get to know me well you'll see the "playful" side of me. I would describe this side as humorous, a bit reckless, an adrenaline-junkie, and undisciplined. Hobbies in this category include skateboarding, art, mountain biking/bmx, weed smoking, beer chugging, guitar playing (play in a band). Friends in this personality are musicians, artists, athletes, and degenerates who would describe me as nerdy and contrived.\n\nHaving two sides made it hard to find an identity while I was growing up, but I like it. Some people just have flat personalities and it's like what you see is what you get.
2	no
1	# i agree 
1	Yes and I’m not even ISTP. This may be a modern male human thing
1	I feel like an introverted thinker.
1	Yes and I love it. 
1	Yep, same here. I'm competitive around people, and maybe a few of my friends know me when I'm by myself, which is needing out with computer science, playing games, or finding random shit to do
1	Yes. Extremly competitive, love sports and im a huge nerd for fantacy (lotr and other)
1	Best of both worlds
1	Yeah, I am good at anything physical. At the end of the day I am all into books and introverted activities. Or vice versa.
1	Yes. I played baseball in highschool and played competive video games in college
1	Yeah. I played county badminton in high school (UK equivalent of ‘going to state’), also played squash and football. I skated and biked everywhere. Was super active.\n\nAlso, big into Star Wars, Back to the Future, Nintendo, Futurama etc etc. Me and my buddy in high school just used to sit in class quoting Futurama. \n\nThen I got glandular fever pretty bad at 17 and just stopped *everything* all at once and never returned to it after I got better. \n\nThat is, until now!! I discovered yoga about 2 months ago and I’m doing it about 6 times a week now! I really needed to do *something* because I was so unhealthy for like a decade, and mistyped as INTP on all the tests I took because of never indulging my Se. I bought a new skateboard and some hiking boots as well. \n\nAfter a conversation over New Years with a stranger they said I probably mistype as INTP because I’m likely in a ‘Ti-Ni loop’ because of years of neglecting Se, so I looked up what that meant and indulged myself in so many activities over Christmas and New Year. Got a blister on my heel and didn’t even care. Got absolutely soaked in the rain, no bother, I was exploring!! \n\nSo yeah, I like nerd stuff and sports. 
1	this is exactly me, damn. I remember being such an awkward nerd in HS with a terrible haircut, but people keep telling me how popular I was. Those two sides are prevalent today, I like watching sports with the dudes but i always prefer alone time to jump down random reddit rabbitholes. 
1	I used to be super nerdy, freckles, glasses, asthma, food allergy, smart but weak as hell, braces too.\n\nNow at 29 people think I’m a Marine, including actual marines because I mad the gym my second home. \n\nBut then while chatting they realize I’m still quite intelligent and quick witted, then they think I’m a serial killer :/
1	100%
1	not an athelete, never was, even when i tried. it really depends on what gives you the rush or feeling of accomplishment. sports never did and never will give me a feeling of accomplishment. if you're talkin bout actually *watching* sports.. forget it, unless there's booze. i can be considered a "nerd" due to my knowledge of electronics and programming, except i can't relate to the weaboos or rpg/WoWfreaks, sure i played an mmo (not wow) when i was in middle school, but i decided to stop gaming, never looked back. 10 minutes of game time and i'm bored
1	Too much of a nerd to be a jock, too much of a jock to be a nerd. 
1	Not really into team sports but I play Basketball in jr high and had my time in the Army. Played chess a bit and enjoy a good PC game now and then. Threw a few keg parties here and there and still hit the gun range. I was and still am known as the “cool one.” I have different friend groups for certain hobbies and situations. 
1	Yeah I completely agree
1	I love swim and to improve at physical activities. And feel really confident in those abilities. But, build 3d printers and shit in my free time. It's a really odd mix.
13	Do you guys have trouble identifying what you’re feeling?	It’s not a lack of emotion or emptiness or anything, it’s that I just have a hard time logically deducing why it is that im having this unrecognized sensation running through me. Can anyone else relate?
17	Definitely. Welcome to the club. 
8	No.  I can identify my emotions fairly well, including the events that led up to them. Being an ISTP doesn't mean you're totally out of touch with your emotions, only that your emotions don't dictate your actions as often as they would a Feeler. 
7	Nah, I'm pretty good at knowing how I feel. I just dont like letting that influence my decisions/behavior. Im also not comfortable talking about them.\n\nBest case scenario, I have an outlet and deal with them through some kind of music or activity. Worst case scenario, I wind up burying/avoiding them until I have some kind of break.
3	It takes me awhile to identify and name my feelings accurately(usually relating to complex, complicated scenario) and where do i stand with them. Then, after i named them I can process them. 
3	I recognize how I feel but have trouble justifying it because emotions are ultimately irrational. Therefore, if I have feelings for a girl, they range from intense to mild on any given day and I struggle to quantify them which makes them confusing. Emotional decision making is not a large part of my life so it feels a bit chaotic when it is my only option. If I end up prioritizing my emotions in decision making and it doesn't work out I instantly regret deciding with my "heart" and not my mind. As I have gotten older I have found it easier to balance my logic and emotions where earlier in life I would make the mistake of recognizing an emotional situation and diving head first rather than also using the trusted logical side of my mind.

3	recently i’ve been reading Brene Brown’s research/books on shame and vulnerability, and that has really changed my life. highly recommend. one of the things she talks about is emotional fluency, and the fact that we need to be fluent in 30 core emotions in order to empathize and relate well with others in a meaningful way and to understand ourselves—but the average person only knows 4. pretty wild. 
2	Nah. I can identify when I'm irritated or feeling joy (this one is light feeling in chest).
2	Nope, but I'd imagine that's mostly because I am like a child and am really only aware of/only feel basic emotions: happiness and anger being the most common and most feelable, sadness being the other one. 
1	Every freaking day.\n\nTo expand on this: usually the "what" is fairly recognizable. I know if I'm mad or annoyed or whatever (although sometimes it's not always easy). It's usually the "why" that takes considerable effort to uncover.
1	i can somewhat identify chemical imbalances or vitamin deficiencies, not specifics just if i feel impulsive or paranoid probably means vitamin deficiency 
0	meditate
6	I feel broken	I'm female istp and I feel broken beyond repair. I don't think its curable. I can't stand a minute thinking about it.   \nI can't accept myself knowing that women are supposed to be obedient, be able to understand and express emotions, constantly show empathy and build rapport with people. \n\nI have no friends and this is killing my love life and career. I'm never taken seriously or feel attractive and I can't bring anything new into work practice without getting a senior talk me down first. I also know women are statistically immune to suicide so its not like I can take the easy way out either. I'm not depressed, I just think I should get lobotomised.   \nBut guys, is there hope for me? Can I convert and stop being such a loser? Asking before I do something I'll regret. I don't want to throw my life away over some petty illness  \nThanks
27	Quit comparing yourself to social standards, you will never be happy that way. Accept who you are and embrace who you are and be yourself. Who cares if you don't fit societal norms? Fitting in and not standing out is what makes you a loser, standing out and being yourself does not. You are as you see yourself, not as society sees you. 
9	My honest opinion? How old are you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're like less than 30, chill the fuck out. Yes dealing with people sucks, but you can learn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're like 50, well, hard times ahead., 
8	You're certainly not a loser despite feeling that way right now. Try to shift your focus to any small accomplishments in your life. Today mine were preparing lunch for tomorrow and painting my nails. Might seem meaningless but I know that after a few rough days my mind can suffer. However, when I start to feel inwardly pleased with any aspect of my day, created by me and sometimes helped by others, it gives further drive for the next day and so on. Hopefully in time this feeling will grow and you will recognise your own worth even when others sometimes don't. Do you have any interests or passions? Anything you could get involved in with others? Or even something you can enjoy alone and feel a sense of satisfaction from? \n\nSeek contentment in your own persona and quirks and attempt to  nurture these. If you're struggling a whole lot and it's maybe more medical then please find someone to talk to. Sometimes a simple imbalance can make us look down on ourselves and there's ways to fix that with other people's help.\n\nI hope you feel better soon and can have more positive experiences. 
3	If you don't have friends I suggest you find a hobby that 1) Uses lots of Se and 2) can help you make friends.\n\nI would suggest trekking, crossfit, or something like that. Not the gym. Something where there's a leader and you work within a group.\n\nOnline gaming is a good choice too but I think is not good for Fe improvement.
3	In regards to making friends, I agree with what others have been saying. Joining clubs/activities is a great way to meet new people. However, to make friends you have to take it one step further. You need to invite people to hang out with you outside of the activities that you know them from. It's nerve-wracking at first, but it gets easier once you realize that that most people are chill and want to make new friends. I typically invite people to any place that will provide a talking point to get things going as well as something to focus on if talking dies down. For example, I  invite people out hiking, to board game cafes, or to an event happening at a local bar (ex. wine and paint night). \n\nTo be honest, when I was younger I used to have trouble making friends. I thought that people didn't want to be my friend since I didn't fit social standards. I was too quiet, emotionless, and unfeminine. It wasn't until later that I realized that I was so quiet that I came off as unapproachable. People didn't talk to me because they thought I didn't want to be talked to, not because I wasn't emotional or empathetic enough. Once I took the initiative to approach people, I realized that most people enjoy having an extra friend and will gladly accept an invite out. Of course, there are exceptions but that's more of a reflection on them rather than you. \n\nI hope my rambling somewhat helped.\n\ntl;dr: To make friends sometimes you have to approach others first as ISTP's can be hard to approach. 
2	Female istp here. I've been there. A wallflower among peers, invisible kid in home, a tomboy everyone hate, unattractive girl, the unimportant not-cool kid in school, you name it. When we're younger, we're difficult to find our place in society because our traits looks misplaced. My mother always told me that I'm a weird kid & rebel. \nThanks to MBTI, I learned that I'm ISTP. I even cried reading ISTP articles for 1st time because the internet, an article understand me more than my own parents.\nNow that I'm more mature, I learn to love myself. Acknowledge to myself that I'm sexy, I'm loveable, I'm good with anything I put my effort into. \nAlso I dont really give a thought if I ever found a partner in my life anymore (I'm single now), I'm busy doing my hobby, learn new language, learn to bake (I love eating cakes, since they're overprice compared to their ingredients, I'm gonna make them myself and eat until I puke), enjoying my life. I dont care about people's opinions & people's treatment to me. I don't allow them to determine my inner peace. \nIMHO, next time when people do something bad to you, just shrug it off. I know you will angry/sad, who doesn't, "but sorry dude, your validation is not required, your humiliation can't define my character, because I am awesome and you are too unfortunate to know it" \nSorry for the bad grammar.
2	First off, W O M E N can do any damn thing they want to do. Most I know dont conform how society 'views' them. Secondly, you have the power. A lot of this IS you doing it to yourself but once you accept it you realize you have the power to change it.\n-You want to make you happy? \nDo that shit that makes you uncomfortable but will make you grow. \n-Bosses being dicks? \nFuck em! Time to move on and be appreciated for your time and efforts. Dont waste YOUR L I F E for shit heads.\n-Do you do physical exercise?\nDo it if you dont. Doesn't matter what but challenge your body to get out of your head for a bit and clear it. Martial Arts works great for me along with a bunch of other activities. \n-Cant connect with people in real life? \nDude, TONS of apps have solid algorithms to find lots of people with similar interests for almost anything! Meetup is a good app for such a thing. \n-Smoke weed? \n"Be a lot cooler if you did". Seriously, benefits can help vs taking scripts and give you time to also clear your head and reflect without all the negative red tape in your head. \n\nYou have the power. Dont feel sorry and wallow, you can change. 
1	Thank you for all the replies.   \nI've had a read and its made me think that how I feel probably comes from other underlying issues I've been trying to ignore. It's good to see that this 2% population isn't bound to be gloomy by default but can actually find self-acceptance and be happy which helps me diagnose my own problems so I can work on them.\n\nYou're all capable of socialising, being self confident and finding purpose so really I should be able to do the same and until then figure out everything else wrong with my life. Whether I'll come to terms with societal norms being pointless as you all say I'm not sure but this year I'll try becoming what I **can** achieve, and not what I think society thinks I should be.  \n I'll see about getting counselling and into martial arts also. No use talking if I don't act on it right? :) \n\nThanks again
1	Uuuuugh :( and this right here Is why I'm a feminist fellas, such a shame. These are social constructs on how to be female. There is nothing biological about the way females and males act, we know this because different cultures' males and females behave totally differently. You're not broken! Your personality prevents you from playing the laughable role of what the perfect American women is, embrace this. 
22	Trying so hard to change myself...	Sorry for the bad english.\n\nAm I the only one who've been trying to be the best version of myself ? Been trying to do that for a whiiile. I've went from depression, overcoming addictions, all kinds of laziness (still), family problems, my own internal problems, lack of confidence, etc blah blah.\n\nANd it is so hard sometimes i'm just like, stop those fforts just go with the flow man it's not wrth it, but I know it is and I always remember myself that too late, everynight I go to sleep and I say myself : "tomorrow I will be better" but I don't do or get better... I think I've done progress mentally but it's long before anyone see anything different from me...
12	What is it you want to change? I think live in present, do your best everyday for everything you do and you'll see you're changed before you even  realized it.\nThey say people overestimate a year effort and underestimate everyday effort. 
8	Change is a gradual thing. Don't look for results everyday. Keep doing those little steps that you identified as beneficial and moving you towards a goal you want to achieve, but try to free yourself from being overly attached to result. Accumulating those little steps- like drops of water in the bucket- eventually will amount to a fuller bucket.  \nWhat you do consistently day in and day out, what you do most days determines your tomorrow.  
7	I don't know you but it seems you are too harsh on yourself - like many of us ISTPs.\nThings that can be improved aside (laziness, routine, etc..) you should first learn how to love yourself before anything. Accept that you are the person you are today with all its perks and flaws. Face it, it's very difficult to change habits that took you half life time to acquire, but surely is possible. Start small with the end goal in mind and be happy with every little step towards your goal. There are techniques/books to help you with that process depending what you want to achieve or improve.\nLet us know, we will try our best to help.\n
4	How old are you?\n\nI didn't get comfortable or confident with my personality until my mid-late 20s. We all have internal and external demons but it takes time to sort them out. Some things you can never fix and since we've got a habit of trying to fix things, it is a hard lesson to learn.
4	Change happens slowly my man. Little bit day by day. You adjust to your changes as they come so they’re harder for you to notice. Look back 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, a year. How do you fare now compared to then? Bet it’s a big difference over a year. Just remember that a years worth of change looks much more impressive at the *end* of the year. It takes a years worth of daily work to get there. So even on days that feel less significant, remind yourself that a year down the road, those insignificant days will be overshadowed by the progress you made. 
3	Everyone strives to be the best version of themselves, they all deal with their struggles, that's the human experience. Depression, addiction, laziness, relationship issues, all sound like eternal problems that humans struggled with throughout history. Your problems feel very ominous and real, but when you put them in perspective they're easier to account for and brush off.\n\nOdds are you will face these issues throughout your life. There is no magical pill or solution that will just make them go away. You will have to experiment and try different solutions so that you can find a way to cope with these feelings when they arise.\n\nSuffering is part of our design. Even with everything stripped away, we would still struggle for food, water, and shelter. Instead of being at the mercy of your struggles, accept them, expect them, and work on finding ways to mitigate them.
3	So something that has helped me recently is we got a puppy, this might be long so bear with me. I started learning about the shadow self around this same time and tried to start treating my shadow the same way I would treat the puppy, punish him when he’s bad, reward the fuck out of him when he’s good, your shadow has a lot of pent up energy and all those “bad” impulses you have are just your shadow wanting to get out and run for a while. So you start learning to let him in very short controlled bursts, sounds like your in the wtf years and it’s a bitch I know but the best advice I have it stop saying things that make you feel psychologically weak, listen to your conscience and try to do what’s right not what’s easy. Start breaking bad habits slowly like you would train a dog not to do a bad habit. Idk I’m rambling at this point.
2	Try not to beat yourself up too much about the past. In order to move forward start a new physical hobby and make time for it.  Go outside and bike, hike, surf, ski, run, kayak, paddleboard, goecache, rock climb, play frisbee golf etc.. or just explore your city.  It will help your mind.
2	"  everynight I go to sleep and I say myself : "tomorrow I will be better" but I don't do or get better "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nman that's me. that's what i struggle with
1	Do you like ASMR?	I enjoy it, though despise eating sounds (it's only nam, nam, om nom nom, yuck). Slime, gentle story reading, knife making and art restoration sounds or kanji writing with pen = pure bliss for my ears. 
9	no
7	Yes. Hate eating sounds. Like unintentional soft spoken stuff.
2	Yeah, but can't do anything other than the mic scratching.
2	No, shits a little weird 
1	No
1	Sure but there are better things to spend my time on. 
1	soap cutting all day!!!!!
1	Sometimes, but I prefer it spoken and especially in foreign languages that I can’t understand.\n\nI don’t like the crackling or eating sounds at all. 
1	An INTP wondering about someone so similar, yet so different.	What do you spend most of your free time doing?\nWhat do you think about?\nWhat career paths are you interested in pursuing?\nWould you consider yourself a Machiavellian?
3	lol to answer your core question—yes, one letter can actually change EVERYTHING. my boyfriend is an INTP. :)
5	Wtf. A machiavillain???? Where the heck does that come from. \n\nYou'd be better finding one single ISTP and making friends and then asking them all this instead of expecting this entire sub to give personal essays on these questions-- which, also need to be a bit more specific if you want good answers. 
2	Too lazy to answer the question. 
1	1. Using my hands.\n2. Using my hands,\n3. Something where I get to use my hands. \n4. Individualist
0	Last entry	Feel free to delete this\n\nJust wanna say, I'm that chick who has trouble with my ISTP ignoring me and isolating me and now I think he broke up with me? He is so so so vague and I couldn't understand him. But he feels really shitty about all of this and about me so yeah that's an update for none of you that cared!\n\nI will unsub and kill myself now, goodbye world.
13	Hey, if you're being serious, dont kill yourself. Idk how to help you, but I can tell you that killing yourself isn't the answer. All problems are temporary. Yeah, whatever is going on with your boyfriend may suck, but its only a small piece of your life. Stuff will get better, if you give it time. Killing yourself only ends the possibility of things getting better.\n\nAnd regardless of how you feel, Im sure there are plenty of people who give a crap about you, and wouldn't want to see you do that. Im sure there are even plenty of us ISTP hardheads that wouldn't want to see you to do that, either. \n\nStay alive. Give it another day. And seriously, reach out to someone you're close to in real life. Go to a hospital if you need to. It may suck for a bit, but the sting will go away and I guarantee you'll be glad you did later on down the road.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n
5	He’s hurting right now. He needs time to process. People deal with issues differently. Give him time. I’m talking like weeks and months. Don’t make his decision for him. Don’t leave him with no options.
4	That narrows it down to hundreds of manipulators asking how to control their istp recently.\n\nBut good luck finding someone to control.
1	i don’t like these kind of posts. i actually get really sad and scared when i read them. like watching someone walking towards a cliff but being tied up and unable to help them in any way. hope you’re just venting and not really planning to kill yourself. :-/ 
1	So is she dead now?
14	How to help a suicidal ISTP?	Hello, INFJ here.\n\nI work with a really awesome ISTP who has a dark sense of humor and is genuinely super fun to be around!\n\nRecently he got fired from his internship and kicked out of school for bad grades.\n\nHe still lives at home and his parents haven't been nice about it and he's kept the same dark sense of humor as usual about suicide and self harm but he's been ending it with "not actually but actually" and Im getting concerned.\n\nI just want to help somehow but he's super hard to read and doesn't usually like things to get too serious. I've told him if he needs someone to talk to, he can always talk to me but has never reached out. What can I do? Help!\n\n&#x200B;
23	Just chill with him whenever he asks to hang out. If you don't hear anything from him for over a week, check in with him and ask him to go for some drinks or something easy going. He'll eventually open up and talk about whatever is on his mind when he feels comfortable
9	Just be there and make sure he knows your available to talk whenever period. Tell him everyone goes through rough patches, my mom has been my go to when I’m snuggling with mental health, anyone else and it’s none of their business unless I choose it is if they try and ask and I’m not in the mood then fuuuuck off, you gotta coax an istp while legit letting them know your care and your coaxing them, don’t push but be consistent ya know?
7	I was suicidal once, best thing I did was to learn. Got caught up in Cartesian Skepticism once and realized the only way out of it was to wrestle with first principles and work my way up from there. (Ti approach)  \nThe other thing that helps is to release tension in your body and make sure you are grounded. Body scan meditation helps a lot with listening to your body and learning to control your autonomic nervous system.  (Se approach)
4	I think it's hard for ISTPs to actually justify committing suicide to themselves, so while it's always a possibility and one that can be joked about to cope with some sort of issue (depression and anxiety, for example), it's usually as unrealistic as one of us waking up one morning and suddenly buying a ticket to Miami for a weekend without warning. Can it happen? Sure. But I think it's not really something we'd commit to often. \n\nBut I may be completely wrong, so take that with a grain of salt. Personally, I think that any existence is better than non-existence, stuff just gets hard and hurts sometimes. I wouldn't take it too too seriously, but everybody deserves somebody looking out for them. Just make sure you keep in contact, either through text or in person or whatever, and although they might not tell you exactly what's wrong, they'll probably give you enough information for you to piece it together.
2	I'm an ISTP and I don't think suicide is something we really seriously consider because it's illogical. I have a dark sense of humor too. I definitely get depressed sometimes though. If you want to pull him out of his funk find something he's accomplished or participate in a hobby he's interested in. Emotional support is appreciated but if that's all you do then we won't respond solely to that. 
1	If he was like younger me, I was obsessed with a search for meaning, and upset at the crazy and oft-meaningless world we live in.  Frequent disappointment and despair brought on by news media and politics turned into a persistent feeling of dread, rejection of the world, and a cynical outlook.\n\nIn my 30s I wrote something that gave me a new permanent, higher "bottom" to fall to, even at my worst.  It became impossible to ever fall to zero, or below.  If that makes sense.\n\nI sent it to you in PM.  I prefer it not to be a published work, if you don't mind.  If you like, I suggest printing it out, giving it to him in an envelope, and saying nothing.  Let him decide on his own what it means to him - don't try to coach him into discovering a sense of meaning.  (saying that as an ISTP)\n\nMaybe it'll be worth something.
8	Isolating yourself may hurt others!	I'm just saying, it hurts me and I won't stand for it. In some cases of ISTP's, this becomes way too much, and I need to find the right way to explain to my ISTP why this is a problem.\n\nI don't want him to change himself, I just don't want him to isolate himself whenever there's a problem because it is hurting people around him.\n\nI ask for your respect in the comments and your help. If I can't convince him that is WILL HURT HIM TOO IF HE KEEPS DOING IT then I can't seem to even talk about it at all.\n\nThank you for your time.
28	[deleted]
18	Is he isolating himself to think about the problem or to avoid it? There's a difference between those two. If the other person is clearly agitated I'd rather give both of us some time to think about it and real with the situation when we're calm.\n\nIf he's doing it to avoid the problem, that's a clear signal of immaturity. Might be something else, but I'm not going to jump into that conclusion when I have so little information. 
6	I'm the kind that isolate myself and I'd much rather stay that way.\nI need space to process my own emotion and make the right decision to keep going. If I need advice, I'll ask for it. But most of the time I know what I'm doing, so you just need to trust me and give me space.\nIf somebody tells me he/she is hurt because of my isolation, then I'll stay away further. Because that person isn't helping and definitely not making me feel better. It's my own problem and my life, so you have no say in it. If you're hurt by my action that's not targeted toward you, then it's your problem, not mine.\nI don't know if this will change if that somebody is very very very important for me though.
5	I become really agitated with no alone time , because I have to sort out my own issues and negativity. I wouldnt want to burden others with that.
11	So you want the istp act like a non istp because you feel this is right?\nDafuq. \n\nLeave them alone ffs.
3	Can you give us a little more context of the situation that is causing the ISTP to withdraw?
3	I think if you add more info in your post, you probably will get much better replies from us. When I first read your post, I thought "hey, I do that too. I retreat to be with myself during emotional conflict. I don't mean to hurt anyone but I need to sort out my own feelings before you and I can move to the next step. It's something about us that we need other types to understand."\n\nBut then I read some of your replies and it seems like your boyfriend had been isolating himself for a month now and didn't even say anything to you beforehand. I don't think that's normal for an ISTP (or at least for me) and it's definitely not something anyone should do to their SO, no matter what their type are. My "alone time" that I need to clear my head is usually just a day or two, and I always, ALWAYS let my boyfriend know even though I don't really feel like talking to him. After all, we're fighting this together not against each other.\n\nBut we don't know him and we don't know you. With little information you gave, we're all just guessing. I think the best way is try talking to him and at least understand what phrase you both are in. One thing, though, I too stop talking to someone without telling them anything. But it happens only when I cut that person out of my life (not in a romantic relationship, I always try to be as clear as possible when I break up). Just my two cents...\n
5	Why do you think it will hurt him too?
5	Bold strategy, non-ISTP coming into the ISTP sub and telling us what to do. How you got 7 upvotes is beyond me.
6	I don't know why you're being downvoted if you're right. ISTPs tend to isolate themselves way too much in occurrence.
2	What type are you if you don’t mind me asking? It might help me articulate my answer to fit more with your cognitive stack
2	Is it possible that he punishes you, doing that?
2	I believe that you are right in what you are saying. I agree with other comments saying that that's a sign of a more immature istp and that's definitely true. I think that you need to make it clear to him that's it's hurting you. If it's affecting you the way you say it is then that isn't fair and he needs to know that he needs to change for you. If he won't change the choice then falls on you, whether you want to leave or stay and help him change is up to you.
1	He isn't isolating himself, he is ignoring you
1	you are everything wrong with this world. stop telling someone else how to live their life. maybe he doesn’t give a shit about you. move on. he’s probably not hurting himself AT ALL. 
7	Conversations	How good are you at maintaining a conversation with someone? I suck at it because I try to say the least amount of words necessary to make my self as clear as possible(this usually ends the conversation short). Any tips on how to improve? 
11	Depends on the person. With some people I’m able to click with them right away (usually ENTP, ISTP, ESTP, INFP) while others can be a bit of a challenge (usually ESFJ, ISTJ, INTJ). \n\nFor smooth conversation I find it’s easier to steer the conversation towards mutual topics so I just out with my hobbies or what I plan to do on my time off. \n\nI’m very non PC so if the other person is the way it makes talking to them easier. I like to open up with a story that happened to me or a funny situation to break the ice. For example during a holiday party I outed with a story where I saw a homeless man light his pants on fire. People stopped their conversations to hear my story and suddenly it was all eyes on me. I then segued into other random stories and brought up the idea of playing dominoes as I always keep a set in my car. I find it easier to talk when my hand are doing some kind of activity.\n\nFor basic conversations a good acronym to remember is FORM. Family occupation recreation and motivation. 
11	**1. Have a bunch of good questions to ask if the conversation starts to fizzle.**\n\nHere it's less about the topic and more about getting to know the person. So questions that make people think a little bit and reveal some of their values and experiences are best:\n\n* What do you enjoy most about x?\n* Have you always been into y?\n* What do you think most people don't appreciate about z?\n\nGenerally the formula is to ask an open-ended question about what they *think* or how they *feel* about the topic you've been discussing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Listen out for hooks in the conversation and then play word association**\n\nHere it's about steering the topic of conversation to things you're both interested in.\n\n* You: Have you any plans for the holidays?\n* Them: Umm, I'm going to Greece in August. Looking forward to it.\n\nYou'll see how there's a number of hooks in there: Greece (climate, culture, history, etc.), August (summer, beach, etc.), looking forward (planning, expectation). Pick one and run with it:\n\n* You: So is the plan just non-stop dancing to Despacito on the beach for a week?\n* Them: Haha. No, I'll also do x\n\nIn the same way, you should litter what you say with such hook points so that they too can grab onto something. Try adding *detail* or *story* to what you say. So it can go from "I'll listen to most music really" to "Yeah. I like most music. But really been mostly into rock since I was 16. You can imagine: it's the 90's, I've got ridiculously stupid hair...."\n\n&#x200B;
3	Depends on the person and how much I care to talk to them. If its a person that loves to talk(most people) great, I'll just talk when I feel I can say something of value. If its another quiet introvert I am fine with doing most of the talking and instigating conversation
1	I'm content with saying next to nothing on long car rides and the other person doesn't care to talk then so be it.
67	I hate when people tell me what to do	Anybody else? Like if someone asks me politely to do something for them I’d be willing to do it and actually I’d be happy to do it, but when people demand things from me it really pisses me off, I hate being ordered around.
31	Depends on my relationship with the person who is doing it.  If it's a boss at work or an authority figure, I don't take it personally.  If it's someone close to me, they probably know me well enough to know what I will find acceptable to be told to do.\n\nAnyone else and I'll just give them a funny look.
18	The worst is when I am planning to do something and then someone tells me to do it. My mom used to do this to me about cleaning my room growing up. I'll be in the middle of something with the intention of cleaning afterwards but she'll come and tell me I need to vacuum right away. And me being a teenager would be like well  I was planning on doing that but since you told me to do it I need to wait now so it doesn't look like I'm doing it just because you told me to. 
16	Worse is when they passive aggressively tell you a problem, expect you to help, but won’t tell you how you can help.  I’d rather they tell me what to do than make me guess.
8	Depends on how much I trust them to make reasonable demands. And also the authority level. I guess I’ll add a few examples. \n\n\nBoss comes downstairs and spouts demands at us. Well, this dude is a goddamn business monster. When he tells us to do something, you know there’s a damn good reason and it needs to be done. \n\n\nHigher level employee that isn’t boss spouts demands. He/she can go fuck themselves. One, they aren’t my boss. And two, their job isn’t related to mine meaning I likely know my job better than them. Aka what they’re demanding is likely something to help *them* out. \n\n\nOr let’s say I’m at my buddies ranch. If he yells at me to do something, it’s because it’s an emergency. If he shouts “TURN THE FUCKING WATER OFF” I don’t question it. I get off my ass and book it to the water switch. He wouldn’t be telling me to do that if there wasn’t a very serious reason to do it. \n\n\nBasically every person has a rating by me of how much I accept demands. It’s based on trust, authority, past experiences, severity of situation, etc. There really is no blanket statement I can lay over the topic as a whole. 
7	Usually, only when I can identify what needs of the other person would be met by me doing it, and when I also agree that doing it would be the best way to get the other person’s need met as well as mine, then I’d be willing to do what the other person asks of me.\n\nAn example: When I just graduated, I told my mom that “I don’t want to attend the graduation ceremony as it is not the best use of my time.” We got into a bit of back-and-forth, with my mom trying to convince me why attending would be good for my own benefit, and me trying to explain how it is irrelevant in my field of work.\n\nAt one point, I said “I don’t find any use for this, but if you wanted a photo of me in that ceremony for sentimental reasons—” and then my mom said “yes, that’s what I wanted!” Right then I see this request from a different perspective: Compared to my parents’ dedication for me, attending this ceremony for them is a trivial task. I said “I’d be glad to attend the ceremony and get you my photo!”\n\nLater I learned about nonviolent communication (which helped me tremendously as an ISTP). Nowadays when I get demands I try my best to understand their underlying needs... I believe if we can truly understand each other’s needs, no one needs to do things they don’t want to do.
8	That’s like my dad when one of my cats will like throw up or something and he will just walk up to it a look at it and say “what is that??” When he knows exactly what it is but he just wants you to pay attention to it so you will clean it up. It’s so annoying. 
3	Swear that's the reason I dropped out of college.  The whole thing is just a circlejerk of constantly being told what to do.  We can handle the work, we just don't want to.  Wish I would have been able to see past that shit.  (Or there was a better way to get educatimatified...)
2	Yes, I've always hated being told what to do. If something impacts my well-being, you better have some type of qualification that makes your opinion matter. Otherwise I know you're not thinking of my needs and your voice is just noise distracting me from figuring it out myself and getting what *I* need.\n\nI can be very arrogant when it's a decision I really care about, however I've learned to be polite and brainstorm with other people effectively by this age.\n\nI attribute this rebellion to growing up with an overbearing mom. She loves to micromanage and feel like she is the boss. The most frustrating phrase I heard growing up was "because I said so." Shes done a lot for me but at the end of the day the only person who knows what makes you happy is yourself.
2	Bonus point if you were just about to do it. 
2	For me it depends on how they say it and if it makes sense. Sometimes if one of them is lacking I can get frustrated by it.

2	My dad loves micromanaging me. ISTJ to the core he is... I absolutely fucking hate people who micromanage
1	Yeah, I have a problem with authority. 
1	Yes. Unless I am in obviously subordinate situation (employee or I want something from a not-so-close person ) I don't take orders
1	Yes, absolutely understand 
1	My mom, who doesn't live with me, has been nagging me to shave or at least trim my beard. I haven't done it yet out of spite. It's been a month, but she keeps telling me
1	I only mind it if I respect them or there is a logical reason to follow someone else's lead. 
1	Yeah, especially my siblings. Sometimes when people sinply walk up to me telling me to do someting I can flame up really fast.

22	Hint from an ENFP	Recently I have been hanging out with my ENFP friend a lot. So he gave me an interesting hint how to develop Extraverted Feeling. As we ISTPs are famous for not caring about others (except of closed ones) I decided to post this here.\n\nHe said "always ask yourself: what does he/she want?". And he said that even about clay modeling "ask yourself: what does clay want to become?"
26	Lmao the guru has spoken! Funny I find the clay advice better than the human advice. 
18	[deleted]
7	Why would i ask myself what does someone want? Shouldn't i ask them instead?\nCause chances are- i'll be projecting. \n\nThis is exactly the problem with relationships- people  projecting their own wants and feelings into you and then getting offended that it doesn't get them applause or match reality. 
6	Eeek. That's Extraverted Intuition. Extraverted Feeling is saying the right things that would make the clay feel good, and it doesn't matter whether you personally agree to that feeling or not. It's about the clay's feelings.
2	If someone wants something from me and they can't be arsed to ask, I'm under no obligation to try and guess. And the clay part seems stupid.
1	Except the ENFP somehow always decides I want them to “fix” me, no matter what I say
1	Enfp to istp\nPokepokepokepokepokepokepokepokepokedoooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiitttttt!!!!!
29	Does anyone else have a very visual thinking?	Like having a rendering  or maping program in your head.\n\nIt analises stuff and sound kinda Se and Si at the same time
9	Yeah, I do as well. You'll see me with my eyes going around if you describe something that I try to imagine. haha  \nI first thought everyone else does it the same way. But I researched and noticed that people don't think the same way.  Most are Visual thinkers(\~ 60 % I would say.), but many are Verbal Thinkers as well(\~ 30 %) and some are even Feelers(\~10 %). So I try to identify sometimes how people are communicating and mirror their thought process based on their preference. 
9	I have to physically write stuff out on a piece of paper to understand it sometimes especially numbers and measurements so I end up picturing myself writing on a piece of paper whenever I have to solve math or figure out how big something is. I thought everyone did though but maybe not.
9	I can rearrange the furniture in my apartment in my head, or change the color of the walls.  Pretty useful in my product engineering career so far.
5	Yes. I memorise codes by imagining digit positions in a numpad and make calculations by picturing dices in my head. It's pretty weird I don't know anyone doing it. The cake goes to music, when I hear music I see harmonic compositions as a flow of waves in a sequencer.
5	I have my own personal street view.
3	I am the king of the white board.
2	Yeah but I suck at drawing and explaining myself, so it's fucking useless to me. 
2	Depends on what you mean by visual thinking. Are you talking about manipulating detailed sensory experience or manipulating abstract shapes in your head, taking reference from objective reality? Because I would be the latter.
1	Absolutely.  I'm shit at explaining things in writing generally, but excellent at using my body and spatial relations to describe an event.
1	When I pay close attention to people talking, I see their words. 
1	No. I never do it.
1	I'll have my own room constructed next week, and for a month I've been thinking how it should look like. The preparation is very visual, like I can already imagine it done and I'm living in it.
1	I'm not sure to what degree you're saying "visual thinking," but generally speaking, I'd say yes, my thoughts and ideas can be pretty visual at times. I can usually see what I'm focused on clearly enough to trace things out, number things, estimate lengths or distance, come up with basic schematics, etc. 
3	How do I relate to INTP	I am privileged to lead a team and I “get” everyone except for one INTP.  What are some tactics I can use to better understand her needs and be patient enough to let her GET TO THE DAMN POINT!?  Will providing a framework and structure for her to work within help or hurt her?
8	INTP here. Try explaining not only what you need and expect from her, but why, and how it benefits the project/goal as a whole.  If possible, use practical comparisons to other situations. Once she gets a hang of things, try to take more of a “hands off” approach unless she needs guidance or assistance as this will most likely streamline performance and make for less distraction. 
3	Ask them questions in a way where they have no choice but to answer from a practical angle. 
69	Why I Unsubbed In 2 Words	Relationship advice
41	and other types trying to understand "ISTPs" rather than just communicating with them. 
14	Just point them towards the stickied user guide. If they can't read it we can't help them.
23	Sex and money are all that matter.\n\nMoney is a matter of math. People who are bad with money don’t advertise the fact because they can be proven a fool.\n\nPeople who are bad at relationships advertise because others who are just as bad will rush to their defense, and they can all mutually assure each other that everyone else is wrong.
14	To be fair, ISTP's are a mystery, nobody knows what is going on and it is very difficult to understand you. You rarely ever communicate what you're feeling and thus, you're making it hard for us feelers to care for you.\n\nAs a feeler, dating a thinker is the optimal. But when you shut yourself in and refuse to talk to us (I am not talking about everybody here obviously, just some) it can be really really difficult.\n\nI think we just want to try and understand you.\nWe want to be there for you and be nice to you, but sometimes it feels like all we do annoys you.\n\nHope nobody took this the wrong way! Have a good day.
4	It's been getting worse lately too
5	but muh emotional intricacy!
5	I - dare I say - feel ya.
13	why dont we just ban that
7	It's too bad you couldn't just focus on the content you like and scroll past the content you don't. I didn't realize we had to babysit you. But I'm glad you got up on the soapbox, cool story.\n
3	Ok wow. It’s like 9/10 people seeking relationship advice. 
3	Agree! Meanwhile, I'm really fed up with /mbti subreddit, where most of the threads are "type me". Soon people will be asking others to type them by the color of their poop.
3	Don't go over to r/AskMen, then. 80% of the posts are "How do I know if I like a girl?"\n
1	Im an ISTJ and I CONSTANTLY see on that page some long drawn out post from some one basically asking how to manipulate an ISTJ into a relationship. "I known and like him for 6 years and he just stares at me and doesn't initiate conversation. He doesnt talk about his feelings or share his innermost personal secrets with me and it kinda bums me out. How can I get him to fall in love with me if he never tells me if he even likes me?" Fo realz? Six years? Probably because he doesn't see you as a keeper but your not offensive enough to kick to the curb. Hell just let you hang around in your neutral spot doing whatever it is your relationship  involves until something or someone happens to justify your removal. Next. 
2	When starting to date someone what are some yellow flags? Like, maybe you will keep dating but one foot just moved out the door?	
17	What is dating?
10	They get mad when you don't like their posts on social media
11	Needing constant verbal affirmation. 
6	Addiction to social media, being a poor communicator, tarot cards and astrology shit, no goals or ambitions, no hobbies, terrible with money, constantly putting other people down for the sake of conversation, talking about exes repeatedly and having nothing good to say about them.\n\n^/singleasfuck
3	Red flag lookin out for yellow flags thats cute bro
1	Sends way too many text messages
5	Hey ISTPs, how can we INFJs build a closer relationship with you?	I'm an INFJ, and I have an ISTP friend of 3 years whom I see as I can confide in and healthily debate with. I think I may have grown an interest in him beyond just being purely platonic friends, but even so, I'm genuinely interested in him as a person and would like to get closer to him (as friends first). He can be difficult to read sometimes, especially over text, which I have found is really not the best way for us to keep in touch.  \n\nWe used to meet on a weekly basis due to a group study, but since we both graduated, started working and all our mutual friends we used to regularly hang out with have started getting into relationships, that frequency has gotten more sparse (almost on a quarterly basis now) – although I'd like to pick up the frequency again in a way that doesn't scare him off, or impose on his life. \n\nAny advice?
10	INFP with ISTP SO here\n\n>he can be difficult to read sometimes\n\nBe careful with this. ISTPs mean what they say. You dont need to read into it. Just reach out and be direct.  
9	I'm an ISTP. Respect is the fastest way to our heart. Don't be all mushy and hang on us (unless we're in the mood). Show interest in their interests and be willing to use logic to defend any opposing view you have. If you do those things you'll have us eating out of your hand in no time. 
5	Tell him you wanna hang out.
3	Go a and say to him "I am interested at shooting recently, never tried it, can you come with me to the shooting range?" 
3	Regular contact in person is what works for me. However this only happens when I meet people through a shared activity. Once the activity isn't shared any more I tend to lose contact with the people. So I'd recommend that - find an activity that you can share with him, that won't feel forced.
4	What social media do you use?	Heyo, fellow ISTP here. Recently I've been trying to remove myself from almost every type of social media (besides Reddit and Snapchat). I would delete Instagram but the gf likes me to comment on her posts and like them and such.\n\nDo you use social media as well or have you moved away from it?
12	Just Instagram. Reddit isn't social media IMO because almost none of us reveal our identities.  
3	I lurk on Reddit mostly and don’t use my Facebook ever anymore. I don’t see the point of social media anymore really. 
2	Over the last decade, I've been a super hardcore Facebook user. I'm starting to fall out of it. Just so much drama, ads, ignorant people in all political spectrums, general disrespect, and a lack of support for one another. Even on pages and in groups where people share values or interests, people act shitty to one another.\n\nI probably won't entirely quit Facebook, because I do have friends on there, and the marketplace is a good resource, but I've been loathing Facebook every time I've opened it the last couple months.\n\nReddit is a newer "discovery" for me. Known about it for a long time, but only recently started using it as a replacement for Facebook. I dig the incentive to be a decent person. Karma's a simple mechanic, but seems to keep people civil enough.\n\nNever been into Snapchat or Instagram. Have a Twitter account but I think Twitter is worse than Facebook so I almost never check it.
2	Twitter and Reddit
2	Ive got a Facebook, but I never post anything. Id get rid of it, if it didn't mean losing contact with certain friends/family. \n\nOutside of that, I've got an Instagram, but again, I never post anything. Ill just browse nature/motorcycle/car/gun/military pics when Im bored.
1	Facebook, reddit, and some local forum 
1	Reddit, if random replies in a few subs count? Otherwise none. I have an FB account, haven't touched it in about a year. I generally despise social media.
1	Most Instagram(@this.type) and some Facebook.
1	Twitter Snapchat Instagram. Rarely uses the latter but likes things. Snapchat occasionnally... but rarely nowadays. Twitter a lot but it's start to piss me off I consider stopping
1	tumblr, snapchat and instagram\n\ni post on tumblr, i use snapchat everyday and post on a private story but never on my actual story\n\ni like and comment on instagram but i never post 
1	Twitter and Reddit are the only two I use now. I enjoy sharing my perspective without having to be judged by these people in person. 
1	Snapchat and Reddit.
4	how important is looks/physical Appearance in relation to a man/woman you're interested in hooking up with? Dating/as an SO?	Just curious, are you standards high?\n\n\nWhat is most important amongst these, in what order?  Or I guess what do you gravitate to as far as our eyes/where they wander?\n\n* Face\n* What parts of the upper body? \nChest/Bust/AbsForearms/Hands/Nails\n* Their genitals/how they look naked?\n* Lower body?\nThighs/Rear/Legs/Calves/Feet\n\n\n(particulars?)\n\nHair(style/color)?\nEye color?\nClothing?\nTattoos/Piercings?\n\nWould you overlook someone who is below average if you meshed well? Would an average looking person be someone you'd want, if you again, meshed well?
13	An attractive face and nice hair does matter to who I’d initially find attractive. Body doesn’t matter a whole lot, but if they are fit it’s an added bonus.\n\n\nThough none of this really matters to me if the person has a garbage personality. Physical appearance is what draws me in and vibing well is what keeps me hooked.
12	I gravitate towards people who have unique features or style. Can't stand Barbie's and bros.
7	Honestly, just being fit is very attractive to me. I do want them to be cute (to me) though. Fitness is a matter of discipline and self investment, I also want a partner to share my physical interests with. Then it's a matter of seeing if they're not an idiot.
3	Looks are very important. I know if I could ever hook up with someone the second I see them for the very 1st time. I don't mean common beauty standards, but my own. \n\nThe single most important feature is hair. Men with longer hair have an advantage. Those with signs of baldness stand no chance whatsoever. I'm speaking in general terms; I already have the perfect looking (for me) one <3
4	I plead the 5th for in case my answer may somehow incriminate me in future relationships
2	This doesn't belong in this sub.
1	Body is the most important. Solid and proportional. Face is least important, within reason. No real preference in hair or eyes, etc.\n\nI could go lower if she was a really good match.
4	ISTPs	Personal question, this is for data so i can reinforce my understanding of  ISTPs.\n\nCompletely disregard functions for a moment and just focus on introspection when I ask this. Which of these two do you resonate with the most.\n\n1. You are highly in tune with your personal experience and seek to create comfort, quality and style\n\n2. You are an arderous producer of logic and structure and you desire to enforce this logic upon your life\n\nEdit: Something happened to the order of the question that fucked up the alternatives for a moment
19	It's weird because "arduous producer" is such a turnoff, but I view the world as a set of rules and general known truths. I use this knowledge to create comfort and quality, less so style, and seek to remain within a realm of general comfort, if even complacency. So, 1 by way of 2, detour around arduous production.
5	Definitely the first over the second.\n\nHowever, the first one could apply to an Enneagram 9, the second to an Enneagram 1.  I only bring that up because you said disregard functions and just introspect.
3	More of 1 (mostly because I had to look up what arduous meant) with short bursts of 2.
3	1. I'm moreso the sensing subtype than the logical one. While still logical I care more about experiencing things, dressing well, and getting along well with others
5	\nMan. These are the same statements put 2 different ways. \n\nIf I’m creating I am using logic (for what I envision, which will give me comfort, etc) and that logic is also used to structure my life, mostly. Same process for both. It’s not separate. Just what am I doing at the time? What’s in front of me?
3	I feel very strongly about those questions.\n\nWorded as they are, they mean nothing to me.\n\nLike wtf are you talking about?\nI'm a simple man, ask me simple questions.
3	These types of questions are ambiguous and depend on context but I guess No 2.
2	2 by far and it's not even close.\n\nEdit: Still 2 but it's a little closer because I value personal experience and style. Apparently also impulsive hence this edit.
2	1
2	 #1. And by that, I mean the 2nd #1.\n\nYou numbered them both 1 lol
2	Arderous?
2	1 for the most part. I don’t necessarily hide info from other. I’m more of “I have all the answers you seek, but your not asking the right questions” kind of person. So I’m always pretty comfortable.
2	 3. You are extremely bothered by the fact that 1. is used twice.
1	Neither. not even close
1	You've put me in a tight spot here. 
1	I don’t really understand what you’re trying to get at. Like others said they don’t seem mutually exclusive 
1	#1 for sure.
1	Hard question. I pick no. 1
12	How to differentiate​ between ISTP & INTP	Did any of you think you were INTP and then realise that you are actually ISTP? What would be the major differences between the two types? \n\nAlso, is anyone in an ISTP-ENTP relationship? What's that dynamic like?
15	Just stop believing in the stereotypes for a moment. While it is true that many ISTPs are good with their hands, in reality. This is as much fantasy as saying INTPs are all scientists. Ti makes us extensive producers of logic and reasoning, Se makes us in tune with our environment. Together, this causes us to produce logic that we enforce inside our environment or logic that we examine through the environment. Ni narrows down the logic to one coherent conclusion, we then extract the core principles of each conclusion and put it into a structure through Ti. Most people will tell you that this is a Ti-Ni loop, this is *not* a Ti-Ni loop. Whenever I follow the advice of doing things that  'engages your Se'  I become very unhealthy and over-indulge in stimuli and then as soon as I'm done, i just retreat back into my head. What you really need to do to get out of a Ti-Ni loop is to try and enforce your logic into your environment. A Ti-Ni loop would mean that you would be reaching random conclusions based off the information you've deconstructed, if you find yourself making a lot of false assumption, then you're actually in a Ti-Ni loop
15	I would say ISTPs are more hands-on and INTPs are more in their heads.
11	I test between INTP and ISTP. It depends on my mood, environment, and people I'm with, but I'm dominantly ISTP.\n\nINTPs rely heavily on internal rules and understandings. When subjected to an unknown environment, INTPs will pay attention to what they did in the past and try to understand the present moment.\n\nISTPs rely upon their sensations and surroundings. When put into an unknown environment, they will pay attention to what's going on around them, take in new data, and try to understand it.
7	When I first took the test it said INTP, but I was at like 51%N 49%S. So not really sure if I'm the best person to answer or the worst, but I think the difference is mostly INTP get distracted mostly by their study of random things. Where as ISTP get distracted mostly but random objects they've decided to fidget with.
7	If it takes you a full minute to realise someones talking to you before giving a condescending response, you're an INTP.
4	i think this is actually a really easy distinction, but that could be because i’m an ISTP in a relationship with an INTP. not to burst anyone’s bubble, but INTPs are way fucking smarter than ISTPs with theoretical concepts and just learning in general. we are good at certain types of things (and much better than them at some things), but they have a crazy awesome ability to intuit and learn anything they decide they want to. i think a lot of that is patience. we are doers, they are patient learners. it’s cool to watch. 
6	I have a close percentage between N and S, and depending on what I've been doing recently, and my mood determines the MBTI outcome. \nI like to tinker with things and figure out how they work, but I also like reading about many different subjects, and I can be completely lazy.\nI've had a job as a heavy equipment mechanic, and now I sit at a desk reading survey responses.\nThough I'm a strong introvert, I can function with a job that forced me to interact with people. Recently, I was intercepting random people to conduct surveys.
4	It took me years to figure out if I was an INTP or ISTP and I still question myself sometimes. I finally just decided by talking to people of each type and found I related a lot more with ISTPs.
3	INTPs are more expressive, which says a lot since we aren’t very expressive
3	If you're really into mbti, then it's better to read the cognitive functions than the S vs N divide on test results. \n\nBoth are Ti-dominant and Fe-inferior. They are alike in judging things. The difference is in the perceiving functions. INTP has Ne (knowing all the possible routes via ideas) and Si (stocking information internally, lego-like) and ISTP has Se (spatial awareness) and Ni (knowing the single best route). \n\nIf one would ask an ISTP and INTP to provide a solution to a problem, this is how the two would do it:\n\nINTP > understand the core of the problem via Ti > find ideas associated with the problem via Ne > pull up stock ideas and restructure them via Si \n\nISTP > understand the core of the problem via Ti > find tangible things associated with the problem and begins the solution with those things (via Se) > decide the best format unconsciously via Ni \n\nINTP takes a longer time to find a solution because Ne is far reaching and can go on tangents, and may not be satisfied with the solution and may further think of a better solution because the problem gets stocked in Si fashion. \n\nISTP sees the problem-solving in Se-manner, in the here and now, and will not think too much about it because ISTPs cannot stock depth of information for its lack of Si.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I've been scoring INTP on different tests about 80% of the time through last few years. Other times I scored ISTP, even INTJ and ISTJ once. 50/50 on S/N .\nRead some blogs on it and been lurking on subreddits for some time now and I think I can relate to ISTP the most. \nI do see similar tendencies and habits I share with INTP but I just feel like I dont belong there and cant fully relate.\nHonestly learning about cognitive functions in detail and typing people seems like useless knowledge to me. So after "being" INTP for some time, Im going as ISTP now.
1	I'm about 50/50 ISTP/INTP. \n\nSensory vs Intuition.\n\nSensors in the case of ISTPs tend to be more practical, hands on if you will. They're usually thinkers that like to see theory at work. Science as it functions in the real world. And in many cases, they also usually like to see if they can push some of the limitations of the things they tinker with.  They're usually mechanics and inventors in their respective fields, putting the science to work.\n\nIntuitives in the case of INTPs are intelligent theorists, though they don't tinker, build or make as ISTPs do. Not in the real world anyway. They tinker in their mind mostly, imagining possibilities, formulating new theories and bouncing those theories around with their peers and potentially students. They're usually designers, educators and speakers of theory in their respective fields.
1	i find that intp are more intellectual, and istp are more technical. 
3	I'm not sure where else to post this (relationships)	This sub probably gets me the most because for a long time I felt I was some emotionally broken thing. Then I was figured out my personality, gave this sub a shot, and realise I'm not broken just misplaced/misunderstood. \n\nSo my burning question is about relationships. A little history about me is I was heavily depressed about a year ago. It was all personal. I had a dead end job, school was going no where, I was barely living with my head above water, and what the last straw was the 2 people I loved most at the time I couldn't afford Christmas present for. I was low, destructive, and brought everyone with me. \n\nNeedless to say that didn't end well. I agreed to split up with my girlfriend at the time. Which was actually wonderful but not for the reasons I fear she holds on to. Because it gave me the opertunity to fight out of the Rut I was stuck in. I was forced to do something about it. She was wonderful. Too wonderful. She supported me through all of it which I kinda felt like it enabled me to continue being a sad sac. And it wasn't fair how I treated her and the guilt eats me to this day. But more importantly I miss her little girl that I spent almost 5 years raising. \n\nFast forward a bit and now I'm in a different state, wonderful job, livable wage for myself, a new love interest and finally happy. Which then dawns on me how shitty I was to her. And I feel terrible. When before I couldn't explain an emotion even if my life depended on it. \n\nI'm not sure where this is going tbh. Maybe it's a vent? What do you guys think? I'm not one to over think so is this that? Or did/do I really love her? I'd talk to her but I'm sure I'm blocked in every way. Maybe closure. Idk. Any advice I'd greatly appreciate. 
10	i like to live at peace with all men as much as it depends on me, so i’m all for reaching out—with a few caveats. i make sure it’s a ONE time thing, that i spend a long time planning everything i want to say and say it all, and that it ends on a positive note that the other person understands is not meant to restart anything. if they don’t get it or don’t respond, that’s not on you, you’ve done what you can and can then accept closure. 
27	How do ISTPs handle other's negative emotions?	I can have great empathy when someone suffers. However, emotions that I seem to refuse or am unable to cope with are those that involve anger.\n\nAnger, yelling, sarcasm ect. turn me off and just create a barrier. I want to escape or walk away from it.\n\nHowever, if someone is sad or crying, I feel that pain and want to listen and be encouraging.\n\nHow do you other ISTPs handle the emotional sides of others?
25	I’m very similar. I’m very empathetic towards someone who’s in pain. But when you let your anger drive bad decisions, buh bye I want nothing of it. I realized how toxic anger was a while back and tried to rid my life of it. I get upset and frustrated, sure. But anger has never once helped me solve a single problem. In fact, it almost *always* makes my problems so much worse. So I worked really hard to curb my anger. And I didn’t do all that just to wallow in someone else’s anger. 
9	To me anger is usually an illogical emotion, maybe it's because I struggle to give that much of a shit about anything, maybe it's because I usually try to solve problems before they get to that point for me, either way witnessing someone totally raging about something always seems like a waste of energy to me. When it comes to sadness, it depends on my relationship to the person and what they're sad about. I try to help fix whatever issue they're having if I can but if it's sadness due to something like a death in the family I try to just let someone else step in because I never know how to handle something that intense.
12	I just ignore them and hope they go away lmao
6	Idk whether I'm missing something but I never feel someone else's emotions
5	I try to get away from it too, which I know is not an ideal solution if someone is angry at me.  But, it prevents me from saying something or doing something I will regret in the heat of the moment. I like to go workout and clear my head so I can be more mentally ready to face that person again if necessary.  \n\nAnger is an exhausting emotion for me.  Too bad people can't just tell me what is making them angry and what needs to be done to make them not angry so I can fix it or tell them I'm sorry about whatever made them so upset. Asking an already angry person "Why are you angry" seems to make them angrier because I think I was supposed to already know the reason... oops.\n\nI get you on the empathy thing, I'm way better with sad/upset people than angry people.
3	I let others experience and deal with their emotions. If I get involved, it is to remind them that it's ok to take time to feel the emotions. It's part of the human experience. 
3	yeah no way. it’s actually a big point of contention between my bf and i that i leave the house whenever i get really angry. he wants to sit down and talk about it immediately but i know myself well enough after 28 years not to do that. i think you gotta do you. 
2	Lol
2	If someone is having a bad day I usually just leave them alone because that’s what I would want. Especially if they’re sad...some simple words aren’t going to change that. I would either do something useful for them, or if just leave them alone to ride it out if nothing could be done.
1	I have a hard time empathizing with others... or even putting words to what I’m feeling. 
8	How do you compliment an ISTP?	Nothing too emotional, right? :)
34	With a genuine compliment . Pick something specific and with thought. It doesn't have to be elaborate or real wordy, but genuineness is key. Just be real.
20	Don’t lie.\n\nAn insincere compliment will backfire. I think that’s  the primary reason we have a reputation as pricks. We can smell insincerity a mile away, it irritates us and we can’t just let it pass.
18	"Hey, you're cool/I appreciate you"\n\n"Thanks man"\n\nEnd of interaction
15	Compliment on something I can affect, like my work and not my looks, since I can't choose my genetics.
6	If you compliment my clothes, my looks, my personality I will feel awkward and not know what to do. \n\nOn the other hand, if you compliment something I did that takes some effort, I will feel appreciated for someone acknowledging my work. 
5	Compliment skills. These are things that we worked hard to perfect and will appreciate compliments for.
5	COmpliment them on something they tried hard to achieve on. Compliment them on specific thing is cool too. I genuinely love when someone compliment me on something I do that I don't find special at all but the person likes it;
7	unless you absolutely feel the need to, don’t 
2	Notice, and tell me when I do something well.
1	I personally can’t respect people who come in my Instagram page and JUST like pictures of mine. Yes I'm beautiful but what about my thoughts? (I post most things about my idea, quotes, something logical) That's real me. My thoughts and beliefs are the real me. So make her/him happy by a not fake compliment of her thoughts that you have words for that. 
-4	Suck him off
-3	Suck him off
19	Unable to get angry in public or private	Anyone else have this problem? I can't experience anger in the same way that others do, when someone offends me or does something wrong I just calmly think of the most rational response. The problem is that it often means people don't take me seriously or think I'm a pushover. How do I make myself get angry?
32	You don't need to get angry. Just be clever with your comebacks. 
7	Same, I think I'm just shy, cause if I'm debating someone online there's rage a plenty
6	Just negative emotions in general. I feel like if I show sadness or embarrassment or whatever, it’s showing weakness. There’s probably some psychological thing in there related to me being the oldest child and cousin 🤷🏻‍♂️
9	I don't really have a problem getting angry. My problem is being angry for the wrong reasons. When my emotions take over, primarily on days that already started out bad, I flip for stupid reasons. Yell at my wife for not closing a door right or for feeding the dogs wrong. Stupid stuff. All other times, I'm a rational human being. Just don't catch me on a bad day. My rationality goes buhbye.
2	What worked for me was spending time with people who piss me off. My flatmate can be truly insufferable sometimes... will often say things just to provoke me.\n\nWhat I think you need to experience is getting angry at someone and still feel like they accept you afterwards. I haven't experienced that much growing up, so it was a quite strange experience to me. This is probably useless advice but whatever.
2	As a kid I was very shy. As an adult I’m not shy just very quiet. I spent a considerable amount of time in the armed forces and security so I have a very thick skin when it comes to confrontation. That being said it takes a lot to upset me, but when it happens it ain’t pretty.\n\nDuring those times people try to get under my skin I remain calm and reply with witty comebacks and or veiled compliments usually implementing sarcasm.\n\nMost of the time I just get annoyed not really angry. 
2	Wow, that’s amazing. My life would be ideal, if I couldn’t get angry. You’re basically untouchable. That’s a strength, not a weakness.
1	I can't get angry around other people, only when I'm alone. I control it pretty well, I wanna break stuff but don't because I know it will only cause more problems.\nIf I ever get angry around people, it probably means someone is about to get hurt, and it aint gonna be me.
1	I fake it. 
1	I'm also like this, and so is my dad. He's also an ISTP.
1	Don't think this has to do with MBTI, since I basically have the opposite of this.
1	How to turn an ISTP on?	My ISTP boyfriend is not very keen on sex (and I know not all of your are the same) but help.\n\nI have a very high sex drive (ENFP female) and I just want him all the time, but I want to make him feel like I do when I see him. I want to be able to turn him on the way he turns me on.\n\nAny advice at all?
27	Unfortunately, sex drive is kinda out of one’s hands. \n\nI can’t imagine being uninterested in sex, sounds peaceful. 
8	Not a personality based thing at all. Me (istp) and my partner (enfj) have the opposite issue. Key issue is communication. The more you both open up to each other the better everything goes. 
8	This has nothing to do with ISTP, try some lingerie or just ask what he is into. 
10	Couple ideas:\n\nBe hotter\n\nHave him quit watching porn\n\nHave him take zinc supplements\n\nHave him workout more\n\nHave him switch to a healthier diet\n\nGet better at giving head and riding his dick\n\n&#x200B;
5	I hope this doesn’t come off as rude, as I totally don’t mean it to be. It’s coming from someone who’s been on the other end of this that knows what it’s like to have someone try and force change because they’d like you better. But honestly? Just stop. Stop trying to change him to make him what you want him to be. It’s not fair of you to do that to him. He is who is he is and it’s not your right to change him like that. There’s a huge difference between growing together and actively trying to change someone. Obviously people change when they are in a relationship, but it needs to be organic. Otherwise it’s just manipulative. \n\n\nThis is the man you’ve chosen to attach yourself too. Since you never mentioned that anything has changed, I have to assume he’s always been like this. And it’s not his fault you aren’t okay with a huge part of his personality. If you chose to go forward with him just hoping he’d one day change, that’s on you. \n\n\nNow I know you don’t mean any harm. I know this isn’t malicious and you think you’re just trying to get closer to him. But the unfortunate reality is that you trying to change something that’s a huge part of his personality. Sex drive is one of life’s biggest motivators. It’s a massive defining part of a relationship. It also plays a massive role in the psychological well being. So it’s not just some small obscure personality trait. If you keep trying to change it, it’s not going to end well. He may end up becoming someone he doesn’t know how to be, or you’ll end up resenting him for not being what you want him to be. \n\n\nBeing pressured into changing my sexual habits/preferences sent me down a really dark path that I’m only now recovering from. So I understand, first hand, how damaging this can actually be. \n\n\nSo really you’re best option is to just decide wether or not you love him enough as he is and make a decision. \n\n\nAnd again, I hope I didn’t come off as rude. I’m not trying to yell or get angry. I’m simply trying to inform you how poorly this can go based on personal experience and my (admittedly limited) understanding of psychology. So I hope you get that and don’t take this comment the wrong way. 
4	Kidnap him, take him to your dungeon, lock him into a bondage device and use reward circuit theory to teach him to enjoy sex?
2	Honestly, as an ISTP, I find it easier to want to be more intimate when I feel respected and appreciated.
1	Are you my ex?
1	What does an ISTP do when he wants to break up?	
14	They will stay until there is no "light at the end of the tunnel" but once the switch is flipped they will walk away from everything.
10	Breaks up.  \nThat means there is no way back.  That means all bridges have collapsed.  That means we've held on the best we could, until the end.  It is the end now. 
9	It means everything between the two of you is over, and he doesn't want to be reminded of you anymore.
9	Breaks up
5	To an ISTP the most important thing is time. If we no longer want to spend time with you then a breakup is imminent 
4	Doesn't respond to texts and just hopes it goes away eventually 
1	If he's decided he wants to break up, very little will change his mind except his own. 
0	My ISTP boyfriend ignores me?? (ENFP)	I am an ENFP female and I have been dating my ISTP boyfriend for three months now. Everything was going great (notice a pattern here?) But when my mental health started declining he got more and more distant.\n\nI have Borderline Personality Disorder, and that makes me EVEN MORE EMOTIONAL than a normal ENFP. I am very depressed and have panic attacks and abandonment issues + more, and when I told a friend of his that I wanted to kill myself, he found out, and that was like the last drop.\n\nEver since then I have asked if he wanted a break and he said yes, I just want what's best for him and I love him so so much. I just want to take care of him. I try give him the space that he needs even though it hurts me (abandonment issues, I need re-evaluation.) I cry every day, this morning I cried twice because my mood is so unstable.\n\nI know you ISTP's will ditch someone if they have a negative impact on your life. But I want to be the happy, bubbly, romantic that he knew and love again. I want to be a positive impact for him again. Any advice on how I can save this?\n\nIf we talk occasionally about other stuff (like once a week maybe? I've lost count?) And he still keeps me around, does he really want to break up with me?\n\nThank you for taking the time.\n\nEDIT: I DUMPED HIS ASS HAHAHAHHA FUCK HIM FOR MAKING ME CHANGE HOW I AM TO FOR HIS IDEALS. I'm dating a new guy now who is actually nice to me so 😎
10	I've been in a similar position with an INFJ girfriend. As an ISTP, I was unable to provide proper emotional support (I can fix shit, but not people) which led to "I feel like you don't care" argument and me being doorslammed.\n\nI legit did not know how to make my partner feel better and all my attempts at best felt like they were done into the void. At worst it made everything even worse. So we ended up being two severely depressed people, each for their own reason.\n\nSo, my advice in this case would be to figure out what would make you feel better, let him know and when (if?) he does it - show him that it helped and his attempt was not in vain.\n\nIf he does care - he will try to help you and seeing positive results will encourage him to continue. If he doesn't... well, it's time to re-evaluate your relationship. Three months is not that long, to be honest and I myself value only those relationships that have stood the test of time. Don't know how true is that for other ISTP's.\n\nJust make sure that your ISTP does not have any other serious commitments or problems at the time, like finishing his university degree (I don't know the proper term in English, hope you understood that) or a depression of their own. Bringing this problem to him at a time like this will make him feel being torn apart, as he will have to prioritise and there is a possibility that it won't be in your favour.\n\nHope everything turns out OK for you.\n\nEdit : read some of your other posts. Shit is bad. Get help.\n
6	Sounds like you could really benefit from seeing a psychologist or therapist. It might help you get a better handle on the issues you described and your ISTP will really appreciate your effort in trying to get back to a more stable mindset. It will also help him help you as he will know more clearly what your triggers are and how to help you when you’re in an episode. \n\nThat being said, this won’t be an easy match so good luck if you want to continue with it. 
8	Three months?  Shit, that’s barely a beginning. I wouldn’t say the prognosis is good. 
7	I don't think istp and enfp are a good match
3	As an ISTP, I avoided people who loved me intensely but had serious emotional issues. It doesn't mean I didn't love them back, but emotional housekeeping was just really beyond my want and skills. My INFP ex for a year had serious anxiety disorder. I still think he's the most wonderful man I ever dated, but it reached a point that I felt I was there only to nurse him and deal with his problems. I lacked emotional awareness, and was helpless when he had panic attacks. I started to see our future in a very dark and unhealthy place, and when I lost my sexual attraction, what took over was pity for myself. I had to save myself from the secondhand pain I was absorbing and increasingly manifesting in my day-to-day thinking/interaction. \n\nI really can't help you with his, but I thought it's best to give yourself some space. I understand that the connection was probably intense and the love was magical, but it's really hard to sustain when one person will drag the relationship instead of putting some right perspectives into where it should be going. 
3	I’ve had my share of suicidal/ depressed significant others and they all ended in disaster. It’s a spiraling staircase and I’m guessing your ISTP can see the impending doom.\n\nMy advice for you is to take the time to work on yourself and what you need and what you can do for yourself to make yourself healthy. Find happiness in yourself not in other people.
4	You’ve been dating three months and you love him so so much?\n\nBuckle up buckaroo, life’s gonna be a long ride for you.
0	Estp vs istp athlete, INTP side question	So I'm an INTP. I primarily see an ESTP and ISTP athlete in terms where an ISTP would be better at interacting with the overall structure of the game to make leverage plays. In other words, when the chips are down in the heat of the moment, ESTP wins. But it is more likely that they tend to be in the wrong place to capitalize on their Se, while ISTP will be in the right place but won't be able to capitalize on it quite as well as the ESTP. I primarily see most sports as Se territory, but struggle to conceptualize when Ne is most useful in a competition. INTPs and ENTPs play video games ALOT, and as an INTP I have played utterly endless games of COD and league. I was very good but I also put in lots of time so there is a bit of a chicken and egg. That being said I know many players who played day in and day out and they never really got that good.\n\nWhy would Ne be benificial in call of duty? Is it that an ISTP would be a better shooter but wouldn't be as good at accounting for the random elements of the game such as kill streak influences?\n\nWhat is Ne good for in a competition because I'm the same way as many ISTPs, I HEAVILY gravitate towards faced paced high risk high strategy team competitions. Card games too but that seems a little more Ne. Ni strikes me as more of a chess player rather than a card game player, as long term strategies in card games tend to be hard to pull off with randomness. You have to dip on your strategy to capitalize on a new one at the drop of a hat. Ti using the system of the game for leverage.\n\nGame of thrones risk is some Ti-Ne bread and butter, but still I struggle to see how Ne would benefit a person in a shooter style game.
1	I feel like these are somewhat logical conclusions from the function stack, but they don't necessarily align with actual istp/estps. Biggest difference I notice from playing sports/typing athletes on teams I like: estps are more team-oriented and/or leaders via 'inspiration,' istps are more 'specialists' and/or lead by doing. At least in terms of a level of high performance, I think Ti and Se have edge over other functions, but I don't think the order matters in as precise of a way that you're trying to define here. Especially when adrenaline is involved, being "in the zone" would even the scales between the order bc they'd both be in overdrive. Difference is mainly in the locker room 
1	And I've met NTPs who are really smart about sports but can't think of any good athletes with those types
1	I have oft wondered this when competing in all sort of mediums with my INTP friend. Video games or lets say COD specifically, I'd have to question, how did he even get there? How was he camping and tracking me down across the map at the same time? How did I sneak up on him from behind, have a clear advantage and still die first? Who is this person and what lab was he bred in? ect, ect.\nI have a hard time truly understanding Ne. but I know this, I often gain advantages by predicting the behavior of other people (at least within a 5 to 10 second window), and vs. Ne, that is infinitely easier said than done.
12	New Year’s Resolutions Anyone?	I never do New Years resolutions. I’ve had bad habits in the past that I’ve stopped when it was the right time for me (which never coincided with New Years lol). But for some reason, this year feels different. \n\nI started smoking weed more heavily this past year and I’m sick of it. I’ve been in the carribean for a little over a week without any weed and while I was only planning to take a break and cut back when I got home, I’ve decided my resolution is to quit for good. It sounds cliche, but I’m 24 and I need healthier coping mechanisms than drugs. Weed is the last to go! \n\nSo my fellow ISTPs, do any of you have plans for New Years resolutions?\n\n
28	Same resolution as last year.\n\n3840 x 2160.\n
12	My New Years resolutions have also always been forced. \n\nNever had one to make before, but my Christmas was suitably fucked up to warrant some forcible changes. \n\nFirst time I’ve experienced one of my brothers calling the cops on the other Christmas night due to too many drunken fighting words. \n\nNo more getting drunk all the damn time. Bad, bad coping mechanism. They may not follow, but I will no longer be a part of it. 
8	I usually don't make them, I believe you should set goals any time of the year. \n\nHowever, in 2019 I want to be a better team player and look out for others. I'm motivated and competent by myself but I need to share that, especially going into a heavily leadership and team based career. 
5	I usually have the same one every year - 'level up'. I don't really set specific goals in mind, but I try to make an effort to do better in whatever it is I work on (career, health, relationships with friends and family etc.)
5	New year's resolution: get over my nihilistic mindset
3	Just wanted to say good for you! Must be a good feeling.
2	I usually think the whole idea of a New Year resolution is dumb and make fun of them and the people who make them. \nThat being said I have some things I'd like to improve on, like using my free time more wisely and making better financial choices. I would love to overcome my own nihilism and get my shit together.
2	I don't make resolutions. If something needs to change, I just change it. What's the point of waiting until the 1st?
2	Not really a resolution, and something I've already started a couple weeks ago, learning a couple programming languages for front and back end web development.
1	I generally think they're silly and useless, but right now I have quite a few, possibly for the first time in my life. Some are very personal so i'd rather not share, but it also includes becoming more independent and getting over the wtf years i've gotten stuck into after graduating from university.\n\nMost of all, though, i'm eager on beating what i think might be depersonalization, which is actually why i'm here right now. Seeing myself in something, even if it is a mbti type (which i'm a bit skeptical about even if ISTP describes a lot of myself) can be a start to recognizing myself as myself indeed.
2	Pick up a new martial art, and pick up an old dance. Re-build good habits… bit by bit.  
2	Staying the fuck away from xNFPs.
1	I make resolutions every year. It helps me focus, keeps me accountable. I want to get back to long walks with my dog, read books, lose some weight, and lose some resentments that I have had. Looking outward, there are some friends and family members that I want to continue to help.
1	If you need to set a new year's resolution then you are doing it wrong. You can improve yourself starting any day of the year.  \nBest thing you can do if you are serious about fixing bad habits is to learn lots and lots, get some sort of income and work on your social circle. Study lots about psychology, physiology, nutrition, philosophy, science, technology, media, politics, religion - all the necessary fields of knowledge that will make you a better person. Don't waste your time playing video games, browsing your Facebook newsfeed, watching Youtube or smoking weed all day. You need to stay out of pleasure island or you will turn into a compulsive ass and people will exploit you.  \nThe four human needs, which have their basis in your survival are: WELLBEING, WEALTH, EDUCATION and RELATIONSHIPS...  \nWithout being mentally and physically well you will not have the motivation to earn money or learn anything.  \nWithout wealth you will not have access to the services and education necessary to improve your life.  \nWithout education you will not know how to improve your wellbeing and increase your wealth.  \nAnd poor wellbeing, wealth and education all have negative consequences on your relationships. People will see you as a burden and you will not be able to receive support from them because you likewise cannot support them. Alone we can do so little but together we can be strong. Evolution does not favour the lone wolf.  \nAnd most of all, you need to define and prioritize your goals. Start broad and work on yourself day by day, moment by moment. That is the stoic way. If you can get the four human needs downpat then you will start seeing success in no time.
1	I just built a rig over the holidays. I can play most current games @ 1080p 144hz @60 fps or higher.
1	Zero resolutions. Not worth making anyway. \n\nMan, I'm not even sure who to respond to since the anecdotes went the way of familial get-togethers going the way of drunk and/or  rowdy. Genuinely curious as to how many have had to intervene by whatever means in these instances. \n\nDeep, exhilarating breath and long exhale. Sorry about what went down with you and your sis. Best wishes for the New Year. 
12	What do ISTPs like in a relationship?	I’m an INTJ/ENTJ (fluctuates), and my gf is ISTP.\n\nAs an xNTJ, I’m curious to learn more about how she behaves and acts because sometimes she’s super cheerful and expressive and then all of a sudden it seems like she’s going to blow up a volcano\n\nWe’ve known each other for over half a year now and in the beginning she was always texting me. But now I’ll be lucky if she even texts me more than 5 words in her texts or if she even initiates first.\n\nSometimes she always overthinks about situations that will never happen and it makes her frustrated and she tends to over-exaggerate words/actions often.\n\nBasically, I’m almost clueless at reading her because she’s always changing or fluctuating.\n\nWhat do ISTPs like in a relationship? Like, what do they like from texts, or what do they like their SO to do, etc.? \n\nEDIT: Oh yeah she finds it weird to express her inner feelings/emotions but I have been trying to get her to be more comfortable doing so. Because sometimes she is straight up cold/mean to others or even me due to her frustrations.\n\nEDIT2: we broke up. She moved on so quickly like I was nothing. you ISTPs are too savage\n\nEDIT3: and we’re back together lol
14	We like a lot of space and being alone together. We don't like SOs planning things or future for us. 
9	We like our SO to not text so much. If we want to talk we know how to contact you. ISTP just prefer not to small talk often. If you are contacting her with plans that is probably better than "Hey how is your day?" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy best advice is to not take it to heart if she is a bad texter and DO NOT get insecure and end up texting more. That will surely push her away. And this goes for any MBTI type really. 
9	privacy! independence !
4	> Sometimes she always overthinks about situations that will never happen\n\nI do this often. 
2	Lots of personal space, and sex.
2	Sometimes she always overthinks about situations that will never happen and it makes her frustrated <- this is when we are in a loop. ISTP will think about every possibilities that might happen, no matter how small chances are, and prepare solutions for each of them. I absolutely hate this because if it gets really bad, it can keep me up all night. I'll repeat every scenario again and again in my head, checking if I miss anything. In my case, my boyfriend will hug me and say 'hey, it's gonna be OK. X or Y won't happen.' Sometimes I'll ask 'but what if X really happens?' He'll say 'then we will do.... and..... so don't worry too much, OK?' \n\nI don't like texting. It's not that I hate it but I guess I just don't like small talks. I text him only when there is something I want to tell or ask him. Like I'm taking our dog out for a walk now or I miss him (and it's simply 'I miss you' not 'oh I just saw this and it reminded me of you. I can't wait to see you next Saturday'). These conversations are often very short. I hate questions like 'how is your day/how are things going on at work/what's your plan for tomorrow?' If you want her to reply, I'd say keep it short and simple. \n\nIf there is anything you don't understand about her, just ask her. Be direct. We appreciate that. For some reason, people often misunderstand me as well. I'd rather they ask me why I did what I did than make their own assumptions. \n\nOh and give her space. A lot of space. She probably needs her 'alone time' more than anyone you know. \n\nI hope it helps. Can't think of anything else right now. Feel free to PM me if you want. 
2	You really wanna know? just let her put her head on your lap and just rub her back or head and just let her either talk or if she has a lot on her mind just don't talk, and no need for you to feel awkward. we are tired doing our jobs and when it comes to you we just want peace, that's what we really crave.\n\nyeah can't emphasize more on peace, other than that listen to us, give us feedback and don't get tired of having an argument, because in the end it matters for us to find the truth, even if it means we were wrong.\n\nP.S: let her be on top ;)
4	One does not simply date an ISTP (until the POI is like at least 30 and realizes they don't want to die alone)\n\nLeave before she leaves you. Yw. 😂
3	I like an independent woman that shares my values and morals but has different personality and habits/hobbies. \n\n\nI like a girl who doesn’t need me for her to be complete, but *wants* me. You know? Like she has her own life and I’m an addition to her life, not the completion to her life. \n\n\nAnd of course I want her to share the same values I hold. At the very least morally and religiously. Politics are less of a concern, but I’d prefer her to at least be similar with me. Like there’s no way on gods green earth I could date, or even be around really, someone on the far left. I’m a right wing conservative who only cares about facts, data, numbers, logic, etc. I don’t give a fuck about feelings or offense or PC bullshit. Someone on the far left would *not* like being around me just as much as I would not like being around them. And I’d also want her to be within my religious beliefs so we have the same moral ground zero. \n\n\nSo basically independent, similar shared values, but different enough personality/life that everything with each other becomes a new adventure.

34	“Why are you so quiet?”	How do you typically respond to this question? \n\nNew employees at my job constantly ask me this question, and I can’t help but give an awkward shrug and laugh every single time. \n\n
20	“Why are you not?” \n\n\nIf it’s an employee “because I’m working” is also great.

13	"I talk when there is something to say."

4	“Why? Are you nervous?”
6	"What noise should I be making?"
4	"huh what?"
5	Don't you hate that?\nUncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?\nThat's when you know you found somebody really special. When you can just shut up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.\n
4	Because i have nothing to say
2	depends, usually thinking about something, and respond in word-salad
2	Best response would be to stay quiet instead of answering.

1	“What can I say? I’m a man of few words.” Or “I prefer to walk light and carry a big stick.”
16	What do you do when your joke backfires and offends people?	You tried something risky. It did not go well. The Fi users are offended and it shows on their face. The Fe users in the group catch on and start to think you are a shitty person as well. What do you do?\n\nKeep saying “it was a joke”?\n\nRecoil and keep silent until everyone goes home?\n\nNot hang out with Feelers in the first place?\n\nWhat else?
56	I’ll usually just laugh at myself or get quiet and wonder if I’m autistic. 
17	You have to feel out your audience before telling a joke. Nothing you can do now but learn from the situation.  
28	People taking unreasonable offense at a joke has become normal. It has nothing to do with feelers per se. \n\nYou can’t fix it. Get new friends, or keep right on joking and drive the habitually offended from you.\n\nYou don’t need them.
11	Sometimes I have to explain it was a joke. Sometimes there is awkward silence. Yesterday I joked to an ENTJ in the mbti subreddit and he/she took it too serious :D So serious that I didn't feel the need to explain anything and didn't reply. 
8	Depends on the context, but in general apologizing is the best choice 
9	Most of my jokes are offensive
5	Apologize, make excuse, try to move on. \n\nMy go-to is “oh, I’ve been trying to clean up my language since I left the army but it’s surprisingly difficult.” And usually that draws enough sympathy to smooth things over. 
5	I don't give a shit
4	Change your delivery. Its not what you say its how you say it.\n\nNot to be confused with accidentally saying something (thats not a joke) that offends ppl, in that case youre jst an asshole :>
6	That highly depends on the nature of the joke I would imagine.
3	You can't turn around, the only way is to double down and finish it. 
3	Acknowledge. Be honest and say that you thought it'd go over better and apologize. Learn from it. Good friends will help you out and grow from mistakes. Maybe explain that jokes or social nuance aren't your Forte... Biggest thing: own up
3	I'll avoid those types of jokes next time around that person
3	Depends on the joke.\n\nSaying sorry is the best, typically.
3	Comedy is about knowing your audience. If you think someone's going to be offended, and you don't want to offend someone, then don't tell that joke to the wrong people. If you don't care, then swing away, Merrill.\n\nYou can't fix indoctrinated, feigned offense, or feigned anger over something that was meant as a joke. Their feelings are on them, not you.\n\nAdapt in the way you believe is the logical way to adapt, whatever that might mean for your situation. \n\nPersonally, I work in an environment with lots of different personalities, political backgrounds and social upbringings. Work is where 98% of my daily interactions occur, not including my wife. I don't like burning work bridges because those connections are important for getting work related tasks done. So I try to gauge my audience before I say something. I'm not perfect, but it's sufficient. \n\nMost people can shrug off -what they may perceive as- a slightly idiotic comment the next day. I just try not to make my "idiocy" a daily habit. I think it saves me from potential headaches later on. HR and all that.
2	I apologise profusely and explain that I am terrible at jokes. And than stew in shame for a couple of hours. 
2	"They can't all be winners." 
2	When people get offended I usually just tell them to relax and that I'm never really serious. But my ESFP friend gets mad and wants to fight me so I just keep my distance or it wont end well for him.
1	If you think your joke is funny, it’s funny 🤷🏾‍♂️
1	Follow up with a more offensive joke. They’ll either become desensitised to my sense of humour or leave me alone. Either way, problem solved.
1	shrug it off and claim ignorance :)))))
1	Nothing. Tell another one and if they're offended by that you're with the wrong group of people.
1	Not worry about it usually. 
1	I knock the person beside me with my elbow and laugh harder
1	Don’t care. Not my fault they’re so sensitive 
1	Nothing. If they can't take my amazing hilariousness then the joke's on them.
1	I've met feelers that weren't easily offended, or ever offended at all. 
1	HELP ME PLANNING MY CAREER	Hello guys, i need some help to planning my life (career), i'm not very experienced and i'm a bit confused, since i don't have anyone next to me to give an useful support, to them its all  jokes or simply don't care (family), they are my family, i love them, but i don't trust them when it comes to that.\n\nI'm from Brazil, a violent, competitive and expensive country to live ( no soccer, no girls wearing bikinis on the beach, no parties all the time); i know that most of you are from USA, no comparisons, completely different realities, u guys have your own problems within your country, the same applies to me, but i still think the grass is greener there (no, i don't want a greencard haha, just some tips, your experience...if you dont bother helping me out).\n\nEnough blablabla, let's cut to the chase:\n\nI'm finishing a Technological degree in External Trade (1 semester left) and dropped out from a Bachelor's degree in Accountability after 1 semester( i don't see myself doing that), when i said i dropped out i just mean i locked my registration. The Technological degree is paid while the Bachelor's degree don't, if you are approved in a federal University here you don't need to pay for your studies. I don't know what will be my next step after i finish the Technological degree and since i'm unemployed and next to finish this degree, i feel the urge to plan my next step, but i don't know my options.\n\nPls, help me out guys!!! If u need extra info just ask, thank you in advance, sorry for the bad english.
3	I'm not sure we have "technology degrees" here in the US. Though we might have equivalents. What sort of stuff did you learn for your technology degree?
10	Do you think you could do Porn? What would be the biggest factor, the person involved or the money earned?	Like filmed in front of people, lights camera action, etc. Probably posted online at some point, etc.\n\nIf the person you'd be preforming with was your type physically but wanted them enough, would the situation deter you?\n\nIf it was for a certain amount of money, would you do gay/lesbian scenes?\n\nWould it be something ever discussed/bragged about, and would you be forthright if someone ever saw the video and mentioned it to yourself?
24	Just no.
17	I don’t think I ever could for any amount of money but that may be because of my social anxiety 
27	I would never do porn. My values are strictly against being paid for or paying for sex. I don’t even do hookups. Sex for me is worthless unless it comes with intimacy and emotional connection. Otherwise I feel nothing and get nothing out of it. I’m sure I’d be good at porn because when I’m sleeping with someone I don’t care about I feel nothing and can go for hours. But at the same time, I have absolutely zero interest in being paid to fuck somebody I’m not into. Not to mention I have zero interest in fucking someone with an entire crew watching. \n\n\nAlso, I imagine it’s pretty hard to have a healthy stable relationship with someone I *do* love while my job is to fuck random women all day. 
6	Already did, so yes. Did the lighting and cameras myself though. they are POV, so I'm only in them from the waist down anyway. I signed all the forms, she published them, but I actually never went back to see how well they did. Probably not that much, though. She's popular in the webcam arena, but not mainstream.
6	Hell to the no no. 
11	I would've said yes a short while ago. When you learn how porn is molding our image of sex (and society's image of females In general) you very quickly want nothing to do with it. Porn is a huge problem and will become an even bigger one. With the internet being so young the effects of pornhub being a keystroke away haven't even been considered by most. Think about it, you're 12 years old and barley have a concept of what girls are and boom porn enters your life. You learn about them from porn, create your image from porn. Same with sex, you learn about sex from porn totally messing with reality. Most people have sex and porn combind in their minds. Want to know if this is you? Do you find your self thinking of sex in a fantasy type way with a body that any female/individual could fill? If you said yes well, you have porn on the brain. \n\n Tldr No, porn is poison anything that plays off human desire molds it. The only reason you want to nut on a girl's face is porn.
4	I’ve done it. I don’t talk about it a lot but it’s a fun story to tell. Gets people’s attention in a certain way, if you know what I mean. 
5	Absolutely. Not that anybody would ever want to watch it. But a standard day rate for a porn star actor, with a standard issue pornstar? Sure, why not, there are no downsides to that. \n\nGay for pay? I don't know if I'd be able to do that, unless it was a ridiculous amount of money and my sweet behind is not worth that.
4	If there was a way to retain anonymity, I would definitely do it. I could care less for the money so the person would be more important. 
2	I could do porn, in theory, but my personal morals would keep me from doing it to the fullest, so-to-speak, so I don't. That, and I'd always be worried about my folks finding it somehow.
2	I totally would. Sex and feelings are separate entities to me. Getting paid to? Hell yeah. I'm not shy! I mean I'm not that great to look at but I'm not unfortunate. \n\nGay stuff? Hmmm just gotta keep tacking on them zeroes I guess.
1	You’ll die for that. 
1	Ya I could do it. Tbh it's all relevent, If it's bad money and an ugly chick, then I'd have to be pretty broke before I did it. \nThe biggest factor for me would be the girl more than likely, mainly because I'd want to be able to stay 'up' for the whole shoot, just because of all the public attention like cameras and director etc. \n\nDon't think I would be suited to it as a career, but I have nothing against the oldest job in the world \n
1	Honestly, before I had sex for the first time I was a huge prude but now that I've done it, it's not a big deal at all.  I might consider it but my identity would need to remain hidden and the monetary compensation would need to be nice.  I'm not talking bullshit numbers like a million dollars but it would need to be decent.  The real question is: why would any company pay me when there are much better looking people out there willing to do it for cheaper and don't mind having their identity revealed.\nAs for how the other person looked, or their sex, it wouldn't make much of a difference to me.
1	I've got quite a small penis, so I don't think I could do it.
1	Paid to have sex. Hell yea how could you say no unless its gay sex?\n\n
1	If only my family wasn't religious and there wasn't a chance of picking up diseases and making babies.
1	No. I care about myself and I don't like my future self be boxed by these things. Also, I don't like that I'm doing sex for money. Heck, I don't even like being watched. I find it a corrupt thing. 
1	I wouldn't do porn because I hate being put on the spot and it's gross... But to play along with your question...money would be the first factor. 
1	I don’t think so. Not my style. If I did, I would go all in and try to be the best at it. It’s not really something you half-ass. Ha.
8	Career for istp thats bad at math	I am an istp male and i have no clue what career i want to choose. I am extremely aware and observant, i am super organized, and efficient. I am horrible at math, i like dirt bikes, cars, motorcycles, video games, etc. \nANY SUGGESTIONS OTHER THAN ENGINERRING? \n\nAlso: would like to make a lot of money
24	Don't get too caught up in all of this personality bullshit. It's just a way of categorizing people based on some similarities. Find something that you would enjoy doing and do it well.
14	ISTP female...and I have been in accounting for 20 years and I HATED math in school, just hated it but once the numbers switched to dollars it became easier for me to grasp.  
11	Have you thought about welding and fabrication? If you get a job at a shop you can work your way up. It's a hobby for me, but I often wished I pursued that instead. Building engines, doing motor swaps, custom chassis, axle swaps, etc.\n\nEdit: Most automotive fabricators charge $90+ an hour.
4	I do commercial HVAC. Try looking into trade unions and see what it would take. It does take a little math, but nothing hard and it's the same shit over and over. Plus, there isn't much I can't fix. I'm able to have a decent life in Los Angeles and it's one of the most expensive places to live.

3	Architecture perhaps? You barely need to use any math at all, in order to get by in architecture school. 
2	Aircraft maintenance
2	My istp Dad is very good at and enjoys being a financial advisor.  He really knows what he’s talking about. Also he’s mentioned how he always hated math in school. \n- his isfj son
1	I’m bad at math and I’m an Electrical Engineer. Got straight C’s in math (with a few D’s) from algebra 1 through calc 4. I rarely/never use math in my job, so I wouldn’t say that’s a requirement. 
1	Play instruments and then get into teaching them
1	I'm an ICU nurse and I honestly wish we had more "ISTP" types in this field. I thrive in this environment. Oh, and I am terrible at math but I am fine with med/IV rate calculations because you can use formulas and it's very concrete. 
1	Airline Mechanic.   \nNot much schooling required, airplane engines are actually clean (comparatively) and you can get the option of traveling all over.  \n\n\nAnd someone already said it. Oh well. 
13	ISTP & INFP relationship	Does anyone have experience with this combination? Can you provide insight on the pros and cons? how long it lasted?\n\ni have recently entered a relationship with an INFP, but it seems we are complete opposites. I’d still like to see how it plays out because i’m only a senior in high school, and Im interested in hearing yalls’ takes on the combination.\n\n
13	I'm an INFP female who has been with my ISTP boyfriend for 3 years. It is the easiest relationship I have ever had. That could be due to multiple factors, some of which are irrelvant to MBTI. I moved in after a couple months. Living together, laughing, doing nothing, talking and fucking is all super fun.\n\nWe are very different from one another. I like to think that he keeps me grounded, while I keep him looking up at the stars. Each of us brings something that I find quintessential to a good relationship. What he offers, I simply could not and vice versa. Because of this, I am mystified by his strengths and he, mine. Sometimes I feel like he is like a rare, beautiful bird.\n\nWe have basically identical core values. The primary difference in those values being how we approach commitment maybe, but we are both very loyal and authentic people.\n\nCommunication during conflicts can be a rough area if the ISTP is unable to digest the emotions of the INFP with patience. The INFP has to be careful not to overwhelm the ISTP with strong emotions and remember to suspend judgement before assuming things in the absence of clear responses from the ISTP. Ultimately, we both strive for harmony and an easiness to our relationship that cuts those conflicts pretty short. They are rare and small these days, becoming even less frequent the longer we've known each other. Conflicts usually arise from misunderstandings.\n\nAs I have gotten older I have developed my T and as a lot of ISTPs age, I believe their F functions become a little more tangible, so thats something to think about. If both people are patient and see each other on the same team, I think this can be a really beautiful match. \n\n \n
12	I'm an infp dating an istp and this our 3rd year together. I feel this relationship takes a lot of patience and understanding on both sides. Even though I'm way different from my partner in a lot of ways, i've never felt uneasy around them. It's the most fun relationship I've had. We've had our fair share of arguments and frustrations but he really keeps me grounded and I know I can rely on/trust him even if he is still a bit of a mystery to me sometimes. \n\nSome things we mega bond over is our introverted nature and shared interests. We have the most fun when we are doing stuff together. I really look up to his ability to calmly deal with situations/ not get walked all over and I've learned a lot from him in that area. (As in if someone is being irrational or a jerk then you dont have to put up with their crap). I've always looked up to his no bull-sh*t approach to life and his straightforward honesty. ( if he's mad he'll tell me, if he doesn't want to do something he'll tell me) \nEdit: Also sense of humor! We both have a simillar sense of humor and I'm not sure if this comes with the type but we are both young at heart so we just goof off all the time. \n\nSorry if I wasn't super helpful, I know I didn't answer the question exactly. That's just my experience so far. Hope everything works out and you guys have a nice relationship! 
5	Just had this discussion about both types too:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/istp/comments/a93dmh/_/echszoz/?context=1
5	My parents
3	If there is one thing infps can work on that will foster healthier relationships it's learning to understand and accept the validity of people's views or choices that go against the grain of their personal beliefs.  In my experience this is the biggest hurdle for infps when in relationships with thinker types.  With dom Fi infps can be prone to black and white authoritative demands when it comes to subjective beliefs they very much mistakenly assume are universal morals that all should abide by.  That's the loop and grip in a nutshell for infps.  Everything else is great and workable except for this one aspect that can turn the relationship into one giant clusterfuck, and if you consider how much istps value their freedom, they'll be running for the hills faster than you can say 'Leroy Jenkins' if infps can't find a constructive way to handle their loop/grip.  \n\nIn other words, at their worst, infps have the potential to become the most SJ of the SJs for the negative stereotypes they're infamous for, and of all the environments istps cannot stand, it is an SJ utopia.
3	It is a truly rewarding relationship.  One of the opposite combinations that really work well, brings out the best in each other.  Both are observant, private, and expect no special treatment from others.  It is like the master of the underworld of emotions/dreams with the master of the physical world.  An ISTP would write a book on practical ways to improve environment, they on emotional principles that change the world (Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter) - both healing in their own way, both believe in each other.  INFPs are more in their head and are more refined, ISTPs more of action and adventure - put the two together, stars collide.  Sexual chemistry is perfection, as both are nurturing and sensual, difficult to date.    \n\n\nIt will be smoother if you slow down and contemplate more (turning over a beautiful moment). The values between the two are true - loyalty, authenticity.  Both want moneyback guarantee in love (no traitors or attention seekers), a place in the stars, genuine thoughtful words.  If you believe in their heart, there is no room for misunderstanding.  They will appear foreign, arguments are passionate. Unconditional acceptance, trust, gratitude will bridge the differences.  Both are patient, smart, dignified, attractive. The communication between the two, who could beat it, and I became exceptionally independent, which I previously struggled in.    \n\n\nINFP humor, creativity, and intelligence will stand out right away.  The relationship blossoms and has many complex layers.  Same as ISTPs, INFPs go the distance in the moment, and you will find no disparity.  In a way, both protect: INFPs can sense upcoming danger and motive well, and ISTPs have physical resources, articulation, and resilience more than most.  Both protect each other from lack of belief.   Effort is not for nothing. This is a magical bond that deepens over time.  
3	4 of my exes are INFPs. Best in the beginning, worst as it led to the dumpster fire ending.\n\n&#x200B;
23	Can anyone give me a summary as to why istps and infjs gravitate torwards eachother romantically so much	We're kinda opposites, but I see alot of infj and istp relationships. My girl is also an infj, and I want some insight as to why these two types get together so often.
14	We all prefer our tertiary and dominant functions when it comes to mental masturbation. \n\nISTP and INFJ have those functions swapped. \n\nIt’s like a combination of an ouroboros and a 69. \n\nAlso, I’m drunk. 
13	Imo many people see value in their tertiary function most even though it may not be strongest. For INFJ/ISTP the tert for each is the dom for the other. So INFJ will be impressed and be able to relate to Ti while ISTP will resonate with the strong Ni of their partner. 
10	My GF is INFJ/INTJ. I've only recently realized that shes is definitely more INTJ. So yeah maybe this isn't what you're looking for. My theory is the self confidence that many INFJs seem to have. They are more in tune with their emotional side than we are and are capable of being more honest and open with that. combine that with a tendency to be more diplomatic (while still honest) and you have a person that an ISTP can really respect. ISTP and INFJ may not always have similar opinions but I think there is a sort of respect there for the depth, independence, and individuality of the other person. That's just my amateur theory though so im really not sure. Very curious to return to this thread later and see what people say.
19	I'm and INFJ female who has been with an ISTP male for 10 years. Married for 5. He's strong where I'm weak. He's the most dependable significant other I've ever had. He's no nonsense, no drama, no manipulation, and very analytical. He sees things in black and white where I see many grey areas. Therefore, if I'm caught up on something he easily clarifies things for me. Feelings don't get factored into his decision making as much as they do for me. If I'm stuck in my head, he pulls me out and gets me out of the house, though I'm a little bit more social than he is when we get out there. We "introverted together" and coexist happily. We have a lot of the same preferences, like in music for example. We tend to like and dislike the same people. He's a good guy for sure.
4	You use the same cognitive functions. But while you are strong in the Ti and Se and weak in the Ni and Fe, the INFJ is the opposite in those functions. So you are able to understand each other since you "speak the same language" but are also able to admire their strengths since it's your weakness. Socionics would consider ENFJ as your ideal romantic partner for this reason.
10	I dunno... I don't along with INFJs because they tend to be controlling and sensitive. Gravitate toward INFPs maybe 
8	I haven’t experienced the gravitation for INFJs as I seem to attract extroverts more than introverts so maybe an ENFJ. As for the reason I suppose it’s because of our functional stacks.\n\nISTPs are Ti Se Ni Fe NFJs are Ni Fe Ti Se so we tend to gravitate towards each other’s Primary and secondary functions because we see so aptly the other is in displaying those functions. 
3	People gravitate toward ISTPs romantically?\n\nGood news!
2	No idea, I couldn't never be involved with a J, they would drive me nuts.
2	My wife is an INFP/J (borders between them). I can bring her out of her deep feelings with a hug and some words that remind her that she's strong, and she brings me out of my heartlessness. Not like I'm evil or anything, just that I tend toward the analytical mostly and forget that sometimes we're "feeling" creatures too. We balance each other.
8	Do you guys like handmade stuff/cards?	Im thinking about painting something for my boyfriend for a christmas card. Are you guys into that or is it just going to be seen as a useless doo-dad?
20	I would like it.
17	Do it. I generally find cards to be worthless but id someone special made it for me I would keep it
12	can’t speak for your boyfriend, but i tend to enjoy things that show you actually care rather than gifts that just prove you have money to spend. my favorite gifts are things that i casually mentioned in a conversation once, but you actually took to heart. not sure if that’ll help but best of luck to you!
7	I would appreciate it.
9	I can't speak for your boyfriend but I personally think those kind of stuff is useless. Any cards tbh. I only give them coz I kinda have to...
4	If it were me and someone handcrafted a card, I would really appreciate the effort and time it took to make it. Its a sweet gesture and love the thought of someone doing it for *me*. \n\nHowever if its just a card, I wouldn't have any real use for it. I would probably just tuck it away in a shoebox in my closet or something and never see it for a couple years. If its a painting or something that I think could be decorative, I'll probably hang it up or put it on display for a couple months and then take it down and put it in, yet again, a shoe box in my closet
4	I am istp and i like useable things in my life. Not really a fan of cards, but i appreciate the thoughtfulness of little simple frank heartfelt notes.
3	I would love it. my husband is an isfp - he likes to paint and is very good at it. he always draw something for me every Christmas/anniversary/birthday. they're just cards, not anything big or fancy, but I actually look forward to these more than gifts he buys for me.
2	If my gf took the time to paint something for me, I would value it. Definitely more than something store bought.
1	I appreciate effort
1	I really enjoy receiving and giving cards. Even when you can’t see that person anymore, you can still read his or her card and enjoy his or her memory. This is why I like gifts in general. 
1	Receiving handmade stuff is awesome! Takes a lot of passion to create things and give it to someone else.
1	I would love to receive something handmade. Knowing someone took the time and skill into making something for me would be so meaningful.
1	I know it's late but I love gifts that show ingenuity and workmanship. Shows you really care.

4	Uh do you guys do flirty texts, yes or no?	Yeah okay- I know that you guys don't really prefer texting. Don't worry, that's not what I'm asking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I (INTP) am dating an ISTP who is away for a couple of months on his own personal adventure. Cool, fine. I can do the non-texting for days as long as I get solidly distracted so I don't feel like everything is bad. We try to schedule calls once a week or so and that's really nice. Normally, I ask him up front everything and have great, direct communication. Like for example, I asked him to compliment me more because he never did and he's made a grand effort which is awesome and I love it. Go us. But it's a little harder now.\n\nMy issue is, every once in a while I like to drop a little message in with my texts that's either super flirty or heavy sexual undertones. I don't want to actually sext because it's not my thing but I do just want to keep a bit of a spark while he's away. But he'll later address every text I've sent except that one. It's a little off-putting. Like I could continue it without reciprocation but not responding to it at all makes me feel like I've overstepped some texting boundary (ya know similarly to trying to have a conversation via text with you guys, which is the Worst™). Or maybe he just really extra sucks at texting but I'm relegated to this medium 90% of the time right now. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Anyway it's hard to ask someone when you don't know when the next time you're going to talk to them is and I actually hate to have feelings discussions over text, and I usually just forget about it every time we actually talk.\n\nSo ISTP general opinion toward flirty texting would be appreciated. I don't expect anyone to be able to read the situation well given the little information provided.
27	I'm completely oblivious to when someone's flirting with me at all, to be honest. Even really obvious shit I only realize later, if at all.\n\nLike. One time I was getting a flu shot or something and the nurse was squishing my arm to look for a good muscle, and she said something like "All of your muscles are good, really." And my only thought was "oh good I am glad I'm making your job of sticking a needle into my arm easier"\n\nThree days later: "...Wait a second"
9	I have been very straightforward to express my desire to engage in sex whenever I felt like. Hinting and flirting was never my thing, and I was completely oblivious when people tried to flirt with me. I realize after 5-6-7 years that some person at school or gym or wherever was actually flirting, when I thought they just wanted to be friends with me lol...\n"You want it? Say it." -->  this is my style.
4	Im super down to do flirty texting with an SO, I would usually throw one or two when the mood felt appropriate. I gave compliments to the last girl I dated quite often cause her style was on point, but I always made my best to show I really meant all of them. Good luck to you guys!\n\nEdit: I might be a minority from what I see so far though.
4	Im an INFP dating an ISTP for three years. I dont think flirty texts really works, but what does  is a grand gesture, because it can't be missed. I think my ISTP appreciates the boldness, as well. I like to send him NSFW pics out of the blue. He usually doesn't even really know how to respond to that, which I think is just fucking adorable. I know you say that isnt your thing, but subtle probably isnt his thing.
2	I have to tone it down actually, I banter with everyone. Always nervous other dudes will think I'm gay
2	I'm dating an INTP. Oh shit, now I'm wondering whether he has done any sort of sexting that I didn't acknowledge. We're long-distance too. To be honest, I'd appreciate it (and even welcome it with a fiery attitude) when someone is direct about what he wants. For example, I respond well to statements like "Thinking about (insert a prior sexy time) still makes me horny, and I miss you." This will instantly send shivers to my sensitive butthole that is my heart. :P
2	If somebody is flirting with me it has to be extremely obvious otherwise it goes right over my head or I think they’re being weird. Like, cleavage pics obvious. As I’ve gotten older, my own brand of flirting has gotten more direct to the point that only certain types of girls seem into it. Lots of teasing and dirty comments but that’s just what I like and I hope to get it back.
1	Uhh.  Sigh.\n\nOkay, here goes... glad he’s trying to compliment you more but I’m sure he’s secretly frustrated by it.  (In short — he finds your lack of faith disturbing.  If he didn’t want to be with you; he wouldn’t be with you.  He doesn’t want to have to prove it all the time.)\n\nThe biggest key to dealing with is is turning off the N function.  (My ex couldn’t; which is how I wound up divorced.  I could not call her 3x a day from wherever work had me that week, and she couldn’t handle the perceived abandonment.)\n\nYou’re trying to read something (intuit) into his texts or lack thereof that’s just not there.  We’re blunt to the point of tactlessness.  The fact that he’s even playing along with the compliment bit tells me he really likes you — so stop fishing.  Accept.  Acceptance is all.\n\n“It is what it is.”  That’s us.  You’ll have to accept it, but if you do, things will be fine.\n\nNow that that’s out of the way; the reason he doesn’t respond to overly sexual or flirty texts is that it’s.. pointless at best, hugely uncomfortable at worst.\n\nYou don’t sext — which is fine.  But he’s also far away, which means he cannot act on those feelings you’re expressing.  Since he can’t act on them (and when you say something to an ISTP — you are /demanding action/ — whether you realize it or not.  We don’t have any other mode.  :) — he doesn’t.\n\nHe can’t kiss you or so much as sext you so the text is moot; and this is why you don’t get a reply.\n\nThe only possible responses are sexting; which we can do; or putting our feelings into words; which is an ISTP fate worse than death.\n\nJust accept.  It’s the only way we work :)
1	I am very direct in my 'flirting' with my istp and he always acknowledges it with an awkward laugh.  After a while I asked him if I was making him uncomfortable and he told me that he likes it when I do stuff like that, never once disliked it, but sometimes he can't find the words to say something back.  If you really wanna know I'm sure you can just ask like I did.\n\nAs for long distance I agree with the person who said nsfw pictures.  That's what I did, but I was always a tease about it, never gave up the goods, drove him mad doing that.  He said his favorite pic involved a steamy mirror and lots of blurry suggestive shapes.
1	Yes. I have become the master of textual flirtation.
9	Fellow ISTPs, I need some practical life advice to my situation.	I'm currently at my parents' house for Christmas holiday. I come here (my hometown) every December and on this trip, everything just dawned on me and I've been thinking hard about this one possibility: I will move back here and build my own house.\n\nHere are some facts and sentiments I have.\n\n1. I am based in another city where I already built a lot of networks (friends, and small clients for extra income). I have been living there for 3 years, and it helped me become more extroverted and seek connections (dating or new friendships) whenever I liked. However, it's quite expensive to live there. I spent more than half of my monthly salary on recurring costs (and mostly booze and weekend camping with friends). If I could save the sum of this monthly spend in a year, I could really build a house in my hometown. Or buy a piece of land.\n2. My hometown has really nothing to offer, at least similar things to what I do for money. It's a small agricultural town. But my soul is happier here like I do not miss the city at all. I often stay here for at least two months. The weather is nice and air isn't polluted. I sleep better and longer. I'm less distracted by people. I cycle and hike and visit beaches by myself. I get to meet my HS friends as well. This is pretty much the life I have here. No prospects of dating haha\n3. My parents are almost in their 70s, and they need someone to look after them and all our properties. We have a huge farm that my father still toils just by himself. I have basic farming skills, but I'm not motivated enough to monetize the land.\n4. I work as an IT data analyst. I only need an internet to work and I work here using an LTE wifi hotspot. So far that's the only monthly income I have.\n5. I have enough savings to start building the house. I have the design already. I have all expenses liquidated and I found good carpenters and builders as well.\n\nIn paper, I'm ready. However, every day I have this push and pull feeling whether I'll pursue this plan. I worry about sudden loss of money, and I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do, whether it's the right time to build a house or practical enough.\n\nI don't know if you have wiser opinions, or maybe you can share some circumstances in which you made a similar decision, and did not regret it. And what motivated you enough not to get distracted by negative feelings and possibilities. Some insights on drastic life changes will be appreciated too.\n\nOh, I just turned 30 this month, so maybe this shift into a new decade is factoring in.\n\nThank you for reading.
10	If you dig your parents then do it.  I moved around quite a bit to just to know I wasn’t missing out on a better situation elsewhere.  If you’ve satisfied that and home is drawing you, do it.  Worst comes to worse you can always move again.  \n\nLook at your calendar for the last year and write down the activities you would not have been able to do from your parents town.  If you can live without them or an annual trip can take care of it... \n\nBe honest with yourself. 
2	Embrace your inner ISTP and Just Fucking Do It.\n\nIf it’s a mistake, move on to other places and interests.  In the meantime, it sounds like a fun project.
1	My problem is that I worry too much about the right thing to do. Many times I just need to set those worries aside and just do it. I've found that there is never a right time to do anything, you just have to make a decision and do it. \n\nFrom what I understand, you've already made that choice; it looks like you have the best reasons. Your parents would have someone to look after them, you could build your own house, and you would be much happier. But you're just letting a bunch of small things get in the way. We all know money comes and goes, I've found that it's never the right time, and you worry about practicality. I'm sure you can figure practicality out pretty easily. 
1	I live in Seattle, and from a small town elsewhere too. To me, I see meaning of life and quality of life significantly higher for you going back home. You can fly anywhere saving all that money, and the sense of community (MY barista, MY diner, MY server, MY barber, is how I think of it. Such an awesome feeling when you can get sentimental with your people) is way higher in a small town. Just food for thought. 
1	How far is the city in hours? You can always live out in the country and to to the city regularly for social events. You can also invite friends out to visit you!\n\nPersonally I’d stay in the city for a bit and focus on career growth, but appreciate everyone has different priorities. Also, you should be more mindful of your spend habits if you do stay
1	Do it. Then move again when the time is right. Don’t agonize. 
1	I was just reading a comment of yours from 3 months ago on this sub 
1	Get yourself in a situation where you can commute back and forth easily. Make sure you’re not giving up your friends or your ability to go camping and shit whenever you want.\n\nAlso, in my opinion, you need to balance caring for your parents and family with caring for yourself. I lost my parents several years ago but during that time I was studying for my career and I refused to stop building my life to give all my energy to them. It was a very diffficult time but ultimately their lives were ending and mine was just beginning so the balance was weighted toward myself.\n\nIf you’re a family-oriented person and are secure in your career then you may be able to strike a more empathetic balance than what I could. But you have to keep in mind that you don’t want to get stuck anywhere, you don’t want to limit your relationships, and you don’t want to sacrifice what you’ve earned. Make sure whatever choice you make gives you the freedom to be home when you want and also go have fun when you want.\n\nAs a practical matter, remember then your parents will probably hand down all their belongings to you and at some point you’ll certainly be back in town to deal with that. That’s not exactly something to look forward to but it’s something to be aware of.
22	How is it people keep complaining about their lives, dont do anything about it but still are happy as ever and domt regret anything?	They're laid back, spend time doing nothing. But are amazing at social interaction, making others laugh, being themselves even though their own life is a mess. How can they be happy with themselves, when the self they have created is nothing but an empty flask? Do they fake it? 
9	If they're amazing at social interaction but they like to complain then they're probably a burnt out Fe dom. They care so much about other people that they forget about themselves. This is something Carl Jung talked about: propagation in the external world at the expense of self-preservation.
16	Welcome to ISTP club. Where we do everything good except having friends 
6	It’s easy to be happy when you’re too oblivious to realize your life is a shitshow. \n\n\nOur logic and reasoning makes it hard for us to not see what’s happening. We take in all the details we can and process them. So we know what’s going on in our lives. We know what’s good and what’s bad. And we can’t ignore it. 
3	What is achievement to you?
2	Because we don't value hardship, someone like this wouldn't be a very good consumator you know
2	I think they are genuinely happy, but very lazy. It's easier to complain than to fix things. 
1	People are lazy and don't what to give up/jeopordize/put on hold what little they do have- such as social standing. 
1	I would wager that most people aren't as happy as you think they are. 
1	They are probably simple. Like my old friends. Not intelligent enough to care/worry about other things in life than being with and/or talking about others.
0	Why is an empty flask bad or wrong?  Where is it written that one must "make something" of themselves?  The only rule is survival and an empty flask survives peacefully. 
5	ISTP thoughts on America pulling troops out of Syria	Most ISTPs tend to be non-interventionists. Russia and Syria already defeated ISIS, they don't hold any territory.\n\nUS should also pull all troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan. Anyone disagree?
9	I’m a non-interventionist. I think we should get out of Afghanistan too. The US has caused more harm and chaos in the Middle East than the dictators we’ve overthrown.\n\nWe’ve completely destabilized the region. While the dictators were definitely not good, the current state of the Middle East is significantly worse off.
7	We were working with the Kurds in Syria and the Kurds were working with us. We should have stayed in Syria to help the Kurds and keep Turkey away from them.\n\nAfghan we should have left long ago, the Afghans don't care about what we tried to give them and few helped us attempt to better their lives and instead just played along for the money. 
6	I was in the Air Force. I've got something near 800 hours flying circles over Iraq as a radio operator. \n\nHonestly, we shouldn't be the world's police force. What does it gain us really? I believe in maintaining our military strength, but a lot of the stuff we do oversees is unnecessary. We should focus on getting our own countries finances in order, and worry less about being a nanny state and imposing our beliefs upon everyone else. 
6	The Kurds are the people who are going to suffer because of this. Turkey hates all Kurds and wants to wipe them off the map. If anything, they’re the people who need assistance now.\n\nI think it’s a short-sighted decision and most experts seem to agree. I don’t like any war and think we need to be more efficient about everything, but just pulling the plug without planning in a situation as complex as this is not the way to go. There is more than one person involved here. It’s not like me saying fuck it and doing my own thing.
1	Actually, Iran has the biggest role in defeating ISIS. 
1	I'm not American but everytime they get involved in a war we seem  always follow them in.\n\nMy opinion is that the only time we should get involved with the affairs of foreign country is when we invade and subjugate them. Rebuild the empire.
1	Pulling troops out of middle east seems rather impulsive, inb4 they will send em back. They gotta see if those countries can stand on their own legs before pulling out.
1	I would agree if foreign relations weren’t so crucial to the economic survival of America. If we were 100% self sufficient and needed zero resources from other countries, I’d say wall the country off and tell the rest of the world to fuck off. \n\n\nBut since we still rely on foreign relations, I feel non-interventionism isn’t a realistic way to go. \n\n\nBut also, I highly doubt anyone in this thread is qualified to make any real opinions on this. Unless they’re presently immersed in foreign relations, there will always be things the public does not know. 
13	ISTP Boyfriend Advice Needed (for an ENFJ female)	I know. I know....\n\nWHAT A WEIRD MATCH.\n\nYeah, I think so too. But I reeeeeeallly like him so I'm committed to making this work.\n\nOkay, so my ISTP and I have only been dating for 2 months, so it's still really new. However, we've already run into major communication problems. As in, he will go hours or days without responding to my messages. For the most part, I'm okay with the lag. I know he's busy and he's not very attached to his phone. BUT. I cannot stand it when it's clear that I'm trying to ask him something or engage in a brief conversation and he just doesn't see the need to respond promptly, and it takes me sending him a reminder or slightly exasperated-sounding retort to get him to respond. WHAT IS GOING ON?\n\nI've seen him respond to his friends when they text him and it's almost instantaneous. But for me, it never seems to be a priority to him to make sure he responds to me. I don't get it. I know he likes me a lot, but he does this even though he KNOWS I hate it and it aggravates my anxiety. I've had a talk with him about how it makes me feel, and he said he'd try to get better about it, but he's still just leaving me on read (even when I know he's there to read it, like on FB messenger I can see he's otherwise active on messenger). I told him I'm not trying to be overbearing or force him to do anything that's uncomfortable for him, but I also have needs. One of which is relatively prompt communication.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would really really really be appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: According to responses so far, it's either a horrible relationship and he's a dick or it just takes time and we need to learn how to tend to each others' unique needs. Thaaaat clears it up 😶
43	I do this as well, but mostly because when my dude friends text me, it's because they need something and I can respond with an answer.  3-4 texts back and forth and we're done.\n\nWhen chicks/my GF texts me, its because they want to talk. Small talk, catch up, whatever, and I simply don't care about having a conversation just to have one. Irritates my girlfriend to no end, but having "pointless" conversations will sometimes make me angry and snappy.\n\nIf he's like me and you're in a similar situation, there's not much to do, tbh. You just gotta wait until he's in the mood to talk - happens to me every few days or maybe once a week.
25	I do this and have no idea why 
13	I can’t speak for all ISTPs but I don’t like talking on the phone or texting. I prefer face to face communication. When it comes to texting, even in dating, I just use it to set up dates.\n\nAs long as your ISTP is still seeing you physically and using the texts to set up face to face time I don’t see it as an issue.\n\nAs others have stated, when my friends text me it’s usually a direct question or some info they need so I get back ASAP. If it’s to have a lengthy conversation over text I usually cut it short. 
7	1. I'm married to an ENFJ, any combo can work.\n\n2. This is a common question if you look around this sub.  The majority answer is the ISTP will make time for people they want to be connected with.
6	I ignore people for two reasons:  \n1. I'm busy and I can't be bothered to stop what I'm doing.  \n2. I don't care about you.
5	[deleted]
3	I’m an ISTP bisexual female. No duo is impossible. I have this texting tendency, too, but I would try to change if my significant other asked me to.\n\nOther ISTPs give you their reason and if you believe that he truly cares about you, then good. However, your main questions was advice, not targeting his incentive to why he does this. Here’s my advice;\n\nSet the standards for your dating and if he continues to not reply when it obviously makes you upset, then your relationship will be unhealthy. You already gave him several chances, so I wouldn’t give this guy too many more. If you want to be happy, then you should be with someone who cares enough to fulfill your wants and needs.\n\nEDIT: thinking up of a good, well formatted response should add 5-15 minutes for a good paragraph consisting of 3-5 sentences. It should NOT take hours. 
3	I think it can be easy for people like us (ISTPs) to be selfish when it comes to communication. Many ISTP don't like meaningless talk/random conversation. The problem is that sometimes it isn't meaningless to the other person. Many ISTPs need to realize that. It took me a while to learn that with my current SO. Our relationship is much better for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's definitely not unreasonable to expect interaction and prompt-ish communication from any SO. Part of being in a relationship is realizing that the other person has needs. He is clearly having issues with this. Boundaries are important to ISTPs though. I am glad you seem to be aware of that. You might try asking him how he thinks it makes you feel to be "ignored". Challenge his sense of empathy and get him to vocalize your perspective. Might help it "stick" in his head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I've seen him respond to his friends when they text him and it's almost instantaneous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis part is what catches my attention. I've always felt actions speak louder than words. In my opinion that is an especially strong sentiment for ISTPs too.  We don't know all the details of your interactions so I don't want to draw extreme conclusions. That said it seems like he has a different amount of respect and interest in the relationship (that's not to say disinterest or no respect). Not everyone we love is a great fit for us. I personally think its ok to have standards and expectations even if it means walking away from something that is good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, I really hope you can help him to improve. We ISTPs need that kind of help sometimes. We can be very stubborn but serious relationship investment can sometimes pay off big-time. Just be mentally and emotionally prepared for disappointment. Sorry for this long comment with no real advice in it. I Just saw some of the other comments and wanted to let you know that its definitely ok to be bothered by his poor communication. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	Everyone is different. Hours without communication is okay, but *DAYS*? Idk about this relationship bruh.
3	I didn't read most of the thread, so I don't really know what's been said. I'll just give you my thoughts\n\nIf it takes thought, it might simply just be forgotten. If I don't do something like reply immediately, it will often just disappear into the nether's of my mind to never return. I have a friend I've been thinking about calling for 6+ months. I really want to, but when I think about it it's usually the middle of the night. When it would be a good time I just don't think about it, so it just hasn't happened. If the text is something he wants to put a thoughtful effort into responding to, or has something he needs to think about, he might just forget before he gets to the responding part. His friends likely need no thought, so he can just respond instantly and forget about it. That's actually a good thing for you, because it means he wants to give you real things. \n\nThe other could be it is just something that didn't seem important to him, or didn't need an immediate response, so it didn't get one. I have a very bad habit of not responding to people if it's something I feel didn't need a response. I've been in leadership positions, and frequently people would give me information, and I wouldn't respond to them. I got the information, and I'll act on it as I see appropriate, but in my head that's the end of the conversation so I don't need to give you a response (though people appreciate being acknowledged). This feels like it's the more likely scenario without more information. He feels it's just something that can be handled when he sees/talks to you, so doesn't respond. You likely have different sense of urgency about things. You want to know now, but now isn't important to him, it can be dealt with later. I tend to put off things like that. 
4	Istp enfj is the dream, not weird at all.\n\nIf hes taking forever to respond to you that means hes putting in/anticipating putting in thought into his reply, its a good thing, though i know it can be mildly infuriating to other types.
2	I avoid all messaging apps with read receipts. I'll respond to messages when I'm ready, but the expectation that I should respond quickly just makes me not want to respond promptly. ISTPs don't like rules. We're pretty free and laid back, but that comes to texting as well.\n\nContext is also important. For me it depends on wording, what's being conveyed or how something is asked. If there's some underlying pressure to respond or maybe something that requires thought, a reply will be delayed. Also, if there are too many texts, I'll turn on a mental filter.\n\nI will be responsive though if I'm interested, so take that as you will. \n\n
2	People here seem to have latched on to responses to friends bit and assumed the worst.\n\nBut most ISTP friends start as activity partners — It is 1000x easier for me to talk to a friend about a shared interest than a partner who needs a touchy feely checkin.\n\nHave faith and your affection will be reciprocated; try to change an ISTPs introverted, sensing ways and you’re doomed.
6	I am an ISTP female and it sounds like he is not that into you. sorry to break it to ya. 
3	Not sure if you're being sarcastic but an ISTP's perfect match is an ENFJ first, then ESFJ, INFJ and fourth, ISFJ. So it's not a weird match up at all, it's the perfect matchup. The ISTP seeks his/her inferior Fe-Ni in a relationship (subconsciously) and the ENFJ seeks Ti-Se. It will be difficult to deal with your differences a lot of the time, but you have the same cognitive functions, just in a different order. 
2	I've gotten better about this with practice, but my reasoning, especially in a new relationship, was that I always was deathly scared of saying the wrong thing, so I would painstakingly craft my responses until they were perfect, often asking other people for advice on wording, subject matter, if my intent was clear. Until the point of exasperation in some cases, like you. at which point I would feel the urge to respond more so than before and panic and send a response to avoid causing further exasperation for my partner despite not necessarily being happy with my response.\nWith friends, sometimes I'm worse since I see them as less of a priority and sometimes wouldn't actually respond until I saw them in person again, other times I can respond immediately due to not caring as much about what they think about me.\nPrompt responses are an option on ISTP models, however extended use of this option will over stress your unit, causing it to need extended periods of recharge.*\nAlso read response is an evil invention because it makes me feel like I have much less time to craft a response. \nI cannot speak for your ISTP, but I hope I have provided some insight into a possible reason for his behavior in this instance. It's entirely possible that you're too high on his priority list for normal function.\n\n\n\n\n*personal experiences may vary
1	I'm an istp and I generally respond to my enfj gf within 10 minutes 90% of the time. This guy's just being a dick tbh. He might be doing it for a psychological reason to get you to like him or he just doesn't like talking to you. 
1	To put it in the most ISTP way possible: you're not a priority for him. If you were at least on the same level as his friends, he'd make the time to message you. \n\nDo what you need to do with this information.\n
1	Ex was ENFP. Short story: Did not work and left me burnt out.\n\nEdit: Did not read title properly, oh well...
3	Recently re-took MBTI, discovered I was ISTP. Scary how well this describes me. How can I learn from this new knowledge and better myself?	Hi All,\n\nI took the MBTI several times in college (10 years ago now), and never felt it was that good of an indicator to who I am. However I realize now I was answering questions based on what I wanted (or thought) myself to be, and not what I truly was. Because of that I thought it was a waste of time and never looked into it any deeper. \n\nLast night I stumbled upon one online, and decided to take it and several more. I was completely true to myself, even when I didn't like the answer I was selecting. I came out a ISTP and when I read up on that personality, I was blown away at how accurate it was. \n\nI have always highly valued my alone time. I don't have social anxiety luckily, but being around people wears me out tremendously and I need alone time to recover. I am quick to act in situations that require action, but will take my time and deeply contemplate when can. I have always been told that I seem aloof and non-caring. My friends and family mean a great deal to me, but I am having an extremely hard time getting motivated to find a romantic partner. I have yet to find the person who is better than silence, and starting to doubt I will ever find that person. I am completely OK with this, as I enjoy being alone. I ride motorcycles and am certified to fly small planes. I have always been a tinkerer and Lego is still one of my favorite things in the world. \n\nSorry for the wall text. I basically wanted to introduce myself to fellow ISTP's and learn what to do next. Are there books that I can read to help me learn more about myself? I am about to round my thirties and have stated to look inward to better myself. I believe the first step is to fully understand yourself. \n
2	Hello! I am an infj and my SO is an istp. I think knowing about how we operate and communicate helps us be better in all aspects of life. I was the first relationship in 7 years for my partner. For so long he did not want to be with anyone and it took a long friendship before we entered into a relationship. I think that what makes us work is that we both need and crave alone time. It’s been tough to communicate when I am sharing feelings as they are abstract concepts for him being so concrete and literal. I’m trying to learn how to be more clear in my communication with him. I think it’s great that you have this new knowledge and it can definitely help when dealing with feeling types or any type just to know yourself.. especially as you don’t share feelings and tend to be put off when someone tries to pry. I think just being aware of that will be helpful as you will be more aware.
1	I think understanding the cognitive functions you're using would help you tremendously in interacting with other people, and seeing their own perspective. Knowing how other types are like is helpful too.\n\nPersonality junkie is great.\n\nIn my opinion if you understand how you operate and how others do then that's already fantastic. But it's tough, I still don't have a good grasp on it. 
1	Yeah, go with cognitive functions, it will throw light. \n\nAnd remember that Fe must be developped. Most of ISTPs have problems with that function.\n\nYou enjoy Se. That is the enjoyment place of ISTPs.   Even if you play video games it is Se.\n\nNi is your inner demon. It gives you an opportunity to build or figure out systems really good but if you use it wrong, it will turn your life to shit (Ti <-> Ni loop).\n
5	How early do yall wake up?	Curious to see if yall wake up at freakish times like 4:00 am like I do
9	10am lmao. I’m a dead brick when i sleep.
8	it's 4:30 am and i still haven't fallen asleep. insomnia can be a gift and a curse.
7	It varies. If I have nothing on the next day and I am pulled in by a project, interesting YouTube video or video game I may end up waking up around 10-12 midday the next day, however when I have something in the morning that is important or that I take great passion in, I will probably either not fall asleep at all, or wake up many hours before I actually need to.\n\nAlso i'm an insanely heavy sleeper, I lived beside a railway for a year and it never disturbed my sleep.
6	HA! ya right even on work days the earliest i wake up is 545 am and on days off it's as late as 1 pm sometimes
6	I have a very hard time getting up in the morning. 
4	Between 8-9 without an alarm. 
3	I gat up at 530 but don't leave bed till 6
3	When the sun rises in Summer.
3	For work, 5:45am. People on the road are intolerably stupid, so I go to work before anyone gets on the road.\n\nWeekends, around 7:30 if I wasn't up too late.
2	Either 5am or 2pm. There’s no in between.
2	I am much more of a morning person than a night person. I prefer to go to bed at 8:30 and get up at 4. I can't seem to get anything done past 6 pm, while I have incredible energy in the morning. 
2	I can go to sleep at 3 am and be up by 9 am, I'm gifted
1	5, sometimes 6. Usually in between. Although on the weekends I have 0 issue just going back to sleep until 8 or 9.
1	4:30AM-5:30AM when im in school. my first class doesnt start until 9AM, but i like having that time in the morning to do whatever. 6:30AM-7:30AM when im on break.
1	0430
1	Right at the buttcrack of dawn, whether I want to or not. \n\nUnless I went to bed at that time. 
1	Pretty much 6am on the dot every morning. Used to just me M-F, but now also on the weekends. My body doesn’t let me sleep in these days. So if I don’t want to be tired, I have to fall asleep at an appropriate time lol. 
1	About 10 AM. Doesn't help that all my lectures this semester have been starting after 12.
1	Depends, if I have to work at midnight, 7am or 3pm.
1	Between 2 and 4 am depending if I have to work that day, and how late the dogs let me sleep.
1	Workdays, around 7:30.\nNon-Workdays, around 10:00, give or take.
1	As late as possible. If I didn't have to work, I'd wake up no earlier than 11 am every day and would spend couple more hours just chilling in my lovely warm bed. \nIt is absolutely shocking to me that people can voluntarily wake up as early as 6 am. Even 7-8. I struggle to understand it. 
1	2am?  4am?  8pm the day after I wanted to.\n\nIt all depends on how much energy I expended in the last burst.
1	When I’m at work, reluctantly at 8am. When I’m off work like for the past month I get up at 2pm. I fucking hate mornings.
6	How to small talk?	So my wife often invites people to dinner, and I mostly just stay quiet and stare at my plate because I don't know where to put my eyes. So are there any like tutorials or something on how to small talk?
22	Dismiss yourself for the bathroom. Go to a movie. Come back. No one will have noticed you were gone.
14	ISTPs are best at responding. So instead of waiting for someone to engage you in, ask questions to the noisiest one as s/he talks about a lot of things. It's the easiest way to be present. I learned this from an ENFP.
11	[deleted]
7	Ask questions and share a little bit about yourself until you find a common interest. 
6	Start talking about politics, sport or religion. Let people talk about those topics and fight. They will eventually leave and you won't have to use small talk.
5	The yt channel “Charisma on Command” has been helpful and not as cringey as I thought it would be. The videos seem to be speaking to logic-forward people, not like they’re speaking to 12 year olds. 
3	Start by being an active listener.\n\nIt's better to be quiet but listening to people and going "hmm, uhu" whenever they look back at you then withdrawing entirely 
2	Look at whoever is speaking a high percent of the time, and look at the plate or more specifically just away from all participants of the a little bit to not stare. Open your body to the general direction of all participants if possible since turning away from someone is "uninviting". Small talk can be any shared interest, or a event that happened recently that is peculiar or in general out of the ordinary. At least these are by basic go-to humanoid mode skills. 
2	If you don't feel comfortable looking people in the eyes look at their nose or a little to the side of their head
1	Realize that small talk is so basic, and that if anything interesting comes up it's not small talk\n\nIf it's something around you (weather, clothes, furniture etc.), a popular topic (doesn't matter what), or you don't know that person personally it's small talk. \n\nOnly talking will get you better, don't say anything interesting/controversial and make big deals out of every day occurrences \n\nUsually people who are good at small talk won't be mean to you if your trying to get better at it, those weird facial expressions or vocal cues are there to help you, usually a reminder to keep it basic and most importantly happy and upbeat.\n\n
1	Just listen until you can latch onto something they said to turn into a conversation. Also as a mental exercise think of a thing and how it relates to some way to other things. That should help since that is how conversations tend to go.
1	Not a bad thing if you use it to your advantage. You don't have to talk a lot.... just a bit.\n\nI chime in about 10/20% in some group conversations but gotten better at asking targeted questions that aren't 'fluff'.
1	I want my spatial skills back :(	Hi,\n\nI have been depressed for nearly ten years, i am aware now because i am starting to get out of the well. In fact i used to score as infj. \n\nI have realized that during these years, from 19 to 29 i have lost tons of logical thinking and particularly spatial skills, i barely can visualize a cube.\n\nAs a teenager i could really imagine geometrical relms. \n\nWhat to do? Istps have great visual skills right? 
10	Sounds like you might be INFJ. What makes you think you are ISTP?\n\nAlso, for any of you ISTPs out there that get depressed, go travel. Go adventure. Get on the road with no plans for a week, or a month. Can’t afford it you say?  Can you afford to stay depressed?  Hard to seek a higher paying job if you’re depressed. Get some inspiration from travel or adventure then go back at it refreshed. May not work for everybody, but it does for me. 
6	I believe our spatial reasoning comes from practice.\n\nStart building shit.
2	Anyone can build up their spacial reasoning. I had a much better imagination as a kid too, not so much anymore. But that has nothing to do with my spacial reasoning. It takes practice. It's all about guessing and then measuring, to test your guess. Do that for objects around your house and keep a tape measure with you. Guess, "I'm thinking that table is approximately a foot and a half by 3 feet." And then measure to test. You don't have to be perfect. Just close. "I'm thinking that kitchen counter is approximately 10 or 11 feet away from my current position." Then measure. For measurements over 5 feet, if you're with a foot that's not too bad. For measurements under 5 feet, if you're within 6 inches, that's not too bad. For under 2 feet within 2 or 3 inches. Within an inch for a foot or below. That sort of thing. 
1	Imagination isn't connected to your MBTI type.
5	Need helo with ISTP friend	Disclaimer: He might be mistyped, but made him take 3 separate tests, same result.\n\nSo, one of my best buddies is most likely an ISTP, and, at the age of 34 and hasn't made any life progress in the past 10 years. Same job, still single etc.\n\nI and our ring of friends are all "grown up". Now I wouldn't care if he didn't care either, but I am starting to sense his jealousy towards us. I am trying to give him some financial and career advice and motivate him to make some changes, but every time I bring it up he gets mad and goes full defence mode. "Easy for you to say", "I can't do that" etc. And don't get me started on romance.. Women are on such a pedestal to him that I can't even mention it without him going into furious rage about my attitude towards women and dating.\n\nHow can I reach out to him? How can I (help) motivate him to make changes?\n\nHe's one of my best friends and it breaks my heart to see him want to succeed, but being completely unable to do anything with his life except watch Netflix and play videogames whenever he's not at his shit job which he hates.
9	It's always hard for me to speak "as an ISTP" because I don't know if this specifically applies to ISTPs, or just me, but my take is: you're simply not going to get him to do anything he doesn't want to do. If he wants a woman or success, he would focus his attention and obtain them. We get stuff done, but only stuff we want to do. (well, obviously unless there is a bigger reason than want, but you get what I mean)\n\nIf he's being a jerk, there's probably something beyond is ISTPness going on that I don't think ISTP specific advice would be able to help. Depression? Anxiety? Etc, aren't ISTP specific.
11	*Help
5	Well giving him advice is prob gonna make him defensive because you are essentially saying you know what's best for him and he prob feels stupid, thus will rebel and do the opposite of what you suggest. Maybe suggest some things he can look into that will help with his career, let him kinda find it and feel like he put together the missing pieces. \n\nAnd for relationship stuff, and this may be difficult since you and your friends are settled down, help put him in situations where there is opportunity to meet people. But don't formalize it and introduce him to your female friends trying to force a connection or he will feel awkward. \n
4	That's the kind of shit he has to think about himself, a ground up deeply thought out motivation\n\nTell him not to focus on women at all and only focus on himself, watch Jordon Peterson videos "clean your room" whatever. That helps me at least.\n\nTell him unless you start changing in your life, even if it's cleaning your room or trying harder at work you don't care. Your not going to listen to his negativity anymore \n\nHe will probably hate you for a bit, but if you really care you will give him hard love, aka the truth\n\nMisery loves company, he HAS to work his way out of it, you CAN NOT PULL HIM OUT YOURSELF because he'll walk right back it.\n\nPoint the way, if he wants it he'll walk there. 
3	You don’t need helo, you need Jesus.
2	Maybe he is happy and you are the one who needs to change.
2	Your help isn't wanted.
2	I don't think his problem is attributed to his personality type, or WTF years. We experience those, but this guy just seems stagnant and lacks drive. \n\nInstead of worrying about his own plate he's comparing what's on others' plates to his own, and he's stuck in a negative feedback loop.\n\nISTPs are the worst at confronting this to help a friend. I'd just tell him to man the fuck up and make changes; because he's already getting left behind in the dust. 
1	What's your type?
1	As an istp, I think we are a bit more resistance and stubborn for receiving feedback or advice from other people than the average, and the only way I know to improve on this is being self-aware of our own behavior, and it seems your friend has some deeper issues to acknowledge himself, as you said the only thing he changed in the last 10 years is, he is feeling down and having more negative emotions toward others...\n\nI think mbti may not be able to help much here, but what called my attention is that he may be afraid of change (there are a tons of material related to this subject) and he is not even aware of it, and also unaware that he won't achieve his goals making the same things over and over....\n\nIf this was a different sub I would leave this last line out, but as istp it seems we are well know for giving a bucket of cold water when giving advice, so here you go. :)\nThere's this saying that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same experiment expecting a different outcome 
1	LEAVE.HIM.ALONE. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKidding :p Funny how some of us here went all defensive mode as well. This is what you are dealing with. haha 
1	What’s wrong with being single in your thirties? Is that a problem?
-4	sounds like you are the issue and not him. 
8	Am I actually an ISTP or something else?	Hey guys.  I believe an ISTP is probably closest to my true type, but I've tested as an ENTP, ESTP and INTP before.  I'm very certain on the P aspect, and pretty sure I'm more T than F.  However, I'm very ambiverted, and believe I used Intuition and Sensing very equally.  Here's a description of myself, in regard to each function:\n\nE vs I\n\n\-(I)I NEED alone time, whether it be video games, zoning out, TV, reading interesting articles or eating, I must be alone after a long day\n\n\-(E)Conversely, I really start to feel restless when I haven't seen my close friends for a couple of days.  I also pretty much always choose parties and concerts over staying in and doing my own thing\n\n\-I generally initiate most social interactions w/ ppl I'm close to.  HOWEVER, I pretty much never initiate any contact with people I don't know well.\n\n\-(I) this might be also due to my preference for P over J, but I absolutely hate leading groups of people.  I really dislike group projects cuz I have an idea of exactly what I need to Do, but I cannot stand trying to systematically control everyone and make sure they're all doing what they need to get done.  Naturally, I really do have a "live and let live" attitude.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS vs N\n\n\-(N) I can see possibilities and solutions other's don't always see.  I also have great analysis of books, and often am able to pick out hidden meanings given a writer's choice of words and context of a situation.  I also absolutely love sitting and discussing 16P w/ my super close INTP friend.  I'm also NOT excellent but not awful at stereotypical ISTP stuff like woodworking, fixing things, etc.\n\n\-(S) stereotypically like an ISTP, I tend to be excellent in crises. When I was 16, I saw a guy in a car wreck.  Instinctively, I took the lead among several other adults who just seemed to be panicking and upset.  I remember having pretty much no emotional reaction, just doing.  I ended up pulling the man out of the flipped-over car, but he unfortunately already broke his neck and was dead.  It was tough to see.  There have been a couple of other instances in my life where I seemed to subconsciously react and take charge in emergency scenarios.\n\n\-(S) Pretty much all of these possibilities/solutions that I think of have a practical implication.  For example, there will be times before an event when my ENFP friend, INTP friend and myself will be discussing something in depth. Often , while they're both deep in discusson, I find myself getting sorta impatient because I just want to do something.\n\n\-(S) I also RARELY get so lost in thought that I forget my external environment: Even when I don't wanna, I tend to notice all sounds around me, people walking into a room, etc.  This is probably why I'm a really good driver (I think lol).\n\n\-(S) I like drugs simply due to physical pleasure.  For example, the only drug I've been truly addicted to was Nicotine, simply because of the sheer pleasure and immediate intensity of the buzz.  I enjoy marijuana because it has the capacity to greatly increase extraverted sensing (i.e. food, music, colors, sex, etc.).  Same with driving fast and roller coasters.  I love the immediate adrenaline rush, probably more than an Ne.\n\n\-(N) I generally have crappy attention to detail, especially in math.  Conceptually, I seem to intuitively understand general concepts and patterns.  Yet, when I'm actually doing out a problem, I can miss some basic details.\n\n\-(N) I'm super interested in simply learning more, and not actually actively doing anything with the information.  For example, I can't imagine many ISTPs would be so interested in deep analysis of their own personality on 16P like I am.\n\n\-(N/S) I definitely dream big, seeing past my immediate reality.  However, pretty much all of these dreams are automatically followed up w/ a subconscious thought process about what will work, including little details (even tho I miss these in math) and realistic steps I can take to achieve these visions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDamn that's a lotta text.  I'm assuming I'm either an ISTP (like my profile says), INTP, ENTP or ESTP.  I'm welcome to any other potential suggestions too.  Thanks so much guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
12	Bc of the part you mentioned not being able to shut out external sensations even if you wanted to “noises, ppl walking in a room” I’d say ISTP. Also try forgetting the individual letters and just looking at functions. 
11	LOLing at all the "I didn't read everything's" in this thread. F***ing ISTP armchair quarterbacks. We have our incredible insights on how you should interpret the foundation of who you are but we're too busy to listen to a word you said. 
9	I honestly didnt read the whole thing but if you use both N and S almost equally you are probably an IxxP because they have perceiving functions in the middle so they work well together at somewhat similar level whilst ExxPs have one of them dom and you would know if you were a Ne/Se dom 
11	TYPE👏BY👏FUNC👏TIONS👏NOT👏LET👏TERS👏👏👏
4	Determining whether you're I or E has less to do with how much you need social interaction and more to do with your driving functions, which you haven't mentioned here. \n\nIf you're ISTP, then you lead with Ti (internal thinking) and your secondary function is Se (external sensing). Ti is a judging function (nothing to do with J vs P) and Se is a processing function. One way to think of Ti is that you go into the world with a pre-formed opinion. Se allows you to be extremely in touch with the external world and your physical senses. This is a "hands on" type... who loses patience with too much abstract thinking (although capable of it). You then have Ni, then Fe. I can't explain Ni very well. With inferior Fe, you want to be more socially minded, but you struggle with it... and often say "fuck it and everyone".\n\nIf you are ENTP, you lead with Ne (external intuition, nicknamed "Exploration" by Personality Hacker... and a processing function) and your secondary function is Ti (mentioned above). You do not lead with a preformed opinion; you explore, take in information, and observe the world and patterns therein. You use Ti to make sense of the patterns you've seen. Fe *eventually* allows you to be pretty adept in social situations, but you will always struggle with procrastination and being very organized due to interior Si.\n\nIf you're INTP, you also lead with Ti, but your secondary function is Ne. Both INTP and ENTP are very abstract-thinking types, but INTP is generally more introverted than ENTP, less aware of social etiquette, and generally more awkward (with inferior Fe)... but, with tertiary Si, are more organized than the ENTP... but still not *very* organized.\n\nIf you are ESTP, you lead with Se... you are very aware of the world outside yourself and in touch with your physical body. You are in-the-moment; you are "present" in the here and now. You are taking in physical sensations and watching what's going on around you. You also have secondary Ti... which you then use to make sense of those sensations and what you see. You have relatively well-developed Fe, and so are pretty social, but still somewhat dense in human interactions. And you have inferior Si.\n\nYou are misunderstanding J. It is not about leading a group, but about how organized you are; how adherent you are to a system... one you have created, or others have created (Fi would mean you follow your own system; Fe would mean you would follow the group's). Are you systematic? Are you organized? Do you prefer to have a plan, or do you prefer to be spontaneous?\n\nI'm ENTP hence how deep into the abstract I have gone with you. :D
2	I didn't read everything, but I have similar as you with the 4 different types. I eventually narrowed it down to an xSTP since I am physically inclined. I liked a video on youtube from C.S. Joseph "How Do ESTPs compared to ISTPs". He breaks down the functions, including the shadow, and unconcious functions with examples. 
2	Everything in your description fits ISTP very nicely. In the ISTP function stack, Ni and Se are split pretty evenly. Moreover, the Ni-Se axis has the tendency to analyze only the concepts that apply directly to life, as opposed to Ne-Si which is often more freeform and tangential. Your love of analysis definitely speeks to dominant Ti as well. Hope this confirms it for you :)
1	https://monoskop.org/images/8/8d/Jung_Gustav_Carl_Psychological_Types_1946.Pdf
1	TLDR...at all. 
1	Tested as an INTP and ISFP before, INTP more frequently than ISFP
1	It's too long to read, but if you're good at troubleshooting (whatever system it is), then you're an ISTP. 
16	Are you guys really stoic like the istp stereotype?	I'm not very stoic, and can be a bit expressive but only sometimes. It only happens when I just can't help myself. For example, when my close friend who's bi told me that she got the girl of her dreams, I couldn't help but squeal out of joy for her since I care for her and her happiness quite a lot. I also can be quite sassy, charming, and funny when I feel like it. I think it has to do with my eneagram. However, a lot of the time I'm quite cool-headed and chill. What about you guys? 
43	Only on the outside. 
30	Stoicism (and how I believe ISTPs are at the core) does not mean expressionless.  I'd give the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) page a read.  It means that you believe the value of something is in the moment.  Not the fear or anticipation of the next moment.\n\nIt's not that we don't *have* emotions, it's that we don't *waste* an emotion.  Being calculated about what we express usually means collected when we need to be and explosively passionate when we need to be.
11	I'm pretty damn stoic especially with tragedies. You said sassy so I'm assuming you're female? Or maybe a gay guy. Either way, those could factor in in terms of societal norms. But ya not all ISTP are stoic, I just happen to be. 
5	Really Depends on who I'm with.  With my closest friends, I'm anything but stoic.  I'm goofy, loud, absurd, inappropriate and pretty much the polar opposite of a textbook ISTP.  With people I don't know as well I definitely tend do be stoic and not emotionally expressive.  If I *really* need to (which I fucking hate doing), I can muster up some Fe and act like a seriously warm, empathetic person.  To act w/ that warmth is pretty draining for me tbh and probably comes off as forced cuz I suck at it haha.
3	Very much no. Most people would describe me a bubbly. I just don't deal with my emotions outwardly. I'm "stoic" in the way that you won't see much past bubbly unless we are very very close
2	Depends on the emotion. My hardships are usually evident. You can see I'm having a rough day even if I'm holding it together. But happiness, joy and all that. I might smile momentarily, but the smile is gone pretty quickly, even if I'm still pretty happy. 
2	I rarely show emotion or reaction. I can be excited and it's hard to tell.
2	Let's just say I've had the phrase "emotionally unavailable" tossed at me a couple of times. Personally I don't find it true, it's just that if things are bothering me, I don't really make a deal about it. If there's nothing that can be done about it then why stress it too much, you know?
2	I don’t know about stoic. Most people describe be as nonchalant, chill, calm. I’m friendly but not in an over the top kind of way. More of a live and let live persona.
1	Stoic but not expressionless. \n\nI still feel happy and will react in such a way if my emotions align, it’s just that rarely do my emotions make a feature. 
1	I would definitely say I am stoic.
1	You bet!
1	I get told that I'm calm a lot, but also that I'm sassy and have good people skills. I think because I'm a girl I've had to flex my inferior Fe a lot over the years, so I don't necessarily completely relate to the strong, silent type trope.
1	Stoicism has more to do with your Conscientiousness and level of Neuroticism, which varies from person to person.
1	I can be but not compared to most ISTPs I don't think. I'm of the Sx dom variety and I like cracking jokes and stuff.
1	To the outside world I am. I feel like I get super excited or have up and down swings but according to my friends I appear super calm and collected almost all the time. I think even my friends just assume I don’t get stressed very often because I just appear so “cool” on the outside. 
1	Nope, if I fall into Ti-Ni loop, I am not stoic at all.
1	I go entire days without saying more than five words but I may be an extreme case.
13	Do you guys believe in god and the supernatural?	I'm just curious. \n\nPersonally, I do. I think its due to the way I was raised (I'm a Hindu and Hinduism is a pretty chill religion, not too overbearing), so I found it easier to believe in a higher power. I also am interested in the occult and mystical stuff, like witchcraft, tarot cards, ghosts and demons but I'm not sure if I *really* believe in those things, considering I've never witnessed actual supernatural things in my life. I have, however, had many instances where God has "answered" my prayers, which made me start to believe in a higher power a lot more. Funny thing is, I started off as a complete non-believing atheist. Oh well.\n\nWhat about you guys?
29	Atheist borderline anti-theist 
16	I was agnostic for the longest time. I don't know, I'm somewhere between agnostic and theist at this point
12	I’m agnostic.  I truly believe that I don’t know. I don’t believe that anyone knows either. 
27	I usually want to believe, but find myself unable to.
8	I don't not believe
7	Yes sir 100%
7	I'm pretty much full on agnostic. Whatever otherworldly being has power over us is so complex, that it's over our heads even try comprehending what it actually is.
6	Secular upbringing. Then was Mormon at some point. Then left Mormonism for a non-denom flavor. Eventually fell out of the theology because of my disbelief in the common Bible interpretations of Protestants, moving to something a little more Christian-liberal. Now more Christian Orthodox, still with some beliefs that we don't know everything and that our common interpretations of Christian theology is flawed in some ways, but that Orthodoxy still holds more water for me than other Christian faiths. And I'm very NON-judgemental of other belief systems. Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Sikh.... We're all looking for the same thing. An afterlife with people and a god or gods who love or appreciate us, and an eternal existence of positivity, peace and happiness. That said, yes, I am theist.
8	I don't mean to cause offense by saying this, but I've always been quite anti-theist / anti-religion, and I remain quite sad that our race still maintains such beliefs systems despite believing ourselves to be an intelligent, highly evolved species. If religion caused no harm, maybe I'd change my perspective, but I don't see that ever being the case. Even in my country (the UK) the government allows animal welfare laws to be circumvented, in order to allow people with religious beliefs to cause pointless animal suffering for no reason other than their religion demands it (Halal and Kosher slaughter). Even at its best, I struggle to see religion as anything more than the inheritance and perpetuation of archaic ignorance. \n\nAgain, I'm sorry if reading this offends anybody.
8	We're just a few cosmic moments away from proving that the universe is a hologram at the quantum level.  And we've already shown ample evidence that consciousness has an effect on the universe at that level.   I think it might be just a few short moments before we realize that this is all a dream anyway.  
3	Funny but true fact I was going to make a post like this today but didn't.\n\nI was raised Catholic and although I haven't been to church in years I still believe in a higher power of some kind but not necessarily the Christian idea of God being represented as an old dude. I am also unsure if I believe in an afterlife.\n\nI am really into the occult and supernatural. I read tarot cards and have always had an interest in ghosts and vampires. I love studying all things related to the supernatural but I only really belive in ghosts because of a few experiences when I was younger. One belief I have that is related is that I think every item has an essence or spirit to it. Or rather part of your essence rubs off on things. Like for example if two people buy identically tea cups after awhile they start to feel different based on the owner's personality and how the used it.\n\nThere's some really interesting studies on how religion is ingrained in human culture. Something about how our brains are hard wired to seek higher understanding and to belong in a group and religion (including atheism) fulfills these needs by providing both. I wish I could remember the names but it's been several years.

2	Lately I've been growing more open to certain spiritual or mystical ideas. I'm never quite sure exactly what I believe.
2	I'm Muslim, so yeah I do believe in God; always have.
2	Only vampires
1	no
1	Supernatural in the sense that theres beings of other dimensions sure. But god? Nah.
1	No
1	Yes
1	Was Mormon most of my life, that came crashing down and I'm now barely able to call myself agnostic. I want to believe, but it really doesn't sit well for me.
1	I don't really care at all, I am from the most atheist country in the worls, basically nobody was religious around me growing up and now as an adult I simply don't care, because I never cared in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am susperstisious to a degree as most athletes are, like if you tied your laces differently one day and won, you keep doing it
1	Skeptism 
1	Why think about religion. Think about people and your behaviour and let whoever religious people judges you, judge the real you and not some fake. 
1	Absolutely not.
1	I was raised Catholic, went through the sacraments of Baptism, Eucharist, and Confirmation, but am a closeted atheist now. \n\nBeing around religion for so long has actually made me despise it. \n\nI don’t believe in the supernatural, and I’m not superstitious. 
1	I’m a non believer, but if I had to label myself then Agnostic. I don’t believe but can’t prove either way so fuck it, don’t care.
1	History says the gods were created to explain events people could not explain and to bring them peace of mind.\n\n\n\nGods have been a part of humanity's culture for millennia. For that reason alone, even if you tell yourself you do not believe it, when shit hits the fan you might find yourself praying to these fictitional divine beings.
1	Agnostic.  Who really knows?  No one.
1	I used to believe but as I've grown older the questions started outweighing the answers. 
1	If you believe in a deity you're probably not using your brain to its full potential 
1	I want there to be a god or gods but while I'm alive I don't waste much time thinking about it.  I figure, I'll find out when I die.\n\nAs for things like fairies and goblins nah..  Alien life yes.
1	I cannot take anyone seriously who truly believes in god. I mean, would you take someone seriously if he/she believed in leprechauns?\n\nKind of the same thing. 
1	I’m an agnostic so I’m open to the idea but don’t actively follow any religion or belief system. 
1	You can neither prove or disprove God, heck you can't even prove if anything exists at all. Why are we even alive?  \nCartesian Skepticism/Existentialism makes you think.
-3	[deleted]
8	How would you know you're Ti - Se or Ti - Ni? Who are some real life examples of the two types?	Consume or sleep.
6	Jealousy, let's say you think your loved one is cheating. You create an assumption(this is Ti) and after, in your mind, closed in your room, you try to find evidences (this is Ni). \n\nBut if you think he/she is cheating and you go out and try to find evidences in the outter world (you do a little investigation) it is Ti - Se.\n\nOn the other hand if you go out and talk to your loved one about it, it is Ti - Fe.
2	This^^
0	You mean Ti subtype and Se subtype right? (According to socionics there's ISTj - Ti and ISTj - Se).\n\nThe Ti subtype I think is more indoor, prefers reading or solving problemas.\n\nThe Se subtype I think is more outdoor, prefers doing hands on stuffs.\n\nFergie from The Black Eyed Peas ir ISTP - Se subtype. Ti subtype I would think is more introverted, more into books and stuff like that.\n\n&#x200B;
18	The Grinch is an ISTP	Prove me wrong
17	He seemed like quite the planner and organizer, so he may be -J. 
11	I was seeing more Te/Fi - I'd argue IxTJ.
8	I don't see it, he's too vocal
3	I love the grinch
5	Infj. I know because of the way he is.
2	Dr. Seuss based the grinch off of himself so shouldn't they be similar types? 
2	Well he's definitely a dominant introverted judger - he goes his own way.  \nMy personal guess is INFP tho.
2	I tried to type a couple of arguments out, but nothing held up.  You might be right on this one...
2	He’s a fictional non-human character with no life experience, instincts, or biological coding. \n\n\nThere ya go. Can we stop this stupid bullshit now? 
1	Me: Personality type the Grinch?  \nLocal personality type wizard:\n\nbefore or after his rejection - or after his redemption   \nok   \nso ...   \nhe got things done   \nJ   \nhe was a strong feeler ... he loved that one Whoo ... and he was personally accosted from the shaving mockery ... and abandonment in fact   \nhis black heart grew because of Feels at the end   \nF   \nHe thought about impacts and future ... and planned and followed patterns   \nN   \nand although he was a reculse - it wasn't by natural choice   \nso   \nGrinch was a hurt ENFJ.
1	The burden of proof is on you
7	Marriage	Those of you that are married, was there a point where it was clear to you about getting married?\n\nI haven't dated a ton. I'm in a decently serious relationship, and granted I feel like I'm bad about big decisions, but part of me wonders if I'll ever feel that and / or if that means I need to reevaluate where I'm at currently / maybe move on. I know you could almost always play the ‘grass is greener’ scenario but I also don’t want to settle. \n\nThoughts?
9	Never wanted to get married then met someone I wanted to marry and it felt normal and I was cool w it 
5	My husband is an ISTP and he wanted to get married since he was in his early twenties and did so in his late twenties, to the first person he dated seriously because as he put it, he just knew because it was simple. There wasn't drama. We mutually respect each other, have common and separate interests and we basically are really good friends who live together and hang out.
3	Definitely consider the other person's personality and ask yourself how that fits in with your processing methods. Those differences will come into play during disagreements which can be bad or good. Since ISTPs are most capable of walking away from relationships, it's important that one's partner is going to respect how we work. We can be in it for the long haul, but meshing together is very important for our own happiness.
3	I just want to add that ISTPs probably have varying degrees of red lines. While compromises are needed in any relationship, a partner really needs to understand that what makes us interesting also requires working what our needs and traits are.\n\nFor me, things like alone time (but with an open door when/if needed to talk), avoiding ultimatums or strict rules (we tend to color outside the lines and toss rules that make no sense), excitement/adventure, spontaneity and privacy are all important factors for my happiness.\n\nThe red lines in my case though are understanding, empathy and kindness which aren't really tied to the above ISTP traits but I think are related to our sense of direct fairness.\n\nMake sure your partner can respect your processing style or it can lead to much unhappiness.
2	Married, but not actually living together.\n\nNever had strong feelings about marriage. But I'm into it.
1	I've been engaged twice, married once and still am. It happened both times because she was ready and it was the next logical step. I would have been happy in both cases with not being engaged and married but we must follow social norms especially when most/all of your friends are married.
1	Married and now is in process of divorce. I dont love him anymore. All the feelings burnt out one day and I just thinking what the hell made me to want to marry him. Well, he didnt treat me good, leaving me taking care our baby alone, never support us and very temperamental.\nI dont need toxic person in my life. And I am much happier being alone than with somebody who like to control me. 
10	Tattoos	What tattoos do ya'll got? Any ISTP-esque one? Which one are you proud of/regret? Planning a back tattoo, am curious. 
36	No tats.  I can’t say that there is anything I feel passionate about for long enough to justify permanently marking my body. 
11	No, they're a waste of money, plus it makes no sense to put something on yourself that won't come off easily.
7	I’ve watched other people get tattoos they regretted. Does that count?
5	Don't have any and likely never will.  If I did, I'd probably get a diagram of some favorite organic molecule like adrenaline or dopamine.  
5	None... apparently that's a personality trait too, who knew!
5	I have the brand of the sacrifice on my back right shoulder and plan on getting many more anime related ones
4	None, because as others said they are way too permanent. I mean, I could tattoo the speed of light on me but wouldn't I look silly if it turned out in a few decades that it isn't actually constant, eh?
3	Personally I've always liked the idea of a yakuza back tattoo or even maui back tattoos but not enough to do it on my body.
3	Tattoos are too permanent for my tastes
3	Never seen one I thought made a person look better.
6	I have multiple. I don't regret any, though I do wish I had changed one.
2	When I was younger, I had good ideas for tattoos that I'd thought up and liked at the time. But never got one. As with others here, at the end of the day, it's a waste of hundreds, possibly thousands of dollars, and there's nothing that's come to my mind that I was just absolutely passionate enough about to put on my body as a permanent feature.
2	Sorry, my body is not sketchbook
2	I dislike tatoos
2	I got one when I was 17. It was the one thing my parents absolutely forbid and hated, but my friend’s older brother was a tattoo artist and he did it when I was 17. So now I have a tiny heart tattoo right under my hip bone. Andddd I immediately regretted it. It’s never visible, but I started getting it removed a year ago.\n\nI don’t like tattoos, I don’t think anyone looks BETTER with a tattoo, I think they usually make people look worse. 
2	I got shitty looking Kame house from dbz, a four star dragonball next to the seven star one, I have a rose on my leg cause I'm basic af but fuck it I like roses, & I have pink panther w a bunch Lil Peeps tattoos, love all of them want a million more lmao
1	I have 2, got one laser removal session on 1 but the I kind of accepted it once the laser faded it a bit 
1	i am 17 right now, but i would love to get tattooed once i turn 18. \n\ni wouldnt want my tattoo to mean anything necessarily because, as others have said, I wouldn’t be passionate enough about something for that. \n\nInstead, I would get something small and only for the experience and the sake of art.
1	I have two. One is a solid black crescent moon sort of surrounding the words 'trust your instincts' on my upper arm, which is both kind of fitting for an ISTP and it's something my mom said to me my whole life.  And the other is under my collarbone, stretching to the ball of my shoulder and says 'What doesn't kill you will try again'. \n\nI used to feel that a tattoo had to have strong meaning and such but now I count it like a memory of a time or thought. Like a scar, but that you chose, and some will have more of a story than others. As long as it's very well done there's nothing I regret about them. I have many more ideas but money has more important places to be spent at the moment.
1	I have a black and red nautical star above one elbow and I hate it.  There's zero meaning behind it.  I got it at age 18.  I keep it as a reminder to myself that I'm stupid and not do it again.  \nThey're so expensive and I get that for some people tattoos ARE the hobby but I just.....  what a waste of money. 
1	i have quite a few and plan to get a whole lot more, i've always wanted them since i was a kid. grew up on sci-fi movies and video games which led to me having an interest in geometric/blackwork/futuristic style tattoos \n\npersonally, i've always found it mildly hilarious how people without tattoos almost always need to share their dislike of them with the world.
0	Do it, only one for me, no regrets. I want to get another one or two soon.
20	The rarity known as crying	I noticed that I wont cry for myself unless I feel completely helpless/hopeless. but Im more prone to forming tears when a close one tells me about their sadness when going through a tough situation \n\nJust wondering if anyone else experiences this
37	that's called empathy 
9	Yeah I’d agree. It’s usually an external stimuli that gets my tear ducts pumpin. Wether I see or hear something beautiful (which recently started bringing tears to my eyes. Not sure why LOL), someone tells me something sad, whatever. \n\n\nHonestly feels good though. I went so many years without a single tear. Sometimes a good cry just feels good man. I rarely like all out bawl my eyes out. But some tears streaming down makes me a feel a certain way. 
9	I rarely cry at sad stuff. I cry when the Iron Giant says "I go. You stay. No Following." I cry when Samwise wades into the River after Frodo. I cry when the giving tree is a proud stump that can still give the boy a seat to rest on.\n\nI don't cry when I've had a bad day or gotten bad news. Those are problems that require focus and clarity. I cry when something is so beautiful that it melts my cold inner core.
8	The only thing I can recall that's made me cry in the past 5 years or so was the Jupiter Jazz episodes of Cowboy Bebop. 
4	Not that I am incapable of crying, but it isn't a go-to.\n\nLast time was actually so I wouldn't stand out after some of our pets died. Who wants to be the "All dogs go to heaven"-guy, right.\n\nTime before that, I came off of something weird. Couldn't stop crying for no reason; it was hell.\n\nAnd of course the occasional watery eye you are supposed to get from those critically acclaimed television dramas.
8	I can form tears if I watch one of those 'soldier coming home and surprising their family' videos but even then I get embarrassed by crying in front of myself. 
3	I didn't cry that much as a kid or teenage but somewhere in my early twenties I started to cry a lot more and get emotional over sad stories. 
2	That’s Fe in play. I envy you, as I haven’t cried in years now. Wish I could relearn that.
2	The real me never cried, I've always been stone cold hearted (except when my best friend died). But then I started taking birth control 2 years ago and it really messed up my hormones. Nowadays I can cry, for example, when I watch a cooking competition. 
2	Empathy is great. I always feel like the other person is just telling me a story, like a sequence of events, and I don't feel any type of way about it. I understand with my brain it's a sad situation, and these thoughts might initiate my emotional response, but even that happens rarely. If they display their emotions too much I get annoyed, because I just don't get how anyone's able to feel SO much and let it overwhelm you that hard.\n\nI only cry when romcoms end well, it brings a happy tear to my eye. Or when I watch those cute videos of kids being nice to others, they make me really emotional lol.
1	I can't cry most of the time. I will only cry under extreme pressure. 
1	My last good cry was in the middle of a Hero's Journey on Gold Caps- super liberating.   \nPast that, the closest I get to crying is that lump in the throat. Machine oil for blood I guess. 
1	I’ve cried for real like 2 times this year, once because ”friends”, once because i saw the end of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
1	I don't get that
1	It's because Fi or morals is not in our main functions.  So we care less about how we feel.  But Fe or ethics is one of our 4 main functions even if it is our inferior one.  It makes us care about how others feel.
1	When I cry it’s usually not something I’m currently going through but with things I can relate to. Usually it’s something I’m watching on TV that makes the feels come out.\n\nI was in the Army and lost a lot of friends and cried during their funerals. I actually stopped going after the 10th because it was too heart breaking and we lost 20 more on that deployment.\n\nI saw an episode of Flashpoint with a veteran who was going through it and I had tears streaming down my face. I’ve seen a few Animes that made me tear up and some Netflix tv shows and whatnot. So year mostly empathy. It reminds me know I’m not some cold hearted bastard and that I’m actually human.
1	Last hard cry was 6 months after my 5yr relationship ended. It sort of hit me that, while I didn’t miss the relationship and I initiated the end, my best friend was gone. I had to mourn that.\n\nI cried when my friends dog died because that\ndog was amazing. He would bark when I drove up, which he never did for anyone else. We had a bond. Last time I saw him was through the window and he whimpered and I said, “I’ll pet you soon. I’m sorry.” He was gone two days later. \n\n
3	Help me with more info about mbti	I joined this thread shortly after taking the test on 16personalities.com and everything I know about different types I read on that website. I have no idea what you guys mean when you talk about Si, Se, Fe, Ni, etc. It is like Chinese to me. Of course I googled but was not satisfied with the first few articles that came up. Could anyone please link me a good source you know about, that explains everything thoroughly? I'd be very grateful. 
4	I highly suggest watching CS Joseph on YouTube.  He has a shit ton of videos explaining cognitive functions and how they work for all the types.  As well as a lot of other stuff that goes way deeper into it.
3	Www.typeinmind.com I can send you some pictures of charts I’ve made to help me understand it more, it’s really helped me understand how people think and be able to relate/communicate to them better, especially feeling types, it’s no longer like talking to a brick wall when talking with an ENFP, it’s actually quite pleasant 
22	Do you care about your external appearance?	Or are you more “I’ll take showers regularly and throw on whatever clothes I find comfortable and that’s it, I don’t care if you find me sexy or not or find my fashion sense horrible or not” type of guy or girl?
30	I wear what I want. If it looks nice so be it, but I am not going out of my way to feel uncomfortable just so you can think I look good. 
20	I absolutely care. I recognize style from other people or social media to gain perspective. Not caring about how you look seems retarded to me. Anyone who wears baggy jeans is completely unaware of current trends and looks like a moron.
39	i try to look the best i can with the least amount of effort
28	I care a lot about my physical appearance, even though I generally don't give a heck if people think I have a bad personality or not.\n\nI take pride in my efforts to look good and enjoy the stares/compliments. \n\nI don't necessarily follow fashion trends, it's just really important to me to look well put together and cleanly.
10	Yep very much so. I have a very elaborate daily skincare and makeup routine, spend hundreds of dollars on bleaching and styling my hair each month, and love coming up with fun outfits and collecting handbags. In the wild people tend to assume that I’m a girly feeler and are taken aback by the Ron Swanson-esque vibes when I talk lol. \n\nHowever I do think it’s important to note that I don’t do these things to impress other people or gain approval, but because I just think they’re fucking fun! Perhaps it’s Se magic at work, but I feel great when I look the way I want to look and can be creative with my style. \n\n
4	I wear what I like that the end of the day, I just want to wear what I think looks dope, don't really care if anyone else thinks its wack
4	Practicality with a hint of caring about what others think.
7	I work out a ton, and eat well and keep clean and decently groomed--so I care about my physical appearance a lot and keep very fit, but fashion and trends can go fuck themselves. \n\nI still wear a t-shirt/hoodie and jeans to work and I've been a professional engineer for decades. \n\n
3	Kind of. I care about it because I wanna feel good with myself. I try to wear clothes that suit me and to look good.
2	I have a decent sense of fashion, for a guy at least. I try to not dress like a kid. I also try to get my hair cut on a somewhat regular basis and keep my beard trimmed. Theres not a lot I can do after that but  I do put in some effort.
2	Kind of:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShowering is a must, if only because I get *rank* when I don't, so I usually shower in the mornings and after the gym. Easy enough.\n\nI have a skin-care routine which I *mostly* stick to, and that's it. Makeup hasn't graced my face in well over a decade.\n\nHair-wise, I have a few products that increase the odds of my hair looking the way I like it. I put those on and then let fate take the wheel. My hair will look how it chooses to look that day.\n\nClothes wise, it's a little more complicated, since I recently "rehauled" my wardrobe to better fit the fact that I'm almost in my 30's.\n\nFor the longest time, my wardrobe was essentially graphic Ts, jeans, boots and a flannel. Nowadays, the boots and jeans are exactly the same, but I've traded the T's and the flannel for button down shirts with...[interesting](https://mosaic03.ztat.net/vgs/media/pdp-gallery/DE/12/1E/05/XQ/11/DE121E05X-Q11@4.jpg) [patterns](https://di2ponv0v5otw.cloudfront.net/posts/2018/03/31/5ac00c9a5512fd1c27af9a9b/m_5ac00ccbb7f72b947d4cffae.jpg).\n\nDo they look good on me? I think so.\n\nDo other agree? Not really, but I like them and I'm wearing them, period.\n\nShoes... Well I wear boots unless it's entirely too hot, and those are almost always scuffed or dirty, so even if I try to look 'pretty', the shoes always leave something to be desired.\n\nI have a series of necklaces (I love skulls) I wear when I remember to.\n\nNo earrings, no bracelets, no nail polish, nothing beyond what I've already mentioned.\n\nI have a few old and beaten handbags, but those are only used when I need to carry a bunch of shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, I like to smell nice, feel clean and dress up comfortably but somewhat formally because I was getting sick and tired of being chronically underdressed.\n\nOther people's opinion don't necessarily factor in my decision, though I do ask friends and family if the outfit of the day matches, since I usually can't tell on my own. 
2	Depends on the purpose. I take showers once every two days because it clears my head. I wear nice clothes only when I have to meet up with people because (1) I like to explore my good sense of style (nothing trendy) (2) I like it when people affirms it. Both things makes me feel good. But in my natural habitat, I'm a basic ugly sloth. I don't even brush my hair. I mostly use natural products tho cause I am afraid of having leather skin early in life. Also depends where I am. I'm at my parents' farmhouse atm, so looking good isn't really needed as much as when I was in an urban setting.
2	Gym shorts and t shirts. That's all I wear. If it's chilly, I throw on my same jacket I've had, since 9th grade, for 7 years. It's so comfortable, none of my other jackets compare. 
2	I hate trends but i still care about how i look
2	I prioritize comfort over judgements/what others think even though every article of clothing is broadcasting something.\n\nThere sadly isn't a pair of joggers suitable for every situation...
2	Look good feel good. I’m not as picky about appearance for work. I just shower and throw work clothes on. But for stuff outside of work, I like to look good. Not for other people, but for myself. When I look good, I feel good. Boosts my confidence, my general happiness at the time, and gives me an energy boost. If I leave the house in sweats, all I can think as soon as I leave the door is “god when do I get to come back home”. But when I put on nice pants and a nice shirt and style my hair/beard, I want to stay out and do stuff. 
1	M 30, I have my own rules of clothing and I follow the rules: always black, cargo pants, long handed shirts or camelneck, a silver necklace on the top, yellow military boots always.\n\nIf I am whole deep into my craft I can forget shower 2-3 days. 
1	Not really. I usually wear stuff like shorts or sweats because they are comfortable, convenient, and allows me to do more than other restricting clothes would.
1	def the latter
1	For the most part I try to look nice, it doesn't mean I don't get lazy sometimes. Showering everyday and clean well fitting clothes are a must. However, makeup is more sporadic for me and I haven't shaved my legs in over a week (it's winter and I'm single so no one will really see them). 
1	I care up to the point where it doesn't interfere with my day to day. I get well fitting, non-K-mart, plain styles that all compliment each other (ie: no graphic tees). I can just grab pants and shirt with a 90% chance they'll match.
1	I didn't when I was younger, but I do now, or at least more than I used to.  I used to be "shower and whatever is comfortable".  At some point I realised that (particularly at work) people judge you on your appearances, and that their judgement and opinion matters.
1	I have a super casual, comfortable and practical style.  Probably come across a little tomboyish at times.  Definitely not a girly style.  But I dont look sloppy at all.  I always style my hair and almost always do my makeup every morning.  But I wear my makeup the same way every day and my nail polish is pretty much always chipped..  (but hey I work at a bike shop)  and I cut and dye my own hair and paint my own nails and wear the same shoes every day.  Body wise I make sure that I stay active and stay fit and have pretty high standard for how my body looks.  So I do care about my appearance but I like it to be super casual and practical and not girly.    
1	Comfort over everything, but yes, I care. 
1	Yes, i think it's important to portray via your fashion style what kind of person you are, so that people have a small clue about what i am about and will approach me or not based on their first impression. It functions like a filter i would say.
28	Whats your memory like?	Only raising this question because I was plastered out of my mind last night at a work party, met someone new, and instantly recognized them as a classmate from fucking elementary school. Lo and behold, I was right.\n\n\nIf you asked me what I did during the day yesterday I wouldn't remember fuck all.
35	Yup, that's my memoey right there. Remembering weird things from who knows when for who knows why, but yesterdays events are fuzzy unless I try to remember yesterday 
25	Yep.  Excellent facial recognition.  I know if I’ve seen you before.  But don’t ask me to remember your name.
16	I can't even remember what I did this morning... My memory is so random and horrible. Probably a reason why I don't like arguing because I can't remember what I'm arguing about.
12	Yeah, my long term memory, and memory of events, is really good. I don't know if I could officially call it photographic since I don't know what the criteria for that is or if it's even a real thing. But it's like - if it happened to me at some point in my life after about age 3 or 4, I remember it. My short term / working memory, though? A probably-ADHD-induced fucking sieve.\n\nSo I can remember precise details about stuff like walking down an elementary school hallway what it felt like running my hand against the wall - but I'll forget what I was thinking about five seconds ago.  Great priorities, brain.
4	Mine too. I remember things not even I knew I knew.
2	I can generally remember faces but need about 20 min to remember what I did last week 
2	I don't know how many times I have shook hands with people I've already met before because they didn't remember me.
2	My long term memory is excellent, particularly for interesting things.  I have a particularly good memory for numbers - I know most important phone numbers off by heart, I know pi to 50 decimal places and I have known the speed of light since I was 12.  \n\nMy short term memory is genuinely terrible (embarrassingly bad).  I pretty much write everything down at work and keep a list of thing to do, otherwise I have a continuing series of people coming to me and saying "Have you done that thing you agreed to do?" and I look at them blankly with no memory of that conversation.\n\nThe real problem is that my subconscious decides what is interesting or important, not my conscious.  That normally means that I know my third cousin twice-removed's birthday but can't remember to buy milk on the way home from work.
2	Semantic memory: godlike.\n\nEpisodic memory: poor.\n\nFace memory: terrible for people I didn't pay attention do, incredible for people I did pay attention to. \n\nMemory of where I was while reading a given book: perfect, useless.
1	Intelligence agent skills
1	Wait, what was the question? \n\nBeing serious, excellent long term memory but short term is lacking. I can recognize faces years later but names elude me. My men's soccer team has had the same 11 guys on it for 2 years and thankfully three are John and two are Mike, otherwise I'd still be using "dude".
1	I'm a teacher. I used to teach about 100 - 110 kids (not all at once, obviously), and I could remember all their names, their hobbies and random little things they told me. It would really make their day if they bumped into me outside somewhere and I'd ask how their swimming competition went, or if they enjoyed the movie their parents were taking them to see. \n\nNow I teach adults, and one of my students looked at me funny once because I mentioned something he'd told me months ago. He said it was pretty cool, that my memory was so good. I told him I can't remember what I ate yesterday but I can remember random things about people.
1	I don't know if it counts as a memory, but I'm short-sighted and can't see a shit without glasses on (I mean, it's not that bad, but definitely wouldn't be able to see face from across corridor), though I "create" my own memory. I can't recognize anyone from afar, but due to one's posture, pause between steps, movement, body language, hand/arm movement, etc, I can instantly recognize them even if they only cross the corner of my eye. I can remember someone's name from elementary school, but if I can't, I simply know who they are because of how they move. Uh, I don't know if it's even moderately understandable, but I hope the meaning came across.
1	Yes.
1	Ironclad.
1	Once drunkenly knocked a friend over moshing and broke his wrist.  Was most drunk but went with them to ER.  We were there for hours and I mostly slept in the waiting room while they chatted to some people who’d also drunkenly injured themselves. I had vague memories when leaving of meeting them.\n\nFew months later I’m in a bar and there are these people are giving my friend the evils from across the room.  Apparently this had been going on for 20 mins or so.  I eventually paid enough attention to them to realise it was the random people from ER.  Between them they’d had no idea why they knew each other and the others had no memory of me at all, I’d barely met them and remembered the faces.\n\nI’m terrible terrible terrible at names but I rarely forget a face... seems as I get older I struggle more to remember from where though. 
1	I have an extremely good memory. I remember crazy details from when I was 2-3 yrs old.
1	I remember stuff I shouldn't, then forget stuff I should. 'Nuff said. 
1	Remembering is deliberate and happens at some specific quiet times of the day or when I find something that I can associate with the past. \n\nI find it hard to remember what happens an hour ago or yesterday. Time flies so fast, and when I remember it takes so much time, so I prefer not getting lost inside my head. 
1	episodic memory is whack, but my semantic memory is very acute
1	I can’t even remember what I ate today but I can recite weird commercials that I saw on tv years ago word for word.
1	I have pretty much a selective memory, if i deem this information important i will remember it for a long time if not i the next day this information is gone.
1	I have very good facial recognition (though I SUCK with names), I can memorize things very easily (phone numbers, birthdays, credit card numbers)...which always seems to surprise people. I memorized about 20 different phone numbers within a few months of starting my job which apparently nobody has ever done before...it wasn’t even conscious. More like a muscle memory thing.\n\nBut yeah, if you asked me what I did all day, I probably wouldn’t remember precisely until I actually thought about it. Mainly cause it doesn’t seem important to me.
1	I can remember exactly where I left a book, tv show, movie, videogame, etc., and just pick it up from there even months later. No need to re-read for details I might've forgotten\n\nI like to roleplay, and I have no problem remembering tiny details, who was doing what, character progression, etc.\n\nI often can't remember people's names, what I ate recently, when people ask me to remember something for them, etc.\n\nIf a person changes their hairstyle, facial hair or drastically changes the way they dress, I won't be able to recognize them right away.\n\nI remember in vivid detail how, at least 10 years ago, I was watching DBZ at a pizza place with some of my friends. It was the Cell Saga and Trunks died. I remember exactly where I was sitting and what pizza I was eating.\n\nI know it was a birthday party, I can't remember who was there or whose birthday party it was. It might've been mine for all I know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCome to think of it, I forget my age sometimes.
1	Photographic to a painful degree (I remember it all in stupid detail — even the things I drink to forget.)\n\nBut fuck a bag of names.\n\n(c:
48	Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.	
27	I can’t relate because I’ve never talked to another human.
1	One day she’s gonna need to learn to just move past stuff without needing to rant about every hang up. I don’t want none of ya drama.

1	True story. 
11	Do you find yourself fabricating few details of a story to make it sound more cool?	Or what's your take on lying?
26	No, I more often make a story worse by trying to remember the exact details.\n\nI don't lie. It seems way too risky.
18	If anything, I’ll leave details out of a story to make it shorter 
18	I suck at telling stories, so I don’t 
5	I’m honest when it matters, but definitely guilty of some harmless white lies here or there
3	I sometimes suck at remembering the specifics of stories. So sometimes I'll tell it how I remember it, then look back and realize that's not what happened. So it's usually unintentional. I don't see a point in lying about a story. I don't feel like I'm trying to impress anyone, which is the only reason I imagine someone would want to add flair to their stories.
2	I'm asinine at storytelling, and either tell details incorrectly or altogether. I keep them short and to the facts I recall exactly, so I'm not quite a liar.
2	I am more likely to rehearse my stories in my head before I tell it to someone.  I've learned to pick out the interesting bits and emphasize them for a bigger reaction.  Really useful yet under rated skill that we should practice. We do crazy shit sometimes and apparently people like to listen to adventure stories. (helps make friends too!)
1	Yeah sometimes i will embellish or hyperbolize some element of the story for to be it more impactful, i won't stray too far from the truth though.
1	I omit details when retelling stories or explaining myself. It's not technically lying, but it is a little dishonest. I don't really lie, and I actually suck at it, but maybe life would be a little easier if I had that ability.
1	Sometimes. No need to attribute everything we do to our personality type :p
10	How aren't you as stereotypes for ISTP?	
27	I'm not into drinking and drugs.  I'm committed in relationships and employment.
18	Cars aren’t really my “thing” of choice to work on/tinker with.\n\nI wasn’t afraid of commitment with the right person - happily married.\n\nI’m an elementary school teacher and I love my job.
25	I’m very in touch with my emotions and I’m not too socially awkward. \n\nAltho I use to be that way but solved both those logically by developing my Fe through trial and error.\n\nalmost like a mechanic working on a car! /s (but also not /s because it is true?)
11	I'm not very much into exploring new things, I prefer to stick to the old stuff.
9	I like snuggles.
7	My personality is not very attractive to women, or at least Fe women.
8	Believe it or not I'm NOT a god, demon, angel, or any other immortal being with supernatural powers and infinite wisdom
4	I've always planned for things before they take place. possibly just out of habit because my parents are planners so I've started just doing things and it's a lot more fulfuilling. travelling to Ireland next month and the only thing planned  is the flight
3	Cars aren't my thing ~~motorbike, however.~~\n\nI'd want to have a committed relationship.\n\nI'm not into drinking or any kind of recreational drugs. Alcoholic drinks breaks me out like a teenager going through puberty. I've got pretty horrid eyebags already and so I'm afraid if I ever do drugs a bit overboard I'd look like something's been dead for 5 days, freshly scooped out of a sewer. Also not into not being in control of myself, and the effect of alcohol & drugs is just that, so. \n\nI've got \~10 close friends and is pretty good (I think?) at keeping in touch with them.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I was the worst at sport during school. I don't do sport anymore, even though I should for my health.\n\nI hate cars (like for real. I always saw them as a nonsense security-wise). I love trains, ships and planes though!\n\nAlso never touched drugs and don't even like alcohol.
3	I work in a traditionally female setting, loved college, and am in a committed relationship 
3	I'm not mechanically inclined at all. \n\nI do love working with my hands, doing handcrafts and coloring, but machines just don't interest me all that much.\n\nI *have* put apart a few, stared at them, realized I have no idea what's going on and put them together-ish, but that whole "ISTPs find it very easy to work with engines and whatnot" bit really doesn't sound like me at all. \n\nI do like puzzles, though. Puzzles and riddles and such. 
2	Cars, really not a fan of those.
1	Sensitive, affectionate, cries a lot, wants lots of hugs and kisses. Gay and trans. 
1	I frankly couldn't give a shit about how a machine works 
28	Do other ISTPs find that they care too much about what others think?	I find that I'm hyper-aware of how others perceive me. For example, I get easily embarrassed when my parents do something weird in public. I always look around to see if anyone is looking and scan their faces for a reaction.  Do other ISTPs experience this? 
38	I’m also hyper aware of how people perceive me, but I don’t really care what people think of me. I’m not gonna change how I act because of someone else’s reaction. 
21	I think it's more of I am hyper-aware of what others are thinking despite being socially retarded.
12	I feel like ISTPs are more prone to social anxiety because we constantly assess our environment for problems and inconsistencies. My mood is dependent on my environment and atmosphere. I enjoy being in socially harmonious environments and if an inconsistency pops up, I will change my behavior for a better result.
10	I used to. But this is not an ISTP thing. 
19	I do, but I attribute that to my social anxiety.
5	Yea kinda. It could be related to being an introvert but also having aux Se so we end up being pretty aware of our surroundings while also having low Fe so we ultimately want ppl to like us.
6	I care a lot about how others see me but I’m not terribly socially aware in the moment so it’s mostly cringing in hindsight or just enjoying what’s available to me. 
3	You are obviously quite young.  I give exactly zero fucks what anyone I don't know things about me anymore.  
4	I used to be. Easiest way to fix that? Stop judging other people. \n\n\nAs a wise brain fried junkie once said “don’t judge people. Because you can’t be free if you judge people.” \n\n\nThe more you look at random people and pass judgments, the more likely you are to expect other people to do the same towards you. When you normalize it for yourself, you subconsciously normalize the idea that other people do it towards you. \n\n\nWhen you spend less time thinking about other people, you’ll naturally expect them to think about you less. It’s a simple way to override your anxieties toward embarrassment. 
3	Yeah, because you are Se, you have to be aware of everything happening around you. No other way around. Se is like a very good hunter, he sees everything, hears everything, smells everything (this is really a big problem, I can smell everything). After Se sees everything, your Ni put links between information parts, so you know what others think about you intuitively, that is also a good hunting skill, it is for making predictions.\n\nBut, after all this, all the information goes to Ti and there you analize and make conclusions. There you decide, whethet you care about it or no. If you care, it is a sign that you are immature. To not care, you have to put your decisions in front of your closest people and force them to accept them. You don't have to be dependent. \n\nSee the thing is that, whatever you do, you eventually will be not right for other people. Haven't you noticed it yet? It is because people don't like changes, their reptile mind does everything to not allow changes. Consider it as a ticket to your freedom.
3	We think we care too much but ironically it's not enough. We use a very immature mind frame (in the context of caring what others think) to measure how much we care
3	I think when we're unhealthy, yeah. \n\nI find that when Im healthy, and I've got some good hobbies/goals, Im taking care of myself and have a couple of good friends, I literally give no craps what people think about me. I dont act like a jerk or anything(most of the time ;)..), but I don't care if people like me or not. I just do my thing and don't think twice. Id say the only exception, when Im healthy, would be for something like training for a new job. Just not wanting to do something stupid or screw something up, especially if other people are affected by/have to go out of their way to fix my mistake.\n\nWhen I get in a rut though or start isolating, I can become very self-conscious and concerned about people liking me. It can actually get kind of paralyzing. I go from being pretty confident and ready-to-go, to completely timid and overthinking everything. Probs inferior Fe doing work, mixed with a bit of the Ti-Ni loop.
2	I doubt most ISTPs care or think twice about what others think about us. We do our thing and don't mind breaking a rule to accomplish something.\n\nHowever, yes I'll notice when someone does or says something that imposes on someone else, especially in a negative way. 
2	I find I care what a few of my very close friends think about me but don't give a fuck what anyone else thinks.
1	I'm very aware of what people think about me but I really couldn't give two shits if they like me or not.
1	Yes, I'm much too aware of how others perceive me or how I think they perceive me. Being aware of your environment and the people in it can be anxiety producing. Sometimes I'm able to get lost in thought while I'm in public and any anxiety completely vanishes because I'm just in deep thought. 
1	no, I dont give a shit what people think of me..BUT I am old and just dont give a fuck about much. 
1	I'm scanning faces most the time, but not really because I care what they think. Just like to look at everything.
1	I thought this was an ENFP trait and part of the reason I like ISTPs so much is I find they care a lot less than other types what others think.
1	I'm hyper aware, but I'm minimally concerned. The practical consequences of people thinking I'm weird are almost totally irrelevant. I track them closely though, in case something might change the calculus (e.g if someone whose perspective can effect my opportunities is watching)
1	Same thing here, but I think its a social anxiety thing. When Im around people I like or comfortable places I don't really care about other people think about me.
1	Not really. Mostly I don't care much about it. I can go out looking not very nice.
1	Yes, it's a consequence of using the Ti/Fe function tandem. And it's even worse with Se/Ni because you sense the atmosphere in the room immediately.
1	I think it’s a matter of Ti-Ni loop on a miniature(or major)scale fuled by an inferior Fe. Then you don’t feel confident in your “normal stack”’s ability to take care of things. So your other shadow functions start to creep in. Our sixth function is called the Senex or “critical parent” and ours is Si which takes in and organizes everything our Se just did and criticizes us for it. Which just fuels the inverted loop, which is to say this is all going on in your head at the same time. \nOn the outside your frozen in place or zoned out or super hyper aware but your all “up in your head” \n\nAt least this is how it was for me. \n\nI learned that(and I’m still learning how to explain how exactly I do it) by using my Ti to control how I use my Fe and then by using my Se and actually paying attention to what the people around me are feeling I can then act in such a way to bring balance to the environmental in and I make sure to listen to my Ni so he’s not left out of the loop.\n\nTL/DR:  Social anxiety = (-Se•Ni)Fe)\n                 Social complexity =(Se•Ni)/(+/-0.xFe)\n                 Social comfort = (Se•Ni)+Fe\n\nEdit: Forgot to add TL/DR
1	Is it the inferior Fe?
1	I used to care a lot since i was always the straight forward guy and did't have much boundaries, i always managed to hurt people feelings without knowing so i was looking to justify myself and dissolve the misunderstanding when i happened to hurt someone's feeling, because it was never my intent in the first place and i always wanted to be liked at that time. \n\nNow i try to refrain myself to say something if i might hurt someone or put him/her in a bad spot and if it does happen well too bad i will deem you too sensitive and move on.
5	This happened to me today... on iSTJ subreddit	So, I am an ISTP. I recently found out about it and read that this type loves doing things with hands, practical stuff etc. I instantly looked back at my education - 8 years of theoretical subjects (4 yrs bachelor and 2 MA degrees), that I regret very much and I wish I'd studied subjects like biology, air traffic control or something really practical. So, when I read ISTP description, it all made sense and I realized why I felt that way. I got extremely sad about the choices I made and wanted to complain about this with my fellow ISTPs, but because I just became familiar with 16personality test, I accidentally ended up posting in ISTJ thread, claiming I was ISTJ and was hoping for their support and described my feelings in details in a very heart breaking thread. \nThey were incredibly supportive, nice and gave me great advice.\n\nand now I realized I am actually an ISTP :D 
3	Don’t feel bad about your education. \nEducation is never wasted. \n\nFind what it is that makes you happy. 
8	https://wordpress.com/
2	My personality saddles ISTP and INTP, though I feel more connected to the Sensing trait. I enjoy the process of thought and theory but crave the action of using that knowledge practically. It's not uncommon to have two results that are fairly close. 
2	Ok.
1	Are your results fairly close to the center of the line?
1	Have any of you worked in (military, gov't, or law enforcement) intelligence?	I'm considering leaving my shitty ass job to pursue this career. 
7	Military Intelligence. U.S. Army for 4 years. Worked at a particular "Security Agency" on Fort Meade, Maryland pretty much the whole time. \n\nMy recommendation is stay away from Intel jobs that might turn out to be monotonous. For me, I did Morse Code. Training was sitting behind a computer for 6 or 7 hours of your day listening to beeps. I wanted to blow my brains out.\n\nLuckily, my unit in Maryland didn't need anymore "ditty boppers" and offered me an opportunity to cross train into a decryption job. That was pretty alright. I didn't get the MOS designation, but got to do the work. Which was more fun than beeps.\n\nWorst part of the military though, for me anyway, is feeling like you don't own your life. You can't just quit whenever you want. If you go Intel, you're in for at least 4 years. And if you want out and try to force the military's hand in booting you out, you'll likely end up with a Dishonorable or Other Than Honorable Discharge. Which can possibly affect future job opportunities.\n\nIf you're certain you can be in uniform and serve your whole contract, then good on you and good luck to you!
4	I cannot confirm or deny.
1	Signal Support Systems Specialist aka Telecommunications 5 years US Army.\n\nThe thing I liked about my job was that it was a combination of office work and field work. When I got tired of being in the office all day, I could go out and work in the vehicles and do some hands on installation.\n\nSimply put my responsibility was to operate, maintain, troubleshoot the Army’s telecommunication equipment and to be able to teach others how to use it and basic troubleshooting steps.\n\nI was always good at my job and when we deployed I was the best at my job in the battalion. As far as being a soldier I’d say I was ok. Sure I could shoot but all that left right left yes sir no drill sergeant bit wasn’t really my style.\n\nI still enjoyed my time though some of it sucked. Before you make a decision make sure you know what you’re getting yourself into. You may be put in a situation where you have to kill or may be killed for the purpose of the military is to go to war. Never forget that.
3	An electronics engineer or a computer engineer/programmer?	I have narrowed down my choices to these two as to what I should choose when I go to college. Speaking from the perspective of MBTI and also personal opinion, what do you think an ISTP would enjoy more? \n\nI'm good at programming but not in coming up with ideas myself. If I'm given something to do, or if I have someone with me who can provide my brain with ideas, I'm great at programming. I've spent my entire life with computers so I can say I'll be a bit interested in computer engineering.\n\nAs for electronics and communications engineer, I don't like circuits, semiconductors, transistors and all that yitty yatta. But I do find it easy. I find everything easy tbh. And it is something I can manage. I've held this option because being a programmer would be boring, sitting at the office for hours. An engineer with hands on something to do sounds more fun.
4	As someone who currently works in software, I would go the route of not sitting in a cubicle all day.
3	>I've held this option because being a programmer would be boring, sitting at the office for hours. An engineer with hands on something to do sounds more fun.\n\nI think you have your answer. Do what's fun, and the rest will take care of itself :)
1	Microcontroller programming and robotics sounds like the perfect field for you.
13	Developing auxiliary Se	I'm a 14 y/o kid stuck between ISTP and INTP thus I'm posting this on both subreddits and because I've heard that the auxiliary function develops around this age I'm going to try using this method to type myself.\n\nHow do you think Se is when developing? What were you like when your Se is developing? \n\nWhat should I look out for that signifies the development of Se?\n\nThanks if you helped\n\n
14	Depends on the kind of person you are. You might get really into eastern philosophy and become more centered in the present moment. You might get really into sports or the gym and use the physical exertion to get out of your head. You might get really into drugs for the sensory experience of altered consciousness (though if this is your path, definitely wait until you are significantly older and stick to soft drugs like weed and psychs). You might do something entirely different. \n\nI think the development of Se is mainly about being in the present and acting on instinct instead of overthinking everything. 
7	I think of being "Se" as taking something that is philosophical or theoretical or highly technical, and finding ways to put it to practical use. That might be using (as mentioned in the comment by repotoast) Eastern Philosophy in a practical way, like applying meditation to your life. I meditated as a young person.  \n\n\nIt could also mean picking up a fairly deep or detail-oriented hobby. Leathercrafting, woodworking or whittling (I whittled as a young person too), learning small engine repair (not hard, though fairly technical), or delving into just about any science and studying how you use that science to study things in real life. Biology, chemistry, dendrology, volcanology, and so on. Getting out there and collecting bug samples, getting a chemistry set, studying trees and tree rings, picking up rocks from the base of your local dormant volcano.   \n\n\nThose are very "Se" things to do. So if your interest is in developing that side of you, those are my recommendations.   \n\n\nAs an option, you may also look up "careers for ISTPs" in a Google search. You'll likely see that applicable sciences and technology are kind of our thing. You could use those ideas as a springboard for your own adult endeavors. Get started right in college and have an amazing career that (maybe) you'll continue to find amazing and surprising for the rest of your life.  \n\n\nGood luck with your efforts! :)
2	Fighting games, quick reaction time, up beat music like EDM or metal, suddenly feeling like your surroundings become highly atmospheric etc. In other words, a lot of us develop a strong desire for external input, I'd say especially during these years because our dopamine axons aren't fully developed at that stage. In other words. Anything with external input, whether or not it reinforces your Ni perception of the world\n\nMost of us are in tune with regions of the brain that can easily identify objects in the environment so we are pretty good at recognizing and reacting to details in our external world because of this
2	Se is all about the five senses attuned to the present moment.\n\nSight - Photography (Travel)\n\nTaste and Smell - Cooking (Visit Authentic/Local Restaurants)\n\nTouch - Sex, Martial Arts, Dancing, Mechanical Work\n\nHearing - Music (Learn an Instrument)\n\nI suggest you find connections with people who are good at whatever you may choose to practice. Experts, coaches, friends whose main hobbies are any of these things, etc.\n\nIt may take some years for you to develop a kinesthetic or muscle memory, but the process will be worth it. Eventually, everything will just be second nature to you.\n\nI was in ballet class for 6 years. I didn't have any interest or prior experience when I joined. I just thought it was cool. \n\n&#x200B;
2	In my early to mid teens I became quite the little daredevil and could not get enough of outdoors activities.  This was all long before I ever knew about MBTI and reflecting on that period of time solidified my guess that I am ISTP when I was still trying to figure that out.\n\nI found that I loved snorkeling in particular, I took photos (back in the days of film) of the wildlife I saw and identified them when I got home.  I still have this same passion but now, at 30, it has developed into going for hikes with a massive telephoto lens.\n\nI am also fairly kinesthetically gifted, I can easily learn and proficiently perform sports/physical activities.  I have actually had people make comments to me about this, I make things look easy and effortless.
1	Martial arts, qigong, fencing, NOT dancing(you need some pressure to be in this particular moment), shooting, any hands-on arts..
1	Or maybe everything you've heard about the function stack is wrong. Who said the dominant and auxiliary had to alternate attitudes?  \nI don't believe MBTI's 16 types for one second. I've read Psychological Types and Carl Jung never mentioned it once. Instead there would be 32 types - 4 types for each dominant function.  \nAnd this would mean that you are not "in a loop" if you are Ti Ni. It's not like Ti Se doesn't have problems from repressing Ni, it's just a different set of problems to repressing Se.  \nHowever, if you are going to type yourself according to the letters then you might get INTP or INTJ on the tests. I'm sure if you are Ti Ni you would fit in fine over at the INTP subreddit because a lot of them are more Ti Ni than Ti Ne.  \nIf you want an example of Ti Ni vs Ti Ne just have a look at Elon Musk and compare him to someone like Jordan Peterson. Both get typed as INTP, though Elon also gets typed as INTJ because he clearly has Ni, but really he is an Ti Ni ISTP, and that's what confuses people. Ironically Elon fits the ISTP stereotype quite well.
50	I’m turning 30 next week, and this has been my (ISTP) life.	I have never shared this timeline with anybody in reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 1 to 4: Raised happily and grew up in a foster family. I didn’t know I had biological parents coming home eventually and were going to take me (through sent letters).\n\nAge 5 to 12: Primary school. Living with biological parents who started the family on survival: basically raising livestocks. My ISTJ father, a farmer, made me his partner in almost everything. Learned hands-on skills and practical arts (we made our own dining tables, etc). Suffered first existential crises for so long (separation from a happy atmosphere in a foster family) and questioned why I had to work so hard as a child. I was also pressured to top classes in school. Mom, an unhealthy ENTP, succumbed into her narcissistic tendencies. T-type parents didn't value emotions.\n\nAge 13 to 16: Highschool. Was on top of everyone in class and deeply respected and admired by everyone. Intelligence and recognition isolated me from everyone. Boredom over familiarity. More existential crises. Deep motivation to leave hometown.\n\nAge 17 to 21: Moved to a city down south. Darkest ages. Fraternity. Drugs, alcohol. Wrong choice of bachelor’s degree (humanities, Uni decided it for me). Flunked several subjects, extended a year. Involved as a third party in a relationship.\n\nAge 22 to 23: Suicidal years. Worked as a broker. Quit after 6 months. Worked as a file assistant for $2/hr. Sharing a boarding house with 3 families. Lost ENFP sister joined me.\n\nAge 24 to 25: Worked online (Marketing assistant). 4x higher salary. Moved to a new apartment. Gained huge confidence. Sent sister to university. Bought a camera. Became great at it, and earned more.\n\nAge 26: Suffered gender dysphoria (childhood issues hitting again). Ex dumped me after knowing I wanted to transition. Traveled solo for 2 months. Started taking hormones.\n\nAge 27 to Age 29: Started living as a transwoman. Entered a new relationship. Moved to a tolerant city. Tried MBA, quit after 3 months. Suffered great anxiety after losing job. Ex died six months I moved. Grieved for 1 year with alcohol (unaware it was grief). Two short relationships after. Traveled to two countries. Spent all savings to zero. Learned MBTI and Enneagram.\n\nOnly 5 months ago, I was able to get back on track. A miracle, really. New job (Data Analyst). Back on photography (bought lenses and batteries). Traveled thrice since. Booked flights to reconnect with old friends and my family. Checking parents’ properties at the moment. Securing parents’ health insurance. Still on hormones. Ghosted for 2 weeks by INTP bf. Thinking of quitting dating life forever.\n\nHOLY FUCK. I’m teary eyed  while reading this and for having survived all these. Still I don't know what I feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow's your life been, fellow ISTPs?
14	No where near as rough as yours, but rougher than most that I've encountered in the Western world. Turning 22 in April.\n\nStay strong and use your support system
5	As a 29 year old woman who grew up in a "city" (not like big city but always over 200,000 and now god only knows)  I didn't even know there was a name for people that were gay or transitioning because it never occurred to me.  Until 7th grade when the science teacher spent an entire class period explaining she was gay and I just looked at the clock, "holy shit she's gonna take up the whole period!  No homework!"\n\nIn high school multiple people were transitioning.  When I went to college was the first time I ever heard someone call something "gay."  Learned I lived in a bit of a bubble as far as people's attitudes and acceptance.  \n\nMy point is that from limited knowledge transitioning is difficult enough I would imagine living in the Deep South could really make that a doozy.\n\nOk now this comment seems stupid and unrelated and poorly written but I'm not gonna delete I'm just gonna post....and obviously being gay is different from transitioning im not trying to use them interchangeably but yeah kinda seems like it.
3	that has nothing to do with being ISTP..sorry you had to go through all of this but I dont see how it matters that you are one personality over another
2	Dang, us ISTPs are a bit everywhere to be honest. Especially you though, sounds like you've been on a real adventure so far, hopefully the hardships you've gone through have made you really tuff. If it haven't yet, it will. My story is barely a single fraction as hard as yours\n\nI'm 16,\n\n2-4 My earliest memory was actually from when I was 2 years old and had recently moved to Egypt. My dying grandmother was singing a song in arabic, trying to soothe me to sleep. My father then took me to the middle of a desert in Kairo and tried to leave me there. I was later found by my cousins from a desert village. I was then returned to my mother\n\n4-6 I moved back to Sweden where I was born. It didn't take a lot of time to readjust. I started going to preschool though and that was hell the first few years\n\n7-12 Experiences Ti-Ni loop most of my childhood as I became obsessed with knowing the truth about everything, then got an existential crisis. This wasn't exactly healthy as a child.\n\n12-14 Started appreciating life through a more realistic perspective and became more invested in philosophy as I reinvented my perspective which eliminated the existential dread \n\n14-16 Spent so much time Ti-Ni looping I became core 1. Owned my own bussiness for a short while before i became too bored with it and closed it down. Recently found out about MBTI and just got out the loop. Now strongly driven by my philosophies, I am now crunching the last period of studies before Christmas. I'm heading right back into the studies now in fact\n\nAlso I have genetically mutated brain so I can get an idea of how hard it must be to be gender dysphoric, however I can never truly understand how it feels to lose someone so close. Good luck in future endeavours fellow ISTP, go strong 
2	Welp, we are both data analysts. That's the extent of our commonalities.
2	If you found help from MBTI/Ennegram then you might like the rest of Carl Jung's ideas. He's hard to understand but Jordan Peterson really explains them well. He has a [number of lectures](https://youtu.be/I8Xc2_FtpHI?list=PL22J3VaeABQAT-0aSPq-OKOpQlHyR4k5h), albeit rambly, on how to give meaning and purpose to your life.  \n
1	I remember your last post about the same. That time you were lost. I am happy you are back on track.
1	Currently in my own suicidal years, 21-25 so far. lets hope i pmake it past 26. \n\nI'm also a trans ISTP (ftm) this is really cool to see another trans istp!!
1	My life was decent but pretty boring. I was always shy and indecisive.\n\nIt wasn’t until my mid-20s when I lost some family members, got thrown into the ringer, had to make some hard decisions, and finally realized that I’m only going to be successful if I trust myself. A year ago I started a dope career.
0	I think I got a quick depression cuz of your post. \n\n1. I warn you about xNTPs. \n2. Don't think about the past, as soon as I live my life like there was no past I'm the happiest.\n3. You don't need hormone don't do that to your body. Because of intemperance in different sex styles you have that feelings.
2	Typing others	So, if you do get over your annoyance of guessing other people's types and delve into this post, I hope you can answer this.\n\nDo you find it easy to type other ISTPs? Like from a distance or a bud who hasn't taken a test yet. I find I'm never wrong and it's like I just know that a certain person is one of our own. Any thoughts?
2	Harder to type other ISTP's much easier to type any type I've dealt with in the past. For example: I know several INFJ's and ENFP's pretty well and so when I meet a new INFJ or ENFP I can tell rather quickly. 
1	I imagine, because of our ISTP traits, we might be some of the few that are able to type other people fairly well. We're observant and like the to delve into the "sciences" even if they're a little more theoretical, like psychology. And if there are a set of rules we can follow, or in this case traits in other people that we can see with our eyes and hear with our ears (as in how they speak, and what they say) and match them to the things we know or have read, those application processes is all part of what we do. We study, learn, and apply. We just don't tend to do the whole "feelings" thing associated with, say, psychiatry or emotional counseling stuff, though some of us on the border of T and F might be okay with the whole empathy/sympathy thing.
1	Yeah, I recently typed a girl ISTP, she is a bartender, she is very calm but extremely observant, she is very confident with her body and all the things arround her (you feel that how she touches everything and walks). She is very laid back. She doesnt talk much, but extremely hot (yeah we are hot😂).\n\nAnd yeah I am sure she is an ISTP. Had a little conversation with her and to the question "do you like different tools?" She answered "yes, especially weapons, I have orgasm of the shotgun reload sound".
25	LPT: Interacting with Fi users	When you are arguing with/persuading somebody and, after you have repeatedly logically laid out your reasoning, you still hear things like: "I don't feel like it", "I don't care", or even just "No", that's a telltale sign you are dealing with a strong Fi user. Now in those cases, the wrong thing to do would be to double down on your logic, and continue saying something like "You should do so and so because A is more efficient than B and it's better than C so A is the best choice." No, once you realize you are dealing with someone with strong Fi you need to switch to a value-based argument, by saying things like "You're a BETTER PERSON if you do A", or, "Wow, if you really go through with so and so then you're just the WORST". It sounds silly to us and that's why it took me such a long time (going insane) to realize, but in my experience you get a much better engagement out of Fi people that way. Remember this and next time you end up in a heated discussion with your INFP/ENFP/ISFP you'll end up just a little less crazy ;).
13	Or just let them do it anyways and have them learn the hard way.
7	It's easy to for me to know when someone is a Fi-user. And when I'm confronted by the need to tell them what to do, I shift my statements into questions... and let them figure out what they actually need to hear (from themselves). 
4	I feel it's harder to debate with high Te users because they distort logic and then resort to Fi values to back up their erroneous claims.
1	I would have thought when it comes to Fi users that they would exit the realm of feeling and use their Te when it comes to debates of logical reasoning. And then in that case they would probably be a sheep and accept everything you say, still considering whether their Fi feels like it is a good idea or not.
10	ENFP baffled about ISTP	Enfp female here. Dated an ISTP male for half a year, just wanted to question why our relationship died since istp left me with no answers.\n\nEverything was AMAZING besides a couple disagreements due to different viewpoints on life & long term goals since I graduate a year before him. We were obsessed with eachother completely but I would also happily give space when asked. In the last leg of our relationship, a total shift occurred. I would invite him over or out to dates and it was all denied. Phone calls and texts started dying in a ditch too. He asked for a break and I said okay, but then almost an entire month passed by so I asked if it would be better for us to split and got an immediate yes. \n\nIve asked twice in person before if there was something I did wrong but was deflected and told to never talk to him again each time, so im at a complete loss and am going to indefinitely leave him alone for good. I know cutting people off is common with ISTPs, but if everything was fine and previous conflicts were resolved, wtf happened? Im completely and utterly baffled. \n\nNotes: I was his first girlfriend, hes only close to 1 person in his life & I was the second. Often believed & said that nobody mattered but us. F[17] M[16]. 
5	I don’t know what happened but what ever it was I’m not sure how much fixing is possible. Once a relationship gets to a point there’s no turning back. \n\nI’ve dated two ENFPs. One we didn’t workout for various reasons the other is my current girlfriend of 3+ years. Keep that in mind if you meet other ISTPs, not everyone is the same (even with similar personalities).
3	He felt trapped and didn't connect with you on some level, whether it be sexual or emotional. He probably could sense you were into him a lot by your actions and became disinterested with the absence of mystery. I wouldn't say this is exclusive to ISTP though, but I myself understand this behavior and have done similar things. In the future I recommend letting the ppl you date come to you. If they don't, then fuck em. Move on. But I wouldn't lose confidence over this one guy. Doesn't mean you're not girlfriend material, just means you probably made a few wrong turns in the process of courting this fool. 
3	I was with an ENFP for almost a year and a half. Eventually she just became too much of an energy drain and I ended it. It sounds like this is what happened here. \n\nIt's not you it's us.
3	I believe that any personality starting with E would be exhausting to me and I'd feel trapped and choked. This has happened to me before. I didn't necessarily felt that way during the relationship, I was very much in love, but looking back from now, that was 100% the case. I just hadn't heard about 16personalities then, haha :D it is easier to articulate my feelings now, as I've read a lot about my own personality and found tons of things I can relate to. 
3	He has figured you out (how you think and operate) and nothing seems to excite him anymore. There's boredom to familiarity as the pressure of long-term connection starts to factor in. Don't reconnect with him. He only cares about his pleasures and has no interest in knowing the "full you" further. 
2	This has happend to me allot, all great and in love and then I abruptly loose interest and have to end it, if I don't I'll either end up cheating or become deppressed. 
2	When I was younger I'd lose interest in people abruptly as well as my affection (before) I think was dependent on the thrill and excitement of a relationship. Everything just gets boring after a while and I didn't know what was happening then so when I end relationships, I wouldn't know how to explain it so I either ghost them or harshly ask them to leave me alone. I thought this was normal and common so it wasn't a big deal for me then.
2	I was all set to give you a response and then I got to the end.\n\nYou both are young and don’t really know what you want yet — move on and gain experience.  If it’s meant to happen it’ll happen.\n
1	Hey, I'm watching Ellen DeGeneres game of games, you guys are sadistic lol
3	Lost interest in my job	Hi;\n\nI don't know how to explain what I am feeling, I have lost my interest in my job that I love. I am a Continuous Integration/Delievery guy in a Software Development agency with almost 4 years of working life.\n\nIt's been a month since I no longer want to do anything or talk to anyone. My position involves lots of talking and communication between all my colleagues and myself being this "un-interested" is causing me trouble emotionally.\n\nIs there anyway to somehow "re-charge" interest ? I've taken days off with the hopes that I'll return to normal, without success?
8	I can't last in a job for 4 years. Consider some upgrade. That feeling is telling you that you have probably exhausted all motivations to carry on. You need a new challenge. Familiarity is sickening and makes ISTPs dull.
5	You might not "love" it anymore. You might like it, and appreciate the experience it gave you. But maybe you're ready to move on.\n\nI'm 35. There has not been a job in the past that I've been able to rekindle interest in. Once I was ready to move on, all I could do was move on. \n\nIf you enjoy the work, you might try a different company doing the same thing. Alternatively, if you like your company, you might try working toward a slightly different job, related but different. That might spice things up enough for you.\n\nCurrently, I'm in I.T. It's the longest job I've willingly held at just over 2 years. Starting to get boring, but to spice it up I'm considering transitioning from a Help Desk role to a networking role within the same company. \n\nMake or use work connections in other departments and maybe you can shift over, either lateral or a slight up-step.
2	What do you do when you're not at work?
0	Are you brainless? Just change jobs?!
6	What are some ways to improve Ti?	
10	Think of a way to improve your Fe. That'll give your brain something to Ti forever, lol\n\nInfinite loop = infinite Ti 'exp' = infinite Ti growth
6	Read more
2	Learning new things seems like a good start. 
2	Make a multireddit that includes subreddits like eli5, outoftheloop, or askscience
1	Improving Ti for me is making better and more refined conclusions. I work as a data analyst, so I am working on my Ti exponentially everyday. Feeding Ti is different. It's just about learning as many things and as in depth as possible, without needing to reach conclusions. 
1	Well, normally I’m pretty good at explaining development of the different functions. As I’ve put a lot of effort into developing weaker functions. But Ti has always been my top function and I’ve never felt the need to put extra effort into it. I’m not even sure how to go about boosting introverted thinking lol. \n\n\nI’d guess running thought experiments could help. Wether it’s political, religious, financial, whatever. Find something sink your brain teeth into. I think it’s mostly about just thinking productively and not having idle thoughts. 
1	think of the possibilities. 
7	Best part-time jobs for ISTPs	Hey guys, I am trying to find an interesting part-time job in the evening, because I have my main job in the morning. Any advices?
11	I worked for a smaller privately owned gym for a while, it was nice in the evenings because I could get my workout in and get paid and then unwind. 
8	Wood working 
7	If you’ve got the skills, freelance coding / web stuff (especially frontend) can be very interesting and also has palatable hours
4	I got a job at a large wine and spirits store. I stock the shelves, it's mostly solo work. I only tangentially work with others and I help customers find wine or answer their questions. \n\nFringe benefit is I get to taste wine/liqour after the store does their tastings or seminars. I got to try Hennessy VSOP, XO, and Paradis Impérial last week. The Paradis Impérial is $2600 for a 750ml a bottle. \n\nIt's a pretty fun low-key job. It sucks that I'm working 6:30am-3pm then 4-9pm on days I work the part time job though.
5	Barbacking or washing dishes has always been my go to. It’s mindless work and I can usually keep to myself and just think about shit or listen to podcasts or something.
4	I found delivery to be nice. All you do is drive, and social interaction is kept to a mininum. Plus you generally make good tips if you're fast.
3	If you just want money: delivery, if you can.  I was able to grab $20/hour off $3-4 tips.\n\nIf you want interesting: that dude who wipes down the loads at the bath house.  
3	I've been in AV for a decade, super complimentary. Installs is normal work hours, but service could be scheduled around a full time job. 
4	I worked overnight retail and I liked it
1	Coding. :)
1	I worked as a bicycle tour guide last summer and omg I loved it <3 can't wait to go back the next season.\nI could control my working days and hours, I loved working with something not abstract, I enjoyed doing bookings and working in the system.\n\nEven though I am very introverted and I begun as a shy guide, soon I managed to open up in front of the customers. I got plenty of tips every time.\n\nMust note though that I needed a decent nap after almost every tour, it was exhausting not only physically but also emotionally. But I loved this feeling of tiredness and then recovery!
40	How many other ISTP's work on their own vehicles?	
18	The ability to work with my hands is probably the biggest ISTP trait I lack. It’s the one thing that used to have me doubt my “type.”  \n\nI can build spreadsheets and queries, but working with cars/wood/metal/electrical stuff is beyond my area of expertise. \n\nI envy all of you with mechanical know-how and the ability to put it into practice. 
9	This is my slightly modified daily driver. Does anyone else do pretty much everything related to vehicle maintenance and mods on their own stuff? 
10	If I wasn't living in an apartment I would do much more my self. Used to be a mechanic.
5	I maintain my bicycle, if that counts. The only parts I haven't replaced yet are the frame and the front fork. Oh, and the rear rack, simply because I haven't found any that would be an upgrade. 
3	Been wanting to learn and do a lot more 
3	Definitely base all vehicle purchases on the percentage of work I can do myself on the car. Old Volvo's have become my area of expertise.
3	Yup, also am a mechanic
2	I dont
2	I do some work on my own. I replaced the AC compressor in my truck for instance, but I still take stuff to the mechanic when I don't have time or it's an especially involved issue.
2	When I had vehicles that were older and required maintenance, I would do most stuff. I now own a new truck so no need anymore, and I get free service from the dealership. I enjoyed doing oil changes and such though.
2	Cars, no. Computers... all the time. I couldn't imagine paying anyone to do anything to my PC. 
2	The 6.7L power stroke dually! You got yourself a fucking tank bro! With your all your bed accessories it's pretty much a mobile shop that you can crush the snow with those skinny i-Pike tires. It looks badass dude!\n\nI modded the hell out of my '07 VW Rabbit. New intake and header, ECU, exhaust kit, performance clutch, short shifter, wheels and tires, lowering springs, and floor mats. I can't afford new mods anymore so I stick to the boring shit like replacement parts now lol
2	Sitting on my sofa next to my motorcycle farring as I type. Its getting upgraded turn signals from the comfort of the sectional. 38/istp/f 
1	Not by choice. But I'm generally capable, and the savings on labor is often too much to *not* work on my vehicles. \n\nThis summer I replaced the evaporator core in my car, that involved taking the entire dash out. More recently I put new ABS sensors in my van. But now that it's sub freezing here and I don't have a heated garage, I may have to send repairs to the shop until spring.
1	I'm a mechanic.  I work on my own vehicle and everyone else's all day, every day.
1	Yes but my dad was in service/fleet mgmt and I worked at dealerships in college as a porter and service helper.  Need to do an oil change and replace a fog light bulb (that requires front bumper removal) sometime this week before it gets too damn cold.
1	just dropped off a replacement engine purchased from a junk yard at a machine shop this morning actually, somehow the current engine's block formed cracks between the cylinder heads which the guys at the engine shop hadn't seen before. 96 suzuki sidekick with a g16a that I'm inheriting as stepdad didn't want to deal with pulling the engine and rebuilding it again after the last engine rebuilder fucked it up ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
1	Went through all sort of cars.
1	Yeah I'm a massive gear head. I turn all of my own wrenches, build motors, do paint and body work, welding/fabricating, etc. \n\nI love tracking motorcycles https://i.imgur.com/2OUeWZ3.jpg\n\nRacing cars in 24Hours of Lemons https://i.imgur.com/pAuM3EE.jpg\n\nFixing up old stuff https://i.imgur.com/NF3b74V.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4NJMV9b.jpg\n

1	Aircraft, motorcycles, vehicles, generators and the occasional golf cart or airboat.
25	This was funny	[Youre an istp if...](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjc2aZceYvA)
22	I hate videos, I'd rather just read, since I can read faster and videos seem inefficient by comparison. But I gave this one a shot and many LOLs were had.
7	Fuck videos, can't skim and scan or whatever the fuck
2	I'm also usually reluctant to watch videos, at least not all the way through, but I gave it a shot. The driving / walking in public nailed me. I hate when people don't know how to move around in the real world, or how to make room for others when they're being ridiculously slow and obnoxiously in the way. Though, I don't care about blinkers as much as I care about someone going (at least) the posted speed limit, and getting out of the way (when possible) if faster drivers are coming up behind them. That should just be common courtesy. 
2	ISTPs, what do you think about.	Hey! Intj here. Just wondering, what do you ISTPs spend most of your time thinking about? \nI realize this is too general of a question, but I'm looking for extensive answers.
14	When I am occupied, I am consistently thinking functionally and spatially. I like to know where I am, what my surroundings are, where my exits are. As well I’m focused on what I’m doing. At work, most of my thoughts are going to be about work. Things to do, things I’ve done, projects I’m waiting to hear back on, whatever. Unless I’m on Reddit that is. \n\n\nIf I’m unoccupied, like sitting st home watching tv, I’m thinking about personal shit. Wether it be struggles I’m having, a relationship I’m building, goals I’m working towards, goals I’m failing on and need get my shit together, etc. \n\n\nI rarely have a blank mind and rarely have idle thought. Which is why I like to smoke weed after work. Since I’m up at 6 am and work 11 hour days, I’m doing productive/functional thought the vast majority of my day. When I get home, I like to turn that off and go creative. Think about dumb shit that doesn’t matter. Thought experiments into life/politics/finance/etc., a hobby I like, boobs, clay sculptures, anything really. Just the random shit I don’t have time to think about when I’m busy. 
7	I spend a lot of time actively and subconsciously thinking about things I don't understand. Nothing makes me as uncomfortable as not understanding something.\n\nIt could be a recent interaction with someone: why did that go the way it did? It could be my feelings about something, why is it that I feel this way, what's the underlying reason? It can be enormous things like, how can the world function with so many religions, etc. \n\nI wouldn't say I'm pompous enough to say I always figure everything out. But I work on it until I come up with a plausible/logical explanation that satisfies my need to "not be confused". Then I can move on to something else.\n
5	Whatever. Replay conversations in my mind and think about different things both parties could have said, how I can better protect my chickens from hawks or any other issue I may have, the future, weighing the pros and cons of starting a business, how to be a better sibling, an interesting concept, why something didn't work and what I could do to make it work. I don't listen to music so thinking is how I pass time. Some time ago I thought when I imaged things I felt the back of my brain working more and saw it there, the optical nerve js back there so that supports that, random stuff likr thay. 
2	Currently when I'm at work I think about all the things I would rather be doing than working. It's about 90% hiking in a forest and 10% eating the chips I have in my cabinet at home.\n\nOtherwise if I think about it, I do mostly think about what I am going to do in the next few hours/days. Sometimes I also daydream stories but I'm not necessarily in them. Almost like making up a movie in my mind. Sometimes I'll have a question pop into to my head that I might think about for a few minutes until I can either look up the answer or I come up with a good solution. (Ranging from 'Is this vegetable in season?' to 'Why do I keep having nightmares about horses?'). Mostly I just think about the task on hand. 
2	Boobs.\nJust kidding, I mostly think about how to make something work. How to adjust something in a best possible way. It could be relationships, moneymaking, hobbies, health (like qigong, yoga shit like that). Anything you can imagine. JUST HOW TO MAKE IT WORK EFFICIENTLY.
1	Usually, wondering about how I'll achieve success, how long it'll take to get there, analyzing the steps I might need to take to get there, wondering what experience I'll need or what education I'll need to get there. This is usually accompanied with thoughts about upcoming bills, and thinking about how I can arrange my finances to get to the next stepping stone.\n\nWhen I'm not considering how I'll achieve success, I'm thinking about the mysteries of the universe, the theories surrounding certain mysteries, and wondering how I could practically test those theories by physical means. Devising possible experimental instruments for the testing process.\n\nIn another, alternative life, I probably could have been a scientist of some sort, physicist or chemist or inventor, probably mostly working my scientific hobbies out of my garage. That could have been fun. But it is what it is.\n\nI'm currently in I.T. without any educational history in I.T. I have minor experience from over a decade ago, but I lucked out in getting this job. Knew someone who knew someone. That said, with 2+ years experience in I.T. now, might as well consider continuing education. Networking classes and certs. Microsoft certs. Relearning Unix. Maybe look into some White Hat classes or programs. \n\nI'm 35, but you're never to old to learn something new that can benefit you or at least teach you something new. I consider myself a life learner for the most part. I enjoy learning even if I don't like the "school" format.
1	Questions, just allot of bloody questions.
8	Getting an ISTP to socialize is like pulling teeth?	I'm familiar with istp's preference to be left alone to their devices so I reach out every so often to plan something I can do with them one on one.\n\nI've known an istp for a few years now and it's been frustrating to plan something simple like a lunch or dinner lately as their work is currently at it's busiest time of year. Timing isn't great but it is what it is. \n\nThe last few times I've contacted them didn't pan out and it's been disheartening. We talked about it briefly and they were apologetic about it and I understand.\n\nIts been a few months and I have things I'd like to discuss with them specifically and it's frustrating to wait until their schedule frees up. We were suppose to plan a trip so I needed to get some time frames from them, but my work schedule has now filled up so it sounded like I shouldn't have had my hopes up to begin with.\n\nI know they care and this will come and pass after the busy period when they have a bit more time available, but it doesn't change the fact that for some moments, it feels really one sided. \n\nFor the istps, how are you when dealing with friends who are looking to make plans? Do you reach out yourself? Make counter offers if the first plans don't work? Any advice how to deal with an istp who is focused on something else?\n\n
14	if you are important to this person they will make the time for you. Use this information how you see fit..or get the hint. ISTP woman here and if there is something or someone I want to see I will make the time. maybe they dont want to go on a trip with you and tryin to get out of it?
7	If it’s the busy time at my work I expect people I’ve already told this information to understand that. Expecting me to socialize when I’m busy would be hectic at best and annoying at worst. \n\nI’d tell you if I wasn’t interested in going on a trip with you. But I’d want to wait until I wasn’t busy to plan this trip. \n\nBest thing to do is just wait and tell them to get back to you when they have time. \n\nIf this person doesn’t get back to you - send a polite reminder. If they *still* don’t get back to you, then that’s just rude (and has nothing to do with being an ISTP) and you should take it as a sign. 
6	Plans are our kryptonite. Plans are for suckers. Future guidelines and intentions are more our style.\n\nYou and your insistence on a plan are as annoying to us as he is to you. Sounds to me like you would both be better off out of each other’s lives.\n\nJust today I was talking to my isfj wife. I need to drop the car off at the mechanic tomorrow and will need a ride home. I’m flexible. I can drop it off whenever. The mechanic won’t get to it for a day anyway. She needs an exact time in order to function. I had to set an exact time in order for her to get any sleep and stop stressing.\n\nInstead of planning to meet, just do it spontaneously. Drop in. Or call and ask to meet in 1 hour.\n\nAs an istp that is what I prefer. Planning is just a headache.
2	Dont try and "plan" something. Just ask if you can come over to their place with your favorite beer/wine after work and kick back and talk for a while. 
2	It depends who you are in my life, and what fulfilment that activity will add to my life. If it's just basic plan for socialisation's sake or maintenance, I wouldn't be so invested (unless I really miss you and need your insight). If not, I'll just probably nod and say "We'll see", and then forget it until I'm confronted again and dragged to the activity.\n\nI have an INFP friend who means a lot to me, so I plan my year making sure I'll get to see her (booking flights and saving up for my time with her). As for other friends, I'm like a "come-what-may" person around.
1	I hate to say it but they don't want to make time. I guarantee it probably won't ever work out. 
1	I'm not good in organizing and making plans but if a friend come with a proposal that fits in my agenda then I usually go for it, unless I really don't want to. You should ask him when he would be available to have a lunch and discuss about your trip and let him come with a proposal instead.   
1	Please stop using the plural pronouns when you're talking about one person.
8	Female high-schooler who would appreciate advice about joining the military.	I read a post a few days ago about a 19 year old who wanted to join the Coast Guard, and while it might seem like a trend, I've been thinking about joining the military in some way for a while now. The only thing is I have no idea if that's the environment that would work for me or how I'd go about it. I know the internet is where I'll do most of my research, but I just wanted to know if there were any female (or male) ISTPs who had advice for someone looking into this path to start off my adult life. \n\n This type of career isn't something I've just started to think about. It might seem cliche, but ever since I was in preschool I've wanted to work as a some sort field detective/officer, and I'm starting to translate that into a job dealing with national security, and I figured joining the military might be the right place to start (?).  I know that most of the work involved is paperwork, never anything like what they show on TV, and exam books I've read have explained most of what the actual day to day life might be like, but I'm still pretty dedicated to this career path.\n\n I've never been able to find people to talk to about my future career path, since it's pretty rare for this to be a career choice in my community, so I sincerely appreciate any and all advice on this matter. \n\nEdit: Should mention that any teachers I have asked for help have told me to look into careers with the FBI or CIA ( I know they are very different organizations). Would working in the military be better instead/or could it help me work my way to a position there.
4	female istp and I joined the Navy and loved it. 3 deployment, 2 ships and  1 shore duty. I got out after 9 years and worked on base as federal and as a contractor. I say go for it! Books and internet will NOT prepare you for day to day life, though. 
4	I’m an advocate for the National Guard if you’re also considering going to college.
4	Honestly it sucks for ISTPs. Mainly due to istps like to do things our own way even if it goes against what a superior says. We don't follow rules very well. We like to be be able to do meaningful work and we use logic alot.\nThe military is the number one place where you are not allowed to use logic. Trust me it will be a struggle everyday trying to deal with people and their "this is just how we do it" attitude.\n\nSource 7 years AF. 
2	Hi. I'm a female INTJ who has been in the army for 10 years. I did electrical engineering for the intelligence 'branch'. \n\nHonestly the army was good for me while I needed it but it ultimatly wasnt a career I could maintain. \nI found the personalities and the culture to be too abrasive and illogical most of the time, however I know alot of my army friends went on to very successful careers in either the civilian contracting world (6 figure jobs in most cases), or into specialized law enforcement (CIA, FBI, NSA things like that.) It was the perfect launching point for those things as it gave a solid foundation and a good network to build on. \nPM me if you have further questions little sister, I'd be happy to help in any way I can.
3	The US military is designed by an for SJs. They excel in the rigid environment. SPs suffer in that environment.\n\nIf you really want to do it, enlist A) for the shortest term possible and B) in the Air Farce.
2	Air Force is the way to go. 
1	Female ISTP here. Joined the Army at 18 and ended my contract at 22. I didn't like the military much, but the benefits I got after the military help me out so much. Going to school now and I know exactly what I want to do. The military matured me a lot and I think it'll only set up for success, but it WILL suck.\n\nSource: Just got out the Army this year.
1	I'd never in my life resign my personal freedom like that. 
1	Join the corps
0	Look into becoming an MP (military police). I don't know where you are, but the Canadian military requires a college diploma (police foundations mainly, but there are a couple other programs they'll accept too, I think) to be an MP or a university degree in Criminology to be an MP officer (MPO).
0	Going to the military is only slightly better than going to prison. 
2	Slightly puzzled infj wants to know her chances w/ istp male	Just curious about the istp perspective. Here’s the situation:\n\n\n- Same class in college w/ said istp\n\n- Spontaneously hanged out for straight 12+hrs with him one day. Mostly listened to music and cooked and talked for a looooong time. which surprised me a bit but might have frightened him idk?? Pretty confident we had a great time and great chemistry.\n\n- Sent him a text following up on a second hang out we briefly menioned. Got one positive reply, then when i asked about specifics, i got no response. But that’s understandable i guess due to intense finals week.\n\n- Sent 1 text to check on him. And then we met and talked in person, which felt perfectly normal.\n\n- Then sent 1 text proposing an alternate choice of hanging out (a less time-demanding one), got no reply. It wasnt until then i realised i’m dealing with an istp (again). Too late, think he might be avoiding me a bit after that.\n\nNow winter break starts, and i wonder:\n1. Did i make things awkward? Did i present myself as overly needy, in the istp’s opinion? we’ll be in the same course for another semester, and it’s a small class, so we’ll def meet again;\n2. Judging from the information given, what are the chances we can pick up the connection we had, after a month, on a relative clean slate? Are istps morelikely to hold on to awkward tensions or just brush them off?\n\n——————————\nedit: on the question of relevance to mbti types.\n\ni have previously been in an relationship with an istp before, who used to exhibit some similar traits (lagging behind in the social skills part, for example), and imo they’re not bad people so i generally go slightly out of my way to try meet them halfway. Also i’ve read about (and experienced) some istp’s issue with texting... therefore i guess a huge part of my attempt is to discover underlying patterns about you people, cause that’s what you do here on reddit innit lollll\n\nthanks everybody!
9	You seem to have made it clear that you like him. If he's not texting you, he's not into you (and he won't ever be). He'll still be your friend and things won't be awkward as long as you don't push for anything more than a platonic relationship. If you push for more it will drive him away very quickly.
3	Not too sure what type has to do with this even if you're correct. I think ignoring your text sent a pretty clear message he's not interested. (In which case, he could have just said so instead of ghosting you. Do you really want someone with that poor social skills?) I wouldn't worry about how you came off. You weren't needy, you just shot your shot and he passed. No big deal. It's unlikely to be awkward unless you make it awkward by bringing it up.
4	Remember, we approach everything in terms of purposefulness and that's how we mentally prioritise things (and even people) effortlessly. When you communicate, be direct and express the purpose of hanging out. It shouldn't just be for the sake of socialising. We aren't motivated by that. It's boring especially when we've invested our time in our "in-the-moment" hobbies, or MOST ESPECIALLY when we hung out a few times already.\n\nAlso, don't ask an ISTP for specifics. You are the one asking out, so you should know enough what is going to happen, what to do and what to see out there. That's basic courtesy. Expecting him to get invested in what you're offering would only hurt you. Know when he mostly has free time and see him there.\n\nI don't know whether he likes you or not. Interactions like that isn't even close to knowing whether one is interested.
2	We are quite simple. I am ASSUMING in his case he doesn't really care, don't overthink your interactions.
9	Christmas Gifts	Hello! \n\nI'm trying to think of something for my ISTP fiance. We have been together for 7 years and Christmas shopping for him has not gotten any easier, I'd also like to punch him right in the feels for Christmas this year :D \n\nI am an ENFP just for reference not that it even really matters \n\nHe loves his Car, tinkering with things, and cooking. any suggestions would be awesome! \n\nEdit: so many awesome suggestions!! Thanks so much !\nI’m planning a whole day in philly including an escape room tour of medical oddities museum and dinner as well as looking into some stuff to tinker with :)
10	A good flashlight, an air fryer, a good pair of jeans... All good choices
8	I imagine buying anything related to his hobbies, unless you know specifically what he wants and explicitly that he wants it, it's not going to be a useful gift. He'll appreciate it to a degree, but I'm guessing as a pragmatic/realistic person, he might look at it and go "hmm, that's kind of a waste because it's not what I wanted".\n\nIt might be better to go with an "experience" gift? Related to what he likes? What about a day at the race track where he can drive a real race car, do you have those? Or a cooking class, or something like that? It's going to mean something to him if you show that you notice and care about his interests. 
6	People have mentioned it already, but experience gifts... sensory deprivation tank session, Airbnb/road trip somewhere new, flight lessons... just cool things you can do together... \n\nWhat are YOUR interests/talents? I’m an artist & painted/customized a skateboard for my ISTP last year. He likes just about anything I make by hand. I also got him a violin for his last birthday, which is something he’d expressed a lot of interest in. \n\nStraight up gifts from the store are hard because he doesn’t like just any crap... it needs to be practical AND good quality. I don’t feel I know enough about a few of his hobbies (hockey, soccer) to buy something he’d genuinely appreciate. No knickknacks. 
5	Basic lockpicking set and a [clear lock](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/clear.htm) or [this set](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/qprolok.htm) of progressively harder locks.  \n\nNew best hobby ever, tinkering to the max.  
3	If he likes thinkering with things and enjoys computers and electronics, get him a 3D printer. Especially one that's a kit from a Chinese company that he'd have to build him self.\n\nMy favorite unit I have is a Flsun Kossel Delta 
2	Y’all are all much better girlfriends than me lol
2	Aak him about something for his hobbies that he wants, but cant justify to himself buying. Hell love it. 
2	My wife got me a nice toolbox a few years ago.  Something kinda like this https://m.lowes.com/pd/CRAFTSMAN-2000-Series-26-in-W-x-19-75-in-H-5-Drawer-Steel-Tool-Chest-Red/1000615509\n\nMy hand tools were previously everywhere.
1	Love this thanks! 
1	My boyfriend's an ISTP !  I'm an ENFP so I think of a zillion things for him but then realize he has almost all of them already. This year I got him a pair of working gloves. Last year I got him a crucible. I've found (with him at least), that simplicity is key and the things others might not usually think of as gifts tend to be the best presents for people like him (or ISTPs in general).
-1	Just google “ISTP rifle” or  “ISTP gun” we are the most type that love things like this.\nyou can buy a air rifle for hunting,  benchrest or field target.  \nBy the way my best friend is ENFP I can imagine how amazing your relationship is. 
4	Anyone have experience with dating an ESTJ?	I'd never been with an ESTJ, I have a good knowledge of 16 personalities. in my opinion ESTJs are sexiest to me. \n\nIf anyone has been there, good or bad and wants to share thoughts please do.  I also curious about how is sex life with an ESTJ. 
11	No thank you 👋
5	I've dated both ESTJ and ENTJ. I prefer ENTJ because they have Se which for me personally is far less annoying than Si. Overall personality is similar and conversation is really fluid. Very not awkward. They keep the convo going if we start to dwell or dig into a topic too much. \n\nEdit: Sex life between the two is different. ESTJ will probably let you take the lead more and you can show her (Se) the ropes. ENTJ will be a little more creative in the bedroom but ultimately want you to dominate since these types typically like to be the opposite of themselves in the sack than they are in everyday life. \n\nEdit again: I realize this may be different if you are a female dating a male ESTJ. 
3	ESTJs are the natural partner of the ISTP, together with the ENTJ.\n\nSexually, the ESTJ is likely to be robust, enthusiastic, and athletic. They will tend to be traditional, and to expect sexual encounters on a relatively scheduled basis. They're likely to approach intimacy as a physical experience of closeness, rather than as an opportunity to express and receive expressions of love and affection. The ESTJ will probably have to work on remembering to express their feelings verbally, but their mate's appreciation will make it well worth it for those who do.\n\nSource: http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESTJ_rel.html

2	Nope. Can't deal with Te-doms. I value my Ti highly.
1	No but my ESTJ boss is a total dick
6	Any ISTP author?	Hi,\n\nI always enjoyed writing and was wondering if there are more ISTPs into writing here.\n\nIt is fuc\*\*\*ing hard to get motivated. I never wrote a book, only scripts and essays for podcasts.\n\n&#x200B;
2	There aren't a lot of ISTP writers, but the most notable among us is Ernest Hemingway for starters.  
1	Yes. Here 😌
1	Not to redirect your thread I always enjoy stories, movies, podcasts involving ISTP characters. I'm familiar with some of the main ones like Bond, Wolverine, etc. but always on the lookout for more. I guess the connection might be that ISTP writers may be inclined to write more ISTP characters.
1	I know one director. He is very "cult", so if you aren't into movies maybe you will not get it. He is one of my favorites, extremely smart about relationships.  \n[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4768776/?ref\_=nm\_flmg\_dr\_7](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4768776/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_7)
1	I’ve written a lot of technical blog posts for our website and articles for magazines back when they actually had those in my industry.
1	Bukowski probably istp
1	I was a writer as a kid (late teens). Was often commended on my grasp of the written word. Kind of wish I'd had the drive to keep doing it, but fell out of it after joining the military. I try not to dwell on it though. Looking back should only be done in moderation. That said, I still occasionally wonder what I'd write about if I were to start writing again. But I just don't have the motivation for it at the end of the day. 
1	I’m not an author, but I’ve written several stories as assignments in school. I thought they were pretty half-assed, but the people who read them thought they were pretty good, dunno why tho.
63	Oh look it’s us	
6	Yes.
-3	Can’t relate. I don’t stay still long enough to get depressed, though I imagine if I did, then I might. 
5	Old friendship	Recently a roommate and good friend from college got engaged. I got the invitation to the wedding and assumed I'd be joining for some of the other activities as well. This past weekend found out there was a bachelor party that I was not invited to. I won't say that we're best friends now just because we're several states apart but just felt like our friendship and history we had achieved a certain level of closeness. It was especially surprising given that several of the other guys going were part of our friend group. Having found out about it, I wonder if I should even go to the wedding / try to continue the friendship. I felt like we were good friends but now part of me is like eff it. I've had other situations where I dropped all effort and knew it would kill the friendship and it did. I don't necessarily want to have a smaller friend group but also don't like flaky friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR\n\nThought I was close with a friend, actions indicate otherwise, do I put in effort to continue the friendship.
8	I'd go to the wedding if not for him then for yourself. He apparently did not perceive the closeness of your friendship to be on the same level as you did, but that's not a purposeful offense on his part and no reason to break things off completely. Adjust the distance and consider him to be more of a casual friend or even an acquaintance.     \n     \nThere is also slight possibility that he simply forgot to invite you to that party, as wedding preparations can be hectic. 
4	When was the last time you hung out with him?
2	I would go, if it matters to him it could maintain the friendship , if not at least you would get some cake.
2	Nah, it's just a bachelor's party. Remember it's not one-man decision. Lots of people are probably involved in this event. With the lack of information, be objective that many people, not only you, did not make it to the list or forgotten without such intention. I suggest you show up at the wedding, though. Presence is validating enough as an effort to maintain the friendship. 
1	I have a friend group who have an instagram chat titled "The Table(minus my name). I can relate. I would skip the wedding. 
21	How to stop explaining myself?	I find I always have the need to explain my actions when something goes wrong. My SO is tired of me making “excuses”, but that is honestly not my intention. I feel like I need to explain my logic behind whatever happened and I can never stop myself. Does anyone have this issue and do you have any advice on how to stop doing it?\n\nNote: my SO might be ESTJ (she did the test but won’t tell me her result) if that makes a difference.
13	She sounds like a peach. If it were me, I'd drop her so fast. Ain't no place in a relationship for one person not willing to hear communication from the other. Also won't tell you her type? It's only going to get worse.
10	[deleted]
6	stop caring bro. u can't please everyone
5	Maybe what you want isn't to explain yourself but to be understood, and that's why you feel like you need to explain yourself. I always feel like my actions hurt people because they don't understand me and think I'm doing certain things to upset or hurt them, I see it and it affects me somehow. I usually also feel like I need to explain myself in order to be understood by those people who feel hurt by my actions and whom I don't actually wanna hurt, but I stop myself and think "Don't, words won't change their minds, only actions will". It takes longer for actions to change someone's mind but once they do it'll be much better and easier. Start explaining only important things and have a little patience 💪
3	Why wouldn't she tell you something as simple as her type?
4	Serious mistakes deserve to be explained and apologized for.  But, your description suggests these are trivial issues or even just unlucky circumstances that don't need justification.  \n\nTo stop, have you thought about why you feel this need to explain in the first place?  Ego, that you can't stand to be wrong?  Low self esteem that you fear people will reject you because of a failure?  Maybe judgmental SO or parents?  Or maybe that we all tend to think people notice our foibles more than they really do.\n\nIronically, you may be actually hurting the feelings of those around you if your justifications are perceived that you don't believe they truly love and accept you.  To some extent your defensiveness could feel like you're accusing them of being overly critical when they haven't been.
2	I used to get accused of making excuses for my actions, me trying to explain in detail my actions or thought process as well. I eventually learned that most of the time people just prefer an apology, not an explanation, even if they're asking for an explanation. \n\nMy advice, only provide an explanation if they ask, and then keep it simple, one, maybe two sentences, not even very descriptive. \n\nToo many words often gets interpreted as "deceit." Trying to explain away or cover up your actions. Also, stake a claim on your mistake. You made a mistake. There's nothing wrong with that. We all do it.\n\nAnyway, example....\n\nMe: "Sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen."\n\nBoom! Done.\n\nThen, if they ask...\n\nThem: "How did that even happen?" Or "What were you thinking?"\n\nMe: "I wasn't thinking. Sorry about that." Or "I misinterpreted the instructions. Dumb mistake."\n\nIt's really as simple as that. \n\nThey may sound like they want an in-depth description of events, but, 99% of the time, they don't. They're just analyzing your character. If you're apologetic, and if you're honest about your faults. \n\nKeep it simple for them and they'll understand. Too many words, too confusing for them, and you must be "making excuses."
2	I relate to this so much.  My solution was to break up with my SO lol
1	I have this issue with my ISTP spouse except *I'm* the one who has this need to over-explain. He says he finds it patronizing but if I don't do it, it's not always understood and then he questions it. \n\nWhy is she being so secretive with her type? 
1	The problem could be with your girlfriend and like someone commented above a Te-Ti clash of your functions: Te is blind to Ti so your reasoning isn't convincing her.    \n         \nHowever, MBTI aside, if she cares for you and appreciates you, she shouldn't be making you feel like you're on the spot and you have to explain yourself all the time. Is she acting upset, offended, and grumpy? Is she making you feel like you're always guilty and at fault for whatever has happened? Is she trying to make you feel insecure of your own decisions? If she is doing anything like this, it doesn't sound like a quality relationship or healthy loving attitude on her part really.
1	If she won’t even share a result with you and has such trust issues; run.\n\nI didn’t and it cost me 12 years of my life and nearly my entire net worth.  Run bro.
3	Does “Dichotomy Tests” reflect personality traits? I showed this to a friend and she asked if I was sure I was ISTP. I didn’t know how to respond to that.	
13	I think it makes perfect sense for an ISTP. But most people don't realize you guys are sweet, caring, romantic, moral people. In my experience, ISTPs have strong beliefs and really care about the people they care about. They're idealistic. But this is hidden underneath a shell of impartiality, cool headedness, bluntness, and practical efficiency. People can't see your Ni from the outside very easily. They can't see your ideals and beliefs and the narrative inside your minds. Only what you present to the outside, which doesn't seem consistent with your dichotomy test results unless you also consider your inner experience
6	I think you're a little too low on nihilism for an ISTP ;)\n\nSeriously, no, it's all fucking astrology. Or rather categorization. There's no such thing as an ISTP personality that controls your behavior. The test you took just put you into the ISTP category because that's the category that fits your functional thinking the best. So if we decided to categorize people in 16 categories you'd be in the ISTP category. But there could be as well a different categorization system with 12 categories, or 32. \n\nSo if you're an ISTP who actually doesn't like fast cars that doesn't mean that you're "damaged". It just means you don't like fast cars.\n\nNow the dichotomy "test" is more about how much you've been brainwashed by society into believing certain things. If you grew up among commies you would be high in altruism and low in moralism for example. If you grew up among libertarians your altruism would be lower but you would score higher on moralism. But in both cases you would still fall into the ISTP category.
3	I took it and am basically 50/50 on everything (I lean a little one way, but not more than ~15%) expect for Idealism vs. Pragmatism— leaning toward the latter—and Rationalism vs. Romanticism—leaning toward the former. 
3	Maybe the rationalism vs romanticism is a bit questionable. However, I don't see how it's impossible that you'd be an ISTP
2	I dunno how relevant it is for personality tests. It's a fun test but I got wildly different results. \n[My Results ](https://i.imgur.com/Kf2mCy6.png)
2	I think your pragmatism and rationalism should be a little higher, but heck, who knows. Maybe the test you took is off. Not only that, the whole personality traits stuff is theoretical anyway. And sometimes we exhibit other traits that make us appear a little different. You do you. Doesn't hurt anything. Even if you're not istp 100% of the time, is that going to change who you are fundamentally, or how you feel about yourself? It shouldn't. Don't worry about it. Just shrug it off and keep going. :)
23	I need help	I'm getting really pissed about people assuming my intention is to be rude or an asshole, assuming they can read me and making big things out of nothing, then when I actually do apologize it's "don't play innocent" or "stop victimization yourself" as if, if I don't adhere to their falsely constructed view of me I am actually lying. What the fuck am I even supposed to do in these situations? Just pretend that they caught me so they can stroke their lil dicks of 'higher moral virtue', get away and then never talk to them again?
36	[deleted]
14	This is a really situational problem, but if you're having this problem consistently then I'd wager the blame most likely isn't solely on others, and you are actually not picking up on sets of social cues, values, or giving off certain characteristics that are associated with being a dickhole or whatever the fuck these people think you are, even when you're not, and you just don't realize it. and Yeah, it does suck. But I've found over the years, as a mid-twenties istp that there were some things I'm glad to have learned and changed my behavior around because it turns out i subconsciously look for these things in other people as a sign of care, or that these people in my life who i do trust are often big feelers who are already doing these little acts of social kindness for me, to let me know that they care, or that it's safe to talk with them.   \n\n\nOf course, there are things I will never pick up on and things I'll never be able to change. I cannot be a fake person, I am too terribly genuine with my reactions, and fakeness is almost a job requirement in california so there are some industries i may never fit into. For example, acting. Or any big cliquey offices.   \n\n\nThere are also some people who are impossible to please, but depending on where you are you shouldn't be running into them every goddamn day? I will still occasionally get someone who insists I'm lying and being fake, when I'm anything but; And the irony will usually be that they are so used to looking for fakeness and backhandedness in others, or in themselves, as the only sensible means of operation, they can no longer no see any genuineness at all. The only way to be real to those people is actually to be fake, in a weird way, because thats how theyre used to perceiving the world, and that fakeness is more normal to them than sincerity. Real sincerity to them, must be locked up and hidden away, and shown in small increments. If you're being sincere all the time it has to be a lie, and must be fake.   \n\n\nId say you probably have a classic istp case of both though. It really sucks, but try honestly thinking about how these people are arriving to these conclusions and what better things you can do to show them, through behavior, attitudes, and intent, that you just want to get along and have a good environment. As much as all of us want to instinctively push people away for not making a good effort to understand us, they wont. We have to understand them instead. Theres a social list of rules and eitquitte that has already been universally accepted as law greater than the written one, and if you swim against it, you're likely just to get punted back. It's better to learn how to navigate dangerous waters than drown. 
12	Something I learned some time back that helps with life in general: lots of things don't need to be said. It's often better not to engage at all.
10	Just tell 'em to fuck off. 
2	Just have a read of what Carl Jung said about our shitty dominant function:  \n> "Like every introverted type, he is almost completely lacking in that which distinguishes his counter type, namely, the intensive relatedness to the object. In the case of a human object, the man has a distinct feeling that he matters only in a negative way, i.e., in milder instances he is merely conscious of being superfluous, but with a more extreme type he feels himself warded off as something definitely disturbing.  \nThis negative relation to the object indifference, and even aversion characterizes every introvert; it also makes a description of the introverted type in general extremely difficult. With him, everything tends to disappear and get concealed. His judgment appears cold, obstinate, arbitrary, and inconsiderate, simply because he is related less to the object than the subject. One can feel nothing in it that might possibly confer a higher value upon the object; it always seems to go beyond the object, leaving behind it a flavour of a certain subjective superiority. Courtesy, amiability, and friendliness may be present, but often with a particular quality suggesting a certain uneasiness, which betrays an ulterior aim, namely, the disarming of an opponent, who must at all costs be pacified and set at ease lest he prove a disturbing- element. In no sense, of course, is he an opponent, but, if at all sensitive, he will feel somewhat repelled, perhaps even depreciated. Invariably the object must submit to a certain neglect; in worse cases it is even surrounded with quite unnecessary measures of precaution. Thus, it happens that this type tends to disappear behind a cloud of misunderstanding, which only thickens the more he attempts to assume, by way of compensation and with the help of his inferior functions, a certain mask of urbanity, which often presents a most vivid contrast to his real nature. Although in the extension of his world of ideas he shrinks from no risk, however daring, and never even considers the possibility that such a world might also be dangerous, revolutionary, heretical, and wounding to feeling, he is none the less a prey to the liveliest anxiety, should it ever chance to become objectively real.  \nWhen the time comes for him to transplant his ideas into the world, his is by no means the air of an anxious mother solicitous for her children's welfare; he merely exposes them and is often extremely annoyed when they fail to thrive on their own account. The decided lack he usually displays in practical ability, and his aversion from any sort of réclame assist in this attitude. If to his eyes his product appears subjectively correct and true, it must also be so in practice, and others simply must bow to its truth. Hardly ever will he go out of his way to win anyone's appreciation of it, especially if it be anyone of influence. And, when he brings himself to do so, he is usually so extremely maladroit that he merely achieves the opposite of his purpose. In his own special province, there are usually awkward experiences with his colleagues, since he never knows how to win their favour; as a rule, he only succeeds in showing them how entirely superfluous they are to him. In the pursuit of his ideas he is generally stubborn, head-strong, and quite unamenable to influence. His suggestibility to personal influences is in strange contrast to this. An object has only to be recognized as apparently innocuous for such a type to become extremely accessible to inferior elements. They lay hold of him from the unconscious. He lets himself be brutalized and exploited in the most ignominious way, if only he can be left undisturbed in the pursuit of his ideas. He simply does not see when he is being plundered behind his back and wronged in practical ways: this is because his relation to the object is such a secondary matter that lie is left without a guide in the purely objective valuation of his product.  \nIn thinking out his problems to the utmost of his ability, he also complicates them, and constantly becomes entangled in every possible scruple. However clear to himself the inner structure of his thoughts may be, he is not in the least clear where and how they link up with the world of reality. Only with difficulty can he persuade himself to admit that what is clear to him may not be equally clear to everyone. His style is usually loaded and complicated by all sorts of accessories, qualifications, saving clauses, doubts, etc., which spring from his exacting scrupulousness. His work goes slowly and with difficulty. Either he is taciturn, or he falls among people who cannot understand him; whereupon he proceeds to gather further proof of the unfathomable stupidity of man. If he should ever chance to be understood, he is credulously liable to overestimate. Ambitious women have only to understand how advantage may be taken of his uncritical attitude towards the object to make an easy prey of him; or he may develop into a misanthropic bachelor with a childlike heart. Then, too, his outward appearance is often gauche, as if he were painfully anxious to escape observation; or he may show a remarkable unconcern, an almost childlike naivete.  \nIn his own particular field of work, he provokes violent contradiction, with which he has no notion how to deal, unless by chance he is seduced by his primitive affects into biting and fruitless polemics. By his wider circle he is counted inconsiderate and domineering. But the better one knows him, the more favourable one's judgment becomes, and his nearest friends are well aware how to value his intimacy. To people who judge him from afar he appears prickly, inaccessible, haughty; frequently he may even seem soured as a result of his anti-social prejudices. He has little influence as a personal teacher, since the mentality of his pupils is strange to him. Besides, teaching has, at bottom, little interest for him, except when it accidentally provides him with a theoretical problem. He is a poor teacher, because while teaching his thought is engaged with the actual material and will not be satisfied with its mere presentation.  \nWith the intensification of his type, his convictions become all the more rigid and unbending. Foreign influences are eliminated; he becomes more unsympathetic to his peripheral world, and therefore more dependent upon his intimates. His expression becomes more personal and inconsiderate and his ideas more profound, but they can no longer be adequately expressed in the material at hand. This lack is replaced by emotivity and susceptibility. The foreign influence, brusquely declined from without, reaches him from within, from the side of the unconscious, and he is obliged to collect evidence against it and against things in general which to outsiders seems quite superfluous. Through the subjectification of consciousness occasioned by his defective relationship to the object, what secretly concerns his own person now seems to him of chief importance. And he begins to confound his subjective truth with his own person. Not that he will attempt to press anyone personally with his convictions, but he will break out with venomous and personal retorts against every criticism, however just.  \nThus, in every respect his isolation gradually increases. His originally fertilizing ideas become destructive, because poisoned by a kind of sediment of bitterness. His struggle against the influences emanating from the unconscious increases with his external isolation, until gradually this begins to cripple him. A still greater isolation must surely protect him from the unconscious influences, but as a rule this only takes him deeper into the conflict which is destroying him within."  
2	If they don't understand and start assuming the wrong shit, that's their problem.\n\nYou keep being you, bro.
2	As a fellow ISTP, I can appreciate your frustration, as I frequently offend people without realising I have done so. I certainly don't set out to upset those around me, but seem to do so with remarkable frequency. I have come to realise that this issue is the result of people being far more emotional than myself. People allow their emotions to influence their opinions and decision making, which I rarely do, and this sometimes results in me offending their delicate sensibilities when I disparage an opinion they hold.\n\nI've found the best way to resolve this issue is to avoid associating with stupid people. This necessitated removing a fair few people from my life.
1	Whenever I try to be nice and "empathetic" people think I'm an idiot and start behaving like assholes. Fuck them really. If those are the two alternatives then I prefer to be the asshole. \n\nNowadays I tend to use the phrase "fuck off" more liberally. 
-3	Never apologize for anything. Quit associating with those people. Act professional and put together while making the occasional stinging remark and add just a little arrogance to your behavior and you will find people respect you with a slight aw and fear. 
0	what????? You know what they say...if you keep meeting assholes everywhere then you are the asshole. 
0	So what if some random thinks your being rude or an ass. That's there problem not yours. If it's a friend or even an acquaintance then you both should luarn to communicate better.
63	ISTP Depression	>	If an ISTP is going through depression, the thing that makes them happiest is being by themselves. They might seclude themselves for long periods of time, and will completely alienate themselves from others. ISTPs often will not noticed that they are depressed for a long time, since they don’t usually focus on their own emotions easily. This can cause them to push others away, in hopes of figuring out what is actually going on.\n\n>	ISTPs need support, but from a distance. If someone attempts to smother them, it will only make the situation much worse. Just knowing that their loved ones are there, and that they can trust them when the time comes to open up- means the world to them.\n\nSeems about right.
23	It's pretty much right. A couple of people surprised me with really kind gifts today. That really helped me stay on track
12	The thing that friends have done that has helped me the most during times I've been depressed has been "Hey, do you want to [do thing that I enjoy and is distracting]?"
13	i think im a combination of slightly depressed and wayyyy overly stressed. all i want is someone to fucking notice im stressed and help me in even the tiniest way with literally anything or at the very least, not make more work for me. but at the same time, i know ill keep doing their work and i wont ask for help until someone notices. \n\nbut i also just want to be by myself because i feel mostly angry at or hurt by nearly everyone (fe grip yuck).\n\ntl;dr i need a vacation asap.
7	Right, I was depressed for many years and didn't even knew it. I thought it was normal until I came out of it.\n\nQuite a few years were wasted, but now I'm happy finally.
3	As a non-ISTP, I have to ask: What would make you guys feel better coming from one of your friend when you're depressed ? I never know if I'm doing too much/being too invasive or doing too little. 
3	What helped me is I found a good friend to talk to. I later found out he was an INFJ. \n\nIdk about all INFJs but this one just sat there looking at his phone and listened as I talked non-stop. I saw him once a week so it was like a nice therapy session.\n\nFind an INFJ, they make good therapists.

-10	Or just get on medication. 
9	How do you get an iSTP to do something they don't want to do?	Tell them the alternative is having an ESTJ sit down with them as they instruct the ISTP on every step of the task.\n\n\nI swear, this one works like a charm! I've taught myself all kinds of things just to avoid being patronized by an ESTJ. \n\nedit: i have absolutely no idea how the i wasn't capitalized lol
13	Tell me I have to be subordinate to an ESTJ and I’ll be heading to my nearest sporting goods store to select a hunting rifle. 
8	My wife is really good at dropping very subtle hints without giving away that she wants me to do something. Over the course of time, this casually creeps its way into my brain as "hey I have a great idea, let's do xyz...". \n\nShe's done is many times and it works, it's kinda freaky.\n\nNo, I'm not anti letting her have a suggestion, I just have a tendency to "space out" on stuff like that. But for some reason when it "comes from my brain" I'm a little more invested/interested in it.
7	My husband is an ENTJ and we’ve basically been fighting for 25 years.  It’s ok.  We’ve worked it out.  It’s not easy, though.  Oddly enough, we have a similar sense of humor so we can laugh about it.
5	Ask nicely without trying to manipulate? Or is that just crazy?
3	One of my friends is an ESTJ and he is horrible. ESTJs are neurotics. Yeah he will push you like GET BACK TO WORK RIGHT NOW!!! But it can be done only for a few times because ISTPs have authority issues. And any ISTP will start to sabotage the process in any possible way.
2	You don't
1	Give me an incentive
10	Supporting a depressed ISTP	I think my ISTP may be malfunctioning, and I was wondering if you all had any tips or tricks for supporting/helping ISTPs through general blues/malaise. I think the darkness and weather are part of the issue, particularly because it’s difficult to pursue the usual thrill-seeking outlets when it’s frozen, cold and dark by 5pm. \n\nI’m not sure what to say or do to help. Nothing I suggest seems interesting or exciting enough, or there’s always a reason it ‘can’t’ happen. I’ve tried giving space (ISTP didn’t want that), suggesting other activities, talking about fun stuff we could do after the holidays, just kind of being there in a low key way, offered to help make a plan to achieve some stuff that would make fun times easier/more accessible (e,g: ‘this is how we can buy a snowmobile’). It all just gets a heavy sigh and a ‘nah’.\n\nI’m not willing to be responsible for entertaining him, but I’m happy to support him and help him get out of this rut.\n\nAny suggestions? What cheers you up when you’re feeling down? Alternately, what drives you absolutely nuts and is completely unhelpful?
10	I am all to familiar with seasonal depression. \nBest suggestion I can think of is make sure they get out of the house and preferably into the sunlight. Even if they don't want to go out force them to go for a walk or something with you. Even a short drive to look a Christmas lights. Pretend you need their help with something if you have to. Chances are they don't realize how deep of a depression they have fallen into and making them do something other than sitting around will kick start them into recovery.
2	Preamble: Every single person who suffers from depression is being affected by different things.\n\nIntro: I had a 6 year stint with the big black dog, it sucked but I can see that I'm a better person now having gone to the bottom and come back.\n\nBody: The super excessive logical nature of ISTP is driven by process, find your human a process to follow and assure them that it's worth while. Get blood work done by a naturopath, find what supplements can be added. Take them. Have allergy tests done, then have a dietician create a meal plan. Follow it. Have a stomach parasite test done by a lab that specializes in that. Take the meds if prescribed. There, now you've ruled out 90% of the easy fixes. Next, go on to social. Then find a fulfilling hobby or activity and start increasing social responsibility.\n\nConclusion: My fix was as follows; move to a place I knew I had the best chance of success. Take IV multivitamins as often as prescribed by the naturopath until my mood and stomach leveled out. Find community, in the form of a local weekly market, show up and contribute to it. Threshold dose ketamine every couple weeks or as I feel myself falling. \n\nDisclaimer: Your mileage may vary

8	The impact on introverts of living in a world that values extroversion.	[https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201812/how-introverts-can-make-it-in-extraverted-world](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201812/how-introverts-can-make-it-in-extraverted-world)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn interesting article I stumbled across, which also outlines how introverts can be happier despite living in a world that favours extroverts.
28	Tl;dr: to be happy be yourself and don't give a fuck about what others think about you
17	Honestly they’re not using extrovert or introvert properly. \n\n\nThey’re equating extrovert with social prowess and introvert with shyness. And while those may be common correlations, the definitions are not interchangeable. \n\n\nExtrovert = recharge batteries in social environment \n\n\nIntrovert = recharge batteries alone \n\n\nI am an introvert, but I’m still a social butterfly. I absolutely love being around people and having fun. I’m not intimidated by charisma or crowds. I have no problem walking into a networking event and confidently approaching strangers. The only thing that separates me from extroverts is that I need to go home and be alone to recharge my internal batteries. Social activities drain me, but that doesn’t mean I’m bad at it or don’t like it. It just means that I’m draining while you’re recharging and I’m recharging while you’re draining.

1	Huh, sounds like maladjusted, socially awkward people
1	So a sigma male is basically an introverted hipster? Like 90% of that was about not following rules or conforming to society. Can’t quite tell if we’re going edgy teen direction or hipster... 
1	most istps are gamma or omega, a few are sigmas\n\nIntroverted choices : Omega, Gamma, Sigma\nExtroverted choices : Delta, Beta, Alpha
1	This gave me anxiety in how true it is. 
1	What the fuck is a sigma male? 
1	I’m like a sigma male, I fit in 85% of it, I’m independent, confident, dominant and quiet. I don’t technically read nor I have my own business, but I don’t care what people think and I do what I want. I only cooperate until I get what I want and then I leave. People are confused by me and I couldn’t care less and I don’t let people fuck with me either. I’m like a snake in a snake pit, once played with, you get bitten.
1	Being Sigma is hard and unhealthy as hell. You’re quiet most of your life and just because you’re a social animal, you want to socialiaze. I’m kind of a sigma but I don’t really like it one bit. I fit in 80-85% of what it represents. It’s not good.
21	Anyone else feel like they’d hate to be in the military?	I can’t say I haven’t thought of it , \n\n\nBut I’ve heard people recommend it here a LOT \n\nif my understanding of it is correct ( may not be ) it sounds like it would be my hell: taking orders from people all the time, people screaming in your face, etc \n\nI mean the physical aspect sounds challenging and fun but in real world scenarios one wouldn’t usually be using them right? Since a lot of the military is just “standing around” and not in combat? 
8	I enjoyed the four years I spent in the army. \n\nAt least, I enjoy that I did it. Lol. 
11	Oh, boy.  This question calls out to me.\n\nI'm Acepincter, ISTP (Occasional summer ESTP) and former US Marine (2000-2004) deployed to Op Enduring Freedom (Bahrain, Quatar, Djibouti) and stationed in Camp Smith Hawaii for 3 years.\n\nEveryone sees basic training and thinks this is what the military is like for 4 years.  Shouting, running, pushups...  Nope.\n\nOccasionally some hear stories about combat and think it's a murder factory and huge numbers of people are thrown like a curtain into battle daily and drilling around in patrol formations with weapons and packs for 16 hours a day.  Nope.\n\nThere are others who think it's a system of abuse and cheap labor, mentally shaping a generation of nationalistic go-getters with promises of jobs and college and a gauranteed pass to adulthood.  This comes a little closer to the truth.  But it's still pretty far off.\n\nAbout 15% of the military are combat facing jobs.  That's it.  15%.  Let that sink in.\n\nThe vast remainder, the other 85% are support jobs, very important jobs, of maintaining gear, vehicles, buildings, paperwork, computers, designing things, testing things, processing data, personnel issues, medical/dental issues, making food, keeping records, constructing buildings, taking down buildings, engineering, training, etc.\n\nTaking orders from people and having your face screamed in is part of the rite of passage we call Boot Camp.  It's tough, but it's wonderful.  It shapes you.  It leaves you with a solid core, and leaves you with the ability to endure.  From endurance comes stature, and leadership from that.  To be a leader requires you to acquire many traits- these are not just learned from books, they are earned through trial.  The military understands that.  *The willow knows what the storm does not; the power to endure harm outlives the power to inflict it*.\n\nto the point made by /u/__celli , he's not wrong, but leaders in the military understand their purpose far greater than he gives them credit for- and to give an order is a serious thing, one not done lightly, and one not done if not for a good reason.  There's always a reason.  Sometimes we don't know or understand the reason, and sometimes, much to our disliking, the reason is done to correct a flaw someone sees in our attitude (for example, being ordered to clean toilets is an effective way to build humility.  being ordered to stand post for 12 hours is an effective way to build discipline, patience, and calm.  If you're slow, you might get ordered to run.  It sucks while you do it, but you come out stronger)\n\nThe military abides by some rules unspoken, but effective for growth.  *If you can't, then you MUST* is a good one.  Can't do pull-ups?  Then you MUST do pull-ups until you can.  You MUST grow.\n\nI suppose it's not unlike business in a way.  The president of a company issues a policy or an order, and if it isn't followed, he can punish those who disobey by firing them or some other disciplinary action.  It's not unlike parenting.  It's just one of many hierarchies in nature, but this one is particularly strict about it's enforcement, there's little-to-no fuzziness about who is the authority.  And you don't get to become Daddy/President (the General) until you've shown your worth and intelligence and understanding through success in your career.\n\nThat said, the day we don't need a military, when we can lay down our arms and join in brotherhood- that's a day I'm also yearning for.\n\nOnce you're through basic training, it's so much like a regular 9-5 job you wouldn't believe it.\n\nIf you're a combat job, your job is to get better at your skills for 8 hours a day.  Then you go home.\n\nIf you're a paperwork guy, you do paperwork in an office for 8 hours a day if there's work to do, then you go home.  three times a week, you have to exercise.\n\nIf you're in the vehicles department, your job is maintaining vehicles and their paperwork for 8 hours a day while listening to music and playing sports, reading, gaming or whatever in the downtime.\n\nIf there isn't work to do, you can read, talk, wander, exercise, study, play sport, etc.  Facilities exist for your welfare.\n\n"Home" is a barracks room, usually well-equipped, like a college dorm.  Unless you're in the field, in which case it's usually tents, cabins or bivouacs.\n\nYou put in your time, and you see with your own eyes just how effective the system of rank is at getting things accomplished.  The military is full of real achievement.  Big time.  People make things happen, daily.  Major things.\n\n"Colonel, I need 4 thousand men over on the west side of town in uniform by sundown.  Bring food for 4 nights and give them a place to stay."  "Yes, Sir."  And they make it happen.  It's unbelievable how quickly and efficiently things like this happen.  Authority, delegation, division of labor, and lots of honest work.\n\nAnd then, you get out, and you see the world with a new pair of eyes.\n\nThe thing I hated about military life was having to live up to other people's ridiculous standards of room cleanliness.  I hated being "inspected" for flaws, but I did certainly learn and grow from the experience.  It felt like a constant insult, but I have come to realize that being held to high standards is the only way to really achieve the height, and shine.  When you finally achieve that height, you know your strength and might.  And you start to automatically hold others to the same standard.  Not to punish them, but to say: "Come, walk with me, let me take you higher."\n\nThe rites of passage and the difficult road of the military is what make leaders out of ordinary men.  It's not the only way to become a leader, but no leader ever arose without having passed many trials.\n\nI'm sorry to hear /u/bendix 's comment.  I know what he sees in the military.  There is that element of it, but I assure you that the military knows it needs intelligent, critical thinkers in order to make smart combat decisions on the fly.  It does not want drones, but it also will not tolerate rebels or defiance against itself, as it knows internal conflict will destroy any unit.
4	I hated every second of it. But if your an officer it’s probably a different story. They get treated like little princesses. 
17	Wouldn’t work for me. For me, logic trumps authority. So if a superior tells me to do something that defies all logic, I’m stuck doing a useless task or getting punished for insubordination. \n\n\nThe goal of military training is break people down and brainwash them into yesmen. So they never have to think for themselves. They simply follow the orders of their superior regardless of the order. It’s how you get good men to fight for a bad cause. 
3	I regret not joining the military, then again, I still enjoy my current life without having joined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess it's more what do you want?
5	i ain't risking my only life for a society that doesn't give a fuck about the mental health system & high male suicide rate. Nahh. No cannon fodder here m8. Stay woke 👌
11	I just think of the military as brainwashing
3	Consider joining a reserve branch then? I’m ISTP and in the National Guard and I’m loving it. After boot, it’s just 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks a year commitment so you can be challenged physically, and avoid most of the standing around of active duty soldiers. Then if your unit gets activated you ship out for combat. 
2	My dad was in the military so I got quite an experience growing up. I think I'd be good in the military because I'm really good at getting screamed at and following orders, but I don't think I'd actually like being there at all.
2	The military was SJ hell. It was a miserable experience as an ISTP.\n\nA wartime army might be ok for an istp, but a peacetime army was misery and agony.
1	Theres a reason behind the rules so I wouldn't mind. Also, a lot of special forces guys and fighter pilots are ISTPs - I feel like it takes an ESTP or ISTP to do what they do. 
1	Here's my opinion: we would do good in a war time military where stupid stuff like passing inspections isn't as important, but we won't enjoy the current state of the military very much: not doing anything so stupid stuff matters. Now if we had a job that was utilized during this time, such as helicopter pilot, we'd still do good
1	I probably wouldn't mind if I had the capacity. But it would be highly illegal to put me in combat since I have freaking metal inside of me from heart surgeries. Not to mention a medical requirement that I shouldn't lift more than 40 pounds. \n\nI feel like I would hate it if it was longer than 2-3 years anyway.
1	A lot of ISTP flounder through high school and wind up in the military because it creates some direction. I can't imagine liking it. And I played paintball once so I know for a fact that I would die instantly on the battlefield.
1	I've thought about joining but am too ambivalent to commit to something like that. I only would want to do the reserves anyways
1	It's not so bad. There's less yelling than you'd think, so long as you're not a bag of shit or one of the fighting trades.
1	I spent nearly 21 years in the air force.  First as a heavy equipment mechanic,  and then as a management and organization analyst. \n\nIt's not hard. Follow instructions, and learn the rules as written. When you know the rules, you have the power.  You also know how far you can bend them. 
1	I enjoyed my 5 years in. Got in trouble a few times for speaking my mind unapologetically.\n\nOne time I missed formation and my platoon sgt confronted me on it.\n\nHer: Nesko, I noticed you weren’t in formation this morning. What happened to you?\nMe: I didn’t feel like it.\nBoth she and all the soldiers in the office had their mouths agape at my response. I stood there at parade rest blank expression. In this instance most soldiers would create at least some half baked excuse, but I hadn’t yet learned how to use tact. \n\nOnce she regained her composure, she instructed me to begin pushing. I did 50 push-ups and asked her “Do you want me to stop or keep going?” She instructed me to continue. I got up to 100 and she told me to stop. Lol good times
1	I spent 4 years in the US Army. I wouldn't take back that experience for anything, but I wouldn't make it a career. \n\nThe yelling aspect, you quickly learn, is fake. It's to get the young ones emotionally motivated. Scare them, and they do stuff.\n\nThe beauty of the military is everything is technical. There is a process for everything. Standard Operating Procedures. You learn the process for something and you do it. And sometimes you have the leeway to improve the process in your own way.\n\nThe worst part of the military is that you do not control your life. You're given duties, orders, or told to follow a schedule, at any point.... And you better do it. It's your job. Sometimes you don't care, you're like, "whatever let's just get it done." Other times, you may genuinely hate that you don't have the freedom to say no. Not because the duty isn't tolerable, it might be fine, something you've done many times before, but it's because you don't want to be their pawn at that moment.\n\nAgain, if I could go back and change it, I wouldn't. It was an "overall" good experience. But you need the mental fortitude to keep going during the times when you're ready to quit.
1	I went to the military and it was tough in the beginning, but after getting outta there, i really miss it a lot
1	na, i feel like military is more for istj, despite what they say. sure firing a gun at a few bottles would be fun, and before i get word-raped, i know it's not fucking around, that's the point, it takes quite a commitment.
1	I just don't think I would want to be pinned down for 4+ years
1	Fuck that I’d rather die than lay down my life for the US military lmfao. I would literally prefer to die. 
0	As an ISTP in the military, yes!
0	nope, did 9 years and I loved it...Istp woman here. 
0	I made a subreddit for MBTI enthusiasts who make music. Please come and share your OC!	/r/MBTImusicians\n\n7 different people have already posted songs they've made. You should, too! :)
1	Feel free to check mine out, especially if you live in a different country. It shows different country's flags under my profile's stats and I am measuring my success based on how many flags I can collect :) Sort of like collecting Pokemon :P\n\n* [INTP [Classical](1:00)](https://soundcloud.com/user-216205579/track-1)
1	Rule #3
15	I just came here to say why I love ESTPs and ISTPs	
15	YES! We are so witty, but whenever you have a witty xSTP it's assumed it's an xNTP
5	Ah, c'mon dude, you didn't have to write all of that... Thanks anyway :)
3	Thanks?
2	I'll have you know that I gratefully accept your speech
1	I hate ass kissers. 
1	<3
1	> why I love\n\n\nAaaaaand the reason is? Beyond the title you haven’t said much....
4	Are people with istp successful a lot of the time?	I got this in a test, just wondering since it seems like most people here are depressed and feel like they’re not going anywhere in life? 
54	I like how you say “With istp” like you’re diagnosed with it 
11	I am very successful and very rarely depressed. I may not get as many things done as the ISTJ, but it rarely bothers me.\n\nThat said, if I made a post here it would likely be about my failures, not my successes. The hardwood floors aren't put down in my house cause reasons, but I am great at my job.
21	This sub is largely a place where people come to vent about their problems and seek advice.  Also it's a big echo chamber of people trying to justify their immature, shitty behavior.  Those of us doing well in life don't really have a lot to say so the sub gets a big negativity bias as a result.
8	How do you measure success?
4	ISTPs are a lot more successful than some of the other personality types. We are good at fixing, engineering, and problem solving, which is valued and can be very lucrative. We are also good at being adaptable and excel in times of crisis.
3	Very successful in my career and life. I had a long WTF period before, but it really just helped me define how I moved forward once I moved on and started trying.
3	I'm an ISTP and have a job, a good credit rating, and a 401(k).  Can also afford good coffee and beer.  \n\nI'll call that successful. 
2	Seems we don't value it as much as some other types would, we're at the bottom of the totem pole statistically when it comes to income [https://www.truity.com/blog/personality-type-career-income-study](https://www.truity.com/blog/personality-type-career-income-study)
4	lol, yeah..I fucking came down with a case of the ISTPs. what kind of asinine question is this? I am successful on things I am interested and passionate about. 
1	[deleted]
0	Do you consider yourself successful?	If so what makes you consider yourself successful? \n\n\nIf not what do you think holds you back? \n\n
10	Sure. I have a roof over my head and food on my plate. That's success to me in this f*cking unbalanced world.
7	Financially, yes. Romantically? Kinda. As Seen On TV? No, and I don't want to be.
7	I have money and nothing else. lol\n\nIt's awesome at times and awful at times.
3	Yes, but with the help of an ENFP business partner. Make sure you retain at least 51% share. \n\nEdit:  Having an INTJ accountant and/or credit manager is also key.   They don’t fuck around. 
2	I consider happiness success and I am currently happy 
2	Yes.  I have usually reached my goals.  I'm doing ok.
1	Still in high school. It's hard not to be successful in high school. I plan to be successful in the future, the small details are just sorting themselves out.

1	i've had my downfalls, that i try to climb back from, prob only one honest here
13	19 year old ISTP with questionable direction in life considering becoming an officer in the Coast Guard	Recently, I've found out that my university is one of few across the country offering what is equivalent to ROTC but for the Coast Guard. It's called CSPI, or the College Student Pre-Commissioning Initiative, and basically works the same way, where you end up commissioned as an officer (O-1, Ensign and the ranks thereafter) for three years after graduating. \n\nI'm wondering if any other ISTPs (I've just discovered my type by the way, pretty spot on) have had experience in a military officer role and think that it would be a good route for somebody of that same personality to take on. Officer life is quite different than enlisted life, but there is not much information about it. \n\nBackground for myself: 19, male, good health etc. Studying Information Management Systems right now. Have had a couple internships at tech companies and one at a hedge fund but find the corporate life extremely boring and feel that I'd regret wasting my prime years fresh out of college working some bullshit 9-5. Want to hear some opinions on whether this is just a quarter life crisis situation or whether going the officer route for a few years after uni is a worthwhile consideration. 
16	Go for it. If I could go back and meet 19 year old me I would slap the shit out of him and say, "just get on a fucking path, any path. If you don't like the path you can quit and choose a new one, but drifting through 12 years in the prime of your life without any semblance of meaning or purpose is far worse than choosing a bad path could ever be."\n\nFair warning, there's no escaping bullshit, accept it and make the most of it. \n\nI personally think ISTPs would do well as military officers. Plus you'll probably get great benefits.
5	ISTP going commissioned officer into the army after I finish college. I say go for it. I'd say the military is a good fit for our personality, maybe not the best, but I've been in worse. \nHere's what I can offer you.\n1. I felt the same way, wasn't sure if I wanted to join the military, but the lack of structure in life was overwhelming and every job i've tried to stick with was just too boring. \n2. even if it is a quarter life crisis, if it is just a three year requirement in the coast guard, That's not a long commitment, and you'll have a leg up when re-entering the civilian life being a vet and having job/leadership experience. \n\nIf I may ask, why Coast Guard specifically? Really think about what you want to do in the military before you decide to join. Don't let a recruiter tell you what you want. But also speak to a representative of your CSPI on what you can expect, what your goals from joining are and if joining CSPI requires service (I know some ROTC programs don't require service for joining and only do upon completion of the program)
4	I went the enlisted route in the Army. Had I stayed in longer I would have gone for warrant officer as their roles are more laid back comparing to commissioned officers. I have a friend from high school who’s an officer in the coast guard and she loves it.
3	Go for it man. I've seen several ISTPs on here that were in the military and I myself am gonna join after I graduate highschool. I think the military is a great place for us, at least for a few years, as long as we get to do our job
3	ISTP female and did 9 years in the Navy but as enlisted. The military structure was very good for me. I joined at 21 after years of fast food jobs. I say go for it!
3	Hell yeh a go for it, I’ve always wanted to do exactly that but decided to prioritize education at the moment. USCG is a good bunch to be with and will be very rewarding if you go through with it. But as always, the opinion of a recruiter is worth x100 more than the opinions of random strangers on the internet.
2	Get them bars if you have it in you, make sure you're pursuing your interests as close as you can and get them in writing (contract). The military is out to get you, make sure you're taking them for all they've got.
2	I’d consider doing comsci / software dev or even data science. It’s the future. May be difficult at first, but in be long run can be very fulfilling and since it’s in demand the work conditions are generally better than most jobs

3	what kind of garbage is this, where's george thorogood

2	https://youtu.be/qOwFVowEugQ \nThis song is still so badass, even though it's at least 40 years old. I remember hearing it as a kid in the early 80's and liking it then. \n\nTo me, Alan Parsons must have been ISTP - pay attention to the lyrics.

1	My Youtube playlist of 400+ songs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnij_nwtlB-d7mrknNLTaE6kDPqbO_uOx\n\nIts mostly rock, pop, and techno but everything is there. \n\nAs long as it has a good beat/melody then it's in there.
0	I listen to the news. Fuck you. 
5	ISTPs sucking at jobs or doing stuff	are ISTP shit lawyers?
8	The answer to “are ISTP’s X” will always be: every single ISTP is an individual with their own strengths and weaknesses. There is no such blanket statement you can lay over the entire group. \n\n\nSome ISTP’s are good lawyers, some are bad lawyers. Some are good people, some are bad people. Some are good doctors, some are bad doctors. Some are good SO’s, some are bad SO’s. \n\n\nIt’s frustrating constantly seeing these kind of questions in here. 4 letters does not determine a persons life or worth. Knowing someone is an ISTP does not give you any insight into wether or not they will be a good lawyer. It’s entirely up to the individual to do the work and figure it out. 
16	[deleted]
2	Depends on your ability to remember an endless library of rules. If you know anything about functions, the job that does that best is Si, which is not a particularly strong function for the ISTP.
3	Yes. I'm only ok at my job analyzing data because I'm not a complete retard. We don't on average have admirable work ethic. 
1	I think this may be a problem during the wtf years while they figure out how to get into the field they want. 
1	Shit waiters, memory shit 
1	It depends on the nature of the work and if I find it meaningful. If it is just mindless busy work I will find ways to take shortcuts and grow bored of it very quickly. Personally I do not think I could be a lawyer because a lot of it is just busy bureaucratic paperwork you have to do "just because."
1	I think an ISTP could make a great lawyer. But, I doubt one would make it through all that schooling.
1	Idk but I'm an istp and a shit accountant
16	How do you think you're different from INTPs?	
54	We didn't get beat up in school. 
20	INTPs look at the picture on the box before assembling the puzzle. 
17	I value practical means over theoretical means. I would rather work on something I can sense in the moment than an idea that's been abstracted away. I prioritize new input and new ideas over ones that I've previously formed.\n\nI usually test between INTP and ISTP but I would say my ISTP is more prevalent because of the above.
27	We have an S instead of an N
16	My guess is sports, dangerous physical activities, more in tune with physical tasks than mental tasks. 
16	Physically talented, but poor speaking skills. Reverse is true for INTPs.
7	Doers vs thinkers.\n\nmy brother, an INTP, can sit and talk intellectually all day.  I, an ISTP, enjoy smart chat, but get very restless and feel the need to get up and do something.  
11	We’re actually pretty soft people on the inside once you get to know us, but with INTPs, what you see is what you get basically.\n\n(From what I’ve seen anyway) 
9	in my experience they tend to be more pretentious about their intelligence while ISTP’s tend to be more humble
3	I'm more social (even if not by much), competitive, care more about my image (even if not by much), down to earth, care less about learning by comparison, care more about sports and material things in general, more assertive. I more readily question mainstream science and doctors. I'm not intellectually pretentious and try not to be pretentious in general. I'm much more blunt and to the point, they're very articulate, I'm not at all. Stereotypes but yeah.
3	More aware of our physical presence, appearance, much more focused on our surroundings, sports, risk taking, more realistic/down to earth, more conventional in appearance, less pretentious, more aggressive/competitive/forceful. I think we have an easier time fitting in.
1	The INTP focuses on "what could be", whether I on "what is".
1	INTPs love complexity. ISTPs hate it.
10	I've noticed a lot of things on here about searching for infj/enfj's	I've personally clashed with J's and tend to move away from them. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me why you might be drawn to J's as more of a P person? Maybe the key is the -nfj and I mostly know -stj's? IDK just curious!
8	It's in the preferred cognitive functions.  We share all the same with NFJs, but none of the same with STJs.
5	Married to an enfj. We definitely clash.
6	You should look into ENTJs. They'll have this brand of rationality I think you'll really appreciate, plus they will share the same sense of humor on account of middle Ni and Se. They are Js, so they'll be highly effective people who are always looking to move forward and get shit done, but they'll really enjoy sharing activities with you, and when you do talk, they'll understand you in a way that almost no one else can.\n\nI could explain why ISTPs and INFJs have such a weird history on here, but I'd prefer not to. Just because something happens doesn't mean it's a good thing, and I'm worried that explaining it will make more people try to find it for themselves
4	Married to an infj here.  Overall pretty solid life.  We fill the gaps in eachothers lives.  She is much better at keeping friends in our life and creating purpose in life.  Only downside is she  doesn't like extreme sports and I feel like adreneline is my depression antidote.
3	Best friend with ENFJ here. Only met her a few months ago. Have such a good connection, bonded so easily.\n\nI like her because :\n- maybe due to J, she's decisive so it's very easy to make plans with her\n- despite being extrovert, she's very observant to the changes in my behaviour. Uncomfortable with prodding questions, being around crowd for too long etc. She'll get me out of that situation and never force me into situation that will make me uncomfortable. \n- she's the kindest nicest person around but she's also firm. She'll know if you're being manipulative and she won't let you step all over her.\n- despite being so different, I'm an atheist that smoke and drink while she's very spiritual and doesn't smoke or drink, we get along so well with other hobbies.\n- she never judge me for being different, I can be myself around her. 
3	ISTPs clash the most with -js that are sensory like them, especially ESTJs who can be bossy and overbearing, yet have none of the cognitive function that ISTPs value. With NFJs the story is much different since they not only share every function in common with STPs but also being intuitive they don't "compete" for the same sensory territory, making relationships run much smoother.    \n    \nLiving under the same roof, two sensors clash much more often because each has their own idea about sensory things and it's rare that those ideas are exactly same, so they either start arguing or one has to give way to the other. Intuitives let sensors do their own thing and don't try to override their decisions, so it's easier to get along in the long run.
2	Used to spend a lot of time with Js. I’m drawn by how much they seem to “have it together.” I also thought it’d be better for personal growth to spend time with my opposite(s). Recently I started dating Ps. It feels much more natural and fun and wish I’d done it sooner!
1	NFJs use Fe, which is in direct contrast to how Ti wants to operate. They often see us as argumentative and we see them as fake ass bitches. But we can learn a lot from each other. We are in the same quadra which also helps us see eye to eye on a lot of things, which helps.
1	The only Js I'm drawn to are INTJ.
1	I really like the Fe in the Enfj. A healthy one, mind you. Unhealthy Enfjs are a disaster just l like any other type. \nWish I knew some in real life. I only know one but he is an unstable one...\nTo me they don't seem like fakes, like some types say.\nI think maybe because Fe is my weakest that I like them? Also because we have the same functions, I think.
23	You guys are cool	I've been typed as an INTP for a while now. ISTP makes a lot more sense and I relate to you guys a lot more. Js it's cool to be here.
35	we know
10	Same, from descriptions I thought I was an odd ISTP, I relate quite a bit to INTP too. But hanging around both forums I relate much more to you guys. I love you guys <3
4	What are these, feelings!? Stop the sentimentality and ISTP up! 😏 \nP.S.: I also had a moment when I thought I was INTP, but nope. ISTPs rock 🤘
8	No, we aren't cool! The stereotype is..\n\nBut in reality, all we do is like... play, chill, eat, drink, and enjoy all of it very much. (And other things better not mentioned..)\n\nUsually alone is preferable, but not always, not necessarily... OH, and we probably also do stuff, even for you, when we are in good moods at least..
3	We're so fucked up we're awesome and we know it!
7	looks like someones trying to develop their Fe. 😂
3	Thx man😀
2	I did a ISTP vs INTP test today. It declared I am an ISTP. \n\nSo relieved.
1	Thanks
6	Those in your Thirties: As you've gotten older, how have you changed compared to your 20s?	So let's say those of you in or approaching your 30s, how has your views on love/family/friendships/hobbies, etc changed?
11	The inferior Fe is rearing its head often. I was a robot before, now I've become both more gentle and more asshole, and more emotional overall. At 37 I'm still the ticking time bomb, usually invisible, but then picking fights for perceived wrongs.\n\nOver the years I've become mostly cynical about friendships. Previously, I simply saw "people to have fun with". Now I see people who use me and dont give a damn.\n\nI submitted myself to marriage and to a fairly demanding work. Up until 30+ years old, figuratively I was not doing much. Easy life, easy job, gaming nights... Now, having responsibilities is more difficult for me than most others: I can TELL. I often very seriously want -or don't want- to throw everything to hell, simultaneously.\n\nStill doing my "man cave" nights though, I will never ever relinquish hobbies. 'Hobbies' and beverages, are the ONLY thing that makes life worth living, I only reinforce this conviction with age.\n\nBut at least I recognize sacrifices and hard working people now; I was lucky, with my overall attitude I should be living under bridges. I lived only with luck and natural talents. I've spent years to learn the work I still do now, but back then it was mostly play and not much real work, or I wouldnt have done it.\n\nRegarding love, most important is finding someone who 1) loves back *more*, and 2) has his/her head in the right place. I see married couples going to shit cuz they were either fools with money or family management, or one of them is outright evil and the other a fool for not recognizing it. So my focus here has switched completely from 'explore/fun' to thoughtful preservation.\n\nI always know though that if everything goes to shit I dont need anyone to go on in life. The only thing that really worries me is unemployment actually.. but I'm working toward financial independence in a few more years.
7	Although I was smarter in my 30s, I wasn’t smarter in areas than that actually mattered.\n\nTwenties and thirties were basically the same with the primary difference being sobriety.
6	As hell. I just accepted my dark sides.
6	It's been changing every year since my teens, maybe because my life has been a roller coaster since then, I'm 31 now and how I feel about anything is very neutral and less grounded in what's wrong or right as I was in my 20s, older I get more I realise how little I understand about the world around me.\n If I'm asked what I love or hate, what I'm for or against, I won't know what to say, except "I don't know". Life has gotten so complicated for me to take sides and commit to any idea or activity. \nI've gone from chaotic good to True Neutral.\n\nAlthough my Fe has really I proved.
4	I've dominated my outbursts and now I understand why I have them and analyze every single feeling to know why I feel that way. I'm almost 28 but I feel like I was 32.
4	No more zero days. Pick your battles. Slow and steady is best. Invest in the right people. 
4	As I get into my 30's (31 at the end of Jan) I am definitely doing the "work smarter, not harder" thing.  I am also much more organized.  I used to have a "Well it's just me here, no one else will see this - I can clean it up later" mentality.\nMy executive function is a lot better too, and my ability to accurately anticipate the activities of the week ahead.  Not sure if that's related or because of the fact that I was born and raised by addicts and didn't learn some of those basic things in the crucial windows of time etc.\n\nOne thing I still don't do is fit the suit.  I just cannot bring myself to lean down and smooch the asses of those around me, even a little bit...  For that I'm still on the bottom rung of the employment ladder with zero promotions on the horizon.  This doesn't bother me. \n\nThe older I get the more and more I want to defect from my current (and very boring) life and sort of just wing it on the road.  It's illogical but I do still daydream a lot about getting a beater car and just hitting the road.  If I had the cash I might consider it.\n\nIn the relationship department, I've come to the conclusion that I will be okay if I stay single forever.  I had my first and only relationship at 29/30 and it was very unhealthy (he was an abusive opiate/alcohol dependent) and I won't let myself be that scared and hurt again.\n\nI felt happier in my 20's despite having much less freedom to do as I saw fit. \n\nI am still notoriously slow at trying/getting into tv shows and other hobbies.  Example: I'd never seen Star Trek in my life until the other day and I quite liked what I saw.  
5	I got sober, that changed everything
4	Unfortunately not much.\n\nI'm more emotionally wise, I have better people skills, I'm infinitely more experienced and knowledgeable, I'm well traveled and I'm equally lost and unhappy as I was when I was 11 years old and fell into a nihilistic depression that honestly never left, not for lack of trying mind you, still trying to not kill myself every fucking day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent my early 20's as a workaholic on a mission to find himself, so I vagabonded while freelancing and I lived in 7 different countries, met a ton of different people, had the whole cliche fucking life. Eventually I got too tired to keep doing it, felt like years of my life wasted as I was nowhere closer to feeling fulfilled or generally happy than before.   \nI met a girl and settled to become a recluse. In my later 20's I started smoking way too much weed, still do, because honestly its one of the few things I still enjoy in life, though lately it has lost it's touch a bit.  \n\n\nWhen I'm sober I'm in my head, lost, confused, angry, sad, tired and lethargic. And my social battery is wasted, I consider going to the store a social outing and I can't fucking handle any more than that or I'll get extremely moody. I just want to be alone in my comfort because comfort is the one thing I've managed to figure out.  I like comfort and I can provide myself with it. Congrats, that took 10 years of bad decisions. Fucking idiot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n20 year old me was hopeful, energetic, diligent and hardworking, I thought I had a new start and a direction in my life and I went for it 100%. 30year old me reached a point where I just couldn't give a shit anymore. Too much suffering, too much work, I broke. I have medical problems from overworking myself and all the stress I put myself under trying to find my way etc. Now I'm just trying to live each day as peaceful and positive as I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI meditate, I go on walks to ground myself, I try to make my wife as happy and comfortable as I can, I do my job just well enough to get by because fuck me I can't stand it anymore. I'm hopeless and I feel the same way I felt when I was 15 going through my emo years. Just angry, apathetic and hopeless on repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never managed to find a place I felt like I fit into either. Or people that I just clicked with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n
3	The key differences between who I was in my 20's and who I am now in my 30’s, is that I know myself much better.\n\nIn my 20’s I didn’t really know who I was, what I was doing or what direction I wanted my life to go in, and didn’t do a great deal in my free time other than getting completely wasted at every possible opportunity. I had travelled a bit and had a very comfortable life, but I felt lost, life seemed a bit hollow. I had a lot of friends, but found the overwhelming majority of them unbearably boring, unless I was inebriated. I also found myself increasingly bored by any activity my friends enjoyed, and realised with each passing day that I had less and less in common with them. By 27 I recognized I had spent a long time trying to fit in with a group of people I had very little in common with and decided that I should instead focus on doing my own thing.\n\nI suppose the biggest turning point was meeting my significant other, someone who finds most people as tedious and boring as I do and someone whose interests and morals are much more closely aligned to my own (she’s an INFJ in case you’re interested). She brought about a refreshing change of pace in my life which helped me to focus on creating a happier life for myself. \n\nI’m far happier in my 30’s, I suppose that’s a significant difference too.
1	I am way better at talking to people in general than when I was in my early 20's but have like zero patience with incompetent people now. \n\nDumped most of my friends because they dragged me down in all their meaningless lives. Still have a few very good friends though.\n\nStarted caring even less about what people think of me than before. \n\nAs for love. No clue. I probably became a little more affectionate but most women in the western world nowadays are basic and useless Instagram addicts who think they are a very big deal or think they're super special. So I mostly stopped trying to date and I'll just see whatever or whoever comes around (hopefully) one day. 
5	Would you ever have a going away party (for yourself?)	If you planned it out, how many people would you invite?\n\n
15	Why? I'd be going away to get away from the people that would come....
10	If I’m going away... well... it’s likely because I’m trying to get away from the these people. In which case I’m just going to leave. 
8	Where am I going?\n\nI would invite like 40 people so that I can be sure about 5 show up.
5	A going away party for oneself? For no other reason than to throw a goodbye party? Organize a party? Why? \n\nMaybe a going away to prison party, otherwise Hell no.
3	I'd probably just drink alone. In fact, I have a going away party for myself nightly. It's called sleep.
3	no
3	Certainly not.  I specifically told management at one job to not even tell anyone I was leaving.
2	Nope, when I leave I go quietly.
1	"Going away" as in "moving" or "Going away" as in "I'm dead now"?  I wouldn't have the first one, but the second one sounds fun if planned right.
1	One funeral for me is enough

36	No story behind haunting is needed. It just needs dealt with. 
21	I love that. It’s not “OMG ITS HAUNTED!” Just a casual “just to let ya know, shits hella haunted” as he’s leaving with tools for the job. 
11	Is it because of my age that i don't get it or because i live under a rock?

3	pew pew pew
2	Yep that’s us.
2	ISTPs don’t believe in ghosts and if they do they ain’t ISTP
2	How often do You make phone calls/text others? check your email? use social media?	just wondering, for long distance friends, is it often?\n\nis one of those 4 mediums preferable over the others?\n\nif its social media, which one are you on?\n
9	Not much. I find pointless images saying streaks go be a shallow waste of my time, considering just not respond to her anymore. 
7	Don't have any long-distance friends. For regular friends, just short ones to plan events and establish when/where to meet and such.\n\nI have an FB account I don't use. I will never have a Twitter, IG or whatever else is out there.
4	After I went to college I've only kept up with friends via Discord server other than that I typically only text or call when I'm back in town and when I'm messaged first.
3	I really don’t really use social media much, I check instagram a couple times a day, to see what friends and family are up to, memes and news. And I only check Snapchat once a day, unles someone sends me something, I have twitter but I never use it, same thing with facebook unless it’s some event with a facebook page, my school also puts out information on facebook so I check that. 
3	i never used social media.unless you consider reddit a social media
3	I have 4 contacts on my phone: my father, a cousin, a high school friend, and the bank.  11/29 is the date of the last text I sent.  I check my email maybe once or twice a week when I'm expecting correspondence otherwise about once a month.  I no longer use FB.  I do have and sort of use Tumblr and IG but these are mainly for saving images without me actually having to file them anywhere.  I have no pressing need or desire to stay in contact with anyone else.  I hate talking on the phone and will do what I can to avoid it.
2	I had a best friend that then moved to a different country and we gradually stopped talking to each other within 1 year, we still checked up on each other like 2-3 times a year but that was it. And then like 4 years later we started sending each other a bunch of memes on Instagram and it made us really talk to each other again... now we text on WhatsApp several days a week and make phone calls sometimes (and we keep sending each other memes lol).
2	i like looking at the list changes on fb, i'm curious to see as how their algorithm works lol
2	whenever I feel like it m8
7	Do you ever need to feel strong?	I guess nobody is tough perse, we all have weaknesses and emotions.\n\nBut sometimes I need to feel strong, I want to fix this, because it comes with bad consequences, such as injures working out, risky behaviors, searching thrills and smoking too many cigs a day, thankfully I don't like alcohol nor gambling.\n\nIf you ever felt like this, how do you make it not self destructive?\n\n&#x200B;
14	Sounds like you don't have enough outlets for Se. Perhaps you should take up more constructive activities like hiking, dirtbiking, skydiving, bungee, zip lining, metalwork, woodwork, etc
3	yes! i can kind of relate though i would phrase it differently. i HATE when anyone thinks they can mess with me or that i'll be a pushover. i'm a skinny blonde girl so people tend to assume that. i don't care if you're a 220lb guy, if you say shit to me, ill say it right back. if you cut me in line (say at a bar), i'm going to raise hell and give you shit and be a PITA (for my entertainment mostly). if i'm at work and a customer is trying to get out of a deal to or get my company to spend more on engineering than was quoted, i will not back down. it's only when people cross me that i get like this, otherwise i am very passive. it's like a switch.\n\nand yes, in retrospect i've done some very very stupid and dangerous things in my lifetime. to make it less destructive, find healthy outlets for Se and develop them as habits. i definitely get more feisty when i have fewer outlets for Se.
1	One of the main reasons I took up martial arts is because I was sick of being weak and wanted to be strong.  \n\nDoing a consistent physical activity can help stave off that sudden urge to do something crazy and self destructive. When I stick to my daily routines everything usually turns out okay.  \n\nMight just be me though, I have been told I'm weird and crazy...  
1	Opening up to people about your emotions is one of the strongest things I can imagine. Others always think I'm this strong, stoic type because I'm not able to show my emotions. But deep inside I know it's because of weakness. The anxiety of being hurt rather than having full control of my emotions. This frustration of not being able to share with anyone eventually makes me frustrated, angry, and makes me do stupid shit.
1	Dude, get into rock climbing. Full body work out, mostly safe, especially indoors, and it's so rewarding to get to the top of a route.\n\nYou don't just feel strong, you feel totally in tune with your body. You really have to be aware of angles, which body part is applying a certain amount of pressure, just... Lots of stuff. Very fun!
0	I think I'll drop this here	
2	Erm no thanks 
2	Apparently it's not an ISTP thing to be bored at the prospect of watching a video? TL;DW it for us?
3	How often have you just packed your shit and moved/relocated?	Was it just to start anew or to be with someone else?\n\nDoes the idea pop up often?
5	I have done this more often than I can count or remember. Before I was married and after I got out of the army I was quite a drifter. Even as I went to college I’d change apartments on a whim. That was a good 7 or 8 years of my life. I didn’t know a damn thing about istp or mbti until years later. I look back on those years fondly and would do it again.
3	Havent stayed in the same place for longer than 2 years since I was 18. Im 30 now
1	I did once when I chose to go to an out of state University opposed to going to the much closer and cheaper school.  Kinda counts?
1	Since I left high school I’ve drastically relocated roughly every two years. I’m in my 30’s now and considering staying put a little longer this time. I want to feel what it’s like to really be part of a community or something. Haven’t had that since the Army. 
1	I'm not a mover, so I moved from my parents house, to an apartment for two years, to a townhouse for the last 16 years. Though, I'm moving now to a regular house with yard, and I plan on being there for 20+ years.
1	Just now! I happen to be packing shit together in case I have one more family argument I'll live with whatever fits in my backpack.
1	I grew up with an ESTP father that moved us to chase one adventure after another about every 2-3 years.\n\nI've continued the trend in my life.  Longest I ever stayed in one place was for college, and I still lived in 4-5 places in the town while I worked on my degree.  I'm married with a 3 1/2 yr old and resisting the urge to find a new adventure.  Don't think they'd appreciate it.  Looking to take 1-2 month adventures annually instead to scratch the itch.  Riding my motorcycle to Tierra del Fuego next year.
1	I've done this so many times and probably will do it again.
1	I've done this so many times and probably will do it again.
1	I packed my shit and went (drove) to CA at the end of 2014 and was back in the mid west 8 months later.  The desire to go initially was very strong.  The move back was arduous but I knew I'd want to do it again someday.  In the last 6 months the desire to move somewhere far away has returned and it's just as consuming.  Prior to 2014 I'd moved only one other time in my life.  Seems every 2 and a half to 3 years I want to go.  It's always just to see somewhere new and experience a different climate.  Never for people.
2	Those of you not too good at conversation): You leave a job and someone you've talked to/informed of your plans is also someone who you didn't get the opportunity to exchange contact information with but they contact you out of the blue. How do you feel?	\nSo they resorted to asking someone who worked with you? Would it be welcomed or creepy? I ask only cause we talked for long periods of time which flew by, and by the time the convo ended. We're both pretty introverted and I  guess socially awkward so I guess I related well once we finally started talking/comfortable.
4	Someone who you enjoyed spending time with went out of their way to maintain contact with you? That sounds like a good thing to me. Do they make you feel uncomfortable? I would be flattered that someone wanted to keep in touch with me, as long as they were "normal" (not creepy) about it.
12	How to improve Fe?	How to improve Extracerted Feeling? Have you find ways for that?
22	Woke ISTP here. I've made a simple flow chart for you:\n\n\nDoes this action/idea make other people happy? \n\n1. No\n\n...a. Does it still make logical sense to you though?\n\n.........i. No? Great, don't execute it.\n\n.........ii. Yes? Too bad, still don't execute it.\n\n.\n\n2. Yes\n\n...a. Does it make logical sense to you too?\n\n.........i. Yes? Great, execute it.\n\n.........ii. No? Too bad, execute it anyway.\n\n\nYou need to shut down Ti and overindulge Fe in order to become familiar with and navigate it\n
5	psilocybin mushrooms
8	just give it a few skill points on your next level up, 2-3 every level should be enough
17	Are any of you gay or bi? How do you show interest in the same sex?	If not a bar or club, how does that reframe your approach?
30	I have no fucking clue tbh I could easily hold a flirty conversation with a dude but if I had to talk to a hot chick I'd be off my shits like a giddy schoolgirl 
15	I wonder everyday if I'm a lesbian but I don't think men are the problem, I just don't want to date anyone
7	I have absolutely no gaydar which sucks so I've only ever had luck with online dating platforms oddly enough.
7	No but everyone thinks i'm gay for some reason.
8	I’m bi but I’m clueless with women. (I’m female) I generally prefer men because I like dick but I won’t hesitate to check girls out lmao
5	Yes, and (unhelpfully) I don't usually bother... The only time I'd invest that much energy into pursuing a guy is if I was already attracted to him, and they usually end up being straight. 
3	I'm bi but I'm married to a woman and have no game so that's that. 
2	Nope
2	Don't really go to bars/clubs, but guys are super easy to approach or get attention from.\n\nGirls are harder to read, but the more drunk they are the more flirty they are.\nThat sounds weird but just an observation.
2	Asexual here, it's annoying when people show interest in me because I take too long to notice and I'm never interested back. 
2	i'm bi, and i have no fucking clue how to do it
1	I'm a gay male, and I find it hard to approach other men. Not good at small talk. I find it best to show interest by just making myself present and known in hopes that they initiate some mutual interest. Familiarity tends to make the process much easier!
1	I can’t express love. I can love someone to death but there’s no way in hell I could ever express it indirectly, or flirt either, no matter what gender.
1	I'm bi. I don't really have experience nor attraction to gay men. I also wouldn't let a man lead/be dom, so it just won't happen. I don't really care. 
1	I am gay and I am frightened by the thought that I will die a virgin
5	help im stupid	 lately i've had this extreme desire to get a girlfriend but i can't bring myself to talk and this happened at school today..  \n\n\nim into this girl at school and she pretty much catches me nearly everytime im staring at her. last period today when she walked up to the trash can i was staring at her ass and her friend called her over and the girl i like said "am i being stared at again?" and then when she got close to her friend she whispered something in her ear. after that im pretty much just eavesdropping on them and i couldnt hear well but she said something along the lines of "imma look at him" and then when i looked at her back she immediately looked away and i went back to minding my own business only for her friend to say "THAT DUDE DOESNT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING" all the while im analyzing over what the fuck just happened and i got home and cant stop thinking about it  \n\n\nso yeah idk what to do 
17	Can you stop being a creep staring a people? That's not ISTP related, that's just you making it weird. You have to be a bit more aware of your surroundings and stop staring. If you stop being a creep to her, maybe it will be less awkward for a conversation to come out.
10	Talk to her? Or not, whatever. I only talk to my crush because we have a small, super laid back, chill, do whatever you want as long as you get your work done class together.  If you don't feel confident enough to talk to her, nothins gonna happen. Find an excuse to talk to her, or any future crushes, like in the class I'm in it was giving tips, and move from there.\n\nOh yeah, quit staring at her. That doesn't make girls feel good. It's not weird to look, but if you are looking long enough for it to be staring and longer yet to get caught its too much and repels them.\nBased off of her friend saying you don't care about anything, assuming they meant you, you probably got no hope. That combined with you not talking to her means get over it and move on cus nothins gonna happen anyways.
8	Talk to her and report back to this thread so you don't feel as alone. If it works, great. If not, we've all been rejected, at least the ones who have had the balls to go talk to a girl without knowing her interest. 
4	Ay, I get the staring thing. Been there before.\n\nJust try to talk to her.
3	Have you talked to her?
1	> only for her friend to say "THAT DUDE DOESNT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING" all the while im analyzing over what the fuck just happened and i got home and cant stop thinking about it \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe girl you have a crush on knows you stare at her, plans on staring back at you trying to intimidate you but fails. You're a creep on her eyes, and pretty much most people in this thread after reading what you just posted. What her friend meant is "HE DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK IF HE'S A CREEP AND KEEPS STARING!".
5	Alright, Alright who did this? [Laughing crying emoji]	
11	I wouldn’t throw away a perfectly good gator!  \n\n\nThat’s dinner *and* a new belt. 
6	Improving Se through Hobby Photography	Hi yall\n\nI have been thinking of taking photography as a hobby.\n\nDo you think it can improve my sense of sight? Distinguishing colors, shapes and perspectives better than usual?
4	[deleted]
3	Photography definitely exercises my Se. Whenever I carry my camera I'm always looking for interesting subjects, creative angles, distinguished lighting, and interesting concepts. I'm sure it will help you improve your recognition of colors, shapes, and perspectives too because you will be paying attention to those qualities because it makes a good photo. You will exercise them even more if you choose to edit your pictures after you've taken them.\n\nDefinitely one of my favorite hobbies because it gives me an excuse to get out and see things differently.
2	Had an ISTP friend whose hobby was photography. I don't think I ever knew anyone better at it. His photos were incredible. Not sure it helped develop Se so much as Ni. It gave him a way to capture a moment and capture a feeling without having to be there physically. That said, a photo was never the same for him as climbing back up to the top of that mountain all over again
1	There are many ways to use Se, but Se isn't about improving your senses. You can still have shit functionality while still using Se.
1	Yes, it does improves your sense of sight. Photography helped me with perspective balance, as well as distinguishing others from the crowd that helps me identify the person in front of me. I suggest using film camera than digital ones, though; even though digital offers you limitless shutters and bytes of pictures, films forces you to think through the reflection of your lens, makes you more cautious about wasting a frame before clicking.\n\nBesides from aesthetic value, darkrooms are fun to dabble with chemicals and such when you're done with shooting said films.
1	If someone you met found you on social media without you giving them the info/page/last name to search you by, would you find it weird?	I feel like I hit it off with someone I met but they left and I didn't realize it was for good. I like to think we had a connection in the short amount of talks but I wonder if it's all in my head my view of things, and wondering if I asked about their email/last name (phone number would be too much, me thinks) to keep in touch and see if that's cool with them? We have had maybe half a dozen but deep conversations.\n\nOr asking someone to ask for me, and then mention wanting their info?
2	I mean--if the person was fine with cutting you outta their life to begin with (not necessarily to your fault), then there's really no downside to asking for their contact info... if they think it's weird, they'll just never talk to you again, probably. If you don't do anything, then they'll also just never talk to you again, probably. You've got nothing to lose here. 
1	>if I asked about their email/last name (phone number would be too much, me thinks) to keep in touch and see if that's cool with them?\n\nhow would you get this if you're not in contact with them? if you know someone who'd have it i would definitely ask for their instagram/phone #/whatever. also how is asking somebody's last name less weird than asking their phone number
1	I mean, social media is pretty easy. With a name, a location, and a face, you can find anyone. Especially if your Google fu transfers to FB. \n\n\nMe? In a scenario like this id just test the waters. Add her on Facebook and see what happens. If she accepts, she’s cool with it and wants to keep talking. If she doesn’t, she’s out. So you get your answer without even having to message or bother her. 
1	I believe my cousin is an ISTP but he never makes sarcastic comments. Would this really be possible for an ISTP? (serious question)	We grew up together and he's quite comfortable around me, for the record (example of his comfort: he occasionally talks to me about his emotions!) :)
10	yea, personality types are just a tool to understand people better, it's not hard science in any way. i think i'm more likely to be sarcastic around people i'm not very close to, and everyone's personality changes based on their environment
8	I’m 100% ISTP and wouldn’t consider myself a sarcastic person. Sometimes I’ll mess with people but never in a sarcastic tone. Guess that just makes it lying lol. 
2	😒 this is not how any of this works TF. 
1	Maybe he hates you
1	If he’s talking about his emotions, that seems like a red flag he’s not a ISTP...
1	I didn't start being sarcastic till my late 20s
4	Is this guy an ISTP?	Some friendo told me to check this video, this character and I have similar views on politics and labour:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FZLu12T7tg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FZLu12T7tg)
12	The character is, the actor isn't.
6	[deleted]
0	If you’re asking about the actor, nobody can tell you. Because nobody here can read his mind. They see what he allows people to see, just like the rest of us. Without him taking the test and honestly answering questions, you simply can’t know. Only make uneducated guesses based on your interpretations of his words/actions. And I hope you can see how fruitless that exercise is. \n\n\nIf you’re asking about the character, in what world would it even matter? He’s a character on a Tv show. Every part of his character has been crafted by someone. He only exists when the show is on. What possible benefit could you get from knowing his type? Assuming he even has a real type. With a completely made up character, everything is consciously fabricated. Half of the point of MBTI is to understand your unconscious and why you are the way you are when you act on instinct. If every single thing he does in the show is because of a conscious fabrication of the writers, there’s no real purpose to knowing his type. \n\n\nThe only way you could benefit from knowing a fictional characters type is if all of the characters were written based on an MBTI type. Then the characters and plot would be designed to apply MBTI for deeper understandings of the relationships. But if the show is written without MBTI even being an afterthought, it means personality type did not influence the written in relationships. And of personality type is not influencing the creation of the characters, knowing their “type” would not benefit the understanding of the show. 
8	Any ISTP became rich?	Please share your experience
21	No but I plan on it, and what I plan will be.  More details in vague plan coming soon. Soon is a relative term.
7	As soon as I get my 6 figures of student loans paid off... so maybe when I’m 80.
7	My ISTP friend (35M)is a millionaire, but you would never ever guess it! He's the most down to earth guy you'll ever meet. Living in a modest house, which I found out he bought for his own savings at a young age. He owns his own business and a few years ago he was negotiating a deal to sell it with a very good profit. I said to him "Can you imagine? You might be a millionaire soon!". His reply: "I've been that for years". That really took me by surprise. The guy had just sold his dirt bike so he could allow himself to buy a rowboat to keep at his small/very basic cottage in the woods. If I (INTJ/F/36) had millions, I would have just bought the boat if I wanted it. But I guess that's why he's the millionaire and I'm not. Fuck I love and admire him!

7	Hard work?
3	I'm working on it.  Tip:  Come up with a product that people will want to spend money on again.
6	I'm trying but I also have little motivation. Maybe I'll become the young trophy wife of a 90 yr old billionaire who will die shorting after the wedding leaving me a large inheritance. (Just kidding I'm not hot enough for that)
2	Haha.. 
2	I have big dreams, realistic enough to be within my reach with proper effort. And I’m gonna fight for it regardless.
2	Rich is relative.  It's more about managing spending.  If you can make your own things, it can actually really help, mainly because it keeps you busy.   But money can't buy humility, love.

19	I’m a fan of automotive photography. I get in and out of it. \n\n\nA couple years back I did a photo/film shoot for boardwalk Ferrari at Texas Motor Speedway and got published in their magazine. As a side note, got to ride in a ton of high end Ferrari’s around the track. Even a one off pininforina 458. \n\n\nHere’s a couple of my photos. The third one is a raw photo, zero edits. One of my prized photos. \n\n\n[heres the album](https://imgur.com/gallery/kUES2He)

7	Yeah, I've made music and video tutorials about how to make music on a computer.  I publish everything as Acepincter.  I've got a soundcloud, but [this](https://soundcloud.com/acepincter/a-moment-of-understanding-1) is probably my favorite song I've made.  [Hale Noa's](https://soundcloud.com/acepincter/hale-noa-1) good too, it was a riff I heard in a dark hawaiian Jazz bar by that name.  Lately, I've been developing a video game called ChessTower.  2 months in so far, and a long way to go.  Side project, I made [Dagobah in VR Google Tilt Brush.](https://poly.google.com/view/9p8N4E2bL3m)  I guess you could count the work I did for /r/bodylanguage as well.

4	What is your favorite "adventure" you've been? on and why ?	
9	I loathe hot weather.  Anything over 65 F and my fun factor drops off precipitously.  One August we were having a heat wave in upstate New York (80s and 90s for over week).  I woke up on a Saturday and couldn't take it anymore.  I got in my car, drove to the Ottawa airport and caught the first flight to the Canadian Arctic.  I spent the next week wandering the tundra, soaking up the cool weather, untold miles from the next human.  By time I got home the heat had eased up and I was feeling refreshed.  10/10 would do again.
8	I'm into geocaching, which takes me on a lot of adventures. When I read your post, I instantly thought of this one, so this must be one of my all time favorite adventures. \n\nGeocaches are physical containers that contain a log/record book, some trinkets, and such. So you have to physically get there. This cache is on an island about a third of a mile offshore on Lake Superior in Silver Bay, Minnesota. \n\nI do like the water based ones, but this one is a whole other level. Lake Superior is no joke, it's dangerous, and this island is dangerous to land on. There's no real way to get out of your boat and onto the island, it's just a big thick rock. So I just had to suck it up, time the crashing waves right (and subsequent waves sucking back into the lake) and jump out into the water. It was about thigh high. I then had to scramble to get on the rock and pull my boat in.\n\nI survived. It was fun, and scary. Getting back wasn't much fun either, at least getting back into the boat without dumping it. I've got an album here: https://imgur.com/a/gU8KB
4	For me it's offroading, and finding secluded but absolutely stunning lookouts. With a regular stop at a natural hot spring.
3	https://youtu.be/O7DGe-vNZUk \nThis is probably my favorite, I'm not the one recording. If you don't wanna watch the video, my friend and I road tripped to AZ from Illinois. 
3	I went camping with my friends and we decided to go off trail into this huge valley so that we could chill by the rapids. Honestly one of my favorite things I’ve ever done. The entire hike took 8ish hours but it was so so worth it. 
3	Me and my best friend went on a 4000km road trip to ride mountain bikes (enduro/dh) in the neighbouring country.\n\n-Driving while blasting music\n\n-Improvising with equipment not designed to mount modern MTBs on a car roof\n\n-Discovering new kinds of terrain to ride on\n\n-Getting a flat on a gravel road and discovering we don't have a functioning jack\n\n-Sleeping in hammocs while a pack of dogs howl at the moon in the distance\n\n-Drinking cheap beer while floating on a river flowing down from the mountains\n\n-Hitting bigger dirt jumps than ever before\n\n-Trying to order food without a common language\n\n-Having the car sputter uphill due to lack of gas in a rulal area with 10km to the next gas station\n\nCan't wait for the next chance to do this. Next time we'll pack a functioning jack :D
2	Motorcycling all over usa and canada.\nIt was a great experience.
3	ENTJ/ISTP relationships	Hey guys, ENTJ here. I have never interacted with an ISTP (not romantically IMO). I would love to hear your stories and take on the matter. How do these interactions usually go?
7	I don't generally take a person's type into account when interacting with them, so I guess I can't give concrete examples from real life. But I can tell you, as an ISTP, the two things that would bother me the most.\n\n1. Your J,if it's a strong J, is going to be a problem for my strong P. If you make lists and itineraries and checklists, that's going to stop me from doing my own thing, on the fly, and annoy me.\n2. Your E isn't as much of a problem for me, I like Es. But again, don't expect me to follow suit. If you want to go out and have fun with lots of people and you think I'm going to like it, I'm not. I'd rather stay home or go out with a few people. I don't need to hold court to have fun.\n\nI'm not sure the N will bother me too much. In some ways I think it helps to offset my S, to help me see things in a way I'm not used to seeing them. \n\nThat really goes with all of the letters. I can handle J in small doses. In fact, I know I'm such a space case P sometimes that I make my own lists just to get done what I need done. But I will always have more fun "winging it" and seeing where the day or adventure takes me.
4	I've been married to an ENTJ for 16 years. She talks a lot and I listen a lot. 
5	I'm an ENTJ with an ISTP partner, and we're in it for the long-haul. We're both 30, so know what we want and are mature enough to respect each other's differences - because boy are we different. At home we do everything the opposite way to one-another, but arrive at the same result. We often joke that we have nothing in common, but he's my best friend and we have a really good life together. \n\nOur functions are quite complementary. Both very rational and pragmatic, we approach the world in the same way. We both think in systems, though his are physical machines and mine are abstract models of behaviour and processes. I respect his independence and self-sufficiency, I'm often working so it works to have two people who want each other but don't need each other. We have a lot of crossover in our interests and both like physical activities, cooking, drinking, music, travel, and have a lot of fun hanging our together even if it's just bombing on the couch. \n\nThe difficulty is that subjective Ti can just ignore outside information if it's outside of his experience, so my using stats and data doesn't often sway him. I have to walk him through the logic and see if he wants to follow. We agree to disagree a lot, and can generally laugh at each other and not take it to heart. He gets annoyed at me wanting him to join me in exercise and eating better. He just wants to do what he wants, but I need him to live a long time in good health. He's the immovable object to my unstoppable force. 
3	I clicked well with my ENTJ girlfriend. Pretty much right off the bat. Very congruent, we liked the same activities and she would pretty much plan all of them. I had to do like no work. I just showed up. She was a bit patronizing and arrogant but that could have just been her. She was annoyed that I didn't want more commitment and that I didn't need to hang out all the time. \n\n
2	From my experience, their boasting and arrogance tends to get annoying. Idk I read somewhere that they are supposedly compatible with Istp
22	do you any of you just tend to get exhausted from texting your SO?	im talking to this girl i like but i just get so exhausted and dont want to reply back but i feel forced so i can keep the relationship alive. i can, however, talk to my buddy on steam literally all day. is this a me thing or istp thing? because i remember last year i was talking to this other girl and experienced the same thing.
33	> i can, however, talk to my buddy on steam literally all day\n\n\n\nDump her, go for him.
19	you dont always have to text them, give them time to miss you and wonder what your doing. "texting should be a means to set up a meeting where you can have a conversation, not the conversation itself." its a lesson i had to learn a few times. like yea check in every so often to be a good friend but alot of times if i hangout with a girl on the weekend ill text them wed or thursday to plan something.
5	yes. it's always bothered previous boyfriends. i like spending time with my SO and doing fun things and talking in person, i don't like having unnecessary texting conversations "just because". \n\nwhen in a relationship, i usually see my SO multiple times a week to daily, so i usually don't have any new or exciting information to share in the 24 hours that we're apart or whatever.\n\nbut i don't like having pointless text convos with friends either.\n\ni don't think it means you're uninterested. i don't like texting regardless of how early the relationship is, but i still get excited about seeing the person and make lots of plans with them. i would go based off how excited you are to see her and how much effort you put into seeing her as a gauge.
4	It's a big sign I've lost my interest in romance. It usually happens two months after the best times of sharing my time with someone I'm dating. However, it's weird that I still find chatting to my INTP SO everyday fun and necessary. Maybe I'm adding discernment and wilful communication to our relationship. 
4	Maybe you just haven’t found the right girl? Okay, I’m not a super romantic person or believe in any soulmate business or whatever, but back in the day a girl I was dating used to be one of the few people that made my day better just by being around me or texting me. I know it’s not the same for everyone, but maybe you’ll find a girl who makes you feel that way too.
3	Depends on the girl. Some are very easy to talk to, and some are just a chore. Do what you did when you were 8. Avoid the chores.
2	Personal experience, I just broke up with someone for exactly the same reason. And I found it very hard to describe to her why I felt like this. Same as you, talking to friends all day is no big deal but talking to her because a chore. And I feel I'm happier now. So I'd say, yeah, find someone new. 
40	Anyone have periods of time where you feel nothing emotinally at all?	Quite frequently i will just have an absence of all emotion and its pretty annoying, for example i went away with all of my best friends for a night out clubbing and they were all having the time of their lives... But i stood there and just felt empty and bored, it annoys me that i cant seem to enjoy myself even when i should be. Even things I used to enjoy just feel hollow when I do them. Is this an ISTP thing and if so can anyone offer any advice? It's no longer just affecting me, I'm alienating those around me...
19	this sounds more like depression; go get some help dude.
5	>they were all having the time of their lives... But i stood there and just felt empty  \n\nYou don't have to enjoy yourself because they are. Pretty sure if they watch you doing a weird hobby they would be bored and you would be pumped.
5	Sounds more like depression than an istp thing.
3	Anhedonia is a common symptom of depression. 
3	This happens to me frequently too, but I may also be depressed.
3	Emotions are too complicated. I turn them off as a fellow ISTP. 
2	I think ISTP are less prone to like degenerate hobbies like partying, i feel the same
1	I'd usually book a ticket and go somewhere nice all by myself. When I come back, I have a different, fresh perspective of things or what I left off. 
1	I never liked clubbing. It kept me away from the 13 or so projects I always seem to be juggling. \n\nIt sounds like you might just not be busy enough. I get like this if I finish too many things and my to-do or to-fix list gets too short, too. 
1	Tbh I didn't know if this was a depression thing or an istp thing, maybe both feed into each other a little? I did this when I just couldn't deal with stuff but it really helped me think more clearly through things cus I was clouded by bad emotions a lot 
1	I do, but it’s not random. It’s usually when I blow an emotional fuse. If my emotions get too intense, my brain does this shut down thing. I think it’s a defense mechanism due to the amount of emotional trauma I’ve been exposed to. So whenever my emotional levels get to an uncontrollable point, my brain just sorta shuts them off and I go robot. \n\n\nI used to hate it. But now I actually like it. Why? Because it helps keep me from making emotionally charged decisions. I can handle emotions fine. Until they reach a certain point. And at that point that I can’t control them, the odds of me doing something stupid because of them goes up exponentially. So I’m kinda on board with my emotional shut down. Especially helps in adverse situations that I need logic and rational thinking to navigate. \n\n\nBut for example, say somebody rear ends me. Used to get me fuming. I’d yell and scream and get angry. But now, I get hit, and then my brain just sort of goes numb. And then I get out, civilly discuss next steps, get insurance, and move on with my day. It’s almost like a natural dose of Xanax in a stressful situation. 
1	Sounds like you didn't drink enough. Aside from that, clubs suck anyway. 
1	When I'm depressed, yes.
1	I’m convinced that no istp can thrive without therapy. we are too logical and too devoid of emotion to correctly unpack the things that need to be unpacked. If we sit there and try to figure out what’s going on in our heads through logical means, we will probably come to the wrong conclusions. conclusions that are painful, nihilistic, cynical, judgmental. find a good therapist and you won’t regret it. especially since you sound not only like an istp, but a depressed istp. 
2	When people ask you what's up/how are you, do you give the generalized "i'm good/fine"? Do you also 'throw' the question back at them?	Does these greetings annoy you? Would you prefer Hi/Hello/etc.\n\nAnd what would you think if someone asked you (in person) about the topic, how they seem trite/forced and shallow? Would it be a welcome conversation or boring?
8	"Good good, how are you?"\n\nHowever by the time I reach the end of that sentence, I'm about 10 feet away and walking in the other direction.  I sometimes hear their answer, sometimes not.  So it goes.
3	How are you today?\n\nTerrible. Thanks for asking.\n\nThat is my usual response for people who are a little too loud, aggressive, or annoying.
3	I used to be annoyed by the "how are you" greetings. My initial response/reaction would be "What do you mean?", "Is there anything specific you'd like to know?" and that would usually just leave them stunned or awkward. \n\nBut I do understand now that it is just simply part of human interaction so I'd just go with it and say, "I'm great" when I am feeling extra good and "I'm fine" when I'm feeling flat, stable or down. \n\nAlso, I would 'throw' the question back at them if I'm really curious or interested which is not very often. 
5	I usually reply "great, you?" No matter what, because I've learned it's apparently nice to just reciprocate the question. \n\nThen I tend to not leave room for more than a 1 word response. Because I generally don't care. 
3	Never. It's not my business to ask, and I "don't care", in a high-level sense. If they had an actual problem, I'd of course help if I could, but that's information for them to volunteer.
1	Depends on who they are. If they know me, I’ll give them a full honest answer. If they’re a stranger or only know my masks, I give a generalized answer. But I’m pretty much always honest about it. I won’t always go into detail, but if things aren’t fine I’ll usually say something like “it’s been a rough couple weeks, but hey, I’m pushing forward”. So it’s being honest about being in a rut, but it’s obviously not a pity-searching answer. And it’s not a heavy “life sucks” answer. Just a quick “things are rough but imma be okay” answer. 
1	I say 'decent' to almost everyone.
5	When you like/crush on someone, is it for purely physical reasons? How do you react if its another introvert that catches your eye?	If you answer is, I don't/hope they talk to me, I guess don't post that?
8	usually there has to be some level of attraction for me to "crush" on someone. altho ive kinda grown out of crushes, you dont choose who your attracted to, you can choose who you "like". but once there is attraction and they show caring, kind, honest, positive, traits when dealing with other people thats what really catches my eye. \n\nas far as introverts go i feel like its almost easier because you get the chance to talk to them one on one alot easier. introverts like to be around people and talk to people it just drains us and we need to recharge by ourselves. every once in a while youll find someone who doesnt drain you to be around and they can be with you in your recharge cycle. dont take that for granted, its pretty rare to find. 
3	First thing that catches my eye is physical attractiveness. Next thing I look for is a nice personality, someone enjoyable to be around. If those two meet, I’m in. \n\nIf it’s another introvert, for me it’s easier tbh. I think most introverts secretly like to get approached from time to time, we just don’t show it much. I don’t mind taking the initiative in conversation, but if the other person is not even trying, then I’ll probably lose interest too. 
1	Why would them being an introvert change anything? I would more likely be interested in an introvert anyway, they're more authentic (in my opinion).
2	Feeding my Se	First: Sorry if english is not good, I'm learning it:) \nI have a really good technic to feed mi Se. Is something that I do ccasionally, you'll know why.\nMy technic is so simple, choose an event of a kind of music that you enjoy (enjoy dancing), for me DnB, Psytrance is a good option. Take a dose of MDMA and enjoy. For me, MDMA is a drug that increses the senses a lot and conect's you whit the now and here. The efect that this crazy nights produce in me last for a few weks and I feel that equilibrates my life.\nI know that drugs are bad and bla, bla bla... But there are uses and uses, I use it just for have good experiences, not for scape of my life.\nEnjoy the life! :) 
3	if i can get so easily addicted to weed im definitely not gonna try and do ecstasy.
1	i prefer LSD to MDMA as its almost like it aligns all your funtions properly instead of just feeding the se, also its not always fun which is a more actuate definition of life in general and its led me to some of the most important revelations ive had
0	Technique, not technic
39	Girlfriend cheated on me and I don't care	Back story, so my girlfriend of about a year went on a trip to visit some of her friends for the weekend that go to a university 2 states away. I didn't mind it if she's having fun oh well I'll have probably have more fun playing red dead anyway. We texted and such and she never mentions anything important, but says that she wants to talk when she got back. She gets back tonight we hangout for about 4 hours and are laying in my bed and I ask her what she wanted to say. She just tells me she was at the bar and danced with this guy then made out. I didn't really know how to convey it so I didn't say anything but in my mind I just had this thought that I will never be able to be with this girl again. And I did feel bad because she was crying so it was obviously a big deal to her but I guess she will have to figure that one out on her own. \nI guess I feel bad about not feeling bad but I am relieved that I can do what I want again, which is playing more red dead redemption \n
23	Anyone who would be unfaithful, in any way, is not worth your time or effort.
30	I'm kind of under the impression that prior to this event you already knew that the relationship wasn't going to last long-term. I say this because you don't feel particularly bad, and you're relieved that you have some autonomy back.\n\nNonetheless, if you truly were invested, you might not feel too bad because she had the choice to cheat or not cheat... and she cheated. There's consequences with some actions. Simple.\n\nI'm also not entirely sure what you're asking for, whether it's advice,  a response, vent, or to hear similar stories/mindsets haha.
10	The thing I learned during years - never go against yourself. You feel bad? It is good, accept it, do whatever you want in that situation according to your feelings. I've been cheated too several times by different girls and it is the best experience I could ever have. It shows you that you are just a human, who can't control everything. \n\nAnd after I couldn't feel that she is mine. It never happened. I wanted every fucking time to gain back the feeling that she is mine. But it never happened. When she cheated, something in me said "it is over, she is not yours anymore, accept it and just remove her from your life". I don't know whether it is bad or good. But I don't want to go against me, even if it is "right thing to do". No, fuck it, Heil Red Dead Redemption😂 Btw I think the main character is ISTP.
15	Attention Red Dead Redemption 2 gamers! Arthur needs your help to escape the law, finnish the O’Driscoll’s, and get one last score! To do this, he's gonna need a couple sticks of dynamite, a lancaster repeater, and a full dead eye meter. All you need is your mom’s credit card number, the expiration date, and the three numbers on the back. But be quick, so the Van Der Linde gang can make their epic escape!
16	I recently broke up with my gf like a month ago (because of cheating and what not) and here's my take. Before I got cheated on my response to this would've been to give her a second chance because she felt guilty and confessed. Seems like the best case scenario after doing something like that, right? Well now after I got cheated on a few times, it fucked me up pretty good. You made the right move. What's done has been done, you don't make mistakes like that with someone you care about. It just complicates the relationship and it NEVER, and I mean NEVER, goes away. No matter what you or your girlfriend do to try and fix the issue, it will ALWAYS be in the back of your mind. \n\nSorry I just went on a rant, but yeah. Red dead looks fucking sweet but I'm too broke right now to afford it, plus like i got school and finals and shit. Oh well lol
6	I've just recently learned from a book written by a doctor that there are (theoretically) three types of human attachment: \n(Anxious, Secure, Avoidant)\n\nYou, sir, are of the "Avoidant" type.  \n\nI'm not unlike you.  We know people don't *belong* to us, they're free to come, go , and pursue their happiness as they please.  \n\nThe trick, however, is to learn how to listen for the matching type or work with the close neighbor.
7	You’re pretty stoic OP. You never want to be in a situation where you have invested so much into somebody only for them to fuck it up. But even if you do, you live and you learn. You can only get stronger from shit that gets thrown at you.
5	Every time I've felt the relationship I've been in going downhill, a cheating partner would have been a welcome out. I'm sorry, but it sounds like you'll be far better off! 
3	"I can do what I want again, which is playing more red dead redemption"\n\nMaybe that's why she felt inclined to cheat. Just saying. You don't seem to care much about anything in this whole post except Red Dead Redemption. \n\nThis doesn't excuse her behavior though, but you need to understand the part you played on it. It's good that she was honest with you immediately after the fact. \n\nNow it's in your hands to assess whether you even care about her and want to be in the relationship. 
3	>I just had this thought that I will never be able to be with this girl again\n\nThis is caring. If you didn't care you would just continue as before.
3	You guys (seemingly) are in an exclusive monogamous relationship. Based on her guilt, she felt that way too; and then decided it would be a great idea to betray that philosophy and fuck around with another guy.\n\nI know that you don't care, and if I were in your position I wouldn't be very moved emotionally either, but I'd also throw that piece of trash out. And I call her trash not because she fucked around with another guy, simply because she betrayed your trust and the relationship you two established. 
2	I dated an ESTP once. He denied it but there were rumors going around that he was cheating on me. I realized I didn't care and broke it off with him as much for my realization about lack of concern as much as potential cheating. \n\nI could forgive cheating theoretically, but I can't waste my time on people who if they were to cheat on me, I wouldn't even care. It sounds she just gave you the push you needed to end things regardless.

2	You guys seem to just skip the whole emotional process of these types of decisions and its pretty interesting. Efficient and sensible. Do you notice you struggle to feel emotions in general? Good or bad
3	[deleted]
1	I assume people will do as much as they can get away with. So I don't care what women I am talking to are doing when I am not there. Hell, even when I am there I don't really care as long as she isn't doing something detrimental to my health or safety or hers if she is at my place. 
1	I've never been cheated on so idk if I'd feel differently. But I dont consider making out with someone else cheating. Definitely not acceptable behavior, but ya know. Anyway, good on you OP for sticking to your convictions.

2	What do you seek in a (budding) friendship?	Guessing what qualities you like or are drawn to? What signs or things do you do for them that indicates said interests?\n\n are they other mbti types you find that always catch your eyes or repulse you?
7	Friendly but not too clingy. I have a friend in my math class now that literally follows me all around campus after class ends. I just want to eat and study on my own but he doesn’t take the hint!
5	Yes, I really like the introverted extrovert ENFPs. I also like their wit and humor.
1	I'm a senior in high school, I've pretty much quit looking for friends because I see no point when we're all gonna leave in like 8 months. \nThe people I associate with I chose out necessity to have someone to eat lunch with and their humor. I've grown tired of them because pointless, ill thought out jokes and their lack of interesting conversations and immaturity can only keep one entertained for so long. Thinking about just ditching then for a few weeks.\nNot really sure what specifically I seek in friendships 
1	Entp's I love to hate, 
7	17 and aimless in life	fellow istps, im on the verge of finishing high school and the idea of going to another place to sit down and do work for  4 more years is.... not what i feel like doing. my grades throughout high school have been solid D's and Fs. i really have no idea what it is that i want to do with my life. i got into coding for a little bit and for a while was dead set on going to college for computer science, but sitting behind a desk is also not what i want to do, as i literally do that everyday already. i think i want to be involved in something where the action is but i'm not sure what.. how did you guys deal with the tremendous pressure of life after high school? 
4	Yo dude, firstly, you’re 17. You have a whole 30-40 year career to plan for, so don’t make any rushed decisions. \n\nFormal education can be hard for P types, but it’s doable. The trick is to find a way to do it independently. I struggled to get more than a B+ until I realised this. When I was at uni i would figure out what was needed to achieve top grades in advance and focus on doing all the things I knew would help with that. Anything else was BS. Kinda cocky but it paid off and I finished magna cum laude.\n\nComsci is a great thing to study - from memory software, energy and biotech are the three most exciting spaces to get into over the next 10+ years. Also, consider doing some programming in your spare time. It will be hard at first, but in a matter of years you can make crazy money, find meaning and all that jazz.\n\nGood luck.
3	As a fellow ISTP who works at a computer all day for a software company, it gets dull very quickly. Sitting in a fucking chair all day is agonizing. Do something where you are moving around. The difficulty here is finding something cerebral enough to be rewarding. But if you find a skill or become a manager there will be enough logistics to challenge yourself. 
3	Joined the union and started an electrical apprenticeship, lots of working with my lands, always learning new things, a week of school every six weeks, no student loans and I’ll never be replaced by automated workers. \nIf I ever decide to go back to school it pays well enough that I could save up and go with my own money.
3	Learn coding, make money, spend your free time doing what you love. Don’t be an idiot. You’ll thank me when you’re 40.
3	Join the military. You will figure your life out super quick. And then you'll get a bunch of money to use along with your new motivation and ability to follow through and complete tasks, and suddenly things like college and jobs will be very easy for you.
2	Get a job. Any job. I would recommend a customer service job so you can learn some social and face-to-face communication skills that you didn't get sitting at a computer. Make some money. Use that money to travel or do something you think might be interesting.
2	I am currently coding as well. I'm in school for H.I.T and I'm seventeen. I'm tired as fuck so I'm currently working on a poetry book instead of writing essays for school because fuck no. 
1	What I did was to choose the major that I liked and that gave me lots of options.\n\n\nThen throughout my bachelors I kept going for internships or small part time work things to see what I like the most without considering my qualifications and then I found it ! For me it was something that I'm overqualified for but it made me happy :)
1	Check out commercial diving. It's the best job I've ever had. Travel the world, have adventures, and the pay is amazing. 
3	Passive income?	I noticed that ISTPs are good at creating working mechanisms but does it help to create a passive income source? \n\nHave you tried something like that guys?
4	[deleted]
2	There was a question on this recently (like past weekend), I think in r/financialindependence. Highly recommend that thread, lots of ideas. Just search for "passive income" and dig up that megathread.
1	everything you try to invent has already been invented
11	What is contact like with your (immediate) family and friends? What is the difference between a friend and a close friend for you?	How often are you in contact (phone, text, email) with immediate family members if you aren't in the same state or country? \n\nFor friends, are you any better? 
12	Months for both.
4	I'm an istp and I'm in constant contact with my immediate family, but I'm "no contact" with my relatives.. As for friends, some of them I havent talked to on months, but others I talk to almost daily or at least weekly..
3	I don't talk, i message them, if they're in my zone. For people who unfortunately close in blood line but far out my zone, i never contact them (e.g. my brothers).
2	As an istp, I’m not really in contact with any of them. Talk to my my cousin and best friend maybe once a week. Could be more but I leave it up to them to contact me. Anybody else is up to them to contact me. 
1	Snapchat is how we communicate a lot of things, that and voice
1	i usually try and text my close friends once a week usually to set up a group hangout at someone’s place, but once that’s done I’ll talk to them there face to face.  Immediate family usually only when I need to get ahold of them for something or when they need my help which is about once a week as well. A close friend is someone who I enjoy spending time with and who I can talk to about stuff on my mind, idk I only have close friends or they’re just Acquaintances. There isn’t much in between, usually acquaintances become close friends during a shared activity when I see how they treat my other friends and they’d make good additions to the friend group.
1	I try to visit once a year, but there are clashes in values.  When I listened to their values, I didn't like myself.  I'm closest to my brother, he knows me.
2	I feel that if you have high Se you'd easily belong to almist every category here.....(image by galacticpasta on tumblr)	
17	These things more so describe an HSP (Highly Sensitive Person) which has have absolutely nothing to do with your personality type.
3	These may all be things we associate with Sensation, but I do not at all think that any of them specifically indicate high Se. \n\nIf anything they look like difficulties related to unvalued sensation but I agree with the other poster that this sounds more like a Highly Sensitive Person and not type related. 
2	I'm all of these and I have inferior Si wtf
1	Almost**
1	I relate to all of these but I doubt it has to do with me as an ISTP but rather just me being really picky and sensitive (not in terms of emotions)
1	All very accurate apart from "picky eater".
1	It drives me nuts hearing others chew.
1	I relate very much, though i am not sure it's related to being ISTP.
1	High Se here, don't really relate to any of these. I got really low disgust sensitivity (and low conscientiousness in general) so meh
1	I've found that people with low Se or no Se are more sensitve. 
1	These are actually traits of those on the Autism spectrum. They can be either hyper or hypo sensitive to stimulus like this.
1	 I've always had to drink my antibiotics, my gag reflex doesn't allow me to swallow pills :(
12	What is it with ISTP/INFJs?	I find it really interesting how ISTPs and INFJs, while being essentially opposites, seem to be drawn to and often end up married. Why?
8	i’m attracted to them because i love that they’re big dreamers and they have this inner sense of morality and doing good that i sometimes may lack, but they aren’t idealistic. they will fight for what they believe in just like how i’m willing to work tirelessly for what i’m passionate about. and they are so selfless and humble about themselves that it just makes me attracted to them even more. 
5	Same valued functions in different order. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to socionics there are 4 quadras, and one of them is the Beta Quadra: ENFJ's, INFJ's, ISTP's and ESTP's. We all get along. In fact, according to socionics, the best relationships are formed here, specially INFJ + ESTP and ENFJ + ISTP (duality).
3	I guess it’s like with magnets, polar opposites are drawn to each other.
3	Weird. Im married to one...
2	My brother who is my best friend is an INFJ and my girlfriend is an ENFJ. They’re both very different than me but we get along well. 🤷🏻‍♂️
7	How easily do you hang out with people? Give out your number?	And I guess, text back?\n\nWhat would that person have to be or do, in order for you to think "yeah, I'll give you my number, it's....__"
8	Too easily … Even I'm surprised, the moment they ask I'm like "Sure !". But I'm shit at texting ... so it evens out I guess\n
3	Im usually the one asking for people’s number lol. (For school purposes). As for actually texting that number...never 😅
2	chances are, if you ask, i’ll give my number, but it doesn’t mean i’ll answer your texts or calls.\n\ni also easily prefer face to face interaction over texting or calling, especially calling. 
1	doin business, or i don't mind having them around; must be of some sort of benefit; also goes if they give me their number \n\nis that really how you spell stetoscope?
0	This must be a song for ISTPs	https://youtu.be/eKV5HOVi0r4\n\nOn my way - Phil Collins
10	Everytime someone comes around here and says they found a song for ISTPs it doesn't get a lot of support. 
5	Eh.
3	sounds cheesy like there's absolutely no heart in it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHard pass.
3	Next time pick something little darker.
1	Why?
1	No thanks.
1	phil collins has very few good songs, i think the drums are too complex to the point of interfering with everything, i just dont like them
6	How Often do you use people's names when saying Hello or goodbye?	Is it common for you/yourself?
24	Basically never. I also realized at some point a while back that I'm absolutely shit at introducing myself.
23	Never. I never use people's names. I don't know why. It feels awkward to say "Goodmorning, Tim" as opposed to just "Goodmorning."
5	Not really. I usually don't even use my teachers' names when I need to ask them something. \n\nOn the other hand, it's always uncomfortable when someone repeatedly uses my name... I think that's pretty normal, though. 
2	Yes! Why is it so awkward to say peoples names??
1	if close friend
1	Every once in a blue moon honestly. Rarely say anyone's name ever.
1	Most of the time when saying it to a close friend, but never to an acquaintance, so that they don't realize I can't remember their names properly.
1	i really only use names for emphasis (e.g. you’re an absolute idiot, Joe). it’s gotten to the point where i also don’t even use my own name and i have gone through a 10 minute conversation without ever once introducing myself formally. 
1	I rarely ever use names. Especially in relationships. I seem to use names most often at work. But I'm also horrible with names. I could have known someone for years and have no clue what their name is.
1	Never.
1	I never used to do it, but when I learned that just saying someone's name in the same greeting makes a great difference for the other person I decided the effort put into the extra syllables for a name is worth it. 
1	Trying to. I thought it's a cultural thing since English is my second language. But I guess it's just istp characteristic lol
5	How long do you keep a hobby?	
17	i do what interests me for as long as i'm interested. for most things i could end up excelling at whatever hobby it is i choose, but i don't stick to it long enough, unfortunately. 
9	I personally get really into something for 2-3 weeks, then just... get bored one day, put it away, and never touch it again. 
4	A few weeks or so. And I'm usually super invested for those weeks. One week I'm learning to solve the Rubiks kube, and trying to solve it faster and faster.. and the next week I'm into something new. 
5	My hobby is finding new, interesting, short term hobbies.
4	till i hit the learning curve, then i say fuck it, time for a new one
2	Between 2 weeks and 3 months. Then it’ll usually come back after not thinking about it for 6 months or so. 
2	Just enough to scratch the surface and feel like I understand how it works. However long that may be.
1	It's more like how do I keep this strand of hobbies. The main thing could be video games, which will always be a kept hobby, but the real question is what video-game am I no-lifeing as of late?\n\nOr with literature, what am I currently obsessed with writing or reading? Usually 2-4 weeks though.
1	I would try a hobby and after a few months or maybe a year stop. But I keep trying. Right now I’m super into board games and found a group of friends to play with. I think this hobby may stick for a longer time. I really dig it and there so many games to play, and it depends my bond with friends which helps maintain it. 
1	For as long as I'm still interested, though how expensive the hobby is, or how invested I am in it, both time and money, would probably change how long I'd keep the hobby. For example, I play airsoft quite often, (basically paintball with small 6mm plastic bb's.) And have invested around a year and a half as well as upwards of $2000. This would be a much harder hobby for me to drop than say, skateboarding. (Though I do skate.) Because skateboarding takes a lot of time and practice to show any result, and only costs about $200 for a high-end board. If I were new to skateboarding and had only spent $200 and say, 40 hours on the board, I'd be pretty bad and would probably drop it if I didn't really love it. However, airsoft is rather easy to play with little practice and still have fun. Renting a gun and mask for the day at your local field shouldn't cost you more that $65 for the day. That's enough time to decide if you could see yourself playing the sport/game. Within a week you could have the best gear, best guns, and be working on your tactics. Much more for your time in a sense. Sorry for ranting on for so long.
1	Depending on what it is, anywhere from 2 weeks to 2-3 years. I began woodburning, aka pyrography, for about a month before I lost interest. I was very into digital art for almost half of a year, but got bored when I couldn't practice everywhere (and before I shelled out the money on an expensive tablet). I did nature photography for about a year. My longest-running hobby right now is growing weed.
1	It depends how long it stays interesting, it gets boring once I feel I have mastered it.\n\nMy longest running are probably photography (8 years) and growing orchids (~3 years) with no end in sight for either.  My interest does tend to wax and wane, I'll take a break occasionally but always pick it back up with renewed vigor eventually.
1	Years.
16	Why am i starting to hate myself?	I regret posting that thing on the internet because everyone ignored it. Probably cuz it was too cringy. Even my friends and close ones too. I start d having fears out of nowhere. Fear of rejection, and when I removed this fear, I had no clue what to do or say with people, almost as if I'd lost the self I had  had two days ago. It's almost depressing. I have a girlfriend. She's amazing. But i don't want to stay this way. I want to go back. Go back to being myself. Go back to having fun when I'm with myself, or others, or strangers or anywhere. I want to go back to a few days ago. It feels like everyone hates me, which they probably don't. But idk what action to take to get back. Is this inferior Fe?
9	I think that's some cold hard anxiety, my friend. Might have nothing to do with being an ISTP, you just sound a little stressed and anxious. I get what you're feeling in random waves sometimes, but with a splash of existential crisis about the planet falling apart. You're not alone, check out /r/anxiety and similar mental health related subs, they can only help.
6	Lately I feel really upset, annoyed, lack of motivation, confusion and just.. feel ugh. I can’t even describe it.
3	I think I know where you're coming from, I feel the exact same way. I've been pushing my friends away and trying to make connections with strangers who end up rejecting or ignoring me for saying lame, awkward shit. Honestly, it could be the season bc I didn't feel this way in the summertime.
4	It sounds like you're in a really negative self-talk place. This could have come up for any number of reasons - the holiday season is pretty intense.\n\nThis was really difficult for me to do at first, but hearing positive things helps. I use the Insight Timer meditation app. There's lots of positive affirmations and it helps hearing another person's voice saying them. \n\nThere's one called "theres nothing wrong with you" that helped me IMMENSELY when I got hit with anxiety after my big cross-country relocation. It's a bit new-agey but if you just focus on that statement "there is nothing wrong with you," it really helps. \n\nI thought it was so dumb at first but honestly I was desperate to get out of the negative spiral I was in. So I tried it. And I think it really helped my sub conscious start to pull itself back out of the fear-hole it was in. \n
1	Get out of your head. I suggest meditation and finding a purpose in your life. If you have a purpose, a mission you can focus on you will care less about stuff like this that doesn't matter at all.
1	Let's all remember that seasonal affect depression is a real thing!  Winter is nearly here.  We're Mammals! Instead of hibernation, we depress.  Make sure you're minding your body, get that vitamin D, exercise and as much sunshine as you can!  Go get a tanning session.  It will really help.  You have to listen to your body, and answer it.
-3	r/seduction
9	Meditation + Se + Tip	Hi.\n\nIf you want to meditate the easy way, get a rosary and positive affirmations or prayers if you are religious.\n\nSe will pacify by touching beads in a repetitive way.\n\nTi will shut up by thinking a sentence in your mind in a repetitive way.\n\nNext is Nirvana's gates.\n\nCheers!
13	Incorrect. To mediate the right way, you must crucify the vast numbers of heretics roaming our planet and create a giant pentagram from their corpses.
5	Basically, [mantra meditation. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.wikihow.com/Perform-Mantra-Meditation%3famp=1) 
3	Lord Jesus Christ Have Mercy On Me A Sinner
1	Eh, IDC to meditate. Tried it for a little while a few years ago and now my mind is quieter than it used to be. 
1	Much prefer to just do body scan meditation to remind yourself to stop holding onto tension.
1	To me,  meditation seems unnecessary for ISTP's. It's a way to get out of your head and be in the moment. This would be really helpful for my ENFJ friend who gets depressed when she's alone with her thoughts too much or my INTP dad who's so in his head it takes him half a minute to realise I've spoken to him. for me, spending time forcing myself into my mind and thinking about things that I otherwise wouldn't - such as my emotional state - would be far more beneficial.
0	Who is more Istp from Sega? Knucles or Tails?	Oh, yeah! I don't forsee any problem trying to do with my hands what the world's fastest runner does with his feet.\nKNUCKLES THE ECHIDNA\n\nTails has a distinct love for mechanics and he finds himself most at home in his workshop working on his next creation. Despite his great skills, Tails is very humble about his abilities,[14] never giving them many thoughts, though he has yet to discover his true potential of what he can accomplish.[15] At the time of Sonic Lost World, Tails has become more confident and outspoken about his intelligence, though he still does not openly brag. Regardless, he has been known to mock Eggman's own creations, and sometimes Eggman himself.\n
3	I saw them as ESTP and INTP respectively.
2	Yes.
2	Knuckles because I enjoyed playing him more in Sonic Heroes 
1	SHADOW THE HERDGEHOG\n\n/s
1	Knuckles is an ISTJ and super S, Tails is super N. I seem people type him as INTP and INFJ mostly. Knuckles is technically closer
18	Is this an accurate understanding of our feelings?	It's no secret that us ISTP's are abysmal at expressing our emotions. If someone confronts me about my emotions out of the blue, chances are it's the first time either of us are hearing what's coming out of my mouth and will only be 30% accurate.       \n\n   \n\nI think the issue is that other people  (specifically F types) are constantly processing their thoughts. Their brains devote some of it's energy to processing their feelings by default and thus they have a natural understanding of how they feel. If i wanted to get the same level of emotional understanding, I would have to set time aside and actively think about my feelings. Given enough thought I can understand them and then convey them in a way that makes sense but I would never think about them without forcing myself to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else feel like this makes sense or am I trying to force a cube through a triangle hole?
8	>I think the issue is that other people (specifically F types) are constantly processing their thoughts. Their brains devote some of it's energy to processing their feelings by default and thus they have a natural understanding of how they feel. \n\nNah bro I'm INTP. We think constantly but im no closer to being emotion savvy than any of you. Its Its not about the thinking... F types DONT think or process constantly, they FEEL constantly. Sounds like a nightmare... ughh
5	I treat my emotions like a small feral animal - a lot of patient waiting and sending of assuring vibes (to myself) is involved. Days later I might be rewarded with it poking its head out of its burrow and I MIGHT be able to identify it. It’s kinda like being a wildlife documenter. It’s not a process that can be rushed. \n\nTi is the worst way to go about trying to decipher how I feel.  So I use my other functions:\n\nSe: My body tends to respond to how I’m feeling (even if I can’t identify it), either with a sensation (sleepiness or fatigue for sadness) or a  physical energy (violent, jerky movements for anger). I might cognitively not identify I’m upset about something, but if I find myself slamming mugs down harder than usual and throwing things around, it forces me to acknowledge I AM angry. \n\nNi: My dreams speak to me regarding my emotions VERY clearly. It can be a dream plot that has nothing to do with what’s going on IRL, but I’ll wake up and go,”ah, that dream about trying to save the goldfish from the leaky bucket has everything to do with the anxiety and frustration that my job is currently causing me” \n\nFe: I’ve found I might lack the vocabulary to identify what I’m feeling, so sometimes I rely on people with high F functions to help me name what I might be feeling. It’s easier to quickly identify what it’s NOT, and go through a process of elimination until I narrow it down. \n\nThem: are you angry?\n\nMe: no. Not full on angry, more like-\n\nThem: frustrated, cranky, annoyed?\n\nMe: Annoyed. \n\nAs always, accuracy is important to me. 
2	I agree
1	Yes, honestly I feel like it’s a curse sometimes 
1	I can relate
176	i feel attacked	
57	"will never shed last defense mechanism of aloofness to attain said intimacy"\n\nthis hit home.
35	Ouch. Dude, not on a holiday. 
16	"Cherishes the smiles and laughter of others but cannot overcome crushing desire to be alone," as I sit here alone on Thanksgiving instead of at my friend's house.
16	"he's weird but he's funny"\nOw
14	Accurate with the exception of imposter syndrome, but then again I'm not a person with great achievements...or am I? 
11	Someone's been observing me from afar -_-
9	lmao why is this accurate? xD
6	Some of these don't apply but the most important ones do. I guess i got got.
6	Wow. What the fuck? I have never seen such an accurate starterpack.\n\n\n\n\n\n
3	Replace joking around with talking, and it describes me too well. Even though I can become "*comfortable*", there is a small bump here or there that keeps me from being fully relaxed around people other than my family.
3	Once I remember hanging out at a friends house, and since they were smoking weed, I smoked some too, which makes my awkwardness skyrocket. As I walked to the bathroom, I remember hearing one of them saying something along the lines about me not even seeming human, like I am an alien or something. I don’t think it was meant as an insult, but it just made me painfully aware of how weird I must be to others. My saving grace is that I have an easygoing demeanor so I come across as “weird but funny” vs strange and threatening. 
2	haha lol
15	ISTP Google search	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/4p2t32k0dyz11.png
10	When ever has google lied?
6	i wouldn't say I'm sociopathic. Is that how we come across?\n\n&#x200B;
5	ISTPs not stupid. The rest of it is accurate especially in my experience. :p\n\nINTPs are apparently: Cute, mean, annoying, lazy, the best, the worst, mean, just like cats, jerks, funny, and dangerous. I agree with the cat part. The rest is case by case.
2	ISTP is more grey compared to other types I think. I had one guy say I'm too aggressive to be an ISTP, and some other dude said I was too passive to be an ISTP, like WTF?
2	Female ISTPs in fiction	Anyone know any? Ideally I'm hoping to find love stories involving an ISTP girl and an ENTJ or ESTJ boy (following Keirsey's model)
15	I think Katniss is supposed to be ISTP and that makes  sense to me because she does a ;ot of things that I would do as an istp woman.
10	Maybe Arya Stark from Game of Thrones? Although there’s a lot of debate about what her type would be. 
9	Black widow is probably ISTP
7	Jessica Jones from the Marvel Netflix series.
7	Lara Croft?
6	• Rosa Díaz from Brooklyn99\n• Jackie from Nurse Jackie\n• Lisbeth Salander from Girl With a Dragon Tattoo
4	I feel like the male and female lead characters in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets were a decent example of an ESTJ male and ISTP female.\n\nI kinda hated him, to be honest, so I found their romance irksome.
3	the hot lesbian from haunting of hill house
3	Shego from Kim Possible, so proud that she shares my type \^\_\^
2	Robin from How I Met Your Mother
2	 Any female character in a movie that has a non-existent love life or runs away from a potential partner. 
1	Not 100% sure about the characters' types but maybe try reading Graceling by Kristin Cashore. The main character Katsa is somewhat ISTP like. 
1	Been reading this book series from Robert J Crane called The Girl in the Box. I think the protagonist is an (unhealthy) Istp.  I like reading it just for her.
1	Beatrice Prior from the Divergent series 
65	Is this a typical ISTP trait?	My girlfriend (an INFJ) has mentioned that she is shocked by how much research I do before any more-significant purchase, be that anything from a torch, to a pair of headphones, cameras, a laptop, a car or our home. She agrees that some research is important, but is always surprised that I’m happy to spend weeks or months researching every aspect of somethings functionality, quality or construction and how it compares to everything else in the market. Apparently this trait is all the more bewildering as it starkly contrasts with the way I live the rest of my life, which is apparently a mix of reckless abandon and hedonism.
55	I do it too, because i always want the best shit i can afford and also don’t like to be taken for a fool, paying too much for something or what not. 
26	*slowly raises hand and walks away*\n\nOkay but seriously, it's like looking up interesting products, reading *every single review* and comparing features and specs until you practically know them by heart is one of my favourite hobbies. \n\nHalf the time I either end up buying them impulsively, OR quickly closing all the tabs without buying anything out of feelings of guilt\n\n
12	I also do this. I'm trying to figure out a way to make use of all that information.\nLike when I built a PC I researched everything on my own and learned a lot, now I'm helping my brother and a friend pick parts for their PCs
7	Can also say I do this as well 
8	To be fair, more significant purchases are a lot of money so I’d want to be 100% certain ill still like  it when “better” things are in the market. But mostly i do it so that i find the best price and value for what i buy. Prevents impulsive buying too
5	I'm pretty selective, if that's what you mean, yes.
5	I do this as well. It's not even so much of a "I need to know I'm getting the absolute best deal/best item on the market", it's more just curiosity and wanting to know everything. 
5	I thought I did a lot of research but my ISTP husband researches things for weeks (for me it's a few days). Then after he purchases them he researches it some more to see if he could have gotten something better. It does seem different from how he approaches pretty much everything else in life. Once I make my purchase I don't look back because I'll likely get agitated. He knows he will and does it anyway. 
2	Sometimes. More often it’s completely spontaneous.
2	I definitely do, but also very basic things. Takes me at least 30 minutes to pick out a new deodorant. Gotta make sure I’m making the right choice!
2	You and me both. I hate spending money. So I make damn sure what I’m buying is the best I can get for the money I’ve giving up. 
2	totally relate. took me forever to purchase a set of wireless earbuds. I refused to spend for name and high priced options when they lacked battery performance or other features I wanted. I researched and waited. maybe as ISTPs we see through the marketing and gimmicks. finally waited long enough to see the release of a pair that had fantastic battery life, good sound, the latest Bluetooth spec, was on sale and priced only $40 instead of more costlier big brands that had yesterday's BT specs. \n\nyeah I'll research and patiently wait if needed.
1	Haha are you me
1	I do it as well
1	Nah, that sounds like an Enneagram 5 trait more than anything.\n\nIf I spent weeks or months researching anything purchase-related that would indicate a lack of conviction about the entire endeavor.
1	I do this too.
1	Im like that as well. My main motivation is making sure i dont regret my purchase. expensive or cheap, i want to know what im getting.
1	i barely do that, i just look at reviews, if i'm feeling up to it. i just look at whatevers cheapest
1	Yes that is a cause coming from our role. As ISTPs are Mechanics, they want every fu**in gear in the mechanism to work properly.
1	I do that too. Also researching a lot and giving it time lets you realize if you really need it or not. I don't need extra shit lying around.
1	I don't do this
1	yeah idk i just like finding the best of whatever i can get, i'll spend hours and hours looking for clothes (even though i don't care enough to buy most of them) and i'll always do my research with technology or whatever
3	Curious, what makes you want to talk/Approach someone?	Just curious, I'm an introverted male and wonder what this other guy is interested in talking about with me? He doesn't seem to interact with his co-workers or other people, but we had some talks here and there which seems like he overshares with me (nothing uncomfortable, but in essence, he treats me like we're already friends).\n\n\nNot sure if my type matters.
15	i’m not gonna lie, i don’t approach anyone unless i have a reason to, and more often than not, being attractive or even seeming like an interesting person still isn’t enough to make me want to approach you 
12	1) I need something and they can presumably assist me. \n\n2) A life or death situation and they can assist me. \n\n3) I can’t think of anything else...
4	[deleted]
1	> he treats me like we're already friends\n\ni do that, idk why, must see you as a friendly person
3	Do you have a lot or a few friends? Experience loneliness?	I know they aren't really the same question but having the former sorta helps with not experiencing the latter.
9	Friends...: maybe like one; acquaintances...: maybe eight.
5	I've got a lot of friends and I experience lonleyniess.  Specifically right now.
4	Few acquaintances, one person I will consider a friend because she seems to be taking interest in me as well and isn't just there like most people. Feel lonely a lot of the time, especially at times like right now where I'm unsure of the future and feel a little purposeless 
4	When I was younger I used to have about 2 or 3 best friends, but after I lost trust in people (some stupid kid drama that really affected me for some reason. I think it was my family's reactions to my situation that made me feel like I shouldn't trust others to the extent that I had before). Now I like floating around and talking to almost everyone except people who are annoying as heck/are very hard to take seriously. As for loneliness, I guess I see close friends/groups and wonder what that would be like, but I realize pretty quickly that it would just be too much work to keep the relationship going. 
4	i have a lot of acquaintances that would consider me their friend, yet my real friends are far and few between, yet there are a few. however, despite all the people/connections in my life, i still feel empty or lonely since i have rarely talk about my feelings or problems, even to friends, which just makes me feel like i have no one to really talk to even when in reality my friends are nothing but supportive. 
5	Zero friends here. Zero socializing for me. Let extroverts have all the fun. 
3	theres alot of people who have many friends yet feel alone, just like there are many people who have few friends but are never lonely. \n\ni think loneliness isn't about having people around you as much as it is about you being okay with being by yourself. that mixed with the feeling like you cant properly articulate your feelings to anyone. And yes with practice and deliberate introspection you can learn to process your emotions and i think alot of the way we do that is through dialogue.\n\ndialogue with ourselves or others(i think we need a healthy mix of the two) it doesnt matter but the more you do something the better you will get so yea you suck at first and people wont understand but youll get better and ive foundbeing ablt to communicate feelings is very important to maintaining healthy friendships with say feeling types(our ideal dating match is ENFP apparently) who use the way they feel to describe stuff. also those feelings arent going anywhere. the sooner you learn to deal with them the better off youll be in life.
2	I am a male. My 2 closest friends are females. Most my friends are female. I’m told women gravitate towards me because I am quiet, don’t complain, I’m good with construction and handyman stuff, and I give off a not giving a damn vibe.\n\nI don’t really feel lonely when I’m alone. Actually I struggle to imagine what it’s like to be married for the rest of my life. Constantly in the presence of a family.
1	Two or three good friends. A number of old friends/acquaintances I don’t see that often but keep in touch with on occasion and see maybe once or twice a year. \n\nLike everyone, I experience loneliness from time to time, but I have no desire to make more friends. 
1	Lots of friends and 3 people I consider my best friends. I get lonely but not because of interpersonal relationships or lack of them.
1	I miss having a crew but then I like being alone so... meh
1	Bunch of acquaintances. Few that I consider as friends. None that I think fully gets me/can rely on. I’m not emotionally attached to any one of them. (I noticed that I tend to keep people at a slight distance where I won’t feel hurt if we started drifting apart.)
1	Not loneliness, somehow I seem almost incapable of that, despite having some extreme emotional highs in general. But I have nostalgia.\n\nThere were a few incredibly good years for me, beginning when I was 11 y.o. in 1992, had a few friends, up to 1995. My life was something out of a retro-wave music video, just spending all day everyday roaming outside with the guys, or playing ancient games at somebody's house when it was too cold to go out.\n\nBut in the end I treated everyone as disposable, and sometimes slightly shit; made zero effort in any case, I was too self absorbed in having fun and generally only minding my own business, and my social anxiety did the rest as I'd just avoid any situation with many/new people involved.\n\nEveryone went more or less his own way since high school, when instead we could have sticked together. I realize now that the truly good things in this life are unique and will not repeat.\n\nAfter, I've been a mostly happy loner with only sporadic friendships. I've a good wife which I consider my best friend, and maybe one guy... "maybe" because it's over the internet but he's the only one I almost talk to on a regular basis.\n\nRegarding "real life" friends, it's just too much of a hassle to maintain them; I'm lazy, avoid chit-chat, and generally dislike prolonged company unless it's for a specific task. Even if I know someone decent, I always drift, they remain just acquaintances.
1	good friends? i have many.\ninner circle? i have few.\n\ni do experience loneliness from time to time. i used to not. i used to be completely fine being by myself and just enjoying the silence. i find it a little difficult to do now.\n\nthe primary cause, i suspect, is because i live in a single dorm room at the moment, while that seemed like a dream come true on paper before i became a resident, i quickly realized it isnt always that great,\n\nwhen im studying, it feels rather empty (especially since i didnt bother decorating my room). thing is, i cant study around other people because it is hard to focus. immediately heading to my room after classes, taking a nap, then sitting in a chair for long hour sessions and being mentally drained at the end of the day is exhausting. even moreso since it's my routine for 6/7 days. while i dont normally mind being on my own, at this point in the school year, the monotony forces me to want to have some social interaction to break my pattern. i dont feel this way when school isnt in session though. i enjoy spending my free time on my hobbies that i put on hold while in school.\n\nwhen i can, i try to get a bunch of my friends/classmates together to go out and eat because, like me, theyre stuck on campus doing the same thing everyday. after a few hours though, im grateful that i come home to my own space where i can unwind and recharge. even though it was my idea in the first place to go out with friends, it is still a draining activity.\n\ni think it is important to balance out alone time and time spent with others, so that's what i try to do.
1	Two best friends, one lives 4 hours away,  the other lives 1 hour away and can't drive yet. I have a handful of other friends who live 30min-1hr away, most of whom also dont have cars.\n\nI don't get lonely, but I think that has more to do with being introverted and having a pet.
1	i have a few friends, usually from different groups, like it's rare for me to be in a group. it's always me and a bro-in-crime idk but getting older it's kinda getting a bit weird to be completely honest with you, therefore solitude is becoming a more preferred choice of existing. then sometimes something snaps in my brain and i wana be around a lot of people
1	I have a sizable amount of friends and like 4-5 are close friends. And I still feel lonely like every other night.
4	infp here, having a hard time with my istp	asked for space a few days ago to reflect on our relationship because i just haven’t been as happy lately. i feel like he is desensitized to everything and never shows emotions besides pretty much being neutral all the time about things (or angry). I also feel like he doesn’t try anymore.. not like when we were first seeing each other. we had a conversation and i addresses how i’ve been feeling and how being an emotionally deep person sometimes clashes with his personality. it’s been a few days and it’s been challenging, i’m on the fence between staying with him or not. He says he would do anything to keep me around because he loves me and really enjoys my company. I just don’t know if we will ever be on the same page emotionally
4	Being on the same page emotionally is never going to happen. Please take comfort in accepting this truth, but use this a curbing point to get to know him, especially his emotional side. \n\nRemember that you lead with Fi. You can know, tell and understand the emotional atmosphere of a person, situation and a relationship between two people. ISTPs lack that. Sorely. Imagine yourself being ahead of a lifetime when it comes to emotional awareness. \n\nWhat you're struggling with right now must be same proportions of chaos in his mind. He's probably thinking of ways, solutions and some internal shit you might not probably understand. Heck, ISTPs are horrible at showing/telling what we feel unless probed harshly or treated with desperation, which shouldn't be the way to go for you.\n\nI can say I have a better understanding of this conflict because my ex is an INFP and it's the most intense rollercoaster I ever experienced. He was unhealthy so his uncertainties and perceptions of me led me to emotional punishment (withdrawal, passive aggressiveness and making me feel not good enough while being happy with other people). That amplified the hurt and the already appalling emotional distance between us. \n\nIf he hasn't given up on you, if he hasn't verbally said that you're becoming a burden (emotionally), then recalibrate your expectations. GIVE SPACE to your relationship and start knowing him from scratch. Ask lighthearted questions, not probing ones. Teach him to feel. When my ex and I fought intensely, he'd sit at a corner, play his guitar and listen to good nostalgic music. He'd even pour me some whiskey. That was so calming, a breather between our eternal conflicting perceptions of each other. \n\nWe're sensors, so little good things (sensations) that you show us would go a long way. Compliments work so much as well. Also, be independent and in control of yourself. You should be responsible for what you feel.\n\nI hope this helps.
5	You probably never will be. I feel like I'm a generally happy person, but when I think about it I don't usually feel happy, I just behave as if I'm happy and really feel neutral most of the time.\nIf you aren't happy leave him, or just do something to spike his interest and get him involved again, whichever
2	i have a friend going through something similar except she’s an ISFJ, so she’s a pure romantic and is very open about her emotions. what i’ve found is that you guys will have to sit down and really talk about this. it’s not just a matter of whether you love him enough, but whether or not in the long run you can live with someone who might not be emotionally ever on the same page as you and he can live with someone who expects  maybe more than he can give. \n\non a more positive note however, you guys might come to the conclusion that you guys want to fight for your love and work on your relationship. with open communication on what you need from him to feel loved (i recommend reading up on each other’s love languages) and what he can realistically provide to make you feel loved, this relationship does have a shot at working out. i do feel the need to warn you that you shouldn’t try to change him either, in my experience, there’s nothing worse than trying to get an ISTP to change if they don’t want to. i don’t want to sound all cheesy but if his feelings are indeed that strong that he’d do anything to keep you around, he will try to change to be a better boyfriend for you. 
2	I know it's been a while but I wanted to chime in!\n\nI'm ISTP And been with my INFP boyfriend for going on 8 years now! We certainly had this issue come up, especially in our early years.. it's really hard to be expressive in ways that are easy for him to feel. I try to make up for it with more hugs and like, bringing home a snack I know he likes if I'm at the store lol If you can come up with ways he could express he cares that aren't directly emotional, it might help out. He's probably kind of panicking about what to do... \n\nIf he says he still loves you and wants to stay together, believe him. I know that much.\n\nNo ISTP would lie like that to stay in a relationship lol they'd just let it go! 
2	To me it sounds like inside he really wants to be with you. Take him at his word on that. ISTPs say it as we see it. We do have a hard time expressing or talking about our feelings. It just goes with the territory of our reservedness and need for privacy. However, not all ISTPs are completely opposed to sharing those things. We just need to do it on our terms.\n\nI really don't mind supporting and listening to someone else's feelings as long as it's kept calm (for me without anger or yelling). Sadness or crying gets me to empathize more actually.\n\nWhen you express your feelings, what are the common tones, emotions used?\n\nWhen we care for someone, it adds a new layer of stress when things are rocky, but we can grow to work with what our partner needs. Maybe reread what the traits are for an ISTP and ask your partner if they might be willing to read your traits. Don't force an ISTP to do anything though. Sometimes just chill time together without any pressure is just the thing to get us to give back what we know our partner needs. It should be reciprocal if he wants to be happy.\n\nDon't give up yet. We are capable of understanding feelings in the right environments.
4	What does the ISTP thought process look like with their functions?	
20	*Me riding my bike*\n\nSe:*see’s a group people* Hey, there’s a bunch of people there, and they’re kinda in our way.\n\nTi: Ok. I’ll figure out a route we can take to maneuver  ourselves through them. *creates route*\n\nFe: Maybe we should find a different route so we don’t hurt anyone...\n\nTi: Nope. If we take the route I just created, no one will get hurt and and we won’t waste time going the long way. Besides, if they see us coming then they should move outta the way. \n\nNi: I agree with Fe. Like, what if something goes wrong and we crash? What if someone calls the cops? \n\nSe: *pedals faster*\n\nTi: *to Ni and Fe* Oh look at that, we’re already here. \n\nSe:*succesfull takes Ti’s route*\n\nTi: Mission accomplished. \n\nFe:*to Ti and Se* you two are so reckless! Think of all the people you could’ve hurt!\n\nTi: Ok, but think of the all the people we *didn’t* hurt, aka zero. \n\nSe: *high fives Ti and continues pedaling*\n\nFe: I hate you both.\n\nthe end
8	Deducing what the best way of doing something is off of surrounding evidence, hoping it goes well, if not trial and error, or if really desperate someone credible for help.
5	can I eat it? can I fuck it? can I buy it?\n\nmy only thought process
14	istps mastery?	istps why are you such masters?\n\n\nalot of istps i see tend to master a specific skill and become really really good at it?\n\n\nhow do you guys do this?\n\n\neg.Miyamoto Musashi(greatest samauria)\n\n\nsteve jobs\n\n\nMagnus Carlsen(world no.1 chess player)\n\n\nclint eastwood\n\n\neminem\n\n\nDavid Blaine\n\n\nsnoop dogg\n\n\nbruce lee\n\n\nso first question?\n\n\nhow do you guys become so good at your chosen art?\n\n\nquestion2)?\n\n\nwhat skills are you planning, or mastering at the moment in your lives?
43	I don't know about other ISTPs, but if I'm interested in something I have to know as much about it as possible. I can't stop myself finding out how it works or reading about it and researching it. My curiosity is pretty insatiable.\nSecondly, I don't plan on mastering anything, it's more sporadic than that, my brain just bounces from one interest or obsession to the next.
19	Because when there’s something we *want*, we can’t be stopped. When there’s something I want to be good at, or want more knowledge on, there’s a constant inching and nagging in my brain forcing me to get better at it. So I do. \n\n\nPlus, genuine enjoyment of the activity at hand leads to many many practice hours while also looking for better and more efficient ways to practice. \n\n\nLike me for example. I’m a gearhead through and through. Building and racing cars is my Dream. I have a project race car that’s almost complete. But I can’t drive it or race it yet. Even though I have a constant 24/7 urge too. So what did I do? Went out and bought myself a full racing simulator, built my car in it, and set the sim settings to feel like my car does. So now I get to practice driving my car on many real world race tracks. Without even having the thing finished yet. 
12	I just get bursts of energy for a topic where I could spend 16 hours a day doing it no problem. And I try hold on to that feeling for as long as I can, but eventually I get bored of it and it will feel like a chore to do. Then I wait for the next burst. It usually cycles between my hobbies with a new hobby being thrown in the mix every once in a while. 
6	When i get something new to play witch, new tools for a hobby, new video games, new truck parts, i have to read EVERYTHING about it. If im playing a game i want to maximise my effeciency 100%. Theres just something about being thorough and effecient that is appealing.
4	i wouldn't say, "master" i'm able to gain above average knowledge on a multitude of topics/skills but i would not say i'm known for a very deep understanding of one topic
3	Voice acting
3	If I feel the burning sensation to know something, I keep throwing myself at it until the fire burns out. Find a hobby, learn it, master it (or at least feel comfy about my knowledge), find a new hobby. That is my circle of hobby life. This also applies to my life in general. For example I went and looked to the control scheme for PES 2019, reason: to mitigate my lack of experience with the knowledge and usage of game mechanics. \n\n\nNot a specific thing is on my scope of "mastery" at the moment. I'm more into being a jack of all trades than a master of one, so it is best for me to keep my mind open about new things.
3	If I want something badly enough, I will put everything else to the side and do it.  There is no stopping me. \n\nFor me it was first soccer, then climbing, then cycling, then Crossfit, and now I'm doing olympic weightlifting. 
3	It’s all about interest. If I’m very interested in something I dedicate all my energy and focus into learning all that I can about that thing (right now it’s nothing tho) until I’m bored of it. It becomes obsessive where I learn enough so that it seems like I’ve mastered, but I really haven’t. Mastering things never happens for me because I eventually lose interest and move on to the next thing. I think this is why ISTPs seem like masters because we’re able to absorb information quickly and learn new skills.\n\nTo put it simply, it’s like eating your favorite food-you keep eating it because it’s so good, but eventually you’ll get tired of eating it all the time and move on.
3	focus.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Video games (FPS games on PC, so mouse aim), Music (I play flute), my job (running kitchen at KFC)
3	Optimization is our passion. Making something perfectly efficient is the fuel.
2	My mentality is that whatever im going to be doing for the rest of my life, i HAVE to want to do it, and if i want to do it im GOING to be the absolute best i can be at it, basically we’re all try hards and every once in a while a try hard with some serious skill pops up and wows everyone with their skills, i think the best way to explain it is ISTPs are less susceptible to peer pressure and other’s expectations, so we are able to find something that we 1 enjoy doing 2 are good at doing and 3 can do it for money, this perfect storm of personality and patience to find what we want to do instead of just something to make money doing will allow (most but not all obviously) ISTPs to reach their full potential in life. And to be blunt, some people just have more potential than others, the “masters” that you are talking about here are just very high potential people who happen to be ISTP and found what they want to do for the rest of their lives. Not all are as lucky as them however.

9	Welcome brüthêr
8	Well you could go down the rabbit hole and start with reading [Gifts Differing by Myers-Briggs](https://www.amazon.com/Gifts-Differing-Understanding-Personality-Myers-Briggs-ebook/dp/B01HPVHGP8/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) and [Psychological Types by Carl Jung](https://www.amazon.com/Psychological-Types-C-G-Jung/dp/1614279705/ref=pd_rhf_se_s_vtp_ses_clicks_0_8?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1614279705&pd_rd_r=30075e1c-dcf0-43bb-8572-fef17dde0a47&pd_rd_w=CGAoA&pd_rd_wg=pUWNa&pf_rd_i=desktop-rhf&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=05d75987-58ed-4d36-bbfa-515cd87e4ee3&pf_rd_r=B5WNCWCEK1G7R0M9XGED&pf_rd_s=desktop-rhf&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=B5WNCWCEK1G7R0M9XGED) but you're probably not gonna wanna do that and probably just watch some Youtube videos about what it means to be a badass, thrill-seeking, motorcycle riding, handyman, fix-all-things mechanic.

1	Merry Christmas. You get to meander about the MBTI forums, get told to learn cognitive functions and take the enneagram, aaand in the end you will settle on probably 3 types and you wont be sure which one you are.

1	Now go build a work bench in your garage and build some shit.
10	What period or significant event in your life that made you truly happy (so far)?	Happiness or sense of fulfilment seems to be less discussed on this sub. Maybe it's time to share some personal triumphs. Maybe it's a way to encourage other ISTPs who are challenged in life at the moment (like me). 
12	I struggle with understanding pleasure vs fulfillment.  I feel pleasure often, but I'm not sure what fulfillment would even look like.  Maybe that's just depression (thanks, adverse childhood), but I've never been guided by a sense fulfillment.  It feels like it fits in the same category as ambition which I also utterly lack.  I just want to survive and do whatever I happen to want to do.  I'm happy every day that I survive without pain.  \n\nTo answer the question, though: LSD
7	Becoming a father, but that's not an istp thing, more of a general human thing. Everything else is much less important than my daughter. Eventually I'll get the vasectomy too and be happy with not buying condoms anymore like u/Testiculese, but the only other important event in my life is my wedding.
3	I get a really good sense of fulfillment when I PR a lift, or do well in a competition, or being in my band and playing music good enough to bring people on the dance floor. Basically anything that shows the world my talents and hard work, and getting external validation from it.\n\nThat isn't to say I don't get happiness or fulfillment from everyday things; I definitely do, but it's not as pronounced and doesn't give me as much of a high. For instance, although I feel fantastic after cleaning my house, doing all my laundry, and going for a run, it's more of a gentle contentment than anything.
4	My vasectomy. That was the day I felt truly free.
2	At the last year of high school I slowly created a social circle of 10 people thanks to my extroverted close friend. We were all just the right amount of edgy, straightforward and thrill-seeking that our friendship still goes on to this day without any drama; even though we're all now in different parts of the world. The happiest months of my life were the final months of high school. We'd go drinking whenever we felt like it, and be totally fine if someone (me, usually) wasn't in the mood and didn't join. On several occasions we went camping, hiking, biking, you name it. Because of how much I enjoyed these experiences, I still sometimes consider actually being an ESTP, but I really don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Wanted to add: Maybe it's the idea of looking forward to something happening soon that made me this happy. So far, nothing else really had the same effect.
2	Having my cat, followed me everywhere i went, couldn't stand being far from me, attacked everyone who would stand in her way to see me.\nI loved my cat, got it when it was 2months old but i discovered 1year later that i was allergic to cats.\nSince this period i wasn't truly happy a single time, but at least i had the chance to experience happiness and love.\n\nSorry if it turned to shit but needed to get it out somehow
1	A spiritual journey I went on with psychedelics. It may sound silly or crazy. But I’ve managed to solve many of my life’s problems while on LSD. The lsd doesn’t do the work. But it opens your mind up and connects everything. Really helps you expand your thinking and get new perspectives on your issues. \n\n\nOne specific trip is definitely my happiness and it’s when I was at the zoo. It was my second trip. And that’s when I conquered my demon function, the source of my anger. I realized my anger stemmed from lack of a “place”. I didn’t belong to any groups. I was too different to fit in any boxes. I never found my people. But I came to realizations at the zoo that trying to fit into society, and failing, was causing me anger. When I found my peace and my purpose, not having a clear cut role in society stopped hurting. And when that pain of constantly not fitting in + trying and failing to went away, my anger went away. \n\n\nAnd that’s why I say that trip is my happiest moment. Because the shift from an angry life with no purpose to a purposeful life on the road to happiness marked the beginning of my personal development. That was when I realized “holy fuck, I don’t have to be the way I am. I can use acid to map my entire life and brain, find the toxicity, and cut it out. All while finding new ways to add positivity.” And that’s when I began the beautiful journey of changing the entirety of who I am. I’m still working at it. But now I am a happy person with a hopeful outlook towards the future. As opposed to an angry cynical asshole that would’ve been more than happy to watch the world burn.

1	Any fellow ISTPs have tattoos?	I have 2 simplistic black and white tattoos in areas that are easily cover-able (ankle and shoulder).  \n\nWas wondering if anyone has cool tattoos or even thoughts on them.  
41	Never could decide on something I’d like to have indelibly drawn on my skin. 
12	No tattoos and no honest consideration of ever getting one.  I do not get it.
4	I want to get the brand from [Berserk](https://i.imgur.com/kTBIrxC.jpg) on the top of one of my pecs, but i'm currently a bit chubby and poor for it.\nSome day though.
14	I will never spend money on cosmetic items, i would rather use the money on better equipment and upgrading my skills.\n\nBut that's just my opinion.
3	I've got one on my arm that I can cover up if need by with longsleeves, but I like being able to look at it, it's an emotionally charged piece. 
3	An ax on my arm.
3	I would not, but my wife got me started. I've got a few now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd actually like to have more, but I can't justify spending the money to actually do it. Maybe in a few years when I've got more expendable income.
2	yeah, i have a few and plan to get quite a lot more.\n\nin the blackwork/geometric style
2	I have 2 that are easy to cover.  One on my upper arm and one on my upper back.  I like them and always planned on getting more(I wanted a full back piece for many years), but have a hard time deciding what I want to get and also a hard time justifying how much it costs.  Nowadays.... I have completely lost the urge to get any more.  
2	Yes, 4 large ones, on my back or ribs (ouch) \nBtw, I absolutely love fit guys with full or half sleeves 🤤
1	Thinking about getting a sweet space jellyfish on my arm. 
1	Knuckles, shin, calf, shoulder and side. All simple black and gray, all designed by me. My knuckles are the only ones done by a professional. Punk rock dont stop.
1	My grandpa had a bunch of tattoos and told me how much he regretted them so that kind of stuck with me.\nI have piercings though.
1	Nope\n\nI don't want to do it, because it is hard to do MRI as I know, in case if you break some bones or something else, if you have a tatoo.
1	na, shows you're sensitive enough to put things on your skin because of some event in your life that your mind could not handle, not to mention you have to pay for it too. also goes with trying too hard to be *cool*. it's not my lifestyle. downvotes will only confirm my opinion lol. though i try not to jump to conclusions about folks with tattoos or assume things about them.
1	Have you seen old people with old, faded, wrinkly tattoos? They're not cool if they don't have a military or jail story behind them. 
16	How do you ISTP’s handle a break up?	
41	the partition in my brain which holds all data on the ex-partner gets formatted
54	Turn 360° and walk away.
24	I don't talk about it with anyone except maybe one friend. Then I try to go out and hook up with other girls and become pretty extroverted because it allows me to escape my negative thoughts about the situation. I also watch youtube videos about handling breakups to try and make myself feel better. Throughout all of this I also reflect on the relationship itself and figure out what went wrong and determine what I need to do to become a better SO and what red flags I need to be more aware of. 
18	I'm an INFJ, and I broke up with my ISTP a month before he went off to boot camp. He couldn't give me solid details about our future together and what would happen after he joined the Marine Corps. When I broke up with him I cried, was angry, told him I hated how he was acting. He would stonewall me during all of this because he doesn't handle emotions well which ultimately made me feel like I made the right decision since it seemed like he didn't care if I left or not. "Do whatever you want to do." He said with no emotion. So I did.\n\nI stopped talking to him all together. For a month we didn't talk. It was too painful for me. The day came that I knew he was scheduled to leave for boot camp. The day went by, and I remember looking down at my phone and seeing 12 missed calls from a unknown caller. My heart sank. The most recent one had been an hour ago. I called back, but the call didn't go through. My phone had been on silent.\n\n3 weeks went by and I got a letter. He told me about his experience so far, basic things, the sucky food, the yelling, the hard work, as if we were still on good terms. He then mentioned that he tried to call me from the payphone before he got on his last flight. At the end of this letter and the next 3 letters he wrote, "I love you and I miss you."\n\nI really believe he had to go through something brutal like boot camp to realize his true feelings. It forced him to be isolated from other distractions. I think to myself often that if he had not gone to boot camp he would have easily moved on and shrugged off 7 years of dating without regret. He probably would have easily found someone new to make it all better. Though a lot of you praise the ability to move on quickly, I would like to suggest that you take time to search yourself before you simply let go of something.\n\nWe got back together after he got home. And got engaged 4 months after that. My ISTP and I have been married for 5 years now.\n\n
11	It’s been different more or less every time, but I try to move on as quickly as possible. \n\nNew life, new people, new habits. 
11	Distract myself as much as possible. 
9	Heavily depends on context. If I made the soul decision to break up with her because I was done, I move on as soon as it’s over. If it’s mutual breakup because of clashing values, I’ll spend some time mourning the parts of her I liked. If she breaks up with me and I have no idea it’s coming, I’m gonna be pretty crushed for a hot minute. \n\n\nBiggest thing is just keeping busy and moving forward. Dwelling is the bad part. 
4	I tend to completely cut people out of my life and move on pretty quickly.  But it's always been because of a huge betrayal that makes it easy for my logical brain to decide that person is not needed in my life and good riddance.   I will usually find a friends with benefits to distract me.  
3	I went on dating apps and found a few nice guys to hang out with. Some I ended up just flirting with and others, we had sex and went on multiple dates. It honestly opened my eyes more to what is out there and what I do and don’t like in a future partner. It definitely makes it easier to get over the last one (even easier if the last partner you had was a scumbag). The only thing I struggle with is making sure not to have too high of expectations of the new possible “romances”. That way I am not too disappointed if the conversation/date nights phase out (which can happen). Also building friendships and initiating hanging out with people. Tell them what you are going through. Everyone has had a breakup and if you’re surrounded by good people, they will boost your confidence in all the reasons why you’re better off without that guy/gal! Theres so much out there in this world and if this relationship didn’t work out, it just means there is something better out there waiting for you in due time. Embrace all of life’s experiences and the lovely lessons everyone teaches you along the way.
3	I guess it depends on how it all went down. But I usually just shut myself off for a non-specific amount of time, and just keep working, studying, hanging out with friends... I only talk about it after I'm done with the sad feelings, and only with people who can actually cut through any bullshit I might actually say to justify this or that. It usually works fine.
3	Turn into a workaholic, come home and Nyquil then rinse and repeat.
3	I would think ISTPs might be really good at handling breakups. Sure we feel an initial sting, but will seek diversions to preoccupy our thoughts with. We easily move in a different direction. We might be the best at walking away.
3	Drugs, alchohol, hoes the usual first aid kit
3	When I break up with someone I've been dating for less than a year, I'm usually over it in a week. When the girl I was dating for two and a half years broke up with me, I was working 70 hour weeks for 5 months, and getting drunk nearly every night. I didn't feel comfortable talking about it with my friends. I didn't want to look like I was suffering, at all, even though it must have been painfully obvious.
2	Really fucking poorly!
1	I become more talkative and needy and act like an immature child, one of my weaknesses, I'll be honest
1	keep yourself busy and try something new every day.
1	I just sort of keep going on about my life like I’ll still go out and party with friends even if I know that by the end of the night, I’ll probably be crying and stuff. I write about it a lot and I’ll talk to my close friends . But I’ll prolly talk to one specific friend about it more than I do the others 
1	Depends on the break up and the relationship. The one before my last, it was toxic rollercoaster so I handled it really badly with too much drama(but not all because of me) and fights and yelling and screaming and crying. \n\nHowever my last one was just a mutual break-up and we knew what was happening and everything was out in the open. It didn't take me a day to be over it and we're still friendly(not friends tho)
1	I used to ignore my feelings and try and not confront them, but I’ve realized that doesn’t work especially when it comes to break ups.\n\nTo get over someone, you have to allow yourself to feel whatever it is you’re feeling. So I’d listen to sad songs. Talk about it with a few friends. I also would dress up and do my hair to feel good. Then after about 2 weeks is when I start to feel better. \n\nThe second part is accepting who that person is. If they’re a shitty person, just accept it. Accept the fact that they’re not who you thought they were. It’ll help you be more realistic about it.\n\nExactly two months ago I cut off an ISFJ. He had a lot of past baggage and made me responsible for dealing with it. Wasn’t cool at all. So after going through those things I mentioned above, I was over it in two weeks. 
1	Yes. I need clarity on this too. Sorry, I'm an ENFP. Sit back for the novel...\n\n  \n\nI am an ENFP who was done with my 18 year marriage to an ISTP (too little emotion, too much judgement, too little honesty about anything financial-unknown credit cards, lied about purchases, past jobs, etc. early in our relationship, yet really working on himself later in our relationship) and fantasizing about living in an apartment or condo on my own or with my son. \n\nThen we had our discussion where I told him I slept with someone 15 years ago (super shitty on my part and I had been a hypocrite about all of his honesty things). He said he wanted a divorce right away and moved into the spare room. So angry and rage filled. Emotional talks every night and then we had sex two nights later. Really nice sex that we hadn’t had in years. \n\nDue to my immaturity with conflict and recognizing my true feelings, when I got angry with him I’d withdraw emotionally and sexually. But now that all the emotions were out and all the truths were out, we became more physically attracted to each other (or I at least did to him, he’d been initiating sex for awhile and I rarely “bit”). So sleeping together a few times a week, living under the same roof, sharing a young son, figuring stuff out. Then he said he was moving in with his boss (10 years younger, two young boys, also going through divorce). Took me by surprise at how fast he was moving on yet still wanted connection and sex with me. Keep trying to stick to no sex but it’s been hard because damn, it’s been so good. And so confusing. \n\nFeel like I’m falling in love again. But he’s definitely moving on and still so angry about infidelity. And then his boss who he has a “special connection” with. What the hell people? Now it’s been almost three months since we had the talk where he wanted divorce. Still wants sex and “connection” with me but is texting boss all the time and moving in with her. I’m trying to be in it just for the sex (who knows how long it will be for me again?!) but it’s hard to separate emotions. I feel like I’m fucking myself over but have little self control. I suggested reconciliation about a month and a half in and he freaked out, “Do you think I forgot about what you did?” Oh, lord. What a reality TV show. Is this kind of thing normal? I’ve been together with him since I was 21 and for 21 years. Only had one boyfriend before him.
1	kms lol
9	Infp needs help with istp behaviour	Update: \nIt turned out the ISTP really liked me. 7 months later he tells me that he still feels bad for how he acted and that he misses me alot and wished that I was his. Haha you istps never stops amaze and confuse me. Love u all :’)\n\n\nSorry if the english will be bad, it’s not my first language.\n\nI need help to figure out some shit about this ISTP-guy. I’m an infp btw. It’s a lot of text but I’m just confused.\nI did an exchange term in another country where  I met this istp guy, and we started to talk alot on messenger and went out a few times to clubs and stuff. I think he really started to like me, he was always the one to initiate things and put effort into coming seeing me. \nWe hooked up a few times aswell and he was shivering in his whole body when we cuddled and kissed, don’t know why lol. It really felt like he liked me a lot, we didn’t really had verbal connection cause he is not much of a talker but I could just feel it was something between us. We had fun together, and he was always telling me it was such a shame that I didn’t live there permanently and that I should come back and stay forever. I told the Istp-boy one time that we would not be able to see each other in 3-4 years which I think made him sad. \nBut suddenly when I just had like 3 more weeks before leaving for home he started to get cold and distant.  He still answered me when I wrote but he was really short. So I kind of took a step back aswell, didn’t want to push him. But every time he was out drinking he always resched out to me, wanting to meet. One of the times I followed him home, not having sex, just sleeping together. When we woke up he was being so awkward and cold, like he was afraid of me. and I just felt ”wtf is this”, and kind of left haha. That was the last time we saw each other actually. But then after that time, I wanted to meet him one last time before heading home to have a proper goodbye. But he was having excuses, telling me he had headache, and that he was tired and such. But then one of my last days, he wrote and asked if I wanted to come for dinner with him and his friends. I was like ”Yes I would love to!” But then he canceled and said he was not feeling good, so he just stayed at home. Then I asked if I could come over to his place and chill with him, but he was like ”I’m sorry I have been acting so cold and distant but I have sort of been seeing someone else”.\nNot sure if this is true or if it was only an excuse. The boy is introverted as fuck so if that’s the cause it must have been mainly through texts.\nWell, when he said that to me I got sad, but I acted really chill and was like ”okay that’s alright, you should of told me earlier” and he was like ”I know I’m sorry, don’t know why I didn’t”. And 2 days after that I left, without a goodbye. It really hurted me that he could’t be bothered to say goodbye to me. It felt like I didn’t mean anything to him. It confuses me. Did he just use me for sex, was I only some sort of goal to concquer? Would an Istp do that? Or did he like me, but didn’t know how to handle a goodbye? Please help me, what do you think? Did I mean anything to him? Fuck I miss him and I know he misses med aswell, he have told me that. And he also told me that he regrets not saying goodbye. He is also 3 years younger than me, more insecure, and a bit immature. One of his friends actually told me that ”istp-boy will be heartbroken when you leave”. I was like lol I dont think so. And the friend then said ”he is just playing hard to get”. The shift of the Istp-behavior just confuses the shit out of me. Did he like me but didn’t know how to act, and acted cold? And also, would you ask someone to come for dinner with you and your friends if you didn’t like the person?\n\nIs this ambivalent behaviour something you istps understand? For me, as the infp I am, it’s fucking weird.\n\n
27	Sounds like he didn't want to get fucked up emotionally by you leaving, so he didn't want to say goodbye. Rather just cut ties as it's less drama than having a emotional goodbye.\n\nWhen my ex and I broke up, I forced myself to be strong - no texting her, no crying, nothing like that, which from the outside world would make me look cold, but in reality it is a coping mechanism for the hard emotional shit we go through.\n\nThis may be one of those situations, but it also may be that he is trying to fill the void with another person or seeing someone else, and that's the reality we all need to face at times.\n\nHope this was somewhat useful, but remember that just being a Myers-Briggs personality type is generic and doesn't account for people being other things outside of the constraints of the 4 letters 😊
9	It sounds like he really liked you for sure.\n\nBut the ‘reality’ of the situation is that you couldn’t be together. The way I see it, he asked you to stay to be with him, and you (understandably) didn’t want to, so there was no way to make the two of you happen. If I was him, I’d be seeing that I’d “done all I could” at that point.\n\nIf he’s anything like me then it’s really, really hard to work with long term ideas when there’s not going to be a chance for physical connection. I’m not very verbal either, but when I experience a connection people can see it I think. Even if I don’t say as much. I make it known, as it sounds like he did for you.\n\nAvoiding you and going a bit cold, as the other commenter said, was probably just about protecting his emotions and not getting any further into something that just isn’t going to work. \n\nI would probably say that there’s no bridges burned, as long as he hasn’t done that for you, and if it turns out in 3-4 years that you could see each other again, let him know. Both of your circumstances at that time will dictate whether it’s possible, but... I bet he’d be pleased to hear from you. \n\nSorry if this sucks for you.\n
7	If I were him, I’d be hurt by the thoughts of you leaving and him distancing himself might just be his coping mechanism (because it’s painful as fuck when someone we love or got emotionally attached to will no longer be around). He’s probably trying to detach himself from you emotionally and he knows that if he saw you then he’ll be back to square one.\n\nMy humble opinion 
5	Trembling while you were being intimate is so sweet my god. Cherish the memories!
4	Ah what these ISTPs do to us 😂... or what we INFPs do to ourselves because of not understanding them completely.  We are overthinkers, they... I don’t know what they’re thinking honestly. I’m glad I’m not alone though.  \n\nMaybe it’s an out of sight out of mind thing he is trying to achieve.? I’m simply assuming here.\n\nTo ISTPs, if things didn’t end in an ugly way would you still be open to friendship or the possibility of trying again with that person in the future?
2	Just curious how INFPs and ISTPs work out in general together?
2	the guy is or was in love with you and the situation was not logical for a relationship to happen. he took action. I LOVE YOU AND I MISS YOU from an ISTP is exactly that. he is not lying. im an ISTP and if i said that i would mean it. we dont talk or think that way so if that came out of him he defnitly is whipped over you girl
4	Some great replies on here. Just a thought on the shaking when intimate thing. I’ve known of an ISTP who got this due to a history of sexual abuse. Which can also contribute to difficulty with intimacy. Good luck!
2	What you need is to find other guy. 
2	Sounds like he really likes you.  Something you can do is tell him that while circumstances at present are no good in starting anything up, that in the future if it were to become a possibility you'd be open to pursuing something then (assuming neither of you are seeing anyone) since he's such a good guy and all.  It keeps things casual and creates a positive future outlook without the burden of lingering feelings.  Worst case scenario you stay friendly, but if luck is on his side he will be surprised with something good in the future.
1	I can't decide if I'm in the right subreddit. No one asked to start with the enter key. hmmmm\n\nHe struggled with what to do, so did what ISTP's do and put it off until it wasn't a direct problem to be handled anymore, trying to avoid the pain. \n\nI'd imagine it didn't work out for him, and he hates how he handled it. 
1	bloke was on benzos or boozin hard if he woke up and was afraid of u lol, theres like a 99% chance. chances are he's isfp too if that's the case, downers = abnormal personality.\n\n>I’m sorry I have been acting so cold and distant but I have sort of been seeing someone else\n\nbs, doubt it, he be trying to attract you more, or covering up something worse, i.e. running out of pills; thus becoming distant because he's afraid of social interaction\n\n> he is just playing hard to get\n\ni'm guilty of doing the whole "playing hard to get" part lol
-2	If he was cheating on you, maybe he got distant because of that. He sounds like a one night stand kind of guy. He potentially could've just faked liking you for sex. 
-1	Might be demon Fi at work.
4	About to hit my WTF years	I'm a 19 year old female ISTP, and I believe I'm about to hit or peak my WTF years. I'm seriously considering taking a break from university, either for a term or a year, to get some of my shit together and make some money before pursuing a degree again. I'm currently a Geology major but I don't believe I like it enough to truly enjoy the field once I get into it and I think there might be something out there that I'll enjoy more. Along with that I'm struggling in college and have slowly began to hate it over this term. I loved my first year and performed well, but after taking on one of my uni's "weed out" classes it really has thrown some things into sharper focus. College really may not be the path for me, or maybe it is but I'm just not in the area I'm supposed to be. I'm still not sure and that's one of the reasons why I'm taking a break.\n\nHonestly, I don't have that many interests, passions, or hobbies, with the exception of one that I haven't even really started yet and even it may fade with time. Taking some time to treat my depression (which could very likely contribute to my lack of consistent interests/passions) will help me with that, though.\n\nWhile it sounds like I have a plan I'm honestly at a loss as to what to do with my life right now aside from work and attempt to become a functional human being. I'm concerned about my future but I know I need to do what is right for me right now. Is there any advice out there from y'all that I can use to help guide me through this point in my life?\n\n\nUpdate: I've decided to stay in college for now, and see how next term goes. If it's just as bad as this term then I will for sure take Spring Term off. Upon doing a lot of research and sitting down and looking at what I want from life (along with a lot of career assessment tools!) I've realised a few things:\nCollege is a tool to help me get what I want out of life. I love answering questions and traveling, and I know that my current major will for sure help me do that. While I dont want to be stuck inside ALL day, around 50-60% inside work I think I'm okay with.\nI need something intellectually stimulating, which science definitely does provide. I believe I'm borderline between ISTP/INTP and when I took my first MBTI assessment I was identified as an INTP, but it was just barely. I'm not as familiar with INTP but from what I know, and talking with a good friend of mine who is in fact and INTP, I do see some similarities in tendencies. \nThe subject of the class I'm not doing great in-the weeding class-is a tool. I didn't see it as that before. While its subject isnt my favourite, being able to understand the content and being able to apply it is fairly important for the fields I want to go into.\nI'm looking at college with a different perspective now. I have a battle plan, and I kind of know a little bit more of what I want out of life. I still have no fucking idea what I'm doing with my life or what I want to do EXACTLY, and there is a lot of anxiety behind that, I know generally what I want and I think that's enough for now. I'll try and keep this updated, but I feel this is a decent conclusion for now. That's a problem for future me.
10	Take a semester take a year off. Most colleges let you back to take classes within two years I believe or you can apply for a deferrment. \n\n
3	I did school the "non traditional" way. Started working random jobs out of high school, didn't go back to school until I was 30.\n\nIt was awesome and terrible at the same time. I was finally able to figure out what I wanted to do by then, so that was great. But going to school while working full time and raising a family is really hard. It also takes a lot longer because you just can't take as many classes.\n\nIf I could do it over again, I would do all of my generals first. At least get them out of the way. Even if you don't know what you want to do, just do the basics that will transfer into any degree when you finally know. Then maybe you come back a couple years after that to finish up what you want. But the longer you put it off, the harder it's going to be.\n
2	As an ISTP  that went through about 15 WTF years, I "managed" to get my BA within about 6 years.  I took a couple leaves-of-absence, or whatever they were called, and had a crazy hard time going back each time.  In hindsight, I wobbled around with un-diagnosed depression through most of it, punctuated by moments of euphoria when I said "fuck it" long enough to do whatever I wanted in the moment.  I switched majors a couple times and never really looked at the process as more than a rubber stamp that would allow me the respect to pursue things I wanted.  I even ended up in the Peace Corps to prolong sorting shit out after college.  That did put some things in perspective.  I've never worked in my field (anthropology), but the degree has enabled many doors to open, for what it's worth.  Take it easy on the substances, if that's your thing.  Did me no favors, though fun at the time.  I don't envy you for where you're at, but there is an end to it.  Not sure if there's any advice in all this, but the fact that you're even aware of the need to sort yourself out is huge.
1	Consider a trade school, good jobs lined up after those programs
1	I second the others' advice to take time off. I'd also recommend having a job lined up before leaving school. It might take a couple weeks to months to get a job, depending.
1	[deleted]
10	(f) INFJ here, looking for tips on how to be the best gf to my ISTP (m).	Because he is worth it and deserves it.
21	Be yourself. Be yourself. Be yourself. Also Be yourself.\n\nAlso important, rules are probably not going to be his thing. If they are logical and make sense, no problem. But anything he feels is a "silly" rule will be ignored.\n\nBut again just be your self. That's what we want. And if you're not, we'll see right through it.
15	The biggest thing is to let him think about what he wants to say about how he thinks or feels first before being like “come on just tell me!” We take a long time to process how we feel and to articulate our thoughts so just be patient.
10	My best friend is an INFJ and although I love her, spending time with her could be so much better if she improved one thjng: was more openly communicative about her wants. For example, when we hang out, she tends to overly care much about what I want (e.g., where to go eat) and she‘ll end up repressing what she wants. I’d much rather her tell me what she wants and trust that I, as an adult, will agree to or offer up an alternative if it’s something I don’t want to do. On the other hand, she’ll sometimes be OVERLY restrictive and show high disdain towards something, which makes me feel like I have no options in that moment. So it sounds completely cliche, but OPEN and honest communication about how you feel would remove a lot of the misunderstandings and doubt/worry/angst (as I know how you INFJs so regularly feel.) Although we’re friends, I think that’s true in any relationship and in addition to my 18 year friendship, I’ve also dated a couple INFJs in the past. Anyway, best of luck! ISTPs will do what we want to make us happy, so if you want a harmonious relationship, you should do the same. 
4	Got to know his principles and beware not to step through.\nAnd of course, be yourself.
1	Talk about sex. touch our hair. Share savage ideas. At some point late at night, propose an exploration plan about an abandoned warehouse and go explore it.
32	ISTPs and socializing	I want to talk to people but I also don't. I dunno, I'll text people and whatnot and enjoy it but then want to be alone. I text people and dont get back to them for days, sometimes weeks. I also dont know what to say to most people anyways. \n\nCan anybody relate? Also ehat do you do to connect with others? Cause like I said I just have no clue what to say to most people
22	Honestly just takes practice. You just have to do it. I decided I was tired of being socially inept and just started going for it. Made a fool of myself plenty, embarrassed myself plenty. But isn’t that how it always starts learning any new skill? You suck at everything before you learn how to do it. You learn by practicing. Trial and error. 
6	>I want to talk to people but I also don't\n\nThis is somewhat true for me. I like the space to be alone to think and explore things of interest to me. I also don't like being distracted from my thoughts.\n\n>I text people and dont get back to them for days, sometimes weeks\n\nWho is "people"? Are they established friends? Potential friends? Family? Tinder matches? My established friends and I talk when we can but time often escapes us (as adult life is apt to do) but we always pick up like we never left. I've had estranged friends pop up years later turn out to be as fast a friend as when we started off.\n\n> I also dont know what to say to most people anyways \[...\] I just have no clue what to say to most people\n\nI need more context:\n\n* Again, who is "most people" ?\n* Is the idea that you think you should be talking to any and everybody? \n* Is this a way of saying you're timid and words escape you when presented with conversation? \n\nIt sounds like you may need to do an inventory of the company you keep/want to keep. \n\ne.g. \n\n* Do you actually like the people you're referring to (ie enjoy their company/respect their opinion)? \n* Do they engage you in a way that leaves you feeling fulfilled or even curious? \n* Do you find them to be a chore to be around/talk to? \n\nThe way you've framed your ideas feels like you're doing something wrong by NOT talking to people. I don't think it's healthy to force an interaction. If you don't want to talk, then don't. If you're concerned with coming off in a negative way (ie antisocial) then you should let them know about this part of your personality. Your words should come naturally because you're interested in the other person's perspective or you have something to contribute that hasn't yet been made apparent. Anything else is just noise and can come off as disingenuous. The people I choose to be around facilitate my words by nature of them being who they are as people. My relationships are few and can be compartmentalized (largely by interest) but none are ever forced.  
5	This crossed my mind today, I get caught up observing so much that I draw blanks and can get awkward when I should communicate. It feels like add occasionally, idk maybe just an extreme version of introvert.\n\n&#x200B;
3	this is exactly what I've been through lately!!\n\nI've been so focused on my work that replying to a message feels like a chore. recently I've worked overtime most of the time, and when I went back from work I just don't care about all of the chats and messages that I need to reply. If it's not related to my job I'd probably skip reading it until 2-3 days later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a problem for me, I've been chatting with 3-4 women I met on Tinder to find a date for myself. But because of my slow response, they all ghosted me. Then when the weekend comes, I feel miserable because I ended up staying at home all day. I really wanted to find a date, but my brain is exhausted with all the socialization I needed to find one (flirting, approaching, and all of that nonsense).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nprobably to kill boredom I needed to do a small project for myself like fixing a broken table in my house. but honestly, I did that bullshit every monday-friday from 9am-7pm. the least I can do for myself is take a rest from the tools.
3	yes I agree
3	Same. I want to talk to people I like but have nothing to say, so I get this weird feeling like I'm holding back a yawn. 
2	I think not knowing what to say isn’t a pure ISTP problem. Also, if you want to know what to say, try asking/talking about what’s on your mind (assuming it’s appropriate lol)
2	I usually respond back quickly. My problem is I don't like small talk and I'm prone to saying something offensive.
2	I feel you, there are times I want to text people but I never do and when I'm texted I often less than thrilled and take forever to respond if I do. But a decent solution is making or having someone else make a group chat with your closer friends so they can lead the texting and you can jump in as you see fit.
6	why are so many posts from throwaways here?	Feels like we're getting trolled or maybe we just don't want anyone to know we're ISTP's (or are involved with an ISTP)?  Makes me not want to burn calories on a reply.  Why are YOU using a throwaway?
24	Because the thought of someone you know discovering your reddit account is terrifying. 
8	No one can know that I have actual feeling!
6	I don’t use a throwaway but I don’t want people I know irl to discover my reddit. My coworkers wife works at reddit and he said if I told him my username I could get free Reddit gold and I declined.
3	The government is watching us ;)
3	I have layers
0	What us a throwaway?
7	What does it feel like to have tertiary Ni?	
17	I like to think of Ni as the guy who randomly shows up when Ti is working on something. He walks in, looks around and then goes “Yeah that’s not going to work/that could work” and walks out. No arguments, no explanation, nothing, yet Ti oddly agrees with him.
13	Gut feelings.
5	I feel my Ni when I'm in the beginning of a relationship. My gut feels can jump from wanting to get married and seeing possibilities to get there, and then out of the blue, it's the same bitch that tells my Ti, Nope, it's a waste of time. My Ti would then justify the child function's discomfort. I hate it what it finds seems always correct.
2	It helps to discern limited information. I am a data analyst and use Ni a lot because there is often not enough data provided to make conclusions and also because I'm lazy and prefer to base my conclusions off patterns I come across rather than sort through actual information which takes forever.
1	I'm pretty good at troubleshooting
1	Do you have ambition in your hobbies?	Like the things you enjoy doing just for the sake of the enjoyment of doing it, do you have ambitions or things you want to achieve? Learn new chords to play for some intrument? Learn a song? Achieve some level in a sport?
4	I always have a goal in whatever endeavor I partake in
2	Since i easily get tired of most things, my main ambition is to be polyvalent.\n\n
1	Yes. For instance, I generally travel with a purpose - to learn, meet loved ones, however, I have paid for to date every airline ticket, even when young because I didn't travel then.  I'm planning a trip for my parent's anniversary on a cruise in May that I'm paying for them.  I utilize social media for work and travel is good.  Mexico is convenient and desirable for my parents.  I take input too now, I have a remarkable mentor.
1	I honestly quit most of my hobbies because I wasn´t good enough at them. My mediocrity is honestly torture. Like Jerry from Rick and Morty is the best way to describe me.
22	Are you scared of familiar negative emotions?	This is what I notice about myself when watching a sad film. Half through the movie, I can sense where the emotional atmosphere is going. It can be influenced by the music, cinematography or the faces characters make. In real life, I also tend to avoid couples who are fighting, mothers yelling to their poor kids or my friends who suddenly become quiet to me after I said a blunt response to their intruding behaviors. I usually forget this kind of feeling but when something reminds me of it, be it as minor as a scene in a movie, I have the tendency to distract myself and move on to another thing... Sometimes I cannot finish a movie due to this kind of discomfort. 
19	Yes and no. I experience the same thing, but I handle it differently. \n\n\nI prefer to continue watching the movie and experiencing the emotions. Why? Because it’s a consequence free way. I can’t experience a wide range of emotions in my life without having a problem in it to cue them up. \n\n\nI like to experience and understand different emotions so that I can be prepared to handle them in my life. \n\n\nWatching movies with emotional rollercoasters is a great way for that. It allows me to feel short periods of a specific emotion without needing something bad to happen in my life. As soon as the movie is over, So are the emotions that came with it. 
12	Your IRL examples appear to relate to Fe if you want some MBTI-flavored analysis. As ISTPs we have a hard time with feelings centered around group harmony, as in offending a friend. I also have a hard time witnessing clear injustice, as a mother berating her child, when I know there's a better way. I feel a sort of cosmic shame at the whole endeavor of living and relating. Your movie reactions I don't share as much. I tend to embrace most of those emotions and see where they lead me. I've studied and practiced psychology for much of my life so for me it becomes interesting to introspect and meditate. If I were you, to the extent I felt comfortable, I might consider confronting some of these emotions (in therapy if necessary) and trying to determine what specifically causes the resistance for you. If it means that much to you, that is. It could result in some growth.
4	My brain is backwards in many ways it seems. I feel like some but not all good memories expire after awhile, they're outdated and I hate them, too different from how I am now. And others, I've gone through depression and then when I get out I wanna go back, maybe cause I was depressed and didn't get to enjoy the moment, idk though.
3	I have never watched the movie Hachiko because of this very same reason. I just know I'd hurt so much, I don't want to deal with it. 
2	I do the same, I just recently noticed it. I thought it was a part of PTSD
1	Yes, I do. I almost always fast-forward through emotional scenes or skip episodes I know are overly emotional.
6	Ti and planning	It’s commonly agreed that the Judging function is responsible for structure, routine and planning. \n\nTi it’s self is a judging function. I have noticed that I am very good at short term planning. I’m not one to plan weeks and weeks in advance but I am efficient for creating daily game plans based on the factors of my day. It’s like loosely planning. I kind of pick out the key details of what needs done and visualize how to get there.\n\nA good example is at work someone may call out sick and I can formulate a quick plan to get an efficient day out of less people. \n\nI detest long term planning but I love short, day to day practical planning. I suppose its tactics vs strategy.\n\nDo any of you others find you are great short term planners?
10	I heavily relate! Short term planning and problem solving is a forte of mine. I enjoy doing it. \n\n\nBut like you said, it’s loose planning. You won’t find me planning things down to the minute. I’m going to make rough plans based on what I’m capable of. It’s a heavy mixture of planning and improvising. But because I’ve spent the whole time observing and analyzing, the improvisation comes out much more efficiently than a roll of the dice. 
4	Repeat after me: Ti is not an ability. It is a way of seeing the world.\nBut, if you are an XXTP you might get distracted by you main perceiving function. You will prefer to explore and understand the world and not order it. So it's possible you will not like to develop organisational skills. They will not feel natural.\nA Te will live to organise and become good at it because they will constantly exercise those muscles.\nMe for example, I don't like telling people what to do, but I'm still good at that.\n\nSo to become a good planner, you need to power trough and exercise. Also being placed in situations where you need to manage your time will influence your organisational ability. Maybe even being around such people will influence that.\n\n(LE: To answer your question:)\nI had an INTP boss, he was a good boss, but hated doing long term planning. But he was great at splitting tasks and organising the work flow for us. Once that was done, he moved on to the next thing that was in front of him.
3	Long-term planning is a common challenge and short-term planning is a golden trait among ISTPs. Even INTPs would agree they have this, at least my INTP would. However, there will be a point in life where at least one long term plan is going to whine like a child in the back seat... and that's our Ni. It wants something huge and for the future. I notice this about myself that when I know something stressful and difficult is going to happen (maybe Ni telling me in an abstract way of course), I have a tendency to plan long-term. Long-term can mean two months, or far-reaching like "What will I do with my inheritance?" These long-term preoccupation in the back seat will influence how we see the future, what information our Ti will digest, and what reality we will have. Just my opinion. 
3	Wtf is this lady on about?	Holy cow NO. It’s Ti backed by inferior Fe that s...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9xbzwc/what_types_are_most_objective_about_things/e9r3ozo?utm_source=reddit-android
5	That person appears to be confused about the nature of cognitive functions. 
16	How often do you check people out?	I do it like all the time. It’s actually quite hard not to. \n\nedit: like if i see someone in public and he/she’s hot; got good taste; etc., I’ll have to like roll my tongue back and convince myself not to stare.
32	I always look at people. Regardless of what the reason is. I notice looking around that many people don’t appear to do this. 
12	I mean yeah. But usually not with any kind of agenda. I just like to size up whoever I’m in the vicinity with. Give em a good ol “ocular pat down” 😂. But really though, it’s just a glance to kinda see who’s around me. It’s part of my “observe and analyze” nature. \n\n\nAnd of course I do make observations. “Oh damn she’s cute” “his shoes are dope” “that watch does not match his outfit” “is this dude really wearing blue dreads on his head” etc. \n\n\nI don’t always have the time to *think* about random people, but im pretty much always watching. 
8	I think it's just a primal sensation to check out potential mates. The human brain is just so complex that we attach positive or negative emotions to it, based on prior experiences. Basically we sense beauty, but society dictates right or wrong in this matter.
5	Yep. That's me. Doesn't matter the gender. If you look good and dress good, I will follow you with my eyes. Jawlines, symmetrically shaped face, nice smile, how you're totally rocking that leather jacket. Beauty is appreciated in any form. 
2	My eyes are naturally drawn to anything dynamic. I'm surprised at how ignoring of external stimuli some people can be. It goes to show how impactful functions can be 
51	How good are you guys at articulating your thoughts?	Cause in text I'm fine, In real life it's just a mess
55	I’m definitely on your page man. When I have sufficient time to type out and edit my thoughts, they come out much more efficiently. When I’m speaking to someone in real time, I can’t edit my thoughts. So I often come down with “foot in mouth syndrome”. 
26	I’m terrible at it. If I can write it out, I’m fine. But something between my brain and my mouth just doesn’t work. 
12	I frequently make stuff that's amazing sound like utter garbage when trying to explain it. I could make brownies sound like dog shit with my articulation.
9	I'm mediocre at best though I'm significantly worse at it through text. 
9	I think that’s why I met WAY more women through dating sites than in the wild.  SO much better with text first before meeting.  
8	I'm absolute horse shit at articulating my thoughts 
7	I used to be pretty precise verbally, but somewhere along the way I began to pickup idioms and now they kind of come out in a mismatched jumble. It's getting a little better again as I am now in a technical field that encourages precision.
7	Terrible. Bf always tells me I'm terrible at explaining myself. I also don't like to think too much about my feelings as I like to live in denial lol. I'm much better written than verbal.
5	I'm garbage at it. Actually, I'm the trash in the garbage.
5	I make leaps based on my knowledge that leave other people confused and sometimes get ahead of my words.
4	one time i made a powerpoint for my boyfriend because i couldn't get the my mouth and my words to do the thing 
3	I put my foot in my mouth in person all the time. Sometimes I just want to get my point across as quickly as possible. Without having time to think about what I say. It ends up sounding like a foreign language lol
3	I’m exactly the same. I’ve been keeping a diary on and off ever since I was really small, I’ve got hundreds of thousands of words scribbled and typed down on everything from the mundane to the life changing.\n\nBut trying to have a conversation about myself and my life? Forget about it.\n\nI think this is a Ti-Se thing though. Realising thoughts in writing, which changes completely when the receiver is a human being with their own perceptive abilities. Writing or texting is sort of an echo chamber. IRL conversation isn’t. 
3	It's the Ti-Ni combination i think
3	Absolutely terrible with my mouth. Typing, as many others have said, I can do quite well.
3	Good online but in person I am trash at it\n
3	i say things in a way that i've been thought of as a completely different person that i actually am. i tend to throw a lot of words around even if i dont know the exact definition just to try getting the point across, prob coz i think slow
3	When trying to talk, and afterwards I just want to bash my head into a wall. And delete 2/3rds of what I said and have citations for the rest. Writing is okay but I have a lot of coded phrases I use in it that have multilayered meanings to them.
5	Jordan Peterson talks about writing just for yourself an hour a day articulating your thoughts and refining them so when asked about them you already have the best version possible stored in your head, I have no where near the discipline needed to do that every day tho
2	Written is great. I have time to put my thoughts down more effectively. Verbally I'm garbage.
2	I'm terrible at it.
1	same
10	As an ISTP, how would I go about improving my social skills?	I am extremely socially inept coupled with a lil bit of depression and a shit load of anxiety. When other people are talking me, I nearly never have anything in my mind to respond with. I'll laugh along and nod and agree etc.. but I never actually TALK much. I'm always over-analyzing and overthinking everything in my head and I don't know how to stop this cycle. I'm trying to learn how to talk to girls but when I think about approaching them I start thinking stuff like "Nah there's too many people" and I'd also have this thinking pattern where I'm like "Fuck I want a girl but I want the relationship to be private but I know thats damn near impossible with girls always telling each other everything"\n\nSo yeah, any tips?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
8	Try to pull yourself out of your head somehow. Be present, focus on your body and speak reassuringly to yourself. When you relax social skills comes naturally. 
13	Ever seen somebody with no shame, no forethought? You probably know at least one person like that, who says or does whatever but has friends and gets lots of attention anyway. Pretend to be that person.
4	Hey man, i feel ya. There's a channel called Simple Pickup on YouTube that really helped me get a 'start' on becoming more socially open. I literally mentioned it to an old friend of mine going through the same issues just last night. Posting one particularly relevant video here, but if you peruse through the channel's videos you'll find a lot of inspiration to help break out of your shell. Good luck bud!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2iGk87bug2s 
3	Being friends with an ENFP for three years now has helped me a lot in achieving social skills. I can play an ESFP now in a heartbeat. :) 
2	Become friends with an ESTP. Copy him exactly because they will be the easiest to model after since you use the same functions in similar positions. Also, watch talk show hosts with outgoing personalities like Conan and Craig Ferguson. \n\n&#x200B;
1	If you want experience talking to girls alone then you could try online dating. If that sounds like too much then I'm not sure where else you could start apart from having close friends that you hang out with.
1	This is life. Don't be an npc, be the main character. Stop following norms. Be you, and if you are istp people love us.

10	Book Recommendations	What are some good books for ISTPs? I want to read a new book and I'm looking specifically for ones that would peak most ISTPs interest. 
6	Hermann Hesse and Kurt Vonnegut. Narcissus and Goldmund, Demian, Siddhartha, Cat's Cradle, The Sirens of Titan, Player Piano to name a few.
5	honestly i feel like “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” by stieg larsson reads the way an ISTP thinks. it’s very cut and dry but it goes fast as hell and that makes it thrilling.
4	A song of fire and ice. 
3	Don't know what genres you enjoy but I recently read Dark Matter and really liked it
3	Thinking in Bets is incredible. 
3	Anything Kurt Vonnegut Jr., "Welcome to the monkey house" is my favorite. 
2	Here's some books I read recently that I enjoyed:\nHope beneath our feet -essay series about climate change and how to prepare mostly a lot of urban farming\n\nGrandma Gatewoods Walk -biography of first woman to walk the entire Appalachian trail by herself (she was close to 70 when she did so that's even more impressive)\n\nThe Book of Three and The Black Cauldron- part of the series Chronicles of Prydain. It's a fanatasy series based on Welsh mythology
2	Books are pretty subjective even within MBTI obviously but I have a few I like that I would say have more appeal to ISTPs. Here’s a couple I read recently that I loved. \n\nInto The Wild - good short book about a guy who abandoned all his possessions and went out to live in the Alaskan wilderness. Lots of stories of adventure, also inspiring, especially if you’re outdoorsy.\n\nGeneration Kill - True story about the recon marines that were the tip of the spear in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I’m not a military guy but this book was fantastic. Very raw, holds no punches about how terrible the war in Iraq was and quite funny at the same time. The author captures the camaraderie amidst a very gritty backdrop well. \n\n 
2	*The Ego and His Own* by Max Stirner
2	At the moment I'm reading \nSEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper\nAnd\nThis is gonna hurt by Adam Kay\n\n
2	idk how you can sit still for even 30 minutes reading a book
1	If you like SciFi, anything by Neal Asher.  Brutal, matter-of-fact and extremely logical.
20	Do you like being ISTP?	I do. I like being a Ti dom and the way it makes me keep my cool.
30	It's alright.
31	I mean I like being me so I guess. Who else am I going to be?
27	It's ok I guess. I think the modern world is kinder to extroverts, but I like being level headed and all the other stuff we ISTP's are good at. 
20	Yes and no. I appreciate the analytical and objective nature. I appreciate the gravitation to nature and such.\n\nI dislike the lack of necessity for social connections, and the niche place I occupy. I sometimes wish I was a regular moron who thought the Kardashians were the coolest people ever, and can't wait for the next episode of MTV's Real World.
9	A lot of people seem to think I’m cool or interesting so I’ve got that going for me. And yeah the level-headedness is cool.
18	Do I have a choice?
8	Hate this inferior Fe , but im still young so i guess it will improve over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
7	Love myself, better than you.
6	I’d rather be handsome.
7	Yeah.
4	It's got its pros and cons, just like any personality type. I like being me just fine.
5	I could do with being a little more empathetic and warm, but overall I love me and I love being an ISTP. 
3	I wouldn't know, haven't tried being anything else. 
3	I'd be happier if I was more extroverted as it would put me in more situations of initiating relationships rather than hoping someone finds me interesting enough to give a chance.
3	Not really.  It's more frustrating that there aren't many ISTP women.  And when it comes to figuring out a career, the jobs best associated with ISTPs tend to be more male-dominated.  \n\nWhen I was in high school, I felt like I was pushed more towards fields I wasn't as interested in.  As much as I like to tinker and work with my hands and travel, the jobs that I felt drawn to weren't as encouraged just because I was born a girl.  And even if I went for them, I would get a ton of shit just because I was a girl who dared to venture into an area that this so called 'weaker sex' was deemed 'unfit' for.\n\nSo sorry about the rant.  But it really is frustrating to be an ISTP female.  What are we good for?  I mean, seriously? I feel more like a guy than a girl and all my life, I feel like I've been pushed towards a route that I am not okay with.   
3	Yes, I’m perfectly happy using logic, being realistic, handling stressful situations like a boss and improvising a lot.
2	I think I'd rather be E
2	Yes, very much. Being an ISTP is working out for me. 
2	hell yeah
1	Lol how should i know im not
1	Intellectually - It's good enough, bomb sometimes, ass other times\n\nKinestetically - Pretty damn good\n\nSocially - It's got all the potential but too introverted to live up to it. Se with Fe is unbeatable (Lookin at ESTP's). \n\nIt's pretty good on a good day and mediocre on a bad day. Just give me some nice facial features and I'm set.\n\n\n
1	Other than the fact that crowds zap me of my energy I'm perfectly okay with who I am.
1	i love being an istp! i think it makes me tuned into a lot of things that people dont normally notice. \n\nbut intuitive types...all of my friends are intuitive and they make fun of me for being the only sensor in our friend group. while i think it’s funny and enjoy being the odd one out sometimes i feel like N types think sensors are just idiots ... LMAO
1	Not really. I try to be anything but an ISTP in real life because they come off as boring to me when I see someone (usually on TV- athletes) that is one. I try to be more outgoing and decisive. Obviously during the week for the most part I am typical ISTP but when I am building relationships I avoid the stereotypical attributes.
1	till this day i won't understand what the fuck ya'lls talkin bout when you're saying all that Ti Ne bullshit. but my answer to the title, na, id prefer to be estp, ruin the world like trump
1	I don’t care, honestly it’s a curse sometimes 
1	It's ok, could be worse lol
6	Are you guys good at Uni Calculus and Discrete math? I found them hard for me ;_ ;	But I found statistics quite easy to handle.\nAny course for recommendation?
5	Back in college, my colleagues used to ask for my strategy for calculus and algebra cause I was pretty good, though maths for engineers are less advanced.\n\nAnyways, here are my tips, it all boils down to time and stress management. \n\nWhen studying you have to understand the theory, raw memorization won t cut it. So I recommend taking as long as needed and not stressing at all so your mind stays open. This means you could spend a whole evening with one lecture or even a single formula until you get it.\n\nGetting the theory means to make it yours, after having understood the formula you incorporate it to your baggae of knowledge and it is yours forever.\nNot stressing means breathing deeply from time to time, making breaks to drink water or smoke a cig. This is underestimated. NEVER STRESS. \n\nOnce you have learned the math you have to prepare for a slightly different task, the exam!\n\nThis is a practical exam you will get through because you have a theoretical solid foundation, but you need to train yourself by doing exercises quick and in the right mood. \n\nHere quick means to do your exercise at home on a time bound basis, with an actual watch. You can solve an exercise one day and try to beat your time another day. \nThe right mood means to breath deeply (underestimated) while being quick, this will wipe stress away and replace it with focus. NEVER STRESS.\n\nI hope it helps, i have found maths are hard when you regard them as a daunting task, so breath deeply and "own" the theory, it is valuable knowledge.\n\nI would like to insist on something, the exam is not really about how much you know about algebra, it is about how much you can solve with algebra. So train with a watch.\n\nCheers! 
3	Yeah. Cal 1 and 2 were blow off classes for me. But cal 3 kicked my ass. Failed it once, dropped it twice. Then I changed my major from ME to corporate finance so I could skip Cal 3. 
2	Hi, I am an eighteen-year-old ISTP. \n\nI'm currently in college and I cannot fucking pass College Algebra. I have approximately 21 days to finish, in order to attain my degree in H.I.T. However, I am scrolling through Reddit and listening to amazing grunge music.  
1	I did at first. Barely passed calc 2 and failed 3. Then I realized I just wasn’t trying and I had a bad attitude because I wasn’t immediately good at it. Once I actually started doing all the homework and showing up to class it wasn’t bad 
1	I got straight C’s in math (and 1 D) from Geometry to Calc 4. 
1	What level stats are we talking? Stats gets hard as fuck later on.  I breezed through all my calc classes and all my linear algebra classes, but fuck if my stats classes didn’t eventually get hard.
0	INFJ(f)+ISTP(m)+Long Distance=Need help!	This is probably going to be pretty lengthy, but I'm going to try to summarize best I can..\n\n2 years ago, I met a guy online playing xbox and we really hit it off. We'd spend all our time together and it got to the point where we actually developed feelings and wanted to meet. Problem was, we were in two different countries. Me in the US and him in Canada. I got everything I needed to travel cause I guess he had some court shit that meant he couldn't. I applied for a passport, bought the plane ticket and even the hotel. (Mind you, first time ever on a plane and I had a huge fear of flying.) We get there, spent a week together, and even though we didn't really go do anything, we just had a great time hanging out.\n\nHere we are, 2 months after the visit and he says he can't do this anymore. I do need to admit I'm at fault for a long of things.. I have a massive jealousy issue due to past experiences, and I always found it suspicious the amount of women he kept around. Said he's always had more female friends, but he thinks of them like a sister. But he also has a really pervy side with how much porn he looks at. I'm just not into that kind of thing and I expressed it. And I've seen hundreds of photos that he "liked" of his female friends showing a little more skin than the average woman. I hated it. And I started questioning who all these girls were. And asking if he talks to them the way he talks to me. He always denied it, but there's no way of knowing for sure with the distance. So I doubted him and didn't exactly make a secret of it..\n\nAnother thing I'd do is push him to be more verbally affectionate. As an INFJ, feelings just pour out of me, I can't help it. Him being ISTP, he's not really into, nor good at it. But he would be like that every so often, when he felt like it. And when he did, it would be the most heartfelt and genuinely sweet things I've ever heard.\n\nI also would beg him to give me "10 more minutes" before he went to bed. He didn't really like that if we were talking about something negative. I was trying to fix it, he needed to step away from it. But there were many times that he'd not just give me 10 minutes, but up to hours more time. But no matter what, we'd always say goodnight before leaving, even if we were mad.\n\nThere were probably a lot more factors involved, but I'm trying to wrap this up quicker..\n\nA little over a week ago he told me he didn't think he could do it anymore, with all the fighting and arguing. Kept going back and forth with "idk" for a few days. I'm a little ashamed to admit that I've been pleading for him to give me another chance. I've done an insane amount of research on our types and I see where all the issues were. I told him that if he'd just stay, I know how to be more open and accepting of his personality cause I see it for what it is now. Looking back at old messages and photos, I see how he showed he cared about me. I just didn't realize it cause it was different. I misunderstood... \n\nHe hasn't cut any ties, all forms of communication are still open. So I have hope that maybe he just wants a little time. He has been passive aggressively an a-hole, but still reads all my messages and responds sometimes. Most of this has been through text, but we've talked a few times now through mic. He's said as much as he'd like to give it another shot, he just doesn't trust that it won't be like that again. We've been here once before, but it was never like this.. I keep explaining that this is different now, but I can't find the words to prove it. Only actions taken through time will show him. But he still "doesn't know" about another chance.\n\nHe asked at the beginning of this, if it ended would I still wanna be friends. I told him I wouldn't be able to do it cause it would hurt too much. He agreed with that. I told him that he'd have to block me. But he hasn't... Why? And why does he keep agreeing to talk to me about all of this? I've been sending what he affectionately labeled "novels", pouring my heart out to him. I sincerely won't do that stuff that drove him away. He keeps listening to me, but responds with "idk if I can believe that" and "I don't want to be made a fool again if it doesn't work".\n\nThe one day we talked, it really sounded like I was getting through to him. We talked about a couple issues, and I told him how I'd solve them. But I had to leave and the conversation was cut short. It seemed like he was gonna give it a shot.. Then texted me later, again saying he didn't know if it would work and followed it with "I'm mad right now, don't text me again tonight". I didn't know what to think.. Did something happen that changed his mind within a few hours? Or was this a test to see if I could leave him alone when he's upset? So I didn't say anything.\n\nThe next night I heard nothing (he fell asleep) until like 2am when he randomly woke up. I was in the middle of writing another novel and I asked if he wanted it. He told me that he's online, why don't I just read it to him. I took it as him being sweet honestly.. Maybe I was wrong, idk.. But after I read it to him, he seemed to really contemplate it all. I swear, I felt like he was saying yes.. I just have the worst memory if it's verbal and not written so I can't give exact wording.. Just, I knew he was saying yes. Idk how, but things turned sexual, but we were okay after. I actually went to bed really happy, feeling like we were going to give it a legit chance.\n\nThe next morning, he tells me he can't do it. I'm floored. I invited him to a party, and he joined. We talked for a couple hours, but it didn't really get anywhere. Somehow blocking was brought up again, and I told him again that that would be the only way I'd stop trying. I noticed he was pretty active on Facebook and I did ask who he was talking to.. Another girl. He said that no, she's not the reason he's unsure. I didn't ask any more questions and left it alone. Eventually he had to leave to sleep for work. I left him another novel. His responses were "there isn't much that would change my mind" and "the feeling isn't there anymore". I actually broke down at work and had to leave. A couple hours later, I noticed he was up for work, and active every 5 minutes. I found the girl's profile and saw the past couple days he's been liking everything she posts. (The reason this is an occuring thing is cause this is very out of character for him, he never used social media for anything.) I didn't bring her up, but instead asked if since he won't talk to me, will he at least talk to his friend at work that has been through the long distance thing before and succeeded. Suggested he may have some ideas. I was told that if he was in, he'd talk to him but "doubt it'll help". After that, he hid his online status and I haven't heard from him since. Idk what to think..\n\nI guess my question is, what does this mean from an ISTP standpoint? Is it common to leave things open like this, even after discussing the only option would be to block me if he were done? Is he just still unsure, but doesn't know how to admit it? Is this just anger taken too far, and he just needs some space to figure it out? Who is this other girl, and can I believe him that it's not because of her? (I'd think if it was, he'd tell me so I go away.) Is there anything I could do to prove my words are true? It's only something that can be proven with time I know, but how can I convince him to give me the time? Idk what to do.. I just don't completely feel like he's done. No matter what he says. Why would he still continue to talk to me and let me pour my heart out? When we talk, he uses "if" a lot, both for good and bad. How do I fix this? :( 
21	holy shit...you sound like a nightmare.  You did and said the exact shit to annoy him. and now you just keep pushing and pushing and he will block you soon. Your questioning him and you jealousy is horrible and a very ugly look. for what it's worth I am a woman and istp and if a man treated me like you treated him..I would block all forms of communication. sounds like you are smothering him and we dont like that. Just leave him alone and quit trying to say that you want to "fix him" there is nothing wrong with him and there is nothing to fix. sorry this is so long but..damn, girl..you are the one making him push you away. so just chill the fuck out and if he wants you he will come back. just accept that it is over and move on( i bet money that he has already) good luck? your entire post scream insecurity and self esteem issues and sounds like you need to work on that. You have NO right to question him about who he talks to.
10	> he told me he didn't think he could do it anymore\n\nHe's made up his mind. Stop pushing him.\n\n> He asked at the beginning of this, if it ended would I still wanna be friends. I told him I wouldn't be able to do it cause it would hurt too much. He agreed with that. I told him that he'd have to block me. \n\nHe was willing to remain friendly with you even if things didn't work out. He extended this olive branch and you refused. What did you expect to happen? I generally cut people off that no longer interest me.\n\n> what does this mean from an ISTP standpoint\n\nI personally think you're an absolute mess and would have cut off contact months ago. It sounds like your friend is worried you might do something irrational and is afraid to leave you alone. It has nothing to do with your feelings at this point and everything to do with you doing something dumb and him feeling guilty about it.
5	Note to self....
4	He’s just not that into you. Let it die.
5	Here's my advice...in other threads on this sub it's been mentioned that istps perfectly understand when someone is trying to emotionally sway them, but at the end of the day they are not pushovers.  What you believe is you getting through to him is in actuality him attempting to spare your feelings while trying to convey to you his desire to end things.  Istps are still Fe users so he is not being direct to you about this.  Your lack in understanding what he is saying to you in your pursuit of keeping it all together is what's making him angry because it takes a lot of effort for him to behave so politely in the first place.  You're in essence being unappreciative of his efforts, so how can he trust you've changed if you're willing to talk past him even now?  \n\nWhile you may be a person of words he is a person of action.  In the world of istps actions speak louder than words.  If your words and actions do not line up he will take you by your actions and not your words.  Unfortunately this situation is not going to work out in your favor because you cannot control his desires.  If you want any chance of being with him at this point it's by giving him what he wants, moving on, and revisiting this after you've found emotional independence from all of this.
3	I sympayhize with you. My dearest ex is an INFJ and our long distance relationship soured from jealousy, miscomminication, and lack of communication. However, from the looks of it, he has already moved on in his mind. He is done. He isn't blocking you and shutting you out, probably from some lingering feelings, but he is done.\n\nLong distance is hard. You've told him how you feel, now let it go. Back off and cease speaking to him. Spend some time doing things you enjoy, being with friends, or anything to get him off your mind. You are over thinking. The ball is in his court, so now you can let go. There is nothing to fix, nothing to keep pushing.\n\nI'm really sorry you're hurting, but for your sake, let it go. He seems to have let go, so don't torture yourself.
2	What are you expecting out of all this? He told you he’s through. If he’s still replying to you, it’s cause he doesn’t want to hurt you any further or just out of plain courtesy, but unless he’s actively reaching out to you (a.k.a. Showing some interest) I’d say he’d rather not have you messaging him constantly, specially about giving it another shot. Cherish the good moments, learn from the bad ones and move on.
2	I’m currently in a long distance relationship with an INTP. It’s a breath of fresh air. It’s golden. My previous relationships were with INFx types and long distance, they’re absolute mess. I was traumatized. I do think self-awareness and finding someone who can fulfill your important needs (emotional) should guide you into relationships. Don’t jump into expectations. My partner and I have separate friends. I love to travel and I meet people on the road. It’s reality, but I’m extremely loyal. I’d even encourage him to socialise and leave his devices. It’s healthy to the mind, whether he’d acknowledge it or not. I can’t imagine being jealous knowing he has lots of girl friends (for they have been there before me) unless he’ll state that he’s developed feelings for someone else who is closer. \n\nYou have to work on yourself. Acknowledge that. Or you’ll meet self-fulfilling prophecies (like every man is a cheater) along the way because that’s been your perception. 
1	I understand your hardship. It sounds like you've been looping a bit, overanalyzing and such. Realize that you are most likely putting him on a god-like pedestal. Pick out 100k random people out of the entire population of the desired sex. With highest probability, at least 20%-30% of them likely have the potential to become your 'the one'. The level of complexity that love has isn't actually that expansive. It's narrowed down to the fact that, more time = more romantization. The more you romantizise someone, the higher of a pedestal you're putting that someone on. In other words, investment is what makes you actually have romantic feelings for someone, biochemically speaking. After approximately 6 months, the dopamine levels will either reduce and the relationship will end or investment hormones will start produce.\n\nSummary: You're (as most people do in relationships) putting the person on a pedastal that is unrealistic and the odds of finding 'the one' again (due to the nature of humans romanticizing our partner and overly invest + ca 4 billion people) is practically 100% (if you don't isolate yourself from love because of this), this devalues the situation as well as the ex 
1	I had an ex like you. You’ve already crossed several lines that would prevent me from dating you.\n1) You don’t let him have his alone time. Those “just 10 more minutes” will eat away at me. \n2) You try to dissuade who he can hang out with. So what if my friends are my preferred sex, We have self-control, respect that.\n3) Telling him what activities he can and can’t do. Even if it’s porn know to us it’s impersonal and recreational, especially in a long distance relationship.\n4) I don’t know how an istp can do a long distance relationship, I know I can’t. \n\nEdits: These rules don’t apply to everyone. Just me and maybe some other istps. \n\n5) As an istp I enjoy experiencing all sorts of things and as a partner are you going to help me experience all sorts of fun and fantastic things or are you going to make me put you at the center of my focus. I know what kind of a partner I want. 
10	How does an Fe grip look like in an ISTP?	
31	Iron grip?\n\nYou mean like Stalin?
12	For me it's starts as intense anxiety from feeling too many emotions at once. Either I freeze up, or if pushed further I may snap, whether that's crying or yelling. I've scared people in the past because I can explode with seemingly little warning. I am irrational and feel incapable of applying logic like I normally can. I end up exhausted and wanting to be alone. I feel paranoid and sensitive. 
4	One way it manifests is in indirect rages in an attempt to convey actual feelings.  Sometimes it's so indirect it's incoherent.  "DON'T BE NICE TO ME YOU FUCKING DICK"
1	You mean like pure pure fucking feelings.
17	Had an interesting thought today	I was feeling super depressed today, due to what I'm fairly certain is Season Affective Disorder (go fuck yourself Daylight Saving). Extreme sadness, heaviness in the heart, lack of motivation and energy, onset pessimism and existentialism...pretty much what INFPs feel year round.\n\n\nBut then out of nowhere I had this thought: "Hey...even though you feel like shit right now and can't find a reason to be happy, think about all the happiness you can still bring to the people around you in your life." And I suddenly...felt...like loads better.\n\n\n*/start Pokemon evolution animation*\n\n
10	this is true, especially for istp's. when we feel idle or unneeded we self implode. given the right motivation, this MBTI type become small-time  heros. something to remember and encourage. we love being used...effectively ;) to maybe offer a diagnosis ( although im not a pro) around festive times i don't see the worth in things and activities around me. this gets me feeling some typa' way. think about your projects in this time. also don't forget to entertain the fact that its festive season. you're expected to play along and be a sport. your are not the only one #D
2	i wouldn't say i was depressed, but i had a weird thought about how bacteria is essentially the root of existence and how we should be sending microorganisms to other planets to study their development ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ perhaps this way we'd be able to see aliens in a million years or so.
1	INFPs are funny like that. It's good to see the humor in that, even if they don't. ☺ 
1	so you didn't feel any of this?
-3	Um... that’s great and all but why did you post that here?
10	HELLO!! NEW ISTP HERE.	Hello guys, my name is Nicolas, 21 years old, brazilian. I did the MBTI test some weeks ago and i got ISTP type, after a lot of research about it and reflecting on myself about my life its make sense and i feel like an ISTP.Is it common for an ISTP to get bored or lose interest of something real fast, i mean carrers/degrees, people, hobbies, personal interests, everything? Looks like i can't do something if im not really excited about it, it seems like eveything is trivial.\n\nI dropped out from college 3 times, 3 different degrees, bcause i couldn't stand lie to myself anymore,  i felt miserable by having to do something i didn't give a fck. I think its one of our strengths right? Be honest, be truthful, i feel like we are amazing people, with a big potential  but we are at the wrong place. around the wrong people, doing the wrong stuffs. 
15	HELLO ANOTHER H00MAN. HOW IS YOUR DAY GOING?
6	Yeah, that's pretty much how it goes. It's hard to stay interested in anything for a prolonged period of time. Once something becomes familiar, I (and it seems other ISTPs) go and look for the next shiny thing to capture our interest.\n\nI like to study languages for fun, I just find them fascinating -- but I've studied 17 languages. That's too much. I'm not even beginner level in 14 of them, but for some reason I've studied 17 different languages at different points in my life. Some of them for months at a time at different intervals. Neither my family nor my husband are impressed anymore.\n\nIt's just how it is. I like jumping into new things feet first. It doesn't matter if I know that I won't be interested in whatever the new thing is in a few months because in the honeymoon period I am so excited and interested in whatever the new thing is, that it's worth it.
4	I wish I could live an infinite amount of lives so I could try everything. 
3	[deleted]
3	wow same here. i changed my major 2 years ago. quite bored with my current degree but im trynna survive. 
2	There is way too much energy going on in this post, make it stop!!!
2	Hi, I'm ENFP but I've been dating an ISTP for 5 years (we are both 23) and I can tell you that he is also like that. He changed his course in high school 3 times, he is now in university and he's not really happy with his course and he's also changing jobs all the time. I think with time and after trying new stuff and discovering new things you will get where you want (even if you dont know where is that place at the moment) . I think you need to invest on things that makes you happy and dont give up and say "fuck it" when a challenge comes up. Good luck!   \n(sorry for my english) 
18	Emotion	I’ve heard comments in the past like, “do you ever show emotion / get excited / etc.?” \n\nI understand sometimes emotion is beneficial, but in the instances I hear this I’m just like why would I want to? \n\nI’m assuming y’all can relate. 
36	I think most of us saw the title of this post and avoided it at all cost. 
17	I've been considered indifferent or unexcited by many people, but it's usually within situations that develop in ways I've already anticipated, so there's nothing to be "excited" about. \n\nGet me going about my favorite topics, however, and you'll see all kinds of color. 
14	because people respond to emotions more so than they do logic. i think it was maya angelou who said this, but people don’t remember what you say, but they remember how you made them feel. \n\ni don’t often feel very strong emotions and most of the time, it’s hard to put my feelings into words because it’s just simply not something i think about. but i’ve learned that to be a good friend and a good leader, you have to learn to empathize with others because truth be told, there’s a lot of feelers out there whose choices are dictated by how they feel not what they know. 
8	The longer you bottle your emotions, the worse it’s going to be the day they all come out. \n\n\nBeing ISTP doesn’t mean no emotions. We aren’t psychopaths. \n\n\nIf you want to know why you should show emotions, it’s because it’s healthy for your brain. Expressing emotions is part of being human and it’s important for development. \n\n\nAnd being bad at expressing emotion is *not* an excuse to not do it. It’s an excuse to *learn* how to properly do it in a healthy way. 
3	Exceedingly few things will elicit visible excitation from me.\n\nI easily show negative emotion, to my misfortune. I regulate how much positive emotion I show. I'm not going to waste mental effort on things that just aren't worth it. But if some one I like a lot is around, I won't withhold emotion from my interaction with them, but it probably won't be *a lot* of emotion either.
2	I feel plenty of emotion but I'm not exactly expressive with it. Also, the deeper it effects me, the more contained I am. 
1	Your emotions make you a monster.
1	Relatable	
13	Appreciation for Aesthetics?	Was studying Mathematics at University for about a month till I decided it’s not what I wanna do.\n\nAnyways, I’m now thinking of coming up with something else for the next semester. I’ve noticed that I really enjoy aesthetics in a broader sense, e.g. design of objects, architecture, photography etc.,  I might go in that direction somewhere.\n\nRelatable much?\n\n
8	Always had a taste for aesthetics and design growing up. Loved doodling in class, drawing comics, flipping through art magazines, stenciling, graffiti, wheatpasting, and almost majored in art, but I realized it's more of an individual pursuit for me than an actual career because I could not imagine myself creating art for someone else, only to be paid in chicken feed.\n\nFor me, art was a way of dealing with my emotions because I didn't know any other way. There isn't really any socially appropriate way to express anger or sadness, so I would usually funnel it into my art and create shocking and provocative art pieces.\n\nISTPs are good at artistic pursuits that are more practical and have a sense of structure to them. For example, we would probably find graphic art and traditional art a bit too open-ended for us, but we would excel in architecture, engineering design, 3D modeling, welding, and other pursuits that have established rules and are less subjective. We are also better at improving existing products and solutions than creating one completely from scratch.
5	Maybe ergonomics or human factors engineering.  Personally I have zero artistic ability (much less mathematics...) Sure you got the right type?
6	I'm in a creative field (video) and I don't like it. There are no right answers to aesthetics, or my boss/client will disagree with something I think is obvious and perfect and I will have to change it against my own design instincts. Lots of pulling shit out of my ass to create things I'm not proud of or even interested in. Not creative or passionate enough to pursue without the steady stream of work/pay so I deal with it.\n\nI tell my friends I wish I was an accountant.
3	i’m a high school senior right now and math is what i want to go into , but all those other options you’ve listed are things ive considered or are things that have been suggested to me because i’m artistic\n\nso yes all this is very relatable to me\n\nsome potential careers i’ve eliminated include engineering, medicine, and law (but that’s just me)
2	I hate mathematics
2	very very relatable! i’m a big economics person but i do have a very strong appreciation for aesthetics and i actually do a lot of graphic design and layout work when i find the time. i haven’t quite given it that much thought, but i have entertained the idea of minoring graphic design or something art related. 
2	Yes! I’m into clothing and fashion, not really into trends, but I get lots of compliments on my clothing and accessories.\n\nI also really enjoy interior decorating. I’ve moved a couple times in the past few years and had to start almost completely from scratch both times. I got lots of compliments on how I decorated my condo and then later my apartment. Unfortunately, furniture and decor is expensive so I can’t add as much as I like. I wish I could be an interior decorator as a side job 😝 I like the process of decorating just as much as the final result.\n\nBut I work as a chemical engineer because I realize that I need a job that is consistent and pays my bills lol. So aesthetics is more of a hobby, but it’s something I value highly.
1	I do enjoy well put together themes, and well crafted decor. But I, myself, will not go out of my way to arrange any of it for myself.
1	I like making things and being artistic so I woodwork. I've wanted to get into mechanical engineering or robotics to be able to make things move how i want.
1	the way I see it, I need both to thrive. During my personal life I want a creative outlet of sorts (still haven´t found mine) but for work I want black and white rules. Work like this, not like that. 
1	Few Questions about male ISTP's	1. How much do they like dogs?\n\n2. Do they spend a lot of their weekends alone? \n\n3. How much do they their value appearance / looking put together: I think ISTJ would wear a polo, so is ISTP ''just look presentable,'' what is the view on that, what types of things do they wear? \n\n4. How likely are they to lie?\n\nThank you 🐣 \n
9	Male ISTP responding:\n\n1) I absolutely love dogs\n\n2) Depends on the weekend. Always down to chill with my friends, but a weekend alone could be nice sometimes especially if I've had a long week.\n\n3) Personally choose to wear clothes that are functional and comfortable, although I've recently decided that I'm going to put more of an effort on being aesthetically pleasing when I go out. I think this might be a maturity thing though and I'm just hitting my second puberty.\n\n4) Unless there's a really good reason for me to lie about something, I'm pretty damn honest. Sometimes even brutally honest.
9	1) Dogs are cool, though I'm more used to cats (but plants are the best.)\n\n2) Depends. I've many good friends online so although I may be "alone" I'm not lonely. That aside, I've more than enough work to keep me occupied enough to lose track of time.\n\n3) Some do. Some don't. Now that I'm older I care more since appearance is a _very_ pragmatic affair, be it for comfort or projecting an image. \n\n4) I don't like lying. It's more trouble than it's worth.
9	1. Not ISTP related\n\n\n2. Not ISTP related \n\n\n3. Not ISTP related \n\n\n4. Not ISTP related \n\n\nAll of these questions you’re asking are only good on an individual person basis. There is no blanket answer for any of them. They aren’t personality type related. \n\n\n1. Just about everyone loves dogs. And this has more to do with your experiences as a youngster and wether or not they were pleasant. \n\n\n2. We may be introverted, but it doesn’t mean we aren’t socially active. Weekends are when I get my social quota. I spend week days at work and at home alone mostly. \n\n\n3. Ones care of their personal appearance has much more to do with mental state than personality. \n\n\n4. ISTP’s May be *better* at lying, but it doesn’t make us predisposed to it. It simply means we can if we want to. I personally hate lying, but sometimes it’s simply easier when the other person won’t grasp the truth. 
6	Lying involves saying things in order to get a specific reaction out of people instead of just because they're factually accurate and I don't think I have enough of an ability to predict how people are going to react to things I say in order to manipulate that to get a certain result. Generally makes me uncomfortable/guilty feeling anyway.\n\nDogs are my favorite living beings in existence.
5	Love dogs. What the hell is a “weekend”? We appear very casual, we strive for that look, but we are far more fashion conscious than we will admit. I don’t lie, and I don’t have much use for people who do, but I won’t speak for all istps. Iif an istp does not have an internal moral code, he isn’t an istp. We follow the rules that are important to us, my internal rule won’t let me lie, other istps have different internal rules, I suppose.
3	A young male ISTP here. \n\n1. Dogs are cool, but I'm more used to cats.\n\n2. I tend to spend my weekends alone, in the house. It lets me relax, rejuvenate from a long week. But this doesn't mean that I don't get out at all. \n\n3. I have some sense of looking good, but that goes out the window when I don't care how I look, which is very often. \n\n4. Lying isn't my strong suit, but I can lie if need marry arise as long as it isn't too big & convoluted. \n
2	wut????
2	M - ISTP\n\n1. We don't deserve dogs. They are amazing. I own one currently, easily the best thing I've done in a while.\n2. Normally yes, I prefer to do a lot of things alone that would typically be done with a group, going to movies, outdoor sports etc.\n3. Function over form for me, but I'm never scruffy either. I make an effort to look neat and tidy as a minimum. It's not beyond me to dress up for a special occasion. Definitely don't mind a mint looking suit.\n4. I lie to avoid conflicts almost 24/7. Doesn't matter how big or small it is, if I don't feel like dealing with it I'm going to lie right to your face. Otherwise I'm normally very honest.
2	1. Dogs are cool\n2. I prefer small gatherings with close friends. Very willing to party it up at times but will definitely need private time to recharge afterwards. \n3. Functionality is the key here. But I can clean up nice.\n4. I think ISTPs are hard wired to be honest. Lies are like chores that you have to maintain. They feel like unnecessary work. Personally, If I have to lie to someone in order to keep things right then I rather just cut ties with them entirely. 
1	1. Anyone with a soul loves dogs\n2. Every second one, personally\n3. It's a work in progress\n4. Depends on social models growing up
1	1.Fuck yes.\n2.Not many weekends.\n3. I wish that I could dress the way I wanted. But alas money is required. But as an idea, I want to some how mix, a lumber jack, a salty sailor, and a punk look all into one. But can still wear a nice suit.\n4. Ehh i try to remain as honest as I can. 
1	Male ISTP.  \n1. I hate dogs with a burning passion.  \n2. Unless I specifically plan otherwise, yes.  \n3. I like looking good, but there's little that is socially acceptable for a male to accessorize in. The only real option, jackets, is closed to me since I overheat easily.  \n4. Not likely at all. If I don't want you to know something, I'm infinitely more likely to avoid the topic altogether.
1	1. prefer cats, dogs are too much maintenance. if i still smoked cigrits, id prefer a dog as it would be a good enough excuse to go out for a cigrit and take a walk\n2. what do you think\n3. depends, some days i just put on a sweater thats still got a cigrit burn in it, and pants ive worn for a week, on other days i can dress well\n4. i don't lie often, especially about achievements, we talkin irl not some imaginary cod-hypomaniac-killstreak achievement, like "how far did you get in reading a book?", i'd be honest about those types of questions. otherwise lying sucks coz i have bad memory, and it's hard to stay consistent
1	idk why you guys respond to things like this, that the person clearly doesn't even care about
5	Do you consider yourself romantic?	Intj female here. Not sure why I'm asking this but here we go.\n\nISTPs, I am wondering, do you consider yourself romantic? If so, why? If not, why? Give me an example of a time where you did something romantic for someone.
16	Yes, because I think about all the shit. Acting out on it in a way that someone else is going to recognize? Probably not.\n\nIn my head though, I'm the God Damn King of Romantic. Can't be beat. 
8	Umm I don’t really know. If a guy was romantic to me, I’d appreciate it but I don’t know how to react to it or how to show him I reciprocate. I don’t understand romance or how it really works or what to do. So I’ll just do him a favour to show I care. Like my ex was painting his stair case, so I did it for him and put a nice finish on it. 
6	I’m convinced I’m the goddess of romance, but an outsider will definitely find me arrogant if I express it with certainty. I’m great in bed, though. Lol is that romantic enough? 
6	Yeah, I’d definitely consider myself romantic.\n\nFor most of my life it’s really come out in the sense that I’m willing to ‘suffer’ for the object of my affection. Which, y’know, is dumb. \n\nIn terms of doing romantic things for a partner... I really can’t think of anything I’ve done. I tend to show my interest / appreciation in the bedroom. 
4	I don't like romantic things but I can get a bit mushy when smitten by someon
3	Not really, but I found myself an ISTJ. His idea of romance is buying me invisible Aligners for my teeth because I’m super self conscious of my gap. With him, I am the sweetest rose in the garden. :)
2	I do not consider myself one, nor does my partner think i am romantic. \nI would like to have been, but i just not romantic.\n
2	no
2	This blog was written by an ISTP and it’s pretty damn romantic: http://dearfuturegirl.tumblr.com/
2	I can be when I want to be, but more so because I lay everything on thick. If I hate you, I'll make it apparent through my actions; if you ask, I'll tell you I detest you. This is exactly same for love, but in a much more positive response, and I find it more troublesome to say I love someone than to say I hate them (but that's because I'm not even sure I've ever been 'in love').
2	No. Can't we just hang out\* and enjoy each other? No need to fuss with the details.\n\n\*Note, this does not exclude going out on a date, I just won't be overly concerned with fanciness or formality.
2	i can try, but it never works out, my idea of romance is their idea of indifference, aloofness, being a dick or being passive-sentimental (??). \n\ni might have a more or less example, though i don't think im going to be sharing that
2	Yes. I think I learned it from my dad. Even though we didn't have much money, he gave us a full childhood.  He took me to a painter on his route, bicycling weekends on the bike path, eventually go-karts with real gasoline (:D).  He also complimented us behind our backs usually, so when he'd say something nice directly, the feeling would go for weeks.   \n\n\nI think that's the same for romance.  It's not something necessarily planned or elaborate, but mainly from the heart and with good intention.  
4	[deleted]
1	yes
1	I consider myself romantic. No one else does. In reality I suppose I’m in over my head.
1	I don't think istps have an easy time recalling romantic gestures when asked.  As an intj in a relationship with an istp I'll tell you some of the romantic gestures he's done.  Whether or not he considers himself romantic is a question I'll need to ask him when he's awake.\n\nBefore we started dating he sent me videos of him doing guitar covers of music he thought I might enjoy complete with singing.  Later on he'd ask me to come up with fun themes for him to create music to and he'd send me videos of him playing those.  These days he will play me new songs as he learns them, sometimes I think he will break his guitar he gets so into it.\n\nHe wrote me a very heartfelt confession when he asked me out.  We were flirting heavily and he got to a point where he was struggling for words, so he asked me to wait for him to write it down properly so he can give it some justice.  Something like that happens once in a blue moon for him because it seems to be extremely difficult for him.\n\nMost days his idea of romance is to share experiences with me that he finds meaningful or is just supremely helpful with my needs.  He won't say no to me if he can help it.  It could be something as small as playing games together on a Friday night or the very obvious one, hiking/ camping trips.
29	Are y’all always bored?	I’m an ISTP, and i’m constantly seeing posts about always being bored as one, but this is not how I feel\n\nI do not get bored on my own; i get lost in my thoughts or I’ll just do a hobby (i like painting, drawing, etc)\n\nWhenever I do become bored I find that it’s from seeing other people bored because it just instantly kills my mood. \nSo for example if i’m at a school dance (i’m still in high school lmao), i’m definitely not the type to get up and dance, but I don’t mind sitting with my friends listening to the music &talking. However, if they start talking about how bored they are, then I can’t wait to get out of there because they’re killing the vibe\n\nmaybe im not an istp?\nmaybe I just tend to mirror others’ emotions?\nor maybe my friends are just really boring ¿\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way about boredom?
28	I only get bored when doing mandatory things that I don't want to be doing. I'm rarely bored in my free time as I try to use it productively.
5	Being bored is for boring people.
8	For me, boredom is avoided at all costs.  I have many hobbies, many ideas, and can always fall back on meditation.  But really, learning how to have good conversations is where it's at.  There are many skills to master to be able to lead a conversation the way you want it to go.\n\nOh, by the way, the trick to dancing is not to think of it in terms of *moves* but *rhythm,* and moving your body to the rhythm.  Let your heel hit the floor with every kick drum, let your shoulders find the snare drum or hi-hats, and just begin inventing hip, leg and arm movements in repeating patterns as the music dictates.  Let the music flow \*through\* you.  That's how to *love* dancing.  Be the instrument's response.  It's actually fun, and it'll keep you fit.
4	I'm rarely ever bored and am at a loss when people tell me they are, in this internet age. There's so much to learn and do and never enough time. I always have some project I'm working on or researching towards. At work I'll find myself amused on here or Twitter in the event of not having any pressing work stuff. Even the mundane/mindless stuff (e.g. cleaning) can keep me relatively engaged. I find myself living by the adage (if you can call it that) "There's a way to do everything" ie after figuring out how to execute something, is there a way to make execution better/more efficient? I definitely have my lazy days (sometimes weeks) but even then I don't recall boredom. There are so many aspects to crafting a cooler, better life for yourself and others that there isn't much room for boredom.
4	I got bored reading your post... not trying to be a dick, just the ISTP life
3	Never bored on my own time, always many things to do.  
2	I’m never bored but I really don’t spend time on hobbies or productive stuff either. I just exist I suppose.
2	One can say you definitively have Fe so one can also definitively say you have Ti- they always go together. Regardless of whether or not one's Fe is the first or fourth one is still impacted by it. Therefore, Fe will pick up the emotions of others, extroverted feelings. When others are feeling down the Fe user will feel down too, and when others are happy then they can be happy as well.\n\nSomething to know is the extroverted functions are the fun functions- as they are not prone to introverted subjective scrutiny.\n\nThe only thing that would point to you specifically being an ISTP, per the information your post provided, is that you prefer the development of Ti instead of Fe. Also, you seem to have a slight Se bias- that bliss of just enjoying the moment.\n\nTi is your sense of self: what you find interesting, the reasons why you do things, your hobbies. It is very easy for you to do things for yourself, to get lost in your thoughts and do the things you like to do. An Fe first, like say an ESFJ or ENFJ, has a very hard time doing anything for themselves even though they have Ti; they consistently want to help people feel better. And as you seem to not have just such a hands on approach to people, one could say that it's your fourth function---> IxTP\n\nConcerning the differentiation of ISTP or INTP as both have Ti first would be your ability to enjoy the moment. You hinted at such a notion by describing your enjoyment of just chilling with some friends. An INTP can do this as well, although it comes out a little differently. So to bring in new variables to answer your question: do you enjoy going out and trying to new things, like concerts, or foods, anything sensory, and be able to enjoy it for what it is? The cause of this is a certain trait that Se  possesses: focusing simply on their environment, they're not off in "endless what ifs" and "endless possibilities" like the INTP, they are 100% present in whatever activity they are doing. If that sounds like you---> xSxP\n\nPut those last two paragraphs together and one gets a super duper ISTP!!
1	I'm in high school as well, and I get bored mostly because I can't just get up and do something whenever I want to. I don't have a car, and there's nothing much within walking distance. Doesn't help that we're hella broke out here too lmao. \n\nSo yeah I get bored pretty often because I don't have much to do a lot of the time. 
1	I'm with you, I used to be bored a lot but that's because I was too lazy to try anything new or that uses up energy.
1	I'm either doing something or bored/depressed, sometimes all of them at the same time. You could say I like to multitask.
1	I know I used to get bored when I was younger, but now that I think about it I can't actually remember the last time I was bored. If I'm in a situation that normally would be boring I just entertain myself by observing or thinking about random shit. After all, those boring situations aren't going to last forever, if you start thinking "I can't wait to get out of here" then the time it takes before you can get out of there starts to seem longer and longer.
1	never bored because when I lose interest in something, I just move on to something more interesting ... do ISTPs even get bored?
1	I'm bored cause I'm depressed
1	I'm exactly the same, I get bored of other people
1	Don't we do things to AVOID feeling that boredom in the first place? If not at every waking moment? Could be just me though.
1	i get bored if i'm home and cannot be stressed into doing something productive lol. given the fact that it's too cold to work on anything outside. it's a nightmare, i need tasks to do.
4	Interesting video on saving money to retire early, something I think we can pull off...	
5	I mean if I get to work 3 days a week doing carpentry/wiring etc and still have food on table, that sounds good enough to me.\n\nMy greatest indulgences in life is internet and yogurt anyway...
3	Pretty difficult to save $1.1 million in 9 years if you earn $280,000 in 9 years...\n\nIt's easy to "save more" when you already earn enough to be able to.
2	Definitely need to start working toward a hybrid of this and my current life 
8	ISTP female (19 y/o)	Hey, so recently I've gotten really interested in learning about the MBTI types, especially ISTP's. I did the test a few years ago and again the other day and both times got ISTP. I think this explains a lot of my qualities. Also a few people have mentioned they think I have sociopathic tendencies which I think could maybe just be an ISTP thing?\n\nAnyways, I have some questions for other ISTP's, and just some other things about myself that I was wondering if anyone can relate to.\n\n* I really have a hard time understanding my emotions and expressing/explaining them to other people. Whenever someone starts to get close I have this tendency to push them away. Any tips on how to be more in tune I guess with emotions?\n* For the longest time I thought that maybe alcohol or trying different drugs would spark some sort of emotional response but so far nothing really has.\n* Does anyone else feel just numb all the time? Like never extremely happy or sad, just kinda neutral, or emotionally muted?\n* Whenever something bad happens, or traumatic even, I bounce back SO quick. It doesn't seem like these events have an effect on me, like almost to the point where I don't care? And it also doesn't matter to me if anyone else involved is okay.\n* I get bored with people so fast. Especially boyfriends/flings. I haven't really been able to commit to a long-term relationship, and I realize part of that could be because I'm only 21 but I just get find I get annoyed with clingy guys and so far they have all been too clingy. Also if people are lazy and unmotivated I can't handle that.\n* I also have a hard time feeling satisfied with where I'm at right now. I'm extremely driven with school and I never take breaks and I feel like that's because I'm trying to reach my career goals as fast as possible.\n* People also tell me that I can be extremely manipulative (especially my parents) which I agree with but I don't know why. It just seems like I am always trying to manipulate my relationships with people to somehow benefit myself.\n\nI feel like I'm missing a couple things but if anyone has any questions totally ask away!\n\n&#x200B;
28	>because I'm only 21\n\nBut I thought you were 19?
9	Everything is me, except school and being manipulative. I stopped trying to be the best a long time ago, not worth the effort.
3	[deleted]
3	I am a 23 yo female ISTP so I hope this helps:\n\n* Knowledgement is key here. Work on just labeling what you are feeling and then go from there. If I can actually figure out the feelings I can address them in a more healthy way. \n\n* Drugs and alcohol don't trigger anything. If you don't have it in the first place then it won't be there.\n\n* Are you actually numb or are you just at a state of equilibrium? Being "happy" all of the time is a stupid idea. I am happy when a good thing happens; I am sad when something bad happens; but most of the time when things are neutral, I am neutral. There is nothing wrong with that. You aren't broken because you don't swing far from normal for too long. \n\n* Most emotionally healthy people bounce back rather quickly. It just means you processed it. People who are worrying types are often extremely vocal about it to the extent we think it's normal and it isn't. Also, the other aspect sounds like a maturity thing to me. \n\n* Also seem like a maturity thing to me. I don't get "bored" of people but I also don't assign arbitrary worth to people. If you are picking partners at random or because they are attractive and trying to assign worth to them you aren't going to do well. You have to have a person you are compatible with and then I personally don't have any issues with that anymore. I also spend years being single because very very few men are worth it. \n\n* This is also me. I finished a bachelors degree in 3 years and then finished my masters right after. I put equal amounts of time into work now that I have a job. I am quite happy with what I'm doing but work is still working. I'm not sure how "satisfied" you expect to be though. \n\n* That's a maturity issue. You might need to talk to someone about it if you can't grow out of that on your own\n\nAlso are you 19 or 21? You sound like you have some serious maturity issues happening (which isn't something you should feel bad about, just something you need to address). I get you might want to make yourself seem younger to make it look less severe but you are only fucking yourself over by doing that. 
1	also an ISTP female and i agree with everything you’ve said so far. honestly the only advice i have for you is to do some soul searching and self reflection. it sounds lame, but it’s how i balance my manipulative side and slightly sociopathic tendencies. 
6	What Type Do You Fellow ISTP Prefer To Date? Why?	Me personally, I love extroverted people because they're very nice and I lack social skills and I wanna learn from them. They're just fun people. And I want someone who can sometimes break rules to have fun but not all the time because that's a turn off for me. I just want someone who I can have fun with. I want thrills and exciting things so he/she (I'm bisexual) must be open to new things. And I've figured I prefer to be with a P type than a J type because I'm happier with them and they're always open to new things.\n\nI also want someone who has plenty to talk about. We can discuss philosophical things or complain to each other about the things we're frustrated about and maybe we can talk things out or give each other some advice or just calm each other.\n\nSo with that, I think I'm more drawn to ENFPs and ESTPs. How about you guys?
7	IxTx women. Not versed in MBTI so I don’t know if there’s a special name for this kind.\nExtroverts tire me out and I don’t like touchy-feely women, though I like women to still look feminine.
6	As a male, the FJ's primarily. FP's are a possibility as well. The first factor is always appearance though and I feel like I can look at someone's face and know their MBTI type. I seem to usually be drawn to the EXFJ's faces almost as if evolution has caused me to be attracted to them knowing they are my ideal match. I've seen girls faces on Facebook and thought they looked like a Fe Dom and then later meet them and find out it's true. Faces tell so much.
3	I haven't tried one of each quite yet, thoroughly enough.
3	I'm generally drawn towards any F type but ESFJs have this way of knowing exactly what I want and when I want it which really turns me on.
3	I'm an ISTP married to an INTJ. It works pretty well I just have to make damn sure I'm communicating because that's not my strong suit. 
10	whoever is the hottest. It is all (and only) about looks for me. 
2	Esfx, I find individuality and extraversion attractive along with being a feeler in contrast to my thinking.\n\n\n
2	I'm a female ISTP. Last year I almost dated an ISFJ and this year an INFJ. When I'm into someone, I usually don't think a lot about MBTI type but I do prefer an introverted person because I hate crowdness and noisy ppl
2	infj, not that great at typing people at first sight, but from the description that's what i'd want in a woman
2	Mainly xNFPs. \nInfps are cute and adorable. \nEnfps are fun and entertaining. \nEntp are mentally stimulating and makes for a strong bond. \nIxtps are chill and good for a random hang out. \n\nxxxJs rub me the wrong way. Sometimes we can be friends but I’m not making plans to see them. 
3	Lately I've been talking to an INTP, and I'm smitten (lol I wonder if she'll see this), but overall I'm pretty trial and error. I mostly just check for alignments in values, interests, etc. 
2	I don’t prefer to date any type. I prefer to meet a person, get to know them, and then decide if I’d like to pursue them. \n\n\nTypes are not there to make pre-judgements on people. Types are there to help better understand someone. If you’re using MBTI for any reason other understanding yourself or someone else, you’re using it wrong. It’s not a predictor, it’s not a persons definition, it’s not a determined pathway. It’s simply a roadmap to different personality types. If you’re using it for any reason other than navigating a personality to better understand it, you’re misusing it. 
1	FWIW my fiancé is ISTJ, we clash a lot (if you thought you didn’t have emotions just meet one of them). But ISTJ’s are perseverant and don’t give up once their minds are made up, so we’ve made it this far. (Also he’s really fucking wonderful and although I knew beforehand that I could go throughout my life without a spouse, I’m glad he changed my mind).
1	as long as it’s not an xNxJ, i’m good
1	I prefer types with Fi and tend to avoid types with high Ti like myself.\n\nENTJ,INTJ,ISFP have been good relationships.\n\nDating an IXFJ who I suspect is INFJ and it's good but a little awkward because we both value Ti and end up being in agreement too often.\n\nI used to like extroverts more but I find myself getting along better with introverts lately probably because my social skills have improved and I can handle taking the lead in more situations than in the past.
1	I was at my best and the most intellectually stimulated when I was with an INTJ because I felt like I needed to live up to his standards. It was like I needed to be at my best ALL.THE.TIME. without him ever pressuring me. I loved all our conversations. The relationship was smooth and nice, but I never truly felt comfortable and relaxed, so in the long run it would probably tire me out. \n\nI seem to like ENFP's and ENTP's from afar because of their ethusiasm and spontaneousness but being in a relationship with them drove me nuts because of all the emotional roller coaster rides. So, that's a no for me. \n\nI'm getting to know an ESTJ now, I totally love all his characteristics and traits. His drive, his presence, his dominance, his subtle sweetness, his practicality, his internal kindness, his toughness, his humour, the freedom he gives me, the way he gives critisms or advices without making me feel like my character is being attacked. Everything is great, except I don't enjoy all our conversations, I can't ever talk to him about hypothetical stuff, weird ideas, or dreams. 
1	Entp or Intj, smart and they get me.
0	Almost Everything Can Be Boring. Here's a Story about Me.	I don't know. I always felt bored, tired (even though I'm not or didn't do antything, maybe because of the repetitive events happening around me) and sometimes I just don't wanna talk. When something unusual happens, I'm not surprised though sometimes I act surprised, into thinking that if I do, I would convince myself to actually maybe feel it? I don't know. Or maybe sometimes to make my life a little bit interesting.\n\nI wanna be interesting or I want an interesting event to happen. I'm gonna be honest, I almost killed my dog because I want to experience killing something (I always kill insects like spiders or cockroaches whenever I see one but I wanna try something bigger). I beat him up and left a little bit of scars. I didn't killed him yet because I like the way he cries. He's a good dog, he never fought back because probably I was a good owner to him. Of course, my parents noticed the scars but I never said anything, they thought it was the neighbor. This kept going for only two days, I admired the dog for his loyalty and determination so I didn't killed him and I decided to consider him as a real pet. I told my parents to send the dog to the doctor and so they did. \n\nFew weeks later, the dog has recovered. I started to like him. I switched his name from Mitch to Titus. He's a well trained german shepherd, my dad and I trained him. I trained him even more. \n\nI'm often involved into fighting. I don't necessarily think I'm cool but rather I think I'm lost and probably just a jerk. I'm depressed for no reason. It sucks. I was also addicted into drinking alcohol when I was 15. I mean all of these happened when I was 15.  Though I stopped drinking alcohol because I thought about it and it doesn't make any sense and it doesn't benefit me, it only made me feel more horrible than I am. \n\nI became rebellious to my parents because my eyes are opened and I know most people, including my parents, treat me like a kid. I know I'm just a kid but what I mean is that they're always lying to me that everything's gonna be alright and making me believe to things are not real. I hated that. \n\nOne day, I met a man nextdoor when mom invited him in a party at our house. Then I discovered that he's a mechanical engineer and a widower. I always like physics but I don't know how to deal with tools at that time. He noticed my potential and thought me about machines. First, he taught me how to fix an air conditioner then we moved to electrical generator. It was one of the best times that I had. \n\nThen one day, me and my dad had an intense and aggressive fight. We almost killed each other and mom couldn't do anything about it. I was really depressed at that time. Plus, I have anger management issues. My life always have been miserable in that house. I could've become insane if I killed Titus before. Like, what would happen to me? I would've aimed higher and could've killed an actual person. \n\nI talked things out with the widower guy. I let out my feelings and everything. He seems to get me and somehow we have a special connection. Although I felt sad when I realized that he's going far away soon and never to come back again. I was devastated. \n\nThen one night, I decided to ran away from home with Titus when I turned 17. I decided to become a mechanic engineer as well and I wanted to follow that dream. Me and Titus went along with the Mr. Mechanical Engineer Guy(not allowed to say his name). I already thought about it, I analyzed the consequences and everything. I know that what I did is for the best. My life would remain stagnant if I stayed there so I just wrote a brief letter to my parents saying goodbye and I gave my gratitude to my mom who tried her best for me though wasn't enough by leaving a gift, a diy necklace, and decided to leave a code containing my number. My mom loves codes and she's vey good at it though I never recieved a call from her until now which hurt me but I must move on because that was my decision.\n\nNow, Mr. Mechanical Engineer Guy provides for my tuition for college and daily needs so in return, I help him with his work. Me, Mr. Mechanical Engineer Guy and Titus are a family. I started to have many close friends that I can trust and hang out with all the time(a female ENFP, a female ENTJ, a female ESTP, a male INFP and a male INTJ)Though I miss my mother, I would rather have a successful and happy life than a miserable one. \n\nSomewhere in your life, I know that there'll be a point that you have to sacrifice something big and important. I'm preparing myself for another wave of that. Nothing can stay the same. \n\nThat's what I've been through with my life so far. What do you guys think? Is this an ISTP kinda thing or what? \n\n\n
12	Um, dude, you ever think about therapy or anything?
1	I think that point for me is coming tbh and I am completely unprepared lol
12	Point of no return? (Relationships)	I come here to ask if other ISTPs experience this similar feeling and thought process of 'once you begin questioning the relationship then you ultimately have no chance at returning back to its initial roots.'\n\nMy first relationship, about 1.5 years with an ENFP, was primarily good until I slowly began having a true distaste for his minor flaws and imperfections that I perceived as detrimental to a lifelong future. I pretty much numbed myself, became distant, and did not allow myself the opportunity to see past them or have the conversations to make things better.\n\nI JUST had this same experience with my relationship that ended after 5 months with an ENFJ. It was just 2 weeks ago that I began noticing 'undesirable features' that would stop me from wanting him as a lifelong partner. I also convinced myself that our lifestyles don't match and that I could find someone more compatible. Therefore, I had a brief conversation and decided to end the relationship before I 'go for the ride' and end up hurting him even more.\n\n...I feel like I'm being utterly unrealistic and cold considering that I'm letting petty flaws or character differences that I 'just don't like' leading to the failure of relationships. However, on the flip side, it's also good that I have strong awareness on these matters.\n\nI appreciate any input. \n\n  \n
7	Had two previous long term relationships, both about 2.5 years. I went through this same thing, even tried to push past it for a (long) while. Neither worked. \n\nBeen married for 2 years, together almost 6 now. My wife has flaws that I hate. She has little things that annoy me day to day or week to week. None of those make me want to leave her. \n\nIMO: It’s easy to use the little things to escape a fleeting romance. When you find someone you truly love, those little things are so vastly overshadowed that you won’t want to end the relationship. 
6	I have no advice for you, but I do this exactly
5	I worry about my bf feeling this way. I would hope that he realizes that he can always turn back. INFP here - I recognize how important autonomy and freedom is to my ISTP, so I am careful not to cut his wings. Someone who is claustrophobic doesnt panic until they're in an enclosed space. I figure if I can give him all the freedom to be who he wants and do what he wants, he won't worry so much about what he is missing by being with me and not some other girl. \n\nIf he gets bored, he gets bored. Thats tragic, but it happens. Divorce is too common. Sometimes I wonder if we are just going to love each other long enough to eventually hate each other like so many other couples and it just makes me want to stop the clock...but I digress. Ideally, you meet someone who recognizes you fear the lull and looks to keep it interesting by continuing to date you, year after year.\n\n You can play that grass is greener game with yourself forever. When you really love someone, you love the moment you are in with them. You dont want to trade up. It doesnt make any sense. \n\nIt sounds like maybe you haven't met the right person yet, but it also sounds like you might be trying to achieve an unachievable connection. If you are prone to doubt - you are probably going to doubt a little. No matter who the person is. That doesn't mean you should stop pursuing them.\n\n Maybe address that doubt and look internally for reasons why you doubt, rather than externally, by trying to understand what about this person makes you doubt them. All of this to say, give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to little things. Those little things we might not initially like about someone can end up being one of the reasons we love them. Good luck out there!
3	To put it simply, figure out what you want. You seem to have an unlimited set deal breakers.\n\nYou need to compromise. You need to accept differences, but mostly you need to be realistic with yourself and what you are looking for.\n\nI have a true partner. We drive each other mad. We talk to each other and work on understanding why we drive each other mad. We work together to fix shit. \n\nWhat are some things that made you dump them?\n\n Curious, because i don't think you are wrong. We think things through, istps.  You probably just had the strength to take action whereas many have stayed in shit relationships.\nI was one of those.\n\n\nEdit: younger me remembers a lot of confidence and doubt issues, so pulling the plug quick was a  tactic i used. (Older me remembers slowly)
1	What's your enneagram type?\n\nI behave that way with non-intimate human relationships, like friendships. I'll end up weighing the cost of my total independence against what it takes to maintain such a relationship.  The ones requiring too much investment for me end up being fades.\n\nBut it sounds like you're describing something rather different.  As an enneagram 9, looking back I see a pattern of just the opposite of what you describe in romantic relationships.  The amount of energy it would require to end the relationship lends me to consider more and more flaws as acceptable as time wears on until something reaches a breaking point.
1	I'm a pretty conservative person when it comes to relationships. I will stay with someone no matter what happens.
0	Look up female nature. Lots of people talk about it on YouTube  (hypergamy). If effects relationships even if you don't realize it\n\nNot bashing you for having it, it's just a difference men and women have\n\nFrom memory, I think r/redpillwomen is a thing
1	Is it possible to be two types?	A few months ago I took the test and got the ISTP type. I watched a video on the type and it very largely described me. However, I just took the test again and now I got INFP and a lot of the qualities of an INFP apply to me. So now I'm confused on what type I really am. Any thoughts?
8	An online test is not definitive. Lots of people question their type. As you live your life you will have insights to better type yourself.
5	You absolutely can be a mixture of types. \n\n\nThe more time I spend developing my weaker functions, the more often I test as different types. I still identify as ISTP because I tested 100% ISTP for years. It wasn’t until o found this place and learned about developing other functions that I began to test differently. So I believe my core is ISTP. But through development of my weaker functions, I’ve began to emulate a mixture of types I suppose. 
3	Nope, everyone is just one. It's normal to relate to every type at least a bit (to varying degrees), though, since in the end we use all 8 functions, it's just about which ones have priority.
3	Every letter isn't a binary black/white, it's a scale. Something like this:\n\nS--------|--------------N\n\nSo this person would be closer to the middle, but leans S. I suspect you're somewhere right around the middle for the S/N and the T/F.\n\nThe other thing is you can compensate for being too far on one side. For example, I'm super far on the P side, I hate J tendencies. But I know being a 100% P makes success more difficult, so I have picked up some J tools to help me manage. Perhaps when you took one of the tests you were thinking not of your default position, but the ways you compensate. Try taking a test and go with your gut reaction.
2	I've been typing all over the place recently, I didn't identify with a lot of the perspectives on this sub, so thought I must have changed. Until I read this and have never identified more ISTP. Will explain the similarities with other types too.\n\nhttps://personalityjunkie.com/istp-type-profile/
9	Be my friend? Lel	I have a soft spot for ISTPs, but I don’t have that many in my life atm, let alone any who’ve done MBTI.\n\nReally keen to learn about how you think, debate MBTI/socionics and so on.\n\nPM me if interested.\n\nCheers.
31	If I'm honest, PMs are too much effort for the expected return on investment. 
23	Coming to the ISTP sub asking to be friends with us is not the right way to be friends with us
8	I want friends, but it takes so much effort to initiate and maintain friendships. I have 6 friends, and the rest are acquaintances that I've mostly forgotten :/
8	Oh my God. We literally want zero friends.
2	No.
1	Debate?  Not for me.
1	Depends
14	Samesies	Any Istps in a relationship with another istp? I know opposites attract and all, but after being married (now divorced after 8.5 years) to someone that just did not understand me one bit, I have found myself in with another ISTP (2 years now), and it's the greatest thing. It just....works. We get each other, we understand ours and each other's struggles and short comings and how to navigate them in a meaningful, productive way. We both enjoy drinking in social settings to give us some extroverted vibes and it's awesome fun. Then we can lay around all day recharging and it doesn't bother the other haha it's just so easy! Neither of us has unrealistic expectations of the other. We take turns around the house with our "explosive" energy.  I'm just over here hoping it's not too good to be true!
14	I never thought I'd see an ISTP say "samesies."  \n\nI always see ESFJ or ENFJ listed as being ISTPs ideal type but I'm an INTP married to an ISTP and I can't see him with anyone who isn't another thinking type, preferably a Ti user. Obviously I'm working around a bias here, but I think he may be happy with ESFJ theoretically (the woman he was interested in before me, whom we are friends with is an ESFJ and she's so very emotional and sensitive, I don't think she'd be happy with *him.* She cries over...a lot of weird stuff and my husband has no patience for people crying, it annoys him).  So, from that aspect, I think two ISTPs would be good together as they wouldn't hurt each other's feelings, encroach upon their space/invade their privacy etc. 
4	Just to remind ourselves though we are ISTPs, our upbringing and principles makes us slightly different from one another. \n\nI'm glad you found someone to be happy with. : )
1	Seems like it would "work" very well, assuming that's your main goal for a relationship then your set. To me, the ideal relationship would be one where you have an understanding of each other but opposing world views. To me this would allow for the most personal growth which is how I see relationships; find someone you enjoy spending time with and become better people together. That being said, I see the appeal as it would lead to an easier life which (correct me if I'm wrong) would become more so the ideal the more you age and care less about how other people view you. Anyhow, glad you found someone who makes you happy.
1	“Opposites attract” has its limits. And I believe this is only a key factor in things like taste, hobbies, fashion, entertainment, etc. \n\n\nBut it’s very important to have similar ideals when it comes to morals, ethics, religion, politics, etc. And that’s where similarly aligned personalities come into play. \n\n\nDifferent Taste in music, food, clothes, pastime activities, etc. brings new excitement to a couple. But different personalities, moral views, ethical views, etc. will all drive wedges in a relationship. They cause strife because they are opinion based ideologies with real world positive/negative affects. The type of food I like holds no bearing over existence or rights or anything. It’s a mundane preference. \n\n\n(The following is all hypothetical and does not reflect any of my personal beliefs/tastes. It’s simply to make a point.)\n\n\nI like corn, she hates corn. Does this matter? No. Not one bit. I like red scarves, she likes blue scarves. Matter? No. I like action movies, she likes romcoms. Matter? No. \n\n\nI believe abortion is murder, she believes it’s her right. Problems? Goddamn right. I believe when we die, we go to heaven. She believes we become dirt. Problems? Goddamn right. I believe the earth is 6000 years old, she believes its 13b years. Problems? Goddamn right. \n\n\n(Hypothetical part over) \n\n\nSo when it comes to likes/dislikes and various mundane tastes, opposites absolutely attract. It’s exposure to new experiences and new things without challenging our core behaviors/personality. But when it comes to how each person operates at their core, and the ideals that drive them, a good relationship will be two people who are very similarly aligned. How could you ever expect a devout Christian and a devout atheist to have a healthy relationship and raise a child? It would be filled with struggle and fight and argue. Same with any strongly opposing beliefs. \n\n\nSo I believe opposites attract when the opposing nature applies to individual subjective taste, such as food/fashion/movies. People who are alike attract when the nature of the similarity pertains to subjective states of belief about human nature, such as morals/ethics/politics/etc. \n\n\nSo if you can find someone who is alike on a fundamental level and opposite on a subjective taste level, you’re going to find a flourishing relationship with a strong unified bond. All of the things that matter to your core beliefs will be upheld and strengthened by your partner while your subjective enjoyment of culture/food/entertainment/etc. will be expanded. Does it get any better than that? 
3	How important is home ownership to you?	Do you feel fine with the idea of living in a rented apartment or would you prefer to live in a house that you own?\n\nHow important is it to you that you do the upgrading/repairs/maintenance around your home? Do you feel fine with the idea that someone else does all/most of that work (e.g. contractors, repairman, plumber etc.)?\n\nRecently I figured out that my grandpa is an ISTP. He is really invested in the house he lives in. He took part in all the major works during the building process, from brick laying (the house is made form [porotherm block bricks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Porotherm_style_clay_block_brick_angle_1.jpg/1280px-Porotherm_style_clay_block_brick_angle_1.jpg)) to light fittings installation. He build stuff from scratch and is a master when it comes to welding, drilling, cutting wood and metal, cement laying  etc. Around 50% of the house is made by his hands only (dog kennel, big pigeon coop, small wooden house for my brother and me etc.) He is also quite possessive of his house and won't allow anyone to touch the house unless he personally vetted that the contractor is of at least his skill level or is a family member. \n\nI'm interested if this is a ISTP thing or is it just a him thing. Maybe it's a generational thing and today's ISTPs don't care so much about all that. 
7	I currently rent and plan on always renting. Location is very important to me and I don't want deal with the hassles and maintenance that comes with home ownership. 
7	Renting is inherently a waste of money. It’s often more expensive than home ownership (in terms of mortgage payments vs. rent, I understand maintenance and repair is a different matter). \n\nAlongside this, when you’re renting, ‘home improvement’ really isn’t a thing. You have what you have and it’s sort of a surprise in some cases after you move in - you can check everything you can think of but something is gonna piss you off, and there’s not a great deal you can do about it.\n\nSo yeah... Home ownership I’d say is a practical approach to a living space, financially and in terms of being able to get exactly what you want out of where you’re spending your money.
3	Unless you live in a city, renting is only good in the short term. You can't usually make an apartment/building exactly how you want if you have laws from your landlord. Plus if you move there's no return investment that you would get. \nI'd rather buy an old historic fixer-up house and work on it over time.
3	I hate renting and I can’t wait until I have enough for a down payment. 
2	So, I grew up on horse property my dad owns. He is terrible at any maintenance and repair. From a young age I did about 95% of the maintenance and repairs. Eventually I found my way into HVAC, have my contractor's license, and am the senior tech at a school district. I still do all his repairs, as well as the maintenance and repairs on my 3 classic cars. \n\nThat said, I live in Los Angeles and with starter houses at half a mil and paying 2500/mo in rent, it's been impossible for me to save enough to even get in the game. Sucks, but I'm not dwelling on it. The place I rent uses a property manager, whose maintenance guy was an idiot. Eventually I was able to contact the actual owner and explained that the guy the manager was using (and defending) was actually creating safety hazards. The homeowner took over repairs, even though I offered to do the work in lieu of rent, but they declined. We now have an unfinished kitchen remodeling project for a year, a hole in the laundry room where rats can get in, and they just raised our rent. It's fucking retarded. Looking for a new place, but the good news is that they fucked the house up so we should get our deposit back, lol. His house, I could care less.
2	I'm aiming for FIRE, so I live cheap and invest all of my income. I occasionally get the desire to buy a house to have more control over my surroundings, but I'm not so fond of being tied to a single location to the tune of several hundred thousand pounds quite at the moment.
2	i'd rent if i really had no choice, to tell you the truth. i hate it when someone makes money off of me, job and career aside. hell i'm even considering purchasing a yard, i'd rather live in a trailer on my own property than renting.
0	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel    free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type    identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay    since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright!
9	You actually made a new account for this?\n\n...well, given the subject matter at hand I can’t say I blame you. 
5	Hm, "none" is not an option.  As I don't see a logical reason to wear them, I don't.
8	Is this a joke?
5	Get this $hit off here 
20	Yall take these letters too seriously	4 letters dont define a person (istp here)
21	Ha.
34	EVERYBODY SAY IT WITH ME! \n\n\n*MBTI IS FOR EXPLAINING, NOT PREDICTING!*\n\n\nOne more time! \n\n\n***MBTI IS FOR EXPLAINING, NOT PREDICTING*** \n\n\nIf you’re using MBTI to predict someone’s behavior, you are applying the exact same stereotyping logic that goes along with racism, sexism, and whatever other isms are out there. You cannot, I repeat ***cannot***, predict someone’s behavior based on 4 fucking letters. That’s simply not how it works. MBTI is not a definition. It is a guideline to your personality to help you better understand yourself. \n\n\nEvery person is an individual. They have their own experiences, unique personalities, and memories. Reducing them to 4 letters and predicting their actions is downright rude and bit narcissistic as well. MBTI is *fantastic* to help better understand somebody and why they are the way they are. It’s great at explaining words and actions. And it’s great for personal development. But the second you start using it to predict, you’re going to run into problems.

2	Well, as an ISTP . . .
2	yeah the letters are an indicator that determines your function stack.. it is the functions that the Myers-Briggs Type *Indicator* is based on
2	Yup, correct.\n\nBut it can give you an insight into your strengths and weaknesses.  It can help you learn to utilise your strengths and build up your weaknesses.  It can help you learn that you aren't a weird loner and that there are a heap of people similar to you.
2	Well as an ISTP, I find MBTI saves me time and provides a practical solution that is more often right than wrong. If everyone wore a pin with their 4 letters,  there would be less pointless chat and more productive understanding and communication.\n\nIf it saves me time, I'm in.

10	I can't workout, too much passiveness	Dear friends of mine, I lay my issue upon your judgement.\n\nSince I was a kid, exercising and sports have meant shame and embarrassement to me. I was too skinny as a toddler and teenager, I was laughed at and called names. Unfortunately as a young adult I have turned obese, so getting fit is a matter of health now. \n\nThe problem is that I hate sports, it brings me bad memories and I have learned to be passive, workingout seems impossible, I don't even understand how it is supposed to feel like in my mind and body. \n\nI have tried going to the gym, but the ambience sucks so much it deserves a thread of its own. \n\nAny one has gone through this? Any success story? \n\nI think I could find a farm not too far from my place where I could work for the weekend so I get a strenous activity for my body. Oddly enough I can lift heavy objects when working on diy furniture projects, carrying wood and bags of cement. \n
12	I think you need to find something you like. I'm the same exact way in that I hate working out because it's just so boring. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I love activities like rock/wall climbing and other outdoor activities. Hopefully that's an option for you. Otherwise, a part-time job that forces you to be active is a good option.
5	Get some sneakers. Start taking walks. Don't jump headfirst into the gym, start with some home stuff that you can do comfortably so that when you get to the gym you can focus on your workout and be blind to those around you. Take some nice walks through a park or the woods if possible, but just find a good route that will take you about an hour each day. Make sure you just give yourself a good 5-10 second stretch of the old leg muscles first.\n\nBuy some home dumbbells. Not huge ones, but ones that aren't for old people and children. Ones you feel comfortable with.\n\nThen once you're comfortable with your walks, do some curls and other exercises before and/or after your walk every other day. Not a ton, just put on like a 10 minute YouTube video and start pumping. Maybe one on the science of muscle growth or weight loss.\n\nOnce you've been doing this for a while and are comfortable with having a routine (and have possibly lost a couple pounds), incorporate some crunches every now and then on your non-dumbell days before your walk. Gradually increase their frequency until you're doing them every other day, then move towards every day.\n\nAt this point, a month, maybe two, perhaps three have passed. When you have a healthy routine like this, then start looking at the gym.\n\nOf course, during all of this, you'll probably need to alter your diet a bit. Head to /r/fitness and /r/loseit and check out their sidebar, I believe they have some good, easy food plans. But keep in mind, **this is not a race. This is not something you can do overnight, or over a week. This is a challenge for you, by you, to attain the fitness goals you want.** It's gonna take a long time and a lot of effort, but it's well worth it. We're all rooting for you.
5	Have you tried playing pokemon go?  I know it sounds like a stupid kids game, but it is something to do while walking around.
5	So I’m a girl and I’ve always been naturally thin. I just walked into the gym and did my thing....but in the morning when no one was there. So just try going in the morning and don’t care what people think. You’ll probably never see them again anyways. Gain some muscle and lift! 
4	Nobody is actually looking at you in the gym, just a heads up. But there are loads of 24 hour gyms out there, and going at night is usually pretty empty. I definitely advocate going and working out on a frequent schedule. Nothing feels better than earning gains. Lots of advice and helpful redditors at /r/Fitness too. Best of luck
5	I'm the same way, I hate lifting weights and the vibe in a regular gym feels awkward and shallow, like I'm being watched and judged every second and I don't like the whole meathead physique. \n  \nI would recommend kickboxing to any ISTP. Kickboxing gyms are always really welcoming and have the best atmosphere. Kickboxing can be a very social activity, but on days your not feeling the whole "teamspirit" you can do your own thing.\n\nKickboxing really helped boost my confidence, I was also bullied a lot in school. I don't want to beat up my past bullies, but it helps my confidence knowing that I more than likely could. You'll also find plenty of people who had a childhood very similar to yours and any combat sport tends to draw a lot of people who think similarly to people like us.
3	Stop eating to get unfat.\nExcercise, although excellent for you, isny going to make you lose all that weight. \n\nEat less.\n\nSource: morbidly obese food junkie.
2	Can you run or ride a bike? That should do it\nOvertime, if you manage to get those memories out of your mind, you can start lifting.\nYou're not supposed to think much more than the muscle that you're using and breathing, that should be the focus of your mind.\n\nI know exactly how it's like, asheming memories come to my mind now and then and it's like torture.
2	Seems like you don’t mind the idea of hard labor to keep you in shape, I worked framing houses back a while ago and I was never in better shape, 35 extra lbs of tools for 8 hours a day plus carrying wood all the time I had to eat about 4000 calories a day just to keep up and not lose weight 
2	The gym sucks, get a mountainbike and use it multiple times a week. Walk the other days, a dog is very helpful to stick to this one. 
2	I had the exact opposite childhood, I spent pretty much all my childhood playing sports, aiming to be pro hockey player. Unfortunately bad deals and injuries lead to quitting at 17. I love sports, but I always hated working out, so I gradually became super lazy to the point I did not even played recreational sports anymore.\n\nI got bit chubby a it was really bothering me, so I was forcing myself to gym, I hated it as it was just gruesome grind and I gradually started again going less and less. Then I fell in love with mixed martial arts and never stopped (until another injury lol) and now I am getting in better shape than I was trying to be as pro athlete again, because I love it so much.\n\nAs ISTP I would recommend giving a shot to jiu-jitsu or boxing, they are both so cerebral, you will almost definitely find a joy in it and won't mind the difficulty, quite contrary, that will keep you hooked. No need to be fighting or anything, just practice itself is great fun and super effective workout.\n\nIf not not martial arts, it is still only about finding what you like and becoming obsessed in true ISTP fashion about it.\n\nWorking out for sake of working is not a way to stay fit and healthy, you will keep quitting and just build up more hate for it.
2	Are you trying to get fit or just lose some weight?\n\nDiet is pretty much 70% of fitness, if you're eating at McDonalds 5 times a day, any exercise you do wont matter, just cut back on food, drink more water, and steadily built up to a healthy diet that suits your needs
2	Walking and running are the two best exercises and are known to have mental benefits as well as physical.\nGo to a park, pick a trail and just go.
1	I have all the same issues, too.\n\nI grew up thinking I was fat when I wasn’t and whaddayaknow, self fulfilling prophecies are a thing, huh?\n\nThe exercise I’ve found I enjoy most is swimming. The worst part (when you’re really uncomfortable) is just getting in and out of the pool.\n\nThe best parts are that you don’t feel yourself getting all sweaty because you’re in water, and everything kind of feels a bit weightless for the same reason too. \n\nYou just have to do it. That’s all. Pick a thing and do it. Work everything out as you go, but just commit to doing it. And if you’re anything like me (as I suspect you are, fellow ISTP) the main part of the battle is in your head. What helped me was to *not* think about it. Get in the empty brain box space and just do the damn thing. And you’ll repeatedly surprise yourself. And it’ll be great. Let the results do the talking.
1	Something that helped me greatly was taking notice of how I felt before and after working out and knowing when to get out of my head.\n\nA lot of times I find myself feeling mentally drained, lazy, apathetic, and wanting to just lay down and give up on life. I'm sure other people share this feeling too, but it's important to realize this mindset isn't looking out for your best self and that listening to your mind during these times will only lead to more guilt, shame, anger, and sadness. It will tell you to do something comfortable, to feed your addictions, ignore your stressors, and everything else that helps you grow in life. When you recognize this mental state, it's important to get out of your head as quick as you can.\n\nThat's where working out comes in. When you focus on the repetitive task of contracting your muscles during a workout, it clears out your mind, removes all your pent up energy, and brings you back to a balanced state of mind. I used a mood journal to monitor how I felt after working out, and I consistently felt more energized, more enthusiastic about life, and better equipped to handle the struggles of life and conflict. Focus on your body, feel the blood pumping to your muscles, and admire the strength and power of our bodies that so easily gets overshadowed by our minds.\n\n
1	Fuck exercise. Find a sport and play for the enjoyment. Take your dog for a jog. Some people enjoy the gym, God bless ‘em. That could be very appealing to a specific introvert. For me it is misery and agony.
1	So, the biggest thing is that you want to work \*toward\* something, not \*away from\* something. For instance, why do you want to work out? You say it's a 'matter of health'. I hope this isn't too blunt, but is the motivation: "I want to work out so I'm not fat", or "I want to work out so I don't look like this." Those are poor motivators. They're powerful for a while, but very quickly you lose steam because bodies change very slowly.  \n\n\nI did calisthenics for a while, and I was successful not because I 'didn't want to look x way', but because I wanted to see how muscular/lean I could get. Again, you want an achievable goal.  \n\n\nGoing to the gym blindly is just... it's just awful. No one likes it, no one has fun. So you have to find some form of motivation for stuff like that. If you want to go to the gym, make it into a game. 'How much could I bench this time?' 'I wonder if I could beat my personal best for time jogging.' I don't know if this is a specific ISTP thing, however. This is just general advice for nearly everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFind something \*you\* like to do. Maybe you realize you like tug o' war, and so you start trying to achieve that. But working out to work out, or to 'not be thin' is an uphill battle. People can do it, but it's damned hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally rock climb, and it's fantastic for me. Moving my body and finding ways around problems inspires me to keep my body as trim and strong as possible. But maybe something like that isn't for you. Maybe you want to ride bikes on a mountain trail or something.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Find something you like to do that uses your body and start doing it. You will naturally want to do whatever's possible to get your body in a position where you can do that thing.
1	I'm a pastry baker, so keeping fit with how much sugar I eat is a constant battle.  I do a martial arts class once a week and yoga once or twice a week.  I tried the gym thing, but there is something about gyms that just makes me hate life.\n\nTry taking a **class.**  Yoga, martial arts, Pilates, cycling, I think someone else mentioned kickboxing too.  \n\nPlus if you invest in an activity financially it gives you that little extra motivation to keep going.  And give yourself time to get into it.  At least two months.  Once you develop a habit your body will start expecting the exercise and you'll actually want to go. \n\nSounds like a bunch of motivational jargon, but its working for me.  Hope this helps.  Good luck man!
1	i used to go to the gym when i was younger. however, i was always the one that stood out for whatever reason. i remember i was a giant germaphobe, i'd go to the bathroom and some bloke that works there was washing his hands after he took a piss or whatever, then made a giant affair out of the fact that i was waiting behind him trying to wash my hands. in a bathroom where there was only one god dam sink. then went outside and was crying about me being "creepy" to his butt buddies. perhaps if the gym wasn't sticky and smell like body sweat i wouldn't have had to wash my hands.. \n\nworst was when i was benching, and sure you could say that i was doing too much weight.  as i slowly was putting the bar back to it's place, some dude ran up to me and started lifting it up for me.\n\nthats my problems with the gym. but i feel like i could use more physical activity as my bud told me how it's important for mental well being
1	Get into running or find a climbing gym. Rock climbing is the literal best. 
12	ISTP and ENFP romantic relationship	Hi everyone, first time posting here!\nThis is going to be relatively long, so I added a TL;DR in the end. \n\nA few monthd back, my then girlfriend decided to put me to the test and sent me the MBTI. At first I got to say I was skeptical about it, and there was no way a test with 100 questions could determine EXACTLY all my traits in my still young life. Turns out that I'm a ISTP and as soon as I started reading the personality type, many of you can relate to this, was shocked with its accuracy. For the first time I felt as if someone compiled everything that I am into a text that I was then reading. It had a lot of substance, but I never really given it much thought. Had no idea how useful it was to understand my own mind sometimes, because you all know it gets messy in here. Until recently.\n\nI've never been much of a romantic relationship guy, always had flings that lasted 1-3 months because I quickly got tired of people. My own personal space, where I can devote myself to whatever I'm interested in at the moment was always important to me, and letting people in is a problem. When I started talking to my ex, I immediately noticed something different. She was not like most girls, I could actually talk about anything and not be judged/mocked for my particular views. She understood my personality and knew that I too was different from the rest. \n\nWe dated for a year and it was a crazy one for me. My lack of experience and my tough personality combined, prevented me from devoting myself entirely, but she understood that and gave me space. However, I feel like it wasn't large enough, for a few months back I started doubting myself and didn't feel like going to see her sometimes, but had no problem texting while I was doing something else. Bells started ringing in my head, telling me to leave her, because it wasn't fair for either of us to be in that position. I never confronted her with these feelings and over night I decided to end it all.\n\nJump forward to 2 weeks ago, something sparked my mind telling me that maybe I made a bad decision. So I decided it was time to revisit my personality type description to try and troubleshoot this. Turns out getting out of my comfort zone is a huge step in making situations like this work. I feel like perhaps I should give it another shot, and this time try to really make it work, no matter the indecisions that might pop up. On the other hand, it could make me feel like I used to and the urge to end it all might never go away.\n\nI would like to know what you guys think.\n\nTL;DR - ISTP feeling like he should give another shot at a ENFP ex but he's worried that doubts and indecisions might rise up again.\n\nSorry for the long post!
16	My husband is an ISTP and I am an ENFP. It is a sometimes-frustrating relationship, but I don’t know any other types that can teach each other more. He and I would have much more shallow lives without each other.\n\nIs it easy? No. Is ideal? Doubtful. Is it all that hard? Not really, as long as you care for each other. As long as you are aware of your differences, you can use them to help each other grow and have a great time every day of your lives. ENFPs stay grounded with ISTPS, while ISTPs learn to enjoy life with more exuberance with ENFPs. It’s like happy puppies loving on old and reluctant cats; sometimes it ends up just perfect. \n\nMy advice: decide if you could ever see her as your best friend, because that’s the relationship that binds ISTPs and ENFPs most. I wouldn’t change my situation for the world, and every day is a fantastic adventure. I have plenty to complain about, but infinitely more to celebrate.\n\nAll the best to you either way.\n\nETA: My husband hates leaving his comfort zone, but the thing with ENFPs is that we take the wheel. You give us love and we make any situation just right because we have so much motivation to give to those whom we love. My ISTP is often reluctant but rarely regretful about the situations I throw him in. I think it’s worth you giving her another shot. It can be such a beautiful scenario.
12	ENFPs make great companions for ISTPs.  Remember that they will need a consistent source of reaffirmation and will naturally seek attention, which is great for getting ISTPs out of the shell, but can be uncomfortable at times. \nGreat traits for a friend but could lead to problems when said ENFP is a girlfriend, particularly because ISTPs are known to need lots of time alone, which could lead to frustration on ENFPs part. \n\nTl;dr: get an ENFP best friend, or a puppy. 
7	Yo ENFPs are the best! And they arent all that common either. My sister is one and we are super good friends... i think you should do it, if you enjoy spending time with her... its ok if you need down time every now and then. If you feel bored, you two could try doing a project together or something. I would say go for it.
6	I’m an ENFP dating an ISTP and it’s the best, easiest relationship either of us have had. But we’re also very blunt about both of our needs with each other. When he needs alone time he just asks for it. When I’m getting bored and need a new experience, I ask for us to go do something. Etc. It works because we’re both incredibly easygoing and protective of our own independence. We also spend a lot of “alone time together”, where we’re hanging out in the same room but doing our own thing.\n\nI’m obviously a big fan of the ENFP ISTP dynamic, but don’t go back to your ex unless you really see yourself giving it a true shot. Don’t jerk her around.
8	I was in your position once. Decided to give it another shot, ended up marrying her a few years later. The ISTP/ENFP pair well together, generally speaking.
3	I'm an ENFP female currently engaged to an ISTP male, and I couldn't be happier :) While it's totally normal to have doubts about whether or not the relationship will work, I would say that in the case of romantic relationships, it's important to follow your instincts. It could end up being a mistake, but at least you can say at the end of it that you really made an honest effort in the relationship.\n\nAlso, remember to use MBTI as a baseline and not the end-all-be-all for helping your relationship. I think sometimes people rely too much on MBTI alone, and I do feel that there's so much variation within the sixteen personalities. Heck, I can't relate to every description of an ENFP-ISTP relationship that I read about haha.
5	> She understood my personality and knew that I too was different from the rest.\n\nthat's quite rare, never once happened to me
3	Im an ENFP. Dated an ISTP for around 3 years. Still love him till today but he says im his biggest mistake. 
2	Hey, does she know about any of this? Did you tell her why you ended it?
2	ENFPs are the best for being close friend to us they bring enthusiasm and motivation to our lives. But for the life and love no one attracts me more than ESTJs and no one fits me more than ESTJs. 
14	What do you do during very short spare time ?	Each time I'm waiting for something for lets say 5-10min, I start by looking at my surroundings then end up staring at people or doing useless things on my phone. I hate that, it's a huge loss of time.\n\nWhat do you do when you're waiting for the rice to cook or whatever ?
29	If I see downtime in my future I try to figure out some way to fill it. Even, as you say, waiting for the rice to cook. Today I postponed a drink of apple juice because it would be more efficient to pour and drink a glass of juice while the microwave was heating up my leftover spaghetti. Warming spaghetti, you see, left me with 1 minute 30 seconds of downtime.
9	I would like to get back into reading so I should start carring a book but typically I browse reddit. 
6	Play with my phone.
4	Every time I am both hungry and need to go take a piss, I put the food in the microwave, go take a piss and return to an already heated dish. Time usage efficacy.\n\n\n
3	When at home - push ups or small chores, like wiping dust in a particular room.\nIn public - check my phone, browse Reddit.
2	Practice german
2	I'm not neurotic about time, so nothing.
2	Look at Reddit
2	Waste it.
2	5 minuets? That’s enough time to run one out
1	listen to podcasts and learn something
1	browse on Reddit or check my social media
1	I sleep or tey to read something.
1	Play sum Lil Tracy ;) 
1	Duolingo, currently studying Spanish
1	Crossword puzzles.  Love them.
1	Planks or stretches. If I'm in public, discreet exercise like sucking my stomach in and holding, or, Kegel exercises. But who am I kidding, I usually just watch cat videos or read the news. Because it's not useless information if it's CURRENT EVENTS.
1	Brows social media while listening to podcasts.
-1	I froth at the mouth, scream, take off my clothes and wank off to the cat
19	ISTPs and routine	Hey, I was wondering how other ISTPs feel about routine, as most descriptions I’ve seen mention liking it as more of a Si thing, rather than a Se one.\n\nI like my routine, or to put it more accurately, I dislike when external factors force me out of it.\nI don’t like taking days off my morning runs or the gym, or when someone suddenly makes plans to go out, hell, I don’t even like skipping classes without a reason. Sure, if someone asked me to go on a one week trip to go hiking or rafting, I wouldn’t think twice about going and skipping everything else, but when uninteresting things make me change my plans for the day, I get quite annoyed. \n\nHow do you guys feel about routine?\n\nEdit: Okay maybe routine wasn’t the best way to put it, it makes it sound like something boring or that I *have* to do. Let’s leave it at being protective of your free time and disliking when things get in your way of doing what you like.
28	I really need routine.\n\nNothing works when I don’t have one. Everything falls to shit, and I eat, think and sleep like a moron.\n\nThis is all regarding things I need to do though. I don’t want any kind of routine in my free time, I don’t particularly even like making plans for free time, I most like to know that I’ve got some time to do whatever tf I want.\n\nWithout something grounding me (which is usually working 9-5) I tend towards chaos and important things get neglected.
21	[deleted]
13	I'm not sure if it's subconcious or not, but I sort of crave for excercise everyday at 5 PM after I first started hitting up the gym. I just want to make any sort of excercise, mostly lifting or running
4	I don't think I necessarily like or dislike routine. I just like doing things on my own terms. And if someone interrupts the flow in a way I don't like, then it messes with the loose schedule I have in my head. I also tend to not like it when other people assume my schedule (read: N dominant) based on what they observe my "routine" to be. Because to me, I don't have a static routine - things could definitely change if I wanted them to. But I need to want to do that on my own. Someone once told me I'm like a shiba inu. They're considered hard to train because you need to make them think it's their idea to do things. \n\n"Shiba Inus will only respond to activities that make sense to them and are very strong-willed and stubborn. They will fight back if feeling threatened and will not back down once they have their mind set on something." https://shibashake.com/dog/why-are-shiba-inus-one-of-the-most-difficult-breeds-to-train\n\nHilarious read, actually.
10	Fuckkkk no. I have no routine other than what I absolutely have to do. So I have to be at work at 9, so I always wake up by 8:20 at the latest. But I could wake up at 7am or I could wake up at 8:20...it changes every day.\n\nIn college, I skipped A LOT of classes. I was an engineering major so i definitely just made it harder on myself. \n\nAnyways I suck at planning and I realize that, so I just don’t bother with it. I always end up doing what I need to do when I need to do it. So I guess I just don’t see the point in planning.\n\nYou sound like an ISTJ btw.
4	I'm not so good at sticking to a routine, which is why I hate it so much when something disturbs my plans.
6	I wake up, eat, coffee, work and sleep. That’s my routine, but it’s just 5% of what actually (randomly) happens throughout my day. 
3	i have my own routine but it rarely defines what i do during the day since i like for every day to be a little different depending on what tasks i need to complete. 
3	I like having routine but having freedom within that routine. So I prefer to go to the gym in the morning, but if I end up going at 3 pm then that’s ok too. 
3	As ISTP is a Mechanic, he likes a correct work of a particular mechanism. But on the other hand ISTP  is more of a probem solver in an intuitive way. That's why the first impulse says to you "Stick to the plan, stick to the schedule, do everything by the textbook" and when you start to do it you feel unsatisfied, because your intuitive problem solver is not engaged. Then you hear something else too "Just quit every plan, bring all the things to the zero and start from the skratch, have only target but not the realization plan". And the second voice is closer to your nature, and there you start your adventures and growth.
6	I used to be a lot more spontaneous when I was younger. But now I’m pretty attached to my routines. I absolutely love spontaneous adventure. But for some reason, too much spontaneity messes with my brain. I start slacking on responsibilities. \n\n\nTo keep my brain and life structured, I try to stick to routine. \n\n\nHowever, I have no problem changing routine if it’s planned in advance. 
2	I hate any form of runtime but I feel if I ever want achieve anything routine is a must.
6	Reaction to destructive criticism	Is it normal that whenever someone tries to damage my self-esteem through destructive criticism I just say that I agree with them but internally I just ignore his opinion about it?\n\nHow does the rest of ISTPs react to that type of critics?\nLike for example, when people attack your intelligence or more superficial things such as appearence
14	Criticism only matters to me if it is logical and objective. For instance, if i lose billiards 10 times in a row, and somebody tells me i am bad at billiards, i cant disagree with them. Theyre right.\n\nBut if someone calls me ugly, i dont give a shit because thats completely subjective and it only matters to them. Of course if like 20 random people told me i was ugly, then i would have to accept that a decent percentage of people are inclined to think so... but there is no objective ugly.
4	I totally relate. I’m not about to argue about myself with somebody. As they’re giving me criticism, I decide wether or not I agree with it. Of course I keep an open mind, I’m not dead set on shutting criticism out. But I’m a very logical methodical person so when I hear criticism, I immediately analyze it and “test” it in my brain via thought experiments. \n\n\nBut if I decide what they’re saying is as useful as a nail gun with staples, I don’t bother getting into it. “Thanks I appreciate the feedback!” Comes out of my mouth while my brain goes “well that was a waste of three and a half minutes”. \n\n\nIt’s just easier to agree and not apply than to justify and defend. If it’s something that *needs* to be defended, say to a boss or SO, I will. But when it’s somebody who’s opinion doesn’t actually hold weight over my life, I don’t bother disagreeing. I just pretend to agree and move on. \n\n\nIt’s part of my “pick your battles” philosophy. 
2	Their criticism is not me, but their perception of me or whatever they find and can talk about me. The only criticisms that matters to me are those that I sincerely ask or coming from people I truly respect. 
1	If it's about superficial things I usually laugh and agree, but if it's about my intelligence I'll do the same while internally ignoring them. I like criticism from teachers or people I think are respectable, because it gives me a good idea of what I need to work on. \n\nCriticism from people I have no respect for is seen as annoying, since the things they critique are usually things I'm always taking a mental note to self-correct, so the constant reminder isn't taken well.  
38	28 F ISTP	I just found out that I am an ISTP.  I am a straight female, 28 yrs old.  And would like to hear from other female ISTPs.  What are you like?  Where are you?  Be my friend!  Lol.  Jk but all my life I've had a hard time connecting with other females.  I've always been the tom boy who hangs out with the guys and has a hard time finding girl friends that have common interests or dont completely drain me, or expect too much from me emotionally/commitment wise.  I work at a bike shop, which I LOVE, because every day I get new challenges like bikes to take apart and fix.  Dont like the sales side as much, but I'm really good at faking that.  In my free time i like hiking, mountain climbing, cycling, and am a very good artist.  But my art is also very precise, technical, and detailed mostly leaning toward photorealism.  Not so great at putting meaning or emotion behind it or coming up with things out of my head.  Im also obsessed with puzzle games like crosswords, sudoku, escape games, stuff like that.  I am extremely introverted and kind of a hermit.  Ok I'm totally a hermit.  I hardly ever feel the need for socialization, in fact it gives me some anxiety.  I do have a long term boyfriend, though who I've been with for 5 years.  He has at times told me I'm cold, not nurturing enough, dont give enough attention or affirmation.  And I find myself wishing he would man up or stop being so emotional/sensitive/needy a lot of the time.  Though I usually try to bite my tongue.   I like my quiet time.   I'm not very emotional.  I dont get super mad or super excited really.  I'm very laid back and go with the flow and live in the present.  I dont like making plans.  I have a very logical mind and dont let my emotions get in the way usually.  I'm pretty vulgar for a girl, and would probably offend a lot of people if I never learned to filter myself depending on who I'm around.  I have never really met another girl like me.  And often times I feel more masculine than the guys I'm around.  But I'm a pretty girl who wears make up and paints my nails and styles my hair every morning too.  So this has gotten really long.  Other ISTPs, tell me about you?  Are you like me?  I would like to discuss.  Thanks.
11	I'm 28 F ISTP too!!!!\n\nYeah I have trouble with female friends sometimes. It's like, I'm smart, but I don't really care about "smart things" that much. I'm not very studious and I don't like being cooped up, I'm mostly drawn to ideas that "interest" or "excite me," and that has a time limit. Things get old fast sometimes. So I don't really fit into the "smart/studious" crowd, because I get restless. But I also don't really fit into the "fun" crowd either. Because I do need *something* to keep my mind busy. This is both to feel engaged (--->fulfilled), and because "an idle mind is the devils playground" and I do reckless things/start drama when I'm bored. I also fall off the face of the earth sometimes and the friends I do have, tend to take that personally. And it damages the friendship longterm.\n\nI have a boyfriend, he is ESTP and it works really well for me. He "gets me," but he's also very different than me because he's so enthusiastic and outgoing. I really like this about him. I can be a hermit too, but sometimes when I get inside my head too much, I start turning into the unabomber, in terms of my mental state. He doesn't really allow me to get there, and also, if I'm like "people are a fucking JOKE. Let's analyze this facebook picture as proof. Notice how their pictures are always taken at a specific and unique angle? This suggests that--" he'll be like "what are you, an emo or a goth? drink this beer" And then I snap out of it.\n\nHe's also the "more emotional" one of the relationship, but because he's ESTP and his emotions are shallow like mine, it actually allows me to be comfortable expressing my real emotions. Sometimes it's hard because I have real emotions, but they're so shallow, so it's like there needs to be a really specific mechanism to even draw them out. He actually prompts me to express them, but he doesn't judge me for how shallow they are. We can both be really "emotionally expressive" but we have no "emotional depth." \n
7	Something that you said about you boyfriend made me thing you should look up love languages and find out his and yours, everyone loves through two of five ways so if you can find his it makes things to much easier 
5	riddles, puzzles, and escape rooms are amazing and i totally relate to not being nurturing enough. my sarcasm and "cold" nature is overwhelming, so i have a big problem where people find me mean and i've gotten in loads of trouble for "bullying" when it was my attempt at what seemed to me like a clear joke. i'm getting better though at holding my tongue, but that just makes me way more introverted than before.
3	41 yr old  ISTP woman and fit all their stereotypes lol, I am even a veteran. I have always tested as ISTP and it is so strange how correctly it describes me. 
3	Dude, same. Well four years younger and work as a baker. But legit same all around. Also weirdly good at faking good customer service even though it's the only thing that really stresses me out. Welcome to the club!
2	Hi! Another ISTP female, 31. To be honest, I wasn’t surprised when I read that ISTP females are pretty rare. I am quite emotionless too. I mean they’re there, but I feel things for very few and specific things.  Message me if you’d like to chat. I could use more friends haha.
2	[deleted]
2	28 ISTP Female\n\nI'm definitely a typical ISTP female like everyone else here...keeping gal pals lately has been extremely difficult. They're needy. I'm too honest and not overly complimentary enough. I don't like typical, illogical female behavior and am bad at hiding my contempt for it. The few girl friends I do have, recognize and at least don't get offended by my straight forward attitude, even appreciate it and know I can give them unbiased, thoughtful opinions. I've given up on everyone else.
3	I’m 24 F istp. Sometimes I feel like a contradiction because I appear very conventional and feminine, but my hobbies and interests are pretty tom boyish. \n\nI’m a chemical engineer. All of my coworkers are guys. About 6 months into my most recent job, one coworker told me how they “all liked how chill I was” lol like it was surprising. I like inappropriate jokes and seem to have a guy sense of humor. Unfortunately most of my interests seem to also be more guy-oriented. I’ve been weight lifting for the past 5 years. I play various rec sports (softball right now), just started playing golf, I ski, I used to climb/boulder A LOT and love it but just don’t have time right now. I’m also on a pool league since I wanted to get better at pool. Sometimes I run, I was a varsity track/CC runner. Oh and I’ve been taking dance classes with my roommate. Most of my interests revolve around physical activity and I’m naturally athletic. I get pretty bored just sitting and talking for too long. I’m also a 5’9” 128 lb blonde conventionally attractive girl. So people don’t really expect me to be smart or athletic or kinda nerdy. They expect me to be catty or something, idk I’ve had multiple people tell me that I’m not what they expected from initial appearance/impression.\n\nI was always very smart. In college I never went to class, procrastinated, but still did just fine. In high school I took all the hardest classes but didn’t have to put in much effort. I hung out with the druggies at my private girl school lol.  I did a lot of drugs, went to raves, just was kinda crazy. Sometimes I do think I bring drama on unintentionally when I’m bored. If strangers say shit to me, I say shit right back, which people never seem to expect. I have very little fear. I kinda like the excitement I think. I am terrible at planning, I hate committing to things very far in advance. Somehow I manage to stay really busy. I rarely spend much time completely alone.\n\nI do have trouble making female friends, largely because I rarely interact with many. I’ve been trying to get more girly hobbies (dance) to meet more girls. I don’t struggle with superficial conversation, though I have trouble maintaining female friendships...they can be kind of demanding? It’s hard to describe.\n\nI had one ex boyfriend (an INFP)  say that I was unfeeling and not verbally affectionate enough. It REALLY bothered me for the longest time. Now I’m starting to think we just weren’t compatible. We were together for 3.5 years, even lived together, talked about getting married one day. No other boyfriend has ever made that complaint though so idk.
2	Another one here too. I’m pretty bad at commitment and tend to roll my eyes at people who are too emotional... trying to give more shits 
2	ISTP girls 😂 👀
1	Wow, I love you...
1	You guys I'm also a total pot head, but never really liked drinking.  Only socially on rare occasions, but even then always limit myself as to not get too drunk.  Do you guys like to drink and/or smoke weed every day?  Lol
1	Are you me!? I wear makeup (not much), dress -sometimes- pretty and I'm good-looking and yeah, pretty much like you, I love being around men (I mean, some of them are hot and some of them are fun to be around, maybe you can even find several ones that are hot AND fun to be around. Heaven.), because just like you I don't find many women with whom I share interests. I have an ENTP female friend who is like me (not emotional, free, doesn't need to be all day every day together, drinks a lot of booze...) so she's all I could "need" in friendship matters; one friend is enough. \nI wish I knew more ISTP women. We're cool.
1	I'll be your friend. \n\nI also am 28 and  ISTP apparently. I'm also INTP 
11	My ISTP has gone MIA	Hey, I’d love to get some input from you all again. I have a good friend who is an ISTP. 2 weeks ago, he admitted that he has feelings for me (which are very mutual). We had some great conversations about it but hadn’t acted on it yet, although I think we were getting close. \n\nLast week, he lost his job (which is where I saw him everyday) and I haven’t heard from him since. I have texted him twice with no response. I miss him, but I’m also worried because he’d been feeling depressed before this even happened. I’d greatly appreciate any thoughts you have as to why he would stop speaking to me and what, if anything, I can do. Thank you!
28	Probably has 10 saved texts he wants to send you but can't get the wording right
11	Im sorry, but did you say he confessed his feelings to you....and the feelings were VERY MUTUAL....2 WEEKS AGO.....AND ALL YA'LL DID WAS HAVE "SOME CONVERSATION" ABOUT IT?!?!
8	This sounds more like acute depression than an ISTP thing. It sounds like maybe there's some shame and/or feelings of worthlessness. If he does decide to hang out with you again, don't overload him with a pep talk.  If he is an ISTP, he will NOT want to vocally confront or acknowledge those feelings.  Just show him your care/support by spending your time on him.
7	Offer to meet or bring him food that he likes.
3	I would not try to "seal the deal".  He may be especially worried to get into a relationship if he is also struggling with depression.  But perhaps it was just a mood?  Eitherway...  for me it needs to happen organically day by day.  If someone pushes me to be with them it will drive me away.  I very much want to be friends first and just go with the flow.  So I would just continue to be his friend.  Dont try to "seal the deal".  But perhaps start being a bit more flirty.  Start a casual relationship.  My boyfriend and I had been friends for years.  Then we casually dated/hooked up with no commitment for a few months.  This gave me time to go over all the facts and see if this person had any habits or red flags that would be a deal breaker.  After a few months of casual non exclusive dating... I decided that I wanted to be exclusive and told him that.  He agreed.  But nothing changed except we knew we would not be seeing other people.  It didnt get super serious all of a sudden.  We just took it day by day and let it happen organically.  After 8 months of exclusive dating, so like a year total of dating, I told him that I love him.  And weve now been together 5 years.  In the past I have ghosted people who have tried to rush me or skip the friend/casual stage and jump right into full on relationship. 
2	Boiii,  does this sound familiar to me. Not an ISTP here, but already had to deal with something like this with one (and still sort of dealing with rn).\n\nFirst thing first, trust me, this most probably has  nothing to do with you. He's not mad at you or something like that. If he had already been feeling depressed before this, and the losing his job happened ontop of it, chances are he needs some time to think things through, etc. And most ISTP need a l o t of time for that. \n\nSecond, if his life is sort of a mess right now, he definitely doesn't want you involved in it. What my ISTP told me when something similar happened was something like "I like you, and it's why I want to take some distance. I want you to be happy, and you can't be happy with me right now". \n\nPlus, regardless of anything MBTI related; if he's been feeling depressed, it's even harder to care about the things you know you should be caring about in that state. \n\nSo, what to do ? Well... Sadly, there isn't any answer to that. Keep checking on him, even if he doesn't answer, he will appreciate you tried, trust me. There's absolutely no way to get an answer out of him if he isn't ready.\n\nIf you want to talk more about this, I'd be happy to give more advices if needed, you can always pm me !
2	Or just ask him what's up.  We like directness. 
1	 \n\nMy partner seems to be ISTP and he struggles seemingly with anything that isn't an engine or a weapon. I'm an INTJ and when I approached him on a dating site I quickly said "No point in messaging continuously, we have to meet up to understand if we have chemistry. I'd rather find out sooner than later so we can either get on with our lives or enjoy it together" (romantic huh?) and he appreciated this attitude as it was unusual for a woman to show that kind of authority and decisiveness.\n\nAs much as I have tried to increase efficiency, he still has some issues and I spend my time sternly asking "what do you want? What do you need? When did you first feel this way? How can I fix this? You do know that there is a solution to every problem" and even though he curls further into a ball at first. I have to try and perceive the point where he has actually been pushed into scared/confused child mode and needs hugs and encouragement. Of course, all people are different, but he really does seem to respond to logical questioning followed by a hug, understanding and reassurance. Ultimately he is delicate.\n\nIf in "sealing the deal" you mean copulation; in my experience (I'm not tarring anyone with the same brush), these people are strangely shy and don't seem to want to expose themselves to someone they don't know very well, (which confuses me as I saw this as a tool in order to confirm chemistry) perhaps this is a fear of vulnerability, which sounds similar to what you are describing. Commitment issues get a bad rep, but really, people who are afraid of commitment are frighted of rejection and being hurt and by golly, they are delicate little things when you get through.\n\nI have now been with my chosen human for 2.5 years and he is still letting down walls and sometimes when things get really bad, he uses me as a 'comfort blanket' of sorts, which I am happy with as he has no other close emotional connections and I understand that this is important for human development and survival. but honestly, it's only recently that he has really started to share his feelings with me willingly instead of pushing me away. He is hard work, but it's worth it when he bounces around talking about mechanics and fixes my motorbike haha.
1	Check your sock drawer.
6	Is it possible to be both a Myers-Briggs ISTP, and a Socionic's ISTp?	As the title states, I'm pretty sure ISTP is my type in both, yet everyone says you switch the last letter if you're introverted.  I'm definitely a perciever in the MBTI sense of the word and all of my socionics relations make sense for me to be an ISTp. I even used the comparison tool and it reinforces that I'm an ISTp.
9	Yeah. Socionics and MBTI don't translate the same for all the types.\n\nPeople generally follow the rule that you switch the last dichotomy for introverts, while extraverts stay the same, but that's still not entirely accurate. It's better just to treat it as a completely separate system for typing.\n\nThere was an ENFP I talked to ages ago who knew Socionics really well, her husband was ISTP in MBTI and ISTp in Socionics.\n\n
4	If you go to r/socionics, you’ll find it’s full of posts of people who tested as the same type in MBTI and socionics. I test as INFJ in both systems, and my husband tests as ISFP in both systems. And yes, I’ve heard of this ‘flip the last letter’ for introverts thing. But now I’m not so sure how valid it is. If you look at Beskova’s descriptions of [Maxim](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/102-Maxim-Male-Portrait-ISTj-by-Beskova)  and [Gabin](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/93-Gabin-Male-portrait-ISTp-by-Beskova) , you’ll find that Maxim (ISTj) sounds just like MBTI’s ISTJ, and Gabin (ISTp) sounds just like MBTI’s ISTP. Same goes for all the other types.\n\nMy conclusion is - maybe socionics has a completely different understanding of the jungian functions, and you can’t really match the two systems by flipping the last letter.
7	Socionics is just nonsense. They literally put half of the mbti ISTP and ISTJ descriptions into ISTp and the other half in ISTj. They define extraversion and whatnot differently. I'm probably an extravert in socionics because I like being outdoors.
2	The 'P' 'J' switch is purely semantic. 'P' in MBTI refers to your first extroverted function being perceiving. 'P' in Socionics refers to your first overall function, whether it's introverted or extroverted, being perceiving.\n\nSo for an ISTP, Ti-Se, the first function is introverted judging (Ti). The second function is extroverted perceiving (Se). MBTI says your first extroverted function is perceiving so it uses a 'P'. Socionics says your first of any function is judging, so it uses a 'J'. The types are identical in terms of the same function stack. ISTP/ISTj is Ti-Se.\n\nThe ISTJ/ISTp is Si-Te, and has the opposite introversion/extroversion for each of the functions. The types extrovert and introvert different parts of their psyche.
2	I test ISTP in both. Profiles match up as well. 
2	Not technically. If you are an ISTP in MBTI your primary function is Ti and your secondary function is Se. If you are an ISTp in Socionics you've got Si as your primary function and Te as your secondary. \n\nObviously, you can't have two completely different sets of primary and secondary functions at the same time. So you are either mistyping as an ISTP (Ti, Se) or as an ISTp (Si, Te).\n\nThis happens a lot, for a few reasons that I can think of. \n\nFirst, Socionics (mistakenly, imo) considers dominant introverted judging (Fi, Ti dom) types to be structured, organized, dutiful, and less spontaneous, much like dominant extroverted judging types are. I think this is a mistake, because their judging function is introverted, and wouldn't be visible in there behaviors in the same ways. Inside they judge, externally, they appear as perceiving types.\n\nAnother reason is because of the differences in the descriptions of the cognitive functions. Personally, I got pretty thrown off the first time I read their descriptions and had to completely reevaluate my type for a while.\n\nThird is the shitty English translation of their websites, tests, and descriptions. It's really easy to get confused reading a lot of the writing on those sites.\n\nSo, yeah, no. If you're an ISTP, you are supposed to test as an ISTj. 
2	To me socionics and MBTI ISTP profiles read very similarly. Both are practical, independent introverts who are super good with details and being “in the moment.” \n\nI find ISTPs are a bit more “chill” than ISTJs though they can be just as stubborn 😂
32	My dating life in a nutshell	
21	I mean at least you have one 
10	They're just so common. 
6	My boyfriend is an ISTP, I’m an ISFJ. We both enjoy being alone, but together because we can each do our own thing. We enjoy each other’s company without saying much, he does his tinkering and I do my schoolwork. Been together for a while now. Sometimes, things work out. 
4	For me an ENTP comes along and blows everyone out of the water 💗
3	I’ve never been long term attracted to Feelers. What’s that like?
3	Zero interest in isfj… or nfjs. Ever
7	but istp/enfj relations are terrible. ENFP is what you want.
2	For me an ENTP comes along and blows everyone out of the water 💗
32	My(INFJ) ISTP is recharging.	I'm an INFJ married happily (but often quite frustratingly!) to an ISTP. I recently discovered this sub and the "care manual" pinned post in here has opened my eyes in a whole new way, while also being frighteningly hilarious. I printed it out and will be referring to the guide frequently until I learn it, adding necessary hacks and tips as need be.\n\nWe recently bought a handheld vacuum that only has 15 good minutes of sucking power. After that, it needs to be recharged for about 6 hours. I realized that this is probably quite similar to the ISTP function! Though a little less exaggerated (but only a little less!).\n\nSuch a helpful analogy all around. Now I'm timing how much recharging time he needs before he's available for interaction again!\n\nEdit: a missing letter
18	Where can I find me a girl like you? Fuck. You care so much that you’re putting in so much effort for him. What a world class wife you are. I can only hope to find someone as open minded and flexible as you one day. Lucky lucky man your hubby is 👌🏻
9	xD I completely relate to him. I **am** sorry that you have to wait for quite awhile though haha
7	How do you have the patience for that vacuum? Lol
6	I've also found I can increase those 15 minutes of social interaction to 30 minutes by just interacting more on a consistent basis. If I hangout with people all the time for a week, all the sudden, after I'm done recharging, I need more social stimulation than before. Now I can and NEED to hangout with people twice as long.
16	This would have been a hilarous post is the ISTP in question was a female.
5	xSTP metal/punk musicians	Any one know of any metal or punk musicians that are xSTP?

28	Sense of self	How strong is your “sense of self”? I find that I don’t really understand any parts of myself (on a psychological and emotional level). I can better analyze other people, but when it comes to me, I just seem “empty”. There doesn’t seem to be much to analyze because I can’t tell if there is anything to analyze. \n\nEven if I try to define certain traits of myself, my mind immediately starts to debate that trait to see how accurate it is (but at this point, I start to deem it unimportant). \nCan anyone relate? \n\nTl;dr Do you have a severe lack of a “sense of self”?
19	My sense of self changes over time, depending on what I see and hear from other people/friends and what I see/watch.
13	I used to relate 100%. But I’ve spent the last two years working really hard to solve this problem. And I honestly owe a lot of it to psychedelics. \n\n\nWhen I was at rock bottom I decided to go for it. Nothing had worked. Therapists, pharmaceuticals, the whole nine yards. Every drug I was ever prescribed Just covered the problem, or more often made it worse. \n\n\nSo I opened my mind 100% to whatever acid had to show me. I did a solo drop for my first trip and went on a journey of deep introspection. Since acid connects most of the brain all at once, it allows you to access the subconscious. With practice, you can even construct a memory bank in your mind and select memories to replay with incredible detail. \n\n\nI’ve tested memories of pictures I know are on my phone with a friend and was able to remember astoundingly small details even though I hadn’t seen the pictures in forever. \n\n\nWith this I’ve been able to dig up some core repressed memories that play a huge role in my personality. It’s really helped me deconstruct all of my defense mechanisms and rip off all the masks. Through a psychedelic experience called ego death, you can see yourself in third person. Your immediate conscious is complete separated from the concept of self. You are simply an observer. When you see yourself 100% objectively, your subconscious cannot hide things from you. It can’t trick you into believing something to protect you, which is its ultimate goal. \n\n\n\nSo this practice can be disturbing and can get terrifying. You may be hiding some disturbingly toxic things deep in your personality. And ego death is going to show you that. But, if you’re ready for it, you can handle it and then process it when you’re sober. \n\n\nSo basically what I’m getting at is that I now have a pretty solid sense of self. I still have a few things I’ve yet to figure out. Searching memory banks isn’t an exact science. I basically have to scroll through until I find something that triggers an intense feeling, then I “replay” the memory and look for the significance. So it’s taken a lot of time to to sift through my life and look for core events and traumas. I’ve been at it for two years and have finally climbed my way out of a 10 year battle with depression. The ten year anniversary of the trauma that triggered my depression is actually next month and I’m looking forward to kicking it’s ass to the curb. \n\n\nGetting to know yourself is the best thing you’ll ever do. It comes with an overwhelming since of internal peace. We fear what we don’t know. When we don’t know our true self, we fear our true self. And that’s a mind at war with itself, which triggers things like depression and anxiety and schizophrenia (I believe) etc. So when you know yourself, you learn to not fear it. That fear is replaced with peace. You are now in control for the first time ever. When you’re in control, everything changes. Life gets better and it moves quickly. \n\n\nAnd when you’ve trained your instincts (your secondary set of 4 functions, whole different wall of text lol), you gain control over the actions which you can’t control. When things happen suddenly and your brain acts on instinct alone, you don’t have a say in the matter. However, if you consciously train your subconscious functions while you’re in control of the situation, it makes it easier for your brain to default to that training when you’re not in control. That’s how you control the uncontrolled actions. \n\n\nSo what this does is help remove fear out of your general life. Because now you know you’ve trained yourself to handle adverse situations that your four main functions failed to solve. It’s harder to be afraid of something that you now know you can handle. You can’t be prepared for everything. But the more you work at it, the more fear disappears. And the higher confidence goes. \n\n\nAll of this takes a *lot* of Work. But it’s been an incredible journey that I am still working on. I believe I have left depression in my past now. One day I hope to fully understand what makes me tick from head to toe. But for now, I’m just happy to have my vitality for life back. 
3	Who we are is defined by what we do. 
2	100%
1	My ex was my mirror that I learned about myself through. I learned that I'm steady, self-centered, funny, averse to commitment, awful at encouraging others, and maybe most of all I got a sense of what to watch out for in a relationship, both bad and good.\n\nWe're all relative to other people, right? Look at yourself compared to those you know the best.
1	do you mean like your identity?
1	huh i find myself in the opposite boat. i enjoy self reflection and i do it enough that my sense of self is constantly changing and evolving. 
1	I find that looking back i cringe at the ways i used to be a lor, and i know that in the future i will cringe at how i am now. Its a perpetual cycle. 
1	Same
1	I've always had a strong sense of self, I think. I had religion and parenthood figured out when I was 10, my career when I was 13. I've always  understood my thought processes.
88	Am I an idiot? I only remember directions by landmark, I don't even know the names of the streets in my own neighborhood	Any other ISTPs specifically like this? I'm curious about other types too though
49	I'm like this as well. I know my address and that's about it lol, everything else is land marks and muscle memory
26	Yes if I need to know a street name I can look it up on my phone. 
16	No, you are not. :) \n\nAre you able to backtrack the exact route you took on the way over even though it's somewhere you haven't been before? 
15	I am an amazing navigator. I drove around the tri state area for a living, I could get many places without consulting a map. I didn't know street names.
8	It's all landmarks for me. I also didn't know the names of most roads near my house. I just didn't care, and didn't need, to know. I don't know most of the roads where I live now, and I've been here 15 years.
6	can't remember shit lol, I remember shapes and colours and though, just nothing specific
5	background: fam trip to prague. we're trying to find our way back to a restaurant we had passed earlier in the day. no service, couldn't use google maps, i got us there purely by remembering landmarks (bars). 
5	Same here, i did learn some recently because I got tired of people looking at me like I'm stupid. Road names are no use to me, I can see land marks from farther away than any signpost of some road name.
5	I don't really know my type, but I'm the same way.
5	I have an ISTJ cousin and an ISTJ friend. Both of them know every fucking street name and read every sign on the road. I on the other hand have never bothered to look at signs or street names. It's always by landmarks like you. I wonder which cognitive function or pair of functions would make someone more likely to read street names. Si or Te?
2	I've found that there are some things that my brain just refuses to learn. Like no matter how hard I focus, I just can't figure it out to the point I would call it "knowledge".\n\nThere's a confusing part of town where 3 roads basically intertwine and come out to 3 different roads, like they change names and stuff it's weird. Anyway, I've lived here 20 years and you'd think I'd be able to figure it out. Nope. Still have to ask my wife which one goes where, STILL!\n
4	I'm like this.  Or in fact, I remember every street in the local area I grew up in (I'm 51) but hardly know any streets where I live now.  Excellent sense of direction though\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife navigates by street names.  We have constant conversations that go like "You need to go down Suchandsuch St"  "Is that the one with the McDonalds?"  "No, that's the one with the bridge over the creek"  "Ok, why didn't you just say that?"
3	It's all land marks for me, I could draw you a street map of my town but could only name like 2 roads.
3	Same here, dude. I can't remember street names even if I tried. I would just end up forgetting in the next few mins lol. But when it comes to landmarks, it pretty much becomes muscle memory.
3	This is weird. ly accurate.
3	Honestly i just remember what roads i need to get too/from work and places i frequent. Like, i know their names but i couldnt tell you where they go or what they turn into. 
3	Landmarks are a secondary indicator for me since I usually foeget them (unless its a huge one). I usually draw a mental map im my mind with all the major street names and navigate as if I have a built in visual GPS in my brain.
3	When my istp follows a GPS he follows it by the shape of the road and ignores the rest.  It's kind of astounding the way it is for Se users.  There's an esfp streamer I watch playing a Dark Souls type game.  He can mow through the first several bosses without dying on his first try but instantly tossed his map when he realized it didn't tell him where he is on the map.  His followers were laughing at him "GG 1 int can't read a map".
4	You’re not an idiot just for not knowing something? Don’t be so hard on yourself. \n\n\nIf there’s something you want to learn, learn it. Start paying more attention to directions. Pick random moments to open your compass and see what direction you’re going. Check and see what directions a street runs. \n\n\n“The cure to not knowing is to learn” -some philosopher dude in BC. 
2	I'm definitely like this. 
2	Glad to know I'm not alone in this xD
2	I’m like this too. Delivery guy couldn’t find my house driving around in my neighborhood and I had to navigate him by house colors and trees. 
1	i can remember big streets, thats bout it, or ones that their names stick out
5	Demon Fi in ISTPs	How does this show up in ISTPs? I read CS Joseph's blog about it and the parts about being underappreciated and becoming indifferent is 100% true for me. I was walking home from school today and I noticed that I had took on this 'ok' indifferent attitude towards everything and his blog just explained everything for me. 
7	Hi!\n\nDemon function is the 8th function.\n\nI've got a theory (with lots of readings about this topic) and I'll try to be as short as I can.\n\nAll types have 8 functions. The first 4 are valued, and stronger in the order they come. The last 4 are unvalued, and stronger in the order they come.\n\nISTP values: Ti Se Ni and Fe. Stronger on Ti, less stronger on Fe.\n\nISTP doesnt value Te Si Ne and Fi. Stronger on Te, less stronger on Fi.\n\nThe thing is, when we are born, we start using the first 2 functions a lot (I'm not sure if the functions start "growing" because of the things that happens around us when we are born, or it is something genetic. For example if mother and father valued Fi, you might value that too. Might be a mixup). When we can't achieve what we want, we start using the next functions, but since the 3rd and 4th functions are less stronger, we start using our subconscious functions (Te, Si in ISTP's case) because of the weakness and energy draining that it is using the 3rd and 4th when they're not developed.\n\nIt is said that The 5th function is used when under stress.\n\nThe 6th function as critical parents when the valued functions don't work.\n\nThe 7th function as a deceiving function when the valued functions don't work.\n\nAnd finally, the 8th function when all else fails.\n\nWhen we use our 8th function (the so called Demon function), it's because all other alternatives failed to accomplish something important in life.\n\nIt is temporary, of course, but you can be in a grip longer depending on the stuffs that happen to your life (loss of a loved one for example).\n\nWhen we get older and more mature, we start using more often the 3rd and 4th functions. It is say that on average we develop the 3rd function in the 20's and the 4th function in the 30's, but that's dependent on your life. A person who goes through a rough childhood tend to mature earlier because they need it to survive.\n\nOn a final note, the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th functions are used subconsciously, it means that it is a reaction, not something that you consciously do. The more you recognise that in your life, you will control your shadow, and become more complete. For example you can sometimes use Te consciously if you're arguing with a person who values Te. It's not easy, and not something that everyone can do, but it is said that it is a way to be more complete, and accept your dark side so that you can manage it in a better way.\n\nI know that when I'm using Demon Te (ENFJ myself) is because I'm really angry, because my Fe, Ni, Se, Ti, Fi, Ne and Si didn't worked out.

25	Anyone else here visually think things out their mind?	I’m talking about whenever you’re trying to figure something out in your mind, you create infographics, animations or things that are visually appealing to help break down what you’re trying to solve? \n\nI struggle with trying to put my ideas into words but everything makes sense in my head when I think this way. Everything just comes out in analogies or drawings if I’m trying to explain something to others.
21	Yes I always think in visuals and can never explain myself with words. It's like words are a language I don't use. I was thinking back to when I was younger and why I never knew actors names in movies and then I realized that even to this day I don't listen to the words haha. I literally just watch the visuals and body language the entire time like an idiot. I'm always reading people's movements and never listening to what they're actually saying.
9	Yes i can relate and that is one of my reasons why i suck at writing and reading. Reading more in the sense when i read a paragraph, in my mind i just go on a picture tangent, my eyes will still read but nothing sticks, after a while i notice i have been imagining unrelated things and have to start reading from the start. I have noticed when i do puzzles, in my mind there are no words, just taking in information with my eyes and makind possible moves with eyes. It's frustrating to speak when someone ask you about something you know but only things that you can think of is pictures.
8	I can only do math in my head if I visualize the operations, and start doing exatcly the same way you would do in a paper\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if I have a black board, or something i can write, transcribing a mind map is usually my way to go to explain a topic more complex to someone
6	Yes. And when it's too much for my head, I sometimes make notes. The notes are undecipherable though, because it's like I group a whole section of shit in my head into a single word or phrase on the notes, and the note is just referencing back to that group. It's like I partition that section off to come back to later.\n\nConsequently I never showed work in school, and it drove math teachers crazy. But how can you accuse me of cheating, or deduct from my score, when I'm the first one done and it's all right? My parents went to bat for me on that a few times.\n\nI also hated writing. Essay's are the worst imaginable assignment, they serve no purpose.
3	Yeah I have a makeshift whiteboard in my room for thinking and writing down other stuff
2	I've told people that I'm "Minority Report"ing when I plan things, because I picture things that take time as blocks that I want to physically move around with my hands.  \n\n\nI also try to think through decisions like a flow chart, but that usually gets away from me...
2	No. I can't picture anything in my head. I mean it literally.
2	Yes! I frequently say “I don’t think in language unless my thoughts pertain to a conversation.” So unless I’m planning out words to say, I’m not thinking in words. I’m thinking in pictures and animations and imagination. \n\n\nI would’ve thought that would make a good candidate for art, because I can clearly picture things in my head. But nope, still suck LOL. 
1	I like analogies and remember directions by landmark, I find I can think and write much more clearly than I could talk but that's about it.
37	Saw this on r/INTP	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7zlfvd0o6ev11.png\n\n&#x200B;
16	But we ISTP don't get desperate easily nor frequently.
4	Wait, so is he a Ti dom or an Fe dom? Who is asking who for help?
2	It's weird, when I panic I start seeking out other people to talk to, usually if I'm in love. I just don't know how to handle it, I have a love-hate relationship with being in love
3	How to support ISTP friend	Hey there, I’ve posted in here a few times about a good friend of mine and you always set me in the right direction. \n\nQuick recap: I have feelings for this friend. He asked me if I had feelings for him a couple of months ago and told me he didn’t want to lead me on. We stayed friends and he later admitted to me that he’s been struggling with depression. \n\nA very happy update: Last week he admitted that he has developed feelings for me. (You all called it!) We’ve had some great talks about that but haven’t done anything else about it yet. We texted each other pretty much nonstop this past weekend. \n\nThat brings us to today. I found out that he quit his job yesterday, which is how I know him and see him. I haven’t heard from him since Sunday. So, my questions are: Should I reach out to him or wait until he contacts me? And if I reach out, how long should I give him and what should I say? I know he has so much on his mind right now and I want to be sure that I’m helping and not adding to his overwhelm. 
11	Contact him, the sooner the better. The longer you don't, the more he'll feel you don't care. That whole "I can't call him for X days", we pretty much hate that (at least I do).\n
16	What are some signs an istp likes you?	Hello! What are some signs an ISTP (male) likes you? I'm an intj and I've noticed that he's been looking at me a lot, almost staring (not creepily) when he thinks I'm not paying attention. He hasn't ever done that before (from what I've noticed in the past anyways). \nThink this is a sign he likes me? He hasn't tried starting any conversations straight up, but he keeps making jokes and he always laughs whenever I make one.\n\nMy sister-in-law put the idea in his head about me (which she does all the time so it's nothing suspicious) and ever since he's acted like that.\n\nThoughts people? \nWhat are some things you istps do when you like someone?\nWhat are some things istps do when they like you?\n\nHe's the only guy I know that I'm interested in so I'm really curious. I haven't done anything to give away that I like him. Should I show interest?\nIf so, how and how much? \nI don't want to scare him away.
35	ISTPs don't really do subtle, so if you want to let him know you like him say 'I like you'.
21	Spending time with you when we could or should be doing other things. 
9	Show interest - in any way.\nHe's probably trying to figure out what to do - looking at you thinking.
8	Putting any effort into talking to you first. Although if he doesn’t, that doesn’t necessarily mean he isn’t into you. 
5	He likes you. What he's doing is textbook me. Don't do subtle, ask to spend time with him. 
3	Mimic his actions\n\nIf he is looking at you look at him aswell (smile)\n\nIf he wants to start talking to you, then talk to him back. That's an important step, talking to him back. Not to much, but just enough so conversation flows.\n\nThe rest you kinda have to learn on your own. gl\n\n
3	I date an INTJ. \nI have for 6 years now.\n\nMost of the advice on here is accurate in that if we like you we will choose to spend our time, energy, and efforts into you. Be honest with him and tell him that you like him. Be direct and to the point with it. That will definitely earn you respect with him. Dont put pressure or expectations out on a relationship, and take it a day at a time. Most of us do. 
1	Attention.
11	Ti dominants need artificial goals	Ti dominants will need artificial goals both in the now and in the future. Both because nothing matters and therefore Ti can't determine a goal. Ti works best within the framework of a goal though. Ti is the best function for programming as it starts at the goal and then can reductively produce, quickly, the most minimal steps needed. Alot like someone talented at math who knows how to get to the solution in the fewest steps possible. \n\nFps shooters are an addiction drop for ISTP and as an INTP(or ISTP, but leaning INTP atm) I relate. I think perfection in them motivates us.\n\nI've found a hard time conceptualizing how Ti dominance helps in fps games so much or if the fake goals just give us so much motivation that we innevitably push ourselves to be the best. ESTP is good at athletics and so is ISTP. Is training time done from ISTP the deciding factor that makes them turn out better in the end? What exactly IN THE MOMENT would Ti be good at? What would it make ti users best at in real time analyzing? Is it demonstratable?
15	my goal is to lack goals
2	Ti helps us with strategy and analyzing patterns. In FPS games this helps us analyze where we think the opponent will be, how to position ourselves, what weapon would be effective, etc. It helps you prepare and analyze, which is only really useful before or after you engage the opponent. In real-time during a critical situation, our sensing/intuition is more useful because it's our immediate reaction to the situation.
2	FPSs maybe good, but stealth actions are better. Element of surprise, stealth, opponent doesn't know anything before the last moment. Ideal tactics.
2	I spend all My time Playing FPS what would I do if I just quit? That makes me sad to think about. I love FPS
1	Carpe diem, bro.
4	Fat people	DAE find themselves harboring a certain unfounded yet convicted personal disdain for fat people? Do be clear this sentiment is confined to the realms of self care/ self discipline and does not dictate their whole person, but nevertheless, it's there.\n\nEDIT: didn't think I'd need to specify but obviously there are exceptions, like medical conditions or lack of resources.\n\nEDIT2: NVM, apparently r/sociopath was a better home for this. Searched "fat people" and they were NOT as nice about it as I was.
14	Hey, if you've got your life 100% figured out and have no bad habits or serious pitfalls, that must be awesome.\n\nI've never had any issue with my weight, but I sure have other issues.  They just aren't so immediately obvious when you meet me.
9	No. But if you do just don't be a dick about it, it's their life. I can enjoy someone's company even if they have a less than desirable body image. My grandma is overweight but I'd sooner die than push my judgment on her.
6	To me it's just a very visible reflection of someone that doesn't have the right amount of self control. I don't think anyone wants to be overweight so it's usually a self control thing aside from the minority where it's an actual medical disorder which I think as an excuse is used too often.
4	Only issue is obese people claiming that they are healthy, when it is obvious that they are not. I wouldn't judge a person character based on weight, but I would encourage them to try and be healthier. I have respect for those who try to better themselves, as it shows self respect. But those who vehemently deny that obesity is an issue, I do not have respect for.
3	> unfounded yet convicted personal disdain for fat people\n\nYes lol.
2	you can't be serious
2	This is pure shitpost by an entitled brat. 
1	Like most things in life that don’t affect me personally I really don’t care. If they want to be fat that is on them. I don’t like people trying to change me so I do the same. Live and let live I suppose.
1	wut? wtf is your issue, you fucking psychopath?

9	Ideal Self Care Day for ISTPs	My ISTP husband has been working hard, juggling both full time work and school. I would like to surprise him with a nice day just for himself... got the idea when we were talking about me buying bath bombs the other day and he mentioned that he doesn't think he's ever tried a bath bomb and is curious how that would go. \n\nAside from me leaving him alone to tinker with his projects and play videogames, what would your perfect self care day be like, male ISTPs?
35	It might be different for everyone, but I'm in a stressed and overworked time right now too.\n\nThe thing I crave most right now where there's a day where I don't have to make a single decision.\n\nI don't have to decide what to eat, what to text someone, what I'd like to do, which movie to see, or what I need to do tomorrow.  \n\nI simply want a day to let my brain unwind.
10	>leaving him alone to tinker with his projects and play videogames\n\nAdd a bottle of tequila and I'd be set.
7	honestly, leaving him alone to do whatever he wants is probably exactly what he needs.  just let him do his thing for a day and try not to bother him with too much, i'm sure he'll appreciate it
4	I'm not a fan of the "self care" things like bath bombs or hair done or nails painted. In my opinion those are frivolous things that don't really hold any meaning and wouldn't make me feel better, in the grand scheme of things.\n\nA far better option would be completing something I've wanted to do for a while, or doing something that I've been procrastinating on. For instance, my boyfriend bought me a bbq cover recently because my other one flew away. He also cleaned my kitchen for me and ordered a household item that I've needed for a while. Those "to-dos" checked off my mental list made me appreciate him sooo much.
3	For me, i'd want a day where i can do nothing but play video games all day/work on my projects. Make it as easy on him as possible, make food for you both so he doesnt have to think about that at all, have whatever his favorite alcohol is stocked up and cold (if applicable) plan to not interact with him literally all day. If he does interact with you, cool, but he may not want to talk to ANYONE (You included...). I cant think of much else. If you guys have kids make sure you wrangel them all day so he doesnt have to put on his dad hat at all. Other than that just leave him to his own devices all day. It also helps to know what your husbands love languages are so you can interact with him that aay. Mine are touch, acts of service, and words of affection. So if my girlfriend brings me a sammich or a steak for lunch/dinner and just sets it on my workbench/desk without saying anything and gently touches my shoulder or lovingly rubs my arm as she does so, i melt. 
2	I agree that giving him alone time to tinker does wonders. Also, One of my favorite things to do is head over to the Shvitz. I'm over near Chicago and once or twice a year I make the trek into the city with a couple of my friends for a good long steam. It's awesome and I feel so good after.
2	You could plan a staycation. Make a huge pillow fort around the TV and decorate it with Christmas lights. Get a bottle of nice liquor, cook his favorite meal, and watch a nice movie or mark art together.
2	Give me an entire day on my race simulator, a case of good beer, some wax/weed, and then just leave me be. \n\n\nEssentially there’s 3 factors. 1- I don’t want to have to make any important decisions (idgaf about decisions like food. I don’t want to make any life decisions). 2- I want to enjoy myself (simulator). 3- I want to be intoxicated. \n\n\nAny day with those three factors fulfilled is an amazing self-care day. 
2	Alcohol 
2	You are such a caring and thoughtful partner!! Kudos to you for real\n\nI would love a nice long hike planned for me and we go together and not talk much and just enjoy the scenery and eat good food that was packed already for me. That’s just me tho :)
1	If he's like me eat breakfast with him and then just leave him alone - but let him know your leaving him alone intentionally for his sake. Bring him food, then continue leaving him alone.\n\nIf he wants to do a project and you can actually help (like your REALLY good at helping) then help him with it, otherwise just bring him sustenance and leave him alone.
3	ISTP (m) ISTP (f) relationship.	I feel like this would be the easiest going relationship out there, surely? As long as both parties were aware of their strengths and weaknesses... But where would I find an ISTP woman?
13	In my experience, it wasn't too great. We were both laid back which was nice, but sometimes it just felt like there wasn't much passion. Like we were almost too comfortable with each other to make anything romantic really work. I actually think we could have been great friends if we didn't try dating, but I know I'm not good with the whole just being friends after being intimate thing so we decided to peacefully go our separate ways. \n\nMost fun I've ever dating would actually be with a girl I only went on like four dates with who I would guess was ESFJ. Really energetic, goofy, and sweet. I think we got along well because I'm not the type to ask for help even when I should, and she was the type to always help out even if I didn't ask, which I really appreciated.\n\nIn general I think, as far as MBTI romantic relationship goes, opposites really do attract. Introverts and extroverts sort of push and pull each other which leads to more dynamic and expressive emotions.
21	I think this would be the hardest of them all. Because the two would be so similar and understanding that it would become boring for both of them. Or it would become an argument fest with both arguing with Ti clashes. Both would compete against each other with their Se, like, one would say, "oh I can do this better than you can" and by using Ti, further adding, "...by using X and Y methods because so and so." \n\nA relationship is supposed to grow the two individuals through love. It's not supposed to be a camaraderie. So the ideal relationship type for an ISTP would be ENFP or ESTJ. I personally found ENFP as people I perfectly click with. 
2	I can't even imagine wanting to be with a woman who is exactly like me, that actually sounds dreadful and uninteresting. Aren't you a curious ISTP? Don't you want to learn from someone who isn't like you?
1	ISTP woman here who once almost got into a relationship with an ISTP guy. (Long story.)\n\nI can testify to the bit about it being a very easy going relationship. We became very close very quickly and could tell each other things that we would never dream of telling anyone else, which was strange for both of us, since we’re both very private people. I can say with full certainty that our relationship would have been relaxed, fully honest and pure. We could understand each other without the other person needing to fully articulate how they felt. We enjoyed doing things together, exploring, goofing around and just loved spending time together, with our conversations flowing naturally in and out of serious deep topics, to playful banter. We were both impulsive and reckless by nature, but we were both also rational and calm but it was during important moments, where we were both opposites. This meant that while one person may overthink or act impulsively, the other person would ground them in reality and talk sense into them. It was great :) \n\nEdit: the reason we didn’t enter into a relationship was due to other problems, and not us being incompatible. 
1	Sounds good, doesn't work

5	Istps are supposed to be make the best athletes [source](http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/09/sports/sp-11641/4). Though I’d argue that ISTPs are best at solo sports while ESTPs have a slight advantage at team sports.\n\n
9	ISTPs are more consistent and know their shit more imo. More skilled. Funnier in a smart way. \n\nESTPs are better at getting things done and pushing the envelope. Funnier in a dumb way.
3	One would be a better technician and the other would make a great car salesman.
2	Istps are generally percieved to be smarter because of ti hero (Iq). Estps are more social smart (eq).

7	Different ways of thinking?	Anyone else been feeling that people around you think you’re stupid because you think through things differently than they do due to personality differences? If so how are you guys dealing with it? Cause I’m not gonna lie it’s pissing me off and I’m not quite sure how to explain what’s going on without sounding like a passive aggressive asshole.
12	Im 47.\nI do not think like that.\nI used to think like that... from 16-23 abouts.\n\nI realized I was the odd duck, the strange one, the one that says and does weird things.  Not autistic, just a little different.\n\nI accepted it, welcomed it and ignored the haters.  This is me now.  People get me or they don't.\n\nLet your freak flags fly. 
5	 I wouldn’t say people think I’m stupid; it’s more like when they say something, they expect me to react in a particular way, and when I don’t, they either feel like something is off or there’s a disconnect somewhere. \n\nI think as ISTPs we think and behave differently than those around us. Given that there’s not many of us to begin with and adding that in certain circumstances or situations, it’s not likely that these people would commonly interact with our type.\n\nFor example, I work in a hotel. I have a military background and I’m not easily swayed by emotion. Typically the types of people who work in hospitality are compassionate, friendly, social, etc type people. What’s the likelihood of them working with an ISTP combat veteran?\n\nTLDR: I say all this to say that it depends on the type of people you interact with. Like minded individuals won’t see you as weird or stupid whereas different types may not see you as competent.
2	I’m not stupid. I just don’t have an initiative to tell what I think is right, unless it’s asked or “it’s emergency” (when everyone else no longer knows what to do). Some people interpret this behavior of mine aloof or uncaring. Heck they are even convinced that I’m not bothered at all with what they think of me. I do care, a lot. I even think I’m extremely sensitive (but I just know how to keep fuse under control). \n\nI’m turning 30. Opinions of others used to bother me when I was younger, but now... I don’t dwell on it. I have a rather interesting life (away from their prying eyes). 
2	I used to feel this way in my teens and in my 20s when I was surrounded by friends who were very social and the “popular” sorts. I always felt that I was different from them and their constant making fun of me, or rolling of their eyes made me quite insecure. As a lot of other ISTPs here, although instinctively I knew I was smart — much smarter than most of my friends, and it showed when I actually made an effort in school, I realized that they thought I was a bit off/dumb through the culmination of their comments/teasing. \n\nIt wasn’t until I hit my late 20s that I hit my stride and freed myself from the social chains that had once kept my true inner self locked away. Through a lot of meditation, introspection, and by eventually surrounding myself with better, more open people — who also happened to be much more highly intelligent than the friends that I grew up with, I am now able to say that I’m on a path where I can really start to be myself. I’m 31 now and am still getting over the social anxiety and depression that had plagued my 20s, but things are vastly much better than before. \n\nTL;DR Your friends may not be the right fit for you. Go out into the world, experience new things and people, work on yourself and you’ll find people who will truly accept you for who you are. Hang in there!
2	ISTPs tend to have a lot of their "cpu power" so to speak subconsciously working in the background. We can make a whole lot of logical leaps without explicitly parsing out the logic; A sort of "thinking 3 steps ahead" but it just happened instead of actually doing it.\n\nI've never had anybody think I'm stupid, but most people don't trust what I say if they don't know me very well. People who get to know me learn that I'm pretty smart, and they shouldn't waste time having me explain for 5 minutes the conclusion I naturally came to in 5 seconds.
1	How old are you? Are you male or female? Those details matter in this instance. People around you will perceive you differently depending upon those details. Our advice may be different for different facts. Edit: Also share if the people judging you are primarily male or female. That matters, too.
1	Well, my friends do think I'm crazy, stupid (relationships wise [friendship partially included]); but at the same time they know that I'm caring, intelligent and all the positive prefixes for friends. My friends are trying to make me more like them, because I'm **different**. I have a quick fuse that's kept under tight control, but even that can be overwhelmed. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt happened a few days ago, there was some "**misunderstanding**" cause by me about the jokes of theirs which turned ugly; I screamed, made the mood bad, but they deserved it, why the fuck would you continue your jokes if the recipient of those jokes just made it clear with a loud voice to stop? After that I went to normal mode to keep it "normal", but they didn't get the memo and they went down the road that made me angry & screaming. Not in the way of crazy screams, just screaming instead of talking. Thank to all celestial beings I wasn't in murderous rage at that moment, because it would be too easy for me. He was sitting while I was walking towards him, just a push kick to the face, and kick the ever loving hell out of him, or just step on the throat to make it quick work & ending my future because someone didn't get the memo to not make a calm person mad if that person is bigger than you & can hit hard. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd they paint me as the bad guy for "** not understanding their jokes**", "**being *too* weird and doing nothing to *fix* it, despite their *efforts* **". All I did was to play my role, and they tried to break me to mold me to **normal form**. So I answered that with an angry & near violent outburst. They stopped, nearing FUBAR for friendships with a few of them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTL;DR: Same thing happened to me, I answered with anger, they paint me as the bad guy, "So be it" I say. Just try them, if they are trying to break you down to "**normal**", try to limit interactions with them if possible. If not, try to play that role until you can limit the interactions. \n\nYou can explain like a normal human being if they are capable of understanding differences between thinking styles, if they are trying to enforce their views on to you, keep playing along with them to keep them at bay. I know this sounds Machiavellian, but you are trying to stay sane around them, this much is a necessary evil, at least from their angle.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSorry for the rambling mixed with ranting that made this wall of text. 
1	Thanks for the replies everybody, gave me lots to think about. I really appreciate the advice.
6	Friend Wanted	Hi, I'm an ISTP (I'm pretty sure) looking for an ISTP friend to talk to. I'm mostly interested in video game design stuff, but also sometimes think about knife design or speculate on sword usage.\n\nRecent ideas I've had; in Ocarina of Time the deku nuts seemed pretty useless, maybe if stunned enemies took extra damage that would've changed the dynamic. Or, choils (a finger-notch on the blunt part of a blade above the handle) on big knives/machetes seem pointless to me. If you want to grip closer to the blade for better leverage, you should just extend the edge down to the handle, and if you want to grip farther up to change the balance, you should extend the handle up farther instead. A choil in this circumstance just gives you an uncomfortable bit of (not) handle.\n\nIf these sorts of topics interest you for some reason, we should be friends please/maybe? PM if interested?
6	I'll be your internet friend. But I'm lazy to reply pms.\n\nChoils I don't prefer, unless it has specific uses like the one on beautiful kingfisher machete reviewed by skallagrim. Love that sword.\n\nGun shaped handle on swords are uncommon, the kingfisher choils designed to assist in pistol grip allowing better thrust. All the while still allowing normal grip if needed.\n\nQuite innovative design.
3	OOT is one of my fav video games. I too saw no purpose for the deku nuts. My favorite equipment in any Zelda game is the hookshot. So many uses
2	If anyone wants an istp internet buddy, PM me. College student, medical major, good at tech, likes rap, rock, country, and I play video games (PC)
2	That one room in Jabu-Jabu's belly where you have to pop all the bubbles within a time limit, a deku nut could pop half the bubbles in the room in one go. Apart from that (and dealing with electrified enemies before you get the boomerang, I guess) I got nothin.
1	Weapons are my weakness, but unfortunately I have no idea about swords in games.
64	Ti vs Te	
28	Real men don't give a shit, and don't get addicted to caffeine. 
23	Real men don’t go around telling people what real men do. Insecure people do that. But I’m happy enough to blame it on their Te. 
5	ELI5?\n\nAm ISTP. No idea what Ti and Te mean and I'm definitely Sr. in this scenario.
3	ISTP here. I drink my coffee black...because taking the time to dress up my coffee in the morning is just too much for me. When I'm feeling patient I'll throw some sugar in there.
2	This is my logic when I order piña coladas or Long Islands. I’ll drink whatever I god damn please!
2	Nah this would be Fi vs Fe, not Ti vs Te
1	Eh, sounds more like Ti vs Fe
9	Are most ISTPs good test takers?	I've never been the brightest student but I've always had good grades because the (American) standardized testing system just seems to work in my favor. \n\nI don't think many ISTPs would suffer from much test anxiety as we keep calm about mostly everything, but I found that even when I do get stuck on something, alternate test strategies come really easy. \n\nI cross of answers I know are wrong giving me a better chance at guessing. I use the rest of the test and look for answers in other questions. I always write **something** in open ended for partial credit. \n\nUsing the test itself for help is one of the strategies that help me the most, especially on things that test on narrow subjects. There's only so much to test on and some subjects and up being repeated but from a different angle. Using how the test itself solves a problem and translating it to something you can't figure out yourself can be extremely helpful.\n\nIn my classes, I can tell many others struggle with seeing past the fact that they don't know the answer, so much that they freeze and end up not doing anything when they could be bettering their chances at guessing.\n\nOf course you have to get the ISTP to care enough about the subject for them to even want to do well but this is just what I've noticed in myself and others around me and I thought it was interesting :/

11	I think the reason why quite a number of ISTPs do well in tests like these is because they are systems people. They are good at figuring out how the system works at an acceptable level and then find ways to game that system. I always use the process of elimination to filter obviously wrong answers and then focus on the remaining answer. Get the easy ones out of the way first. Sometimes you can get a hint of what the previous question is asking about by looking at tge next few questions because they tend to share the same topic. 
11	I was always the opposite. Did well in school without needing to study and always got decent grades on papers except for grammer mistakes. Standardized tests and the SATs not so great. I always have to read multiple choice questions over a few times to get what their asking and then would overthink the answers.\n\nEdit: I forgot to the mention how I would end up zoning out half way through the tests because they were 3 hrs long.
5	Yeah, I never really understood those people who would be crying before and after an exam, or would be borderline ready to throw up because of nerves -- I personally loved exams and found them quite easy and relaxed, so long as you knew what you were on about in the essay/test.
3	Test taking is a skill for sure. Once I figured it out, homework became unnecessary. I hardly ever got an A but I always passed.
2	Depends on the subject. I dislike multiple choice when it comes to grammar because the answers they provide are usually not the ones I’d choose.\n\nFor other subjects I find that if I pay attention in class and do the homework then I can get As without “studying.”\n\nI suck at math so I have to actually study for that
2	Dude, the american testing system works in everyones favor: most answers are c or b, then d with few a. 
1	Yeah I was always good at standardized tests in school.  The same principles apply for some corporate job applications and training programs.
1	I skipped most lectures (unless attendance was mandatory) and aced most tests.  I would go through a test normally and put a dot next to any questions I'm remotely iffy on, then go through those a second or third time before turning it in.  Often, other questions on the test would refresh my memory about things I couldn't remember the first time through.  The only time I studied was cramming for an hour or two the night before, and it seemed to work out fine.
1	I rarely had any significant stress before any test before the responsibility of studying was implicit. I found out that if I don't think I've worked enough I'd get stressful, which is rare for me for exams. I was too calm for my surrounding at the SAT equivalents of my country. \n\nI use the same strategy that you use for exams, but for now I can't because I don't get the chance to use it. Also this may not apply to all of us, but I was & still am a fast solver. It is rare for me to stay for all of the allocated time of the exams. I do as much as I can do, check for knowledge, repeat until knowledge runs out, then give the paper & finish the exam.  \n\n
1	I’m terrible 
5	how do i let my commitment phobic ISTP feel comfortable being close to me?	I got involved with this guy because simliar interests values goals and all the stuff that seem to be key ingredients in an LTR, now I feel like I'm his therapist.  As a fairly dedicated introvert myself, I have no problem giving the guy space, so long as it doesn't degrade the relationship over the long term.\n\nI've been in some bizarre scenarios with this dude where we'll spend hours in bed together having mindblowing sex then he'll give me a hug and a kiss and tell me to move on with my life as he shoots out the door.  I was like, "he's just not taking this seriously, he's not interested," but it turns out he's trying to "protect me from himself", lol.\n\nI thought things were fine, and told him so, I thought a relationship was hanging out and doing fun things together, I didn't really put expectations on it beyond this.  How can I convince him to let me blend into his life in a more organic fashion?  I want to be at a place where I can go over to his house and hang out without the formality of a "date", and without him worrying irrationally that i'm desperate for the gift of his presence.\n\nWe've both agreed that things are pretty decent and we're unlikely to find someone more compatible, I don't see the point in analyzing it beyond this, my feeling is chase it and have the relationship, I guess he's so overwhelmed by the fear of losing out on his freedom or whatever that he hasn't weighed the cost of not taking the risk.  It's silly, there's nothing to lose, I won't hold a grudge.\n\nISTPs in long term relationships, what made you decide to stick around and make that person a priority?\n\n**tl;dr:**  i want a friend I can have sex and do athletic and mechanical things with and my ISTP is scared off by the "girlfriend" label.
11	"i want a friend I can have sex and do athletic and mechanical things with" This sounds pretty perfect to me.  Maybe he had a bad previous girlfriend experience or has some other issue.  I personally prefer women to be more aggressive in their pursuits so the answer for me would be go for it.  
5	I think he needs a therapist
2	So, you want to be his girlfriend? But he gets scared off when you call yourself a girlfriend? So you back off and just call him a FWB... what incentive does he have to actually be a boyfriend if he gets what he wants and it doesn't matter what you think?\n\nIf you want to be his girlfriend and he doesn't want it, then honestly, I think you need to move on.
1	sometimes I like someone enough to hang out with them but not enough to be in a relationship w them. 
1	It's obvious you want him. If I were you, get to know him more without pressuring him. Why is there a need for label and commitment? Does the absence of it make you feel insecure?
1	I'm sorry, do you really want to spend the rest of your life being strung along by someone who can't commit? I think you should probably look at your own future and decide if you are happy to endure this persons behavior and be his toy that he can pick up, throw down and treat with little to no respect. If yes, you go right ahead. Enjoy yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm an INTJ and I'm particularly soft with my ISTP and tried to be understanding, but when he started pissing off when I needed him. I told him he could either man up, grow up and give me what I wanted or I would find someone more compatible, since then he has been a model partner and grows in loyalty every day. So I'd say with someone who never knows what they want, they will quickly know what they don't want if you threaten to take away something that they need. \n\nRelationships are a two-way street and the prime intention of them, from an evolutionary point of view, is to support one another, combine resources and increase your chances of survival. Is he increasing your chances of survival, or are you just lying to yourself? Important question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever ever tell yourself that there is no one more compatible because people with that mentality stay in relationships where they are candidates for abuse, also, are you intimately acquainted with every human on this planet? I don't think you have enough information to accurately say that there isn't anyone more compatible. Unless this is one of your own insecurities, which is probably something that needs to be understood in yourself and worked on (very common in young women these days, epidemic in fact). \n\nTo me, this person sounds manipulative. Also with age, I have come to realize that people tell you their deepest fears and insecurities when they talk, all you have to do is listen. Perhaps as a supportive partner, you should give him what he wants "which is to protect you from himself". You really cannot love someone until they have learned to love themselves, they just won't let you love them as we can see from your .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sound really harsh, I know. But I hope you see this as a logical opposite side of the coin, instead of an attack. Food for thought if you like, I just know that I would never associate with someone like this. I don't know the extent of your situation and I could be totally wrong. But I hope this helps you on your life journey as another view of the situation and I hope you also see where I am coming from. \n\nAs a self respecting woman who has been on the end of some of this behavior, it makes me outraged, because I needed to be angry so I could prioritize my own happiness. 
1	wow. You cant. If you havent already been invited to his place than it is a no go. I would write him off and find someone else. this is coming from an istp woman
1	He probably wants a partner, not a one sided relationship\n\nNOT SAYING YOU ARE DOING THAT HEAR ME OUT\n\nLots of relationships nowadays revolve around the female, guy going to work and handing her the paycheck sorta thing. \n\nHe probably has been in or heard of a relationship like this and does not want to repeate mistakes. He may be, or may not be taking it to far in this case.\n\nGuys and girls have different natures, one wants security and sacrifice/commitment from their partner (women on a general scale) and men want to fuck. You can socialize different behaviors but this is the basic primitive nature of men and women.\n\nHe probably just wants a close friend, and not a committed one sided relationship. If you are not okay with this and want him to "love" you (aka sacrifice time, money, etc.) It may not work out.\n\nTry and find a balance in a logical and straitforward way with him. Ask him about some key words like female and male nature just to see what he will say. \n\nLots of online content describes this stuff in detail if you are interested
4	Has anyone bought the 'Complete Virtuoso Profile' from 16personalities	If so, was it worth the $29 ?  \n\n\n&#x200B;
20	[deleted]
1	I’m dying to hear about this. Really, what special stuff does the “complete” profile offer? 
1	What difference will it make in your life? Would you pay 29 dollars for that difference?
7	How do you deal with other people's feelings?	I often just want to share my feelings with my ISTP friend. Then I remember that he probably doesn't want to hear it. Even if what I want to talk about is how I feel about him. \n\nSo how do you react to F types spilling their feelings all over you? Especially when you either don't reciprocate those feelings or don't know what to do about the other person's feelings.
30	Do you want solutions or a hug? ISTPs are good for the former. If you're approaching from the angle of  "I don't want you to fix it, I just want sympathy" stay away. It will make everyone upset in the end.
15	I wouldn't be so quick to assume your ISTP friend doesn't care about your feelings. I really hate that this is a defining characteristic of our type. If I had to phrase it better I would say "we value the truth over feelings". That doesn't mean we don't care about feelings. If this person is your friend, they should care what's on your mind. You might not get the outcome you're looking for, as it's likely to be met with "how can I fix this" rather letting you vent. If you make your ISTP friend know that your feelings are a big part of your personal identity, they may just come around and see them as something important to you.
9	Yeah. If you want sympathy don’t talk to us. It isn’t that we can’t sympathize, it’s that our first reaction is to analyze the problem and offer solutions. It gets awkward. Most people don’t want solutions, they would rather stay in a bad situation because they thrive on drama and sharing feelings. Consistent drama from the same problems will drive us away.
6	Usually pretty poorly. My most immediate reaction to emotions is that they're unjustified and you shouldn't let them get to you. In the past this has caused me to make things worse by disregarding them, trying to fix them, or even cracking jokes. This makes the person upset because they were looking for sympathy and I would just say "I'm not sure what you're asking of me."\n\nNow that I'm reaching my late 20s and have stumbled through emotions, I've learned that emotions are real and that I shouldn't toy with them. It's kind of an honor to have someone open up to you, but it took many failed relationships for me to learn that :)
2	[deleted]
2	DO NOT APROACH AN ISTP WITH PROBLEMS YOU DONT WANT SOLUTIONS TO. If you are just looking for someone to commiserate with, you will be disappointed. I am an ISTP and when someone presents me with problems or is just "venting" to me, my first instinct is to provide solutions. If those are ignored then it all just sounds like bitching to me and I become angry at the other person. I've learned that this is unfair, as some people need to let off emotional pressure this way but it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.
1	I tell em to talk with someone else or offer them ice cream
1	Not well
1	I can hardly deal with my own feelings. I'm supposed to deal with others' too?!
1	There are dear friends that i care about- that want to talk about the same feeling that is  caused by the same issue over and over again. \nSo,  to them- it's venting.  And i can hear it a few times.  But it gets old.  And i resent hearing the same scenario over and over. It is also upsetting- hearing people in distress- that can actually be easily fixed. \n\nTo me- if it's solvable- do it( whatever it may be- uphold your boundaries,  leave the situation,  change your input etc)---- or adjust your attitude.  \n\nBy doing nothing- you just keeping yourself in a miserable place. \n\nSo,  in short- i'll listen- a few times.  But really- let's ease it up one way or another.  
1	If you're going to ruminate about your day or bitch about so and so or yourself, then you're talking to the wrong people. You should ask "what can I do about...?" If I'm gonna hear about someone's feelings or problems, I need to have a solution or an escape plan lol
1	If it's a friend **I care about** I'll listen and I'll ask questions to better understand the situation and/or give leads to approach it under another angle. \n\nI also understand that people sometimes need to talk simply to empty their bag of thoughts and if I have nothing better to do I'll lend them an ear. That doesn't mean I'm always there for absorbing their feelings as a sponge, I have my own thoughts, priorities and values and I'll not hesitate to make it clear that I'm not interested in continuing the discussion.
1	I can't even deal with my own 
1	How do you deal with other people's feelings?\n\nPoorly
1	I would rather give them a hug and offer an ear to listen, I just think that people will find a way to solve their problem, they do not really needs me.\nI really do not care how they will handle their problem. I mean, as long as they are not trying something really stupid.\nYes, I am an ISTP.
1	I'm better at dealing with other peoples feelings than my own. I try to mirror their emotions in the moment and validate how they feel, maybe ask questions or say things like "that sounds difficult/confusing/upsetting." If I offer a solution I phrase it like "I found sometimes it helps if you can do this, because it could help in this way." Not like "do this."\n\n 
1	I don't mind it. My instinct is to offer a solution or analysis, but I try to be better at listening and support, to be more sensitive. The main problem Fs and Ts will have is if they don't believe each other's good intentions, because behavior will look confusing to the other. But do they have a good heart? \n\nIf I think a loved one is up against something, I support with enthusiasm, optimism, practical things, art, my voice.  That could be viewed oddly, like why all of a sudden or no contact on weekends. But I'm active and logical, and if you think about it like that, that's how I show I really care. If I'm your friend, then I think you at the core are a good person. My view of someone is pure, not based on day to day ups or downs or my own fears, but something I decided after close observation, that I love that person for them. 
1	I'm 31. I'm starting to get a pretty good handle on my Fe. I won't be able to *say* much, because my emotional *verbal* language is basically non-existent; I'm pretty good for listening, and giving a hug, holding hands, or whatever.\n\nBut for an ISTP who hasn't gotten to the point of developing Fe? Forget about it. Parsing through emotions isn't going to go very far.
2	Youtuber C.S. Joseph Concludes That Eminem Is ISTP	
8	What is this crap. “YouTube concludes Eminem is ISTP” \n\n\nYou do realize how ridiculous that sounds right? Right? Please tell me you realize how silly and pointless this is. 
1	He is not an ISTP he’s an ISFP 
1	I highly doubt that
8	Any xSTPs that are in the medical field	Are Any of you in the medical field or know any xSTPs in the field?\n\n\nDo you think being a dr,emt, paramedic etc a good fit for this type?\n\nI'm in the process of being a EMT and was just wondering.
4	Nursing school rn. And yeah those are good fits. Nurse, not so much but its a challenge. Dr. is even harder, schoolwise.\n\nI know lots of xstp ppl in first responder fields
3	I was in med school. Wasnt my thing. Didn't enjoy the ambiguity that comes with people. Now work with computers and love it (Also pays more if your factor in opportunity cost). Only do it if you are really passionate about it 
2	ISTP freshman nursing major, its hard but it'll be rewarding. Stick it out man
2	Just started as a pharmacy tech. Really like the subject matter, the big challenge will be keeping my "customer service face" on at work.
2	My good ISTP friend is a paramedic, and she's damn good at it. 
2	I’m an ISTP and an RN. Definitely gravitated towards surgery, more technical and hands-on and less interaction and need to display emotions. Now I’m in graduate school for a DNP and it is definitely a good fit. Hospital administration is right up my alley. ISTPs are very rare in leadership roles but bring a very unique perspective, especially in health care. 
2	My mom keeps mentioning it'd be a good fit, but I'm already studying in another field.\n\nI'd have a shitty bedside manner, but not squeamish and am plenty fascinated by medicine actually.
1	When I was in the Army I had that choice. I decided on telecommunications instead because if I screw up a piece of equipment I can just replace the part; with humans it’s not that simple.
1	I am an OB scrub tech.  I am over my job, but I will say that it is repetitive and it drives me crazy.   I also have been studying to be an RN and everything inside is screaming at me not to do it.  We will see. 
12	Was it hard picking a major?	Or if you’re not in college, something that you really wanted to do career wise? I’m a Junior right now and at this point I’m just settling. This is the first semester since I’ve started college that I didn’t change my major. I’ve found a few jobs I’d be willing to do, but I honestly would just prefer to be at my current job (that I’ve been at for 2 years) and if I ever get bored of it, I’ll probably just use my degree. \n\nI just wanna know if this indecisiveness is something that is relatable to other istp’s. 
11	Pretty impressive you made it to been a junior. Whatever you do stick with it and get that bachelors in your back pocket.   That’ll help you no matter what you decide to do.
8	Dropped out twice, parents forced it on me despite me saying I don't want to do it and aren't interested in any jobs I could get from it
7	Dropped out of law, tried math, now trying to jump to economics. My life is in shambles, evidently.
6	No college really interested me, let alone major. I ended up enlisting in the Army to get some world experience and have decided that I still don’t want to go to college. I enjoy working with my hands so I plan on going to trade school for welding when I get out. 
6	I'd been playing with computers since I was a wee tike so I always knew that CS was going to be my degree. I started college in 1996 though so the computer landscape was a bit different then. \n\nMy friends and I were pretty much outcasts for liking computers and DnD and being smart/awkward. Now it seems to be lauded, which is good but I sure wish I had that too :)
3	I'm a senior in high school, this is why I don't plan on picking a major. That and i couldnt live with that debt i wouldnt even have a plan other than "grt job, make money" to pay it back
3	I'm in a junior in high school in the throes of picking a major/college/etc. On one hand, it sucks because I know that I'll probably change my mind a million times especially once I'm in college, but that also alleviates some of the press since nothing is permanent. I only have a general and vague idea of what I want to do as a _career_ or even what _type_ of work I want to do, so that's gonna suck a little once I have to really get into things. \n\nAnyway, as for picking a major as a high schooler without a lot of that pressure (I can change my mind a million times for now and be fine... rip you) - I think I've been "set" on engineering for like 2 years, and I've been pretty into chemistry before I ever took a course in it. But I'm still hella indecisive and really want to double major _just to be safe_. 
3	I was undecided when leaving high school. I took a gap year and worked at an mechanical engineering place. Decided that although I like the tinkering, didn't want to work in a workshop all my life. Decided to do Earth Sciences at university, and currently loving it. 
3	I ended up going into IT. I picked my major after the first semester. I kind of had an idea that I'd do something like that because my dad and brother are both technical so I'd gotten a lot of exposure to that area and knew it generally interested me. 
3	I started in law, then went to philosophy, and then engineering.\n\nAnd I’m now out of uni without a degree.\n\nSo I’d give this question a solid “yes”. 
3	Starting college I was undecided, but at some point in freshman/sophomore year I just decided "fuck it, might as well just pick something and graduate within 4 years." My parents were pressuring me to graduate within 3 years (money issues) also, so that factored into my haste as well. I started with Biology, but by sophomore year it was obvious I wasn't into any of my classes because I was barely passing. I switched to Economics because it seemed more interesting, plus it looked like the best bet for getting a decent job at the time. I can't say I was ever super into it but it did open some doors career-wise because a lot of companies these days look for people with business and stats knowledge. I'm still job hunting though, so who actually knows.\n\nOutside of what I studied, what I actually want to do for a career? I've always been more of a humanities/social science kid. I like visual design and thinking about how people's minds work. If I get a chance I'd like to go into User Experience since it's a hot field at the moment. The main thing blocking me is my lack of experience and credentials. So the plan as of now is to use my Econ and stats credentials to get an analyst job (business analyst, marketing researcher, data analyst, etc.), and study to get some kind of UX certificate during my free time. Or just stay as an analyst if I like the job. It depends.
2	Yeah it was, I knew I wanted to do something in science but I kept switching what I wanted especially in highschool. I think every two months I thought of something different. Finally I picked biology because it was the most generalized of the fields and I somehow stuck too it all though college. Now I'm barely using my degree at my current job and getting a Master's in a completely unrelated field just because it's required for most jobs I want.
2	Was superr indecisive in high school when applying for college. Luckily i had a friend with a similar goal path as mine so I basically had her do all the planning. Started out freshman year as biochem, but i always knew I’d be switching out of it. Sophomore year, switched to something i had more interest in, genetics. Then junior year, double majored with psychobiology to boost gpa. Planning to graduate in spring as a double major\n\nMy major plans seem to be figured out, but ive been a train wreck trying to decide what career to pursue. But since youre so deep into college, might as well finish and then decide.
2	I dropped out after changing my major twice. Got into the trades now I’m a 2nd year apprentice making $50k a year. Who knew the kid who played sports every day and hated being in the classroom would enjoy being in construction 🤔
1	It wasn't hard for me, but honestly, I just kept going. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got a degree to teach English, and taught for 6 years. I stay home with my kids now.
1	I had a terrible time. I started in engineering as a freshman, then switched to biology as a sophomore, then computer science as a junior. I took a ton of psych along the way and almost switched to that. I wanted to drop out after junior year but my Mom was not having that. I then switched schools and finished an IT degree.  I ended up in an IT job that didn’t require any degree. Sometimes I think I wasted my time, but it doesn’t hurt to have the bachelors. Or at least that’s what I tell myself. 
1	I went through so many majors it’s not even funny. I finally settled in on English Linguistics. Seems like all the fun stuff requires copious amounts of maths and physics. Calculus is too theoretical for me; I can’t wrap my mind around it.
1	Not for me.  I'm a senior in CS and figured it's what I'd end up doing since I started programming in 8th grade
1	I didn't want to go to college after high school,  but when I did eventually go, majoring in CS was a no brainer. 
1	I got into linguistics on my second year of university. For the first time in my life I found a place where I fit like a puzzle piece. It's really weird. There may not be many job prospects, it may be cutthroat competitive. But I don't care. I found my niche.\n\nYou can find yours too. 
1	Both times it was easy because studying my specific majors were the actual reason why I wanted to go to school. I didn't have a desire to just go to school in general. So both times my decision was "study X, or do something else?" rather than "study X or Y or Z or..."
1	No, I looked at all my interests as well as the trends for those in the next 10-20 years and just picked the one that would allow for the most flexibility and opportunity. 
1	I picked my major in 7th grade. Discovered it, I should say.
10	Aux Se?	What are the most notable signs of aux Se and how does it interact with Ti in practice? (examples would be appreciated)
18	Being in tune with your physical surroundings, and in Ti dom-Se aux case, it consists in being quick to notice physical discrepancies around you. Se is constantly on the look for data and changes in the world around us, even if it’s not really something useful. Noticing a bird flying on top of you, briefly looking at strangers in the same room to see what they’re up to, anything that you can engage fully with your senses is related to Se.

6	Listening to multiple conversations.\nSeeing things that others dont.\nRemembering how to get back to places you've been. Ex. I told so locals about a road that got us within 200 feet of a fire. Last time i was there was 25 years ago.
3	I like the functions but I think people take it too far, I don't believe in these static stacks. Like If you're Te>Se that makes you ESTJ in my mind.  \n\n\nBut to the point, compared to other introverts at least yeah there's a difference, I'm not as content being home, I go stir crazy, I need to go outside and do things, play a sport, go for a walk, something. Also I'm into sensory stimulation more so I listen to a lot of music, I like food, that kind of stuff. Even when at home half the time I'm pacing. The two CAN be exclusive Ti and Se but they don't have to do be. They seem to be most in tandem when doing something hands on or just observing what's around me my mind can wander and I'll be deep in thought. 
2	I'm sitting outside my apartment, listening to a podcast, watching tree leaves falling, crickets on the background, feeling the warmth of my laptop, noticing the type of wood the table is made of, some kids whining as they play outside the gate, the color blue of the walls and the gate brighter and looking dirtier at night, a fallen mango, a chicken, 6 empty bottles of soda... etc. 
1	Never hitting furniture with your feet. 
1	A very passive epertese in bodily awareness, bodily use, and environmental awareness. Like being james bond but being cool with keeping it a secret but also not having any trouble doing a backflip at any given time cuz yknow. youre james bond but its nbd. \n\ni have snatched objects i dont see coming out of the air, perform acrobatics feats in casual and formal settings (And destroying all atmosphere with it), with much the same attitude one would have to discreetly passing gas. 
1	Remembering past experiences, facts and derails. Sharing them, listening what others have to say; brainstorming.
13	Am I the only person that has a long lit of used to dos?	I seem to be unable to enjoy the things I used to do. I’m not sure if it’s ISTP related or some thing else. Has anyone else gone thru this?\n\nI used to love riding my Mtn. Bike, skateboarding, hiking etc.. Now I rarely do any of these things. I’ve often thought it was because of the effects of my job as a wildland firefighter, and all the hyper vigilance and post trauma stuff, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s just me and my personality.
32	Become proficient, get bored, move on.
12	i feel this. i seem to jump from interest to interest with none of them sticking long enough to even really be a hobby. 
8	Same, just wish i'd remember this before I've bought all the kit!
6	Are you losing interest in everything all at once or just getting bored of certain hobbies?\n\nI'll get really into something for a while but then get bored with it. But after a while of not doing a hobby I'll suddenly decide to pick it up again so I end up in a cycle of 5 or 6 hobbies I switch between.
2	That is one thing I do not do. If I like something, I stick with it forever. Been playing pool for 35 years, hiking for the same, bowling for 15, guitar for 30...I accumulate hobbies as a hobby or something.
1	I do have a list. The challenge is actually doing what’s on the list to check off
1	You need a change of pace or complete an old project. Fix a broken item even. 
23	lol im high	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zaissfsrxst11.png
14	I, too, am High and I, too, think this is funny. Thank you. I will treasure it. 
9	Sorcery 
31	Does anyone else have a hard time being an adult as an ISTP?	I swear I really do enjoy the freedom of being an adult. But, I hate the amount of responsibilities that comes with it. Granted, it's just how things are, but I just hate how I tend to just mess up simple things cause of laziness, not communicating with my team, overreacting to the littlest things, impulsiveness and just not having my priorities straight. I don't really want to go too into detail about my personal life unless it's necessary. Basically, I wanna ask how do some of you mature ISTPs keep your priorities as an adult straight without falling into the usual bad habits ISTPs are known for? Like I can be responsible, but I just tend too lose focus on what's important and i will just tend to forget or push it the side until I fuck up.
20	Everybody has problems being an adult. \n\nSave and live below your means, if even one dollar goes I to your savings every week/month you are doing good.
21	Lol yes.\n\nWhen I look around me it's like people already have their shit figured out, they know their goals/responsibilities, and how to get around obstacles.\n\nJust like today, set the stage: Monday morning 7:30AM and I was struggling to get into my lame ass office job. I showed up 15 minutes late and stared at my desk expecting my body to get work done but wasn't feeling any of it. "This is a common struggle," I told myself, "everyone deals with Monday mornings." I looked around my cubicle and saw people typing away furiously, talking on the phone, and generally being productive. This made me a bit more upset with myself because I was still stuck on finding the purpose behind it.\n\nSometimes it feels like I missed out on a class we were all supposed to take or something. "Oh yeah Monday mornings and all those other adult life lessons? We all were there... looks like you were absent that day."
14	I will give you some of my tips, but I a pretty sure you won't use them! \n\nI use the reminders and calendar features on my phone.   My #1 issue is I forget things. Or better yet, I don't care enough to really remember things.  To address this, I put it in my phone to remind me. \n\nI use my phone alarm and timer features at least 5-6 times a day.  This gets me up, my kids up, my kids to their buses, and reminds me to get off the damn computer and go to work.  \n\nI set up a plan to get at least one decent size chore done each weekend.  I spend a little time Thursday and Friday to mentally prepare myself to do the chore before I get lazy.  Once I complete it, I am good for the weekend.  Mission accomplished, time to be lazy.  The key here is mentally getting ready for about 2 days.\n\nFor overreacting, the key is to pause before I outwardly react.  I cannot control the fact that my brain will spin, but I have practiced not letting that spin get out.  It might make me appear to be slow to react/respond, but I find it better to be slow than to explode.  Explosions are messy.\n\nThe rest of the time, its IDGAF.\n\n\n
10	The problem with being ISTP is that ISTP should try, fail and only after that understand. So my suggestion is "go where your fear is". It is the shortest way to grow.\n\nFor example I had a fear of public speaking. So now I go to every event that allows me to speak from the scene. And I gained a lot of useful connections doing this etc. Just as an example.
4	It’s just practice, I’ve found.\n\nI’ve fucked everything up enough times now to know that certain responsibilities require my attention without negotiation.\n\nAlso, eventually you see what’s important to you and what action is required of you to maintain those important parts of your life. Or improve them.
5	I feel you. My energy and motivation to get common things done (education, chores, shopping, laundry, cleaning) come in very short bursts of energy only when I've worked up enough self-loathing that I'm letting it all go to hell.
3	Yeah. Sometimes I feel like I’m barely hanging on.\n\nSome of my problems are self created, some are circumstances. Usually the self created ones are me ignoring my problems of circumstances and doing what’s enjoyable and worrying about the consequences later. \n\nI’m trying to get better financially. So I’m working on paying off all my debt. \n\nI have actually found loose structure and routine to be helping me. And distracting myself with friends doing cheap hangout things, playing video games, watching tv, anything to keep me from thinking about the mountain of problems I am climbing over. \n\nOne day at a time, otherwise I am discouraged. Discouraged can lead to self destruction. I stood in the mirror, looked myself in the eyes and vowed I had to change. I’m halfway to my goals. Being me, I want them now. Sad truth is, it will take another 6 months of grinding.
4	I think the truly mature ISTPs don't use reddit.
6	I'm with you on that. I find so many things "unimportant" until it's overbearing. Then I just get upset at the amount of pressure I have to do something, so I shrug it off. It's a lose-lose. 
2	Im lucky with having a job where i am engaged all day. But i still do struggle on my weekends with getting all the stuff done that i need to do. I find that i have bouts of productivity, i dont chip away at my tasks, i hammer them all out then sit on my ass and drink beer and eat bad food. When i want to start working on my tasks for the day on the weekend, i get up, go to the store/gym/out and do something productive, then immediately come home and clean, do laundry, and sort out bills/work/homework. Then i fall on the couch and do nothing. It works for me, may not be for all. And at work, as long as i show up on time i usually fall right into my daily tasks and dont have an issue. I am aircraft line mechanic on 737, so we are always catching a plane, fixing something, or cleaning the hangar. 
2	Yeah.  Mainly in regards to love or consistency.  But I'm getting better with optimism and courage, so I got that going for me which is nice.  I get off track though and start imagining myself with no responsibilities, or get down when I'm lonely, but it's all a part of the process.  I just let it pass through.
2	Life is hard as fuck dude. It just gets harder as you get older. You need to prepare yourself. 
2	I'm also looking for some inspiration... I'm fairly lazy on some things, and super energized on others. It comes down to things I want to do VS things I don't.\n\nI'll stay late at work 5 days in a row without a second thought. Yet I moved to a new city 3 months ago, unpacked half my shit, and then just stopped. No TV, no couch, I'm just too lazy to finish. Sure I'll get there at some point, but I wish I had the motivation some people had. Unless I *have* to do it, it's a toss up as to whether or not I will. 
2	This is why I plan to remove myself from society as much as possible. So many things people have to deal with are so trival and a waste of time. We are here for a finite time working 5 days a week at some shit job is ludicrous.

1	I prefer Nichijou.
31	DAE ever saw your friend/someone you knew/met before when you're outside but decides not to greet them?....	Instead you get the hell out of the area, watching him/her at the corner of your eye, hoping that s/he didn't recognize you.\n\nIs it an ISTP-ish behavior? I think its due to my social anxiety tho, any thoughts?\n\nEdit: Good to know I'm not the only one haha. But still, I can't shake the feeling that that's not how it works....
25	Frequently. Trust me kid, It gets easier and easier.
13	Almost all of my interactions have been when someone approached me and I am forced to act normal and chit chat. I hate small talk
7	All the time people are annoying, to be honest a lot of then aren't worth my time. That sounds rude but it'a true, they don't care to contribute anything to anyone or anything but their own interests and they just aren't people worth being around.
4	If our eyes did not meet, then we didn't see each other, if it did, then I nod at them
4	When I see them from a distance and they don't see me, I change my path.
3	I do the old "cross da road" style move.  
3	All the time. 
6	Does anyone ever ever saw your friend?\n\nI... don't think so????
2	unless i have a reason to approach them, i won’t 
1	Just smile and don't say hello. Ez.
1	all the goddamn time. the best part is i have to wear glasses but i dont usually, so when they ask me why i ignored them or why i didnt wave back, i say "oh, i didn't recognize you. you were just a blur in my eyes aha i s ould put on my glasses!"
1	Yes. If I wanted to talk to you I would have texted you.
13	Do you ever feel like you have terrible intrusive thoughts?	So in short an intrusive thought is “unwelcome involuntary thought, image, or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession, is upsetting or distressing, and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate” (Wikipedia). \n\nThrough a lot of self reflection I’ve been able to keep it in check, but I know when I was younger I  constantly had intrusive thoughts that would cause me to emotionally manipulate the people around me and be an overall very toxic person. I can’t exactly say all of that is gone right now, but I also wanted to ask if you guys do have intrusive thoughts, what are they usually about and how do you deal/cope with them? 
6	Can relate. Usually these kinds of thoughts leave me going “wtf?” \n\nBest way to cope? Meditation. Calming your mind will allow you to better control it and possibly inhibit the thought(s) from forming completely. If meditation does’t work, you should try to distract yourself with physical activities. For me, when I do things that engage Se, Ti finally shuts up. \n\nYou can also try analyzing the thought to see if you had that “random” thought for a reason. Maybe there’s something bothering you subconsciously. 
3	Any intrusive thoughts I've had are related to anxiety, but I don't think I've experienced them in the way you've described. Have you talked to any medical professionals about what you're experiencing? There might be a known cause/solution and you don't have to do this alone. One of my best friends has a type of OCD that manifests as intrusive thoughts. It took him over a decade before he was accurately diagnosed and it's like a weight has lifted off of his shoulders now that he has the proper treatment. Even if this isn't what you're dealing with, the entire job of therapists/psychologists/etc is to help you improve your coping mechanisms so it might be worthwhile to talk to someone so that this isn't something you have to navigate so actively.
3	I have intrusive thoughts, though I'm used to them. As long as I'm not down in the dumps & alone, I can push that side of me to hit me harder with those words, try to find a chink in my defenses, stab that knife & twist it. It is mostly negative self worth & low self esteem, taking the blame for the things that I **might** have a tiny amount of help & making myself feel bad for that. I also tend to let these things go away when they are small enough to not have any kind of impact, because of laziness & procrastination. Then they group up & become big enough to impact my life in a way, then I get to take care of them.\n\nThose thoughts make me wear masks around people, and when it comes partially off to tell what I really think, I get flak for it, for being *different*, thinking about myself & all. My masks are generally nice with fitting into the crowd. But I know I stick out like a sore thumb sometimes, especially when masks slide, crack or become unusable in some other way.  \n\nMe without masks is just nice but depressive, reclusive, introverted male with self negativity issues trying to live like nothing is going wrong at all. \n\nAs you've experienced, self reflection & mediation helps to tone down these problems, they won't go away that easily just on our own. 
2	If I spend too much time in my head I feel weird, talking makes me feel normal. When I was a kid I suffered from apeirophobia and had an episode back in January but I seem to have it under control now.
1	Absolutely yeah. They used to be compulsions too. Well, sort of. Like for example one day I was hiking and taking pictures. And I suddenly got th urge to just chunk the camera over the ledge. Why? I dunno. I pretty much always kept these impulsive in check. But I could feel my arm itching to throw it. And something in my head would just tell me I need to throw it. \n\n\nI deal with it less these days. But when I was an angsty teen, my head was filled with intrusive thoughts and compulsions. 
1	Intrusive thoughts are totally normal. If you have one of those, just remind yourself it's just a thought. I have them all the time and they used to give me intense anxiety. You'll learn over time that it's really your conscience testing you to see if you're an asshole or not.
1	I keep imagining my throat getting slit for some reason.
1	Sounds like inferior Ni popping up along with Fe. It's a nightmare to control and might have to somehow endure the pain untill those fucntions are well developed or use other fucntions to control them. 
1	Sadistic thoughts here... it can get pretty hectic but meditation helps.\n\nIf not that then punching pads works too.

2	Mmm I don't think you can type someone (let alone a fictional person) just by their comebacks.
1	Nah, just edgy. 
8	Have any of you kicked all your bad habits?	I'm sitting here vaping mass amounts of nicotine and I don't really know why. I picked up smoking when I was younger. I quit for a few months but that didn't go well. I quit all the nasty drugs I did in my youth. I smoke weed every once in a blue moon and drink beer once a week. I work out 5 days a week.\n\nHas anyone else quit drugs, weed, nicotine, and alcohol?
13	Self discipline is the core of all change in a persons life but it's also the hardest thing to do. I've tried kicking my sugar habit and the only way I've succeeded is by not having a single sugary treat in my fridge. This way I don't even need to have self discipline because there is no bad habit to resist. Porn and masturbation on the other hand is way too available for me and so that one's a bit harder to overcome. As far as drugs I've never been addicted to any and Ive only tried alcohol, nicotine and weed. Some guy offered me weed mixed with meth yesterday and I just said no because I'd rather not even try that shit once.
10	I've mostly kicked junk food and sleeping in.  My worst habit now is probably being too hermitted.
4	I kicked nicotine after five years of smoking a pack a day. \n\nStill have the other habits....
3	I've been struggling with the fast food. Been on and off for many years but recently cut way back and lost 50lbs. Downside is I need to shop for new clothes, but hey I look good. \n\nPorn is porn, not stopping the five knuckle shuffle anytime soon.\n\nWeed. Ah. Yeah well with the rage issues I tend to get I try to justify its use to that but I know better, really. Tolerance breaks are a bitch. \n\n
3	i wouldn’t say i was addicted to weed but i used to smoke or dab everyday multiple times and it came to the point where i was questioning if i still had control over my usage of weed. so i decided to quit cold turkey after 4/20 for 3 months just as an experiment to see if my life would be better off, but more importantly, i wanted to see if i could actually quit. \n\ni expected it to be a hard process but it was actually pretty easy; i realized that i just used smoking as a past time but i wasn’t necessarily addicted or highly dependent on it. after the 3 months was over i went right back though bc i realized not smoking didn’t improve my life significantly or at all and i truly enjoyed smoking. 
2	I used to smoke as well. Bought a vape to quit, now I need to quit vaping. Used to do a bunch of drugs when I was younger as well, although those days are mostly behind me.
2	yeah...i was physically addicted to kratom (an opiate) for 5 years, starting when i first got to college at 18. i quit last august. then relapsed. i quit a second time this past june and never looked back. honestly, it's crazy to me now that i was addicted to it for so long. by the end of my use i didn't even get a buzz, i just used it to stave off withdrawals. i don't miss it a bit.\n\ni also abused adderall pretty heavily throughout high school and college.\n\ni still smoke weed every day though lol. i'd like to cut back, but after having problems with much worse drugs, i'm not too concerned at the moment. also i live in denver lol
1	Ive kicked drinking and pills. I’ll occasionally indulge in psychedelics. But for the most part I just smoke to sleep now. I used to be preeeeetty heavily “self medicated”. 
1	Money burns a hole in my pocket and I love food. So if I have even a dollar on me I have to buy food, unless I have something else in mind. Also I procrastinate too much, it's gotten better but last year I lacked the energy to do anything. So I just ran through the motions every day and went a bit insane from prolonged boredom, I'm an idiot lol
1	I quit smoking 3 years ago after 10 years of pack a day habit.\n\nI do drink socially, 2 - 5 times a month, went 6 weeks without a drink recently, because I was busy with some other things.\n\nAs for the rest of substances I do enjoy them occasionally for special occasions as a treat, they are fun that way.\n\nSpent most of my life doing sports and picked that up again, now out with knee injury, but about to get back on mats again.\n\nMy bad habits are more of social nature, I keep talking about myself and jumping into people's speech with my own shit all the time. I am condescending a lot. I can't maintain meaningful relationships or generally focus on things for long periods of time etc. I am trying to work on those, but it is way harder than dieting, working out and kicking nicotine habit at the same time to me.
1	Stoped smoking for a month. Realized that was a mistake and started vapeing. Never was interested in drugs though, and while I like drinking it isn't something I do often. 
0	Quit? Why?
5	Do you have anger issues/how do you deal with it?	From what I've read and researched, most ISTPs have some sort of anger issue that vary in severity. As the question states above, do you have any of these issues and/or how do you deal with the issue when it arises? \n\nPersonally, I smoke a lot of weed and it does help to check my anger and put myself in a more rational mindset but I still struggle. I try to analyze where this anger comes from, but it's difficult to asses because who the fuck wants to intentionally put the spotlight on themselves. \n\nI'm also in a relationship with an INTJ female. Yeah. Let that sink in.
9	besides terrible road rage (i’m bostonian, it’s in our blood), anger is an emotion i rarely feel. i might feel frustrated or bitter about something, but rarely angry. for me, it just feels like a useless emotion that doesn’t accomplish much. 
3	I don't have an anger issue.\n\nIf I ever get frustrated, I swallow it and prevent myself from speaking beyond a few words until I can escape, or, if I'm feeling mature, I'll try to figure out why I'm frustrated. Often it's lack of food, caffeine, etc. Or lack of trying to see from the other side.
2	It's extremely rare that I'm angry. I'd definitely myself as very easy-going. Now male resting bitch face? I gotchu. I find no benefit to being angry plus the days ruined after that so nah man, I'm good.
2	I just can’t afford to get angry like I used to. It takes to much out of me. So I’m listening to an audio book called”The Sublte Art of Not Giving A Fuck. 
2	It's not so much an issue but I can't stand being around ignorant people, it's like they refuse to learn anything or improve themselves and it just sets me off, I mean come on! How hard is it to pick up a book or in some cases just look at the damn controls! (I may be repressing my rants)
1	I go out for a walk and smoke. alternatively, I play a game or take a nap to take my mind off things. 
1	I try to avoid the sources of anger entirely. Prevention is always best, and even though it’s the thing to do I don’t smoke weed, not that I can anyway (I can’t even use the gas pump where I live).
1	I have pretty bad road rage lol. I get frustrated with stuff. If I’m particularly upset, I’ll go for a really long run until I don’t feel frustrated anymore. Ive found it really helps. Going to the gym doesn’t seem to have the same effect for some reason.
1	felony charges..restraining orders, ya know? the usual..lol s/
1	As an Fi blind, anger is hard to detect when it happens. Especially anger, because the cause behind the anger may vary greatly, resulting in us always assuming we're just not angry. As we often lack the ability to detect the source of the anger when it doesn't come from a very specific person, as that simplifies the process of detecting the anger because then the anger can be easily blamed on something. Simply put, emotions are irrational and are not the result of rationalizations but hardly detectable impulses
1	Meditate and isolate.\n\nIn the past, it was injury for either them or I... not going back to that.
1	| ...who the fuck wants to intentionally put the spotlight on themselves.\n\nTe, that's who.  If I have an internal problem (problem with myself) that I want/need to fix, I'll def. apply Te at myself.\n\nFor example. Review and analyze the activities or moments that lead up to the 'out burst'.  From my perspective, there is often a cause-effect relationship.\n\nI get pissed off when I fail in the Se realm.  I shout and swear, mostly at myself or the physical object that stopped me abruptly. \n\nBut, when I recall events I'll at least get some hints on where I went wrong.  My handlebars are too wide, and wouldn't fit between the trees.  I was at an extreme-lean angle and my bar clipped the tree.  I was 'in my head' and not 'in the moment'.\n\nCommon issue here: I/the rider may not have been focused, handlebars may be too wide, too much speed to navigate the section of trail smoothly. \nSolutions: FOCUS mfer! Narrower bars? Slow down?-pfft. Se FOCUS, gd it! Deep breathes/meditation/silent contemplation, even if its just a few moments to recollect oneself.\n\nIt may be scary, but let that INTJ apply some Te to your problem(s)..if your comfortable enough with that sort of situation.  I'd suspect your lack of emotional focus should allow it better than the majority of types would. Especially if you are asking for it.
1	Yeah, I have strong emotions which either come out as anger or crying. It's weird. I've learned to control these emotions but they still come out when under duress. 
0	How do you ISTP´s interpret this song? (From Poets of the Fall. I bet you all like it).	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkweStbjjSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkweStbjjSE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLyrics: \n\n\----\n\n\[Verse 1\]\n\nGetting lost singing their song\n\nCaught up in all I've done\n\nIt's all I know, but not what I need\n\nCut by my love, cut till I bleed\n\n\----\n\n\[Chorus\]\n\nSo I want to run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun to the shelter tonight\n\nUnited in silent resistance\n\nOf bowing to false kings\n\n\----\n\nSo let me run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun from this meaningless pantomime\n\nI'll swallow my pride, give up the pretence\n\nOf bowing to false kings\n\n\----\n\n\[Verse 2\]\n\nBought their smiles, liquid and smooth\n\nTook their words for the truth\n\nEdge of light and shade\n\nMy broken soul once more enslaved\n\n\----\n\n\[Chorus\]\n\nSo I want to run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun to the shelter tonight\n\nUnited in silent resistance\n\nOf bowing to false kings\n\n \----\n\nSo let me run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun from this meaningless pantomime\n\nI see the false kings\n\nI see that all this\n\nMust end\n\n\----\n\n\[Bridge\]\n\nWhen there's no love in my embrace\n\nCold blood runs through my veins\n\nIf I soar without grace\n\nDo I still soar?\n\n\----\n\nI need the love in your embrace\n\nOpen doors, brand new ways\n\nEnd my wars and erase\n\nAnd I'm yours\n\n\----\n\n\[Chorus\]\n\nSo I want to run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun to the shelter tonight\n\nUnited in silent resistance\n\nOf bowing to false kings\n\n\----\n\nSo let me run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun from this meaningless pantomime\n\nI'll swallow my pride, give up the pretence\n\n \----\n\n\[Outro\]\n\nYes, I wined and, and I dined on, on that cyanide\n\n&#x200B;
7	If you want an interpretation, go to r/INTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: This interpretation will not be in the order that the song gives the verses, merely the order by which inspiration struck me.\n\nFrom what I understand, this song is roughly about broken love and a broken man, once deceived\n\nby those whom he held in high esteem, and regrets being so. The phrase "Run from this meaningless pantomime " could indicate a revelation of knowledge that what he once did was empty and devoid of meaning or use, as he was following a "false god," so to speak. That may be a bit of foreshadowing of later parts of the song.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Edge of light and shade" seems to represent the deception in the mannerisms and words of the ones this man once followed, in that it seems to be correct at first glance, "edge of light," as light is typically associated with positive things, and "shade," not being truly dark, but being a deception nonetheless. The edge may represent the difficulty in differentiating between the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"When there's no love in my embrace, Cold blood runs through my veins. If I soar without grace, Do I still soar?" may indicate that the man no longer feels passion, and yet continues pretending that he does, in a relationship. The second part, "If I soar without grace, do I still soar?" is illustrating the strangeness of his pantomime of love, in that if he calls it love without there truly being passion, can it truly be considered love. Soaring is typically associated with birds, and obviously, soaring suggests majesty of flight. Also, birds need to have smooth movements to fly, as it would be quite difficult and inefficient to attempt to force flight, as we humans do with planes. Without these smooth, graceful movements, it is impossible for a bird to fly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"I need the love in your embrace. Open doors, brand new ways, End my wars and erase, And I'm yours". This phrase could indicate that he still desires the relationship, "I need the love in your embrace," or that he finds solace in love that no longer exists for him. "Open doors, brand new ways" seems to mean that he wishes for the partner in the relationship to give him this solace, free him from his burdens and entrapment ("caught up in all I've done"). The last part, "and I'm yours," could either indicate that he may have his passion reignited by the giving of this solace, or that he will continue the pretending game until he can no longer do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"I'll swallow my pride, give up the pretense". This probably means that he greatly desires the solace as mentioned in the part above. Pride is something all cultures value very highly, so to swallow one's pride is generally considered no mean feat. This indicates that he is willing to give up everything so long as the partner allows him to "run to \[their\] shelter".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"Yes, I wined and, and I dined on, on that cyanide" obviously indicates suicide. Cyanide, as commonly referred to in popular culture, means HCN, Hydrogen Cyanide. I'm not sure what "wined on" might mean, but "dined on" definitely indicates consumption. This suicide means that he probably did not receive the solace that he was seeking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long word vomit. This is probably not a good interpretation, as that task is best left to intuitive persons, and as it is a song, probably for feeling types as well. So, my recommendation for r/INTP will probably get you something more akin to this analysis, which I tried to make without any emotional biases. You will be best served by asking someone with INFX to interpret this. I do like the song, though, very smooth. I'll probably be checking out more of their songs later.
7	Having the same personality type does not mean we like the same music. 
2	never heard of it
2	I do not like this. I'm quite open to different styles, but its just. Meh.\n\nNo sir, i don't like it.
1	I guess he's heartbroken
1	It’s clearly about gay sex.
13	Have you ever got yourself into a fight?	I imagine most istps as easy going until there is a rumble and we escape or kick some ass.\n\nIf you have ever been in a fight, how do you justify violence? 
32	Never been one to start a fight. On the other hand, never backed down once I was hit. 
14	I've low-key always wanted to be in one, but I won't look for it. I be always wanted to learn boxing and more though.
16	It's something that I've always kind of been secretly terrified of.  And, having lived my life I've adapted by being fascinated with weapons.  Nunchaku, Sai, Swords, Spears, Chains, etc.  I train myself with them.  Quite seriously, actually, they're a great workout and super useful for coordination.  I know how to injure people.  I've trained TFT and I was a US Marine, and I learned well the combatives.  I'm also into weightlifting, and I'm a pretty big guy,\n\nBut I've never been in a fight.\n\nThing is, in my youth I was terrified of what they might do to me.  Now I'm kinda worried about what I might do to them.  I've studied the patterns and the anatomy to know just how someone will respond when I strike them, such that if it did occur, I really might seriously hurt someone.\n\nI don't look for it, I certainly treat it as a last resort, but I do have an arsenal of tactics at the ready to disable someone.  De-escalation is, however, something I have trained in as well, and I would much prefer to use my words and presence before having to resort to that.\n\nBut all that said, there is definitely a curious beast lurking in my ribcage, wondering what it might feel like to really fuck someone up who deserved it.
8	Hahahaha ohhh yeah. My 10 year elder brother used to beat the shit out of me growing up. Badly. \n\nWhen he left and I aged I grew aggressive in conflict. This lead to an obsession with boxing and later mixed martial arts.\n\nI used to look for conflict but as I grew older and martial arts began humbling me I took on the view that the greatest warrior is the one who is the deadliest one in the room but chooses to keep his sword sheathed anyways.\n\nThe moral there for me was co exist with people. Only fight when absolutely necessary.\n\nAs a kid I sought out conflict for the thrill. As an Adult I try and keep it at bay but if I have to, neutralize the other person quickly and efficiently. \n\nI typically only get into fights when protecting others or myself. \n\nThe last fight I broke the other persons nose with a stiff jab and pulling guard as they fell on me and put them in a triangle locking the choke for a few seconds and calmly asking them if they were done. Once done, I let off the choke.\n\nI could have simply choked them out but I tried to give them every chance to stop.\n\nDepending on how bad the threat is, is how much force I’ll use.\n\nIf the other person is a lot larger than me I have no choice but to try and hurt them as quickly and efficiently as possible. I wouldn’t want to risk being hurt myself.
3	Not yet, but I do wonder how good would I be at a street fight. Got a black belt in karate and I’m looking to get into mma soon, as it seems way more useful in a real life situation and a lot less stiff. Never been someone to look for conflict though, and never seem to attract conflict either. If someone did attempt something though, it’s on.
2	Never been in any kind of real fight, but I've done some play sparring with guy friends in the past and taken a few self defense classes. I've always wondered what I'd do if it came down to it. I know it's different in the situation, but as a female I have a difficult time sympathizing with women that cry sexual assault and rape. Like, if someone honestly tried to rape me, I'd be so fucking pissed, I would make sure it wasn't worth their while. They'd have to beat me near unconscious to get anywhere, and then they'd go to jail. This thing called adrenaline is my best friend.
2	I spent time in the Army and have worked as a security, bouncer, doorman, etc so I have had my share of scuffles. I usually prefer to use diplomacy and talk my way out of altercations, but sometimes fights are unavoidable. In those situations I act swiftly and effectively. \n\nI don’t try and have a fist fight but prefer to take them down using some kind of pain compliance technique and get them out of the establishment or hold them until police arrive.
1	Every fight I have been in has been self defense or in defense of someone I care about. \n\n\nI haven’t been in very many fights, but I’ve also never lost one. Back in the old days when I dealt with blind rage, my body would carry me through the fight without me actively making decisions. Essentially I was fully committed to the subconscious. When there is no think, just fight, it allows you to win (provided the assailant isn’t trained). I’ve taken out guys much much bigger than myself simply because my rage mode knew no fear and no pain, just survive. The vast majority of these fights lasted less than a minute I would say. It’s not like two people in an organized fight going at it to see who’s best. I have done that and I have lost those. I’m talking about spur of the moment “fight to survive” kind of fights. \n\n\nI will never use violence to solve a problem. But when I, or someone I care about is approached violently, I will use violence to mitigate the situation (or attempt to at least). You don’t bring words to a fist fight just like you don’t bring a knife to a gun fight. \n\n\nBut also, I have not been in a fight since curbing my temper. So I’m not 100% sure my previous ability to win will still carry on. If I can’t manually trigger rage mode, I don’t know if I’d make it through a fight in the same fashion. 
1	Only verbal, but as you can tell from the other comments it's very doubtful we would back down from a fight if provoked and logically able to defend ourselves. I'd like to say that we all would seldom be the starter of something physical unless there was a clear moral boundary past. Most of us, if we gave fighting any previous thought are probably good fighters. Other personalities arent as incline to think about how a knock out WORKS, how throwing a good punch WORKS, how protecting your self WORKS and so on.
1	I’ve had numerous chances to be in fights. Girls just have this thing where they think they want to start a fight with me. I always end up resorting to logic eg ‘well if we fight in the middle of the cafeteria we’ll both get suspended’ or ‘I seriously am never going to see you again, so I’m sorry I was talking to your boyfriend, but you will literally never have to deal with me trying to take him from you.’ And every time I’ve just walked away without further issues. That said I’ll spar all day for fun. I just won’t fight when my adrenaline gets me all twitchy. \n\n\nEdit: am a girl for clarity. 
1	I started Taekwondo when I was 6 because I was a big boy and my parents wanted me to defend myself and not start fights. It helped, and I only got into fights in elementary school whenever me or one of my friends were disrespected on the playground. A lot of the school moms hated me for fucking up their sweet little angels. \n\n\nNo fights in middle school. One instance where I shoved a kid a few yards after he tried pulling my pants down.\n\n\nI started boxing in high school. No fights at all.\n\n\nThen in college, I took a girl barhopping, she got fucked up and I walked her home. Some creep walked really close behind us and swiped the inside of her upper thigh. She screamed, and I started throwing punches at the guy naturally. I got him on the ground and kicked him until he stopped telling me to stop, which was quick, then took the girl home through some shortcuts so we could have incredible sex.\n\n\nAnyway, the point is I only fight to teach people lessons on how to treat others with respect. 
1	I’ve never been in a fight, nor do I ever have the desire to start one. But if someone were to every start swinging at me, I’d definitely want to end it myself. \n\nOnce in high school this kid made a $10 bet. I won it and he never paid up, eventually I made him and immediately after he started pushing me and getting aggressive. I didn’t want to fight him because it wasn’t worth it so I just walked away, but mentally I was prepping so hard for his swings. They never came though. 
1	Yep, I picked a fight with the wrong guys [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrBOoriLEcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrBOoriLEcQ)
13	What’s your relationship with sex?	It seems to be the only thing that really motivates me.
35	what is that?
19	It’s definitely one of my primary motivators. This is great when I’m having it regularly, but is a terrible distraction during a dry spell. 
15	Sex is like air. It's not a big deal...unless you're not getting any.
15	[deleted]
4	My sexual desires are increased when I know i shouldn't being doing something or someone. For me the crazier the sex or thrill the better and I rarely care about the consequences. If i feel bad its for a few minutes or a couple of weeks at most and I'm back to my idgaf attitude. I do how ever want a stable relationship someday, but have developed a "what happens, happens" attitude. 
3	I find I (22M) get more aggressive, easily angered, and less focused when im not getting laid regularly. 
5	[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet\_petit\_a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet_petit_a)\n\nSex is not biological or something like that, it is just ideology. What you really lack is the desire of a desire.
2	Thinking only about sex is not related to MBTI but to NPCness i guess
1	i would say it does not motivate me but is an important aspect of my relationship with my SO.
1	No relationship, just sex.
1	I have a healthy relationship with sex.\n\nIt took me a while to get that way.
1	I wish my ISTP boyfriend were motivated by sex, I might be getting more of it.
1	That's all of us I think no matter your type. People cock up other ways to feel good about themselves which in turn leads to feeling better with the world. Everyone has their way of getting sex but sex is always the dominating factor
1	It’s a major drive in what I do, how I think and how I approach things in life in general. I’m not necessarily proud of this but I have come to accept it and try to look in which ways it has positvely affected me and motivated me to learn and do things I otherwise wouldn’t have been interested in. Some basic examples are dressing sharp and projecting a warm and welcoming personality as well as some social skills, which I might not have given a flying fuck about if it had not related to getting some fine bootay..\n\nI do think that it might play a bigger role in our lives due to our strong Se compared to the average person, as much as I appreciate an emotional connection and feeling close with the right person, I sure like the sensational part of it too. Think back to the best damn fuck you had... just take a moment. What made it so good? Not the emotional part right? Well that’s us. Always seeking that sensory sweetness. \n\nThis turned into a mini wall unexpectedly and I’m not quite sure what kind of answers you’re looking for but let me end with this: \nRecently somebody asked me the following question, if you had to choose between living the rest of your life with a deformed face or not able to have sex anymore, what would you choose? I think the answer to this question uncovers a lot about how you view sex and life and opens up a lot of topics to discuss.. 
3	How many males vs females here? So curious	
31	Ill hope you know that I sexually identify as an A10 warthog
22	would be easier to do a poll for this
19	I’m a male here. On the ISFJ forum I’m a chick.
13	im a sea cucumber
12	Negative, I am a meat popsicle.
9	I'm a mail, because I'm never on time
6	It's a trap
10	Female
3	Dude here
3	Not a dude
4	Potato here
2	Male. Surprised to see many females here.
2	female
2	Female 
2	this feels like bait. 
2	Did you just asume my gender! /s
1	Not a Sheila.
1	Female

12	Does this sub have a chat room?	Hey guys, noticed the INTP and INFJ subs have their own reddit chat rooms, was wondering if we can have one as well?
24	We're too introverted for that to work, i think the crickets would enjoy it though
8	Almost posted this myself about an hour ago, so seconded!
6	How many places do we need to have...? 
3	do you mean like a discord channel?
1	I’m a miserable failure at the whole chatting thing.
5	What is your ultimate belief in life?	Do you think about it often?
29	Shit happens
10	The ***ultimate*** belief I have is that, the most fail-safe way of leading a life, is constantly bettering yourself, so whatever happens, when it happens, you’ll be fine.
4	lol I don't know
4	Life and the universe are essentially perfect.  It's other people that are a pain in the ass.
7	The true meaning of the universe and of life itself will always evade mankind. Either because there is no true meaning to it all and everything just is or because as minuscule fleeting blips of self reflecting matter we'll never be able to truly grasp the nature of existence. 
3	Depends on the month
4	I’m religious, Catholic.
5	I believe in a dualistic force. Order and Chaos very similar to Gathic Zoroastrianism. And there’s a karmic balance to this. My personal experience has taught me that you reap what you sow.\n\nOrder is wisdom, peace, and higher thinking.\n\nChaos is ignorance, aggression, and imposing on others.\n\nWe are born with the capacity to be good or evil by our own decisions. I don’t believe in a literal horned devil. That’s an archetype that exists within. We can either submit to it which is the easy path, or resist it which is the higher path.\n\nThere is also nature. Death pays for life. In order to live we have to eat. Be it plants or meat. Such is life. Chaos greeds  in death and assumes dominion, order takes just what it needs and is thankful for what it takes from nature. 
2	that life is something like a simulation (a.k.a. the matrix) and that nobody has a monopoly on the truth (i.e. any specific religion)
1	we are our own enemies 
1	Bear your cross.
1	Do I need one of those?
1	I believe in God, The Universe, etc. I believe in free will and what you do doesnt really matter anyways. If do what you think is wrong than its wrong and what is right is right. I believe there are many paths people may take whether we deem them right or wrong. To me its all about how we perceive it. If i feel ive done wrong then ive done wrong. Were all human we make mistakes but life goes on and "whatever happens, happens"
1	Live and let live
0	My conclusion on ISTPs and their reaction to harsh criticism and regrets.	As curious as I was, I wondered how you guys would feel if someone were to harshly criticize them and how you all would respond if that person were to come back the next day and apologize to them. My guess before using them as an experiment is that you all wouldn't really be bothered by the criticism and still wouldn't care if that person apologized for it.\n\nAfter posting a fake post about talking negatively to you guys the results came out interesting, same time unsurprising.\n\nWhat was surprising was how many upvotes I after I criticized you all harshly. I am still thinking why you all upvoted such a negative reaction towards. Is it because you find it true and actually wanted to improve yourself? Could it be because of how apathetic you upvoted instead of responding or arguing back? I am intrigued. No one but around two ISTPs responded back negatively.\n\nWhat wasn't surprising is that you guys did not take it seriously at all. Now on to the apology post.\n\nWhen reading the replies, you guys refused to forgive. It's like you all will hold that grudge forever, even if you may not think so. My opinion on you all is that you guys view another person based on what they said to you in the past, and you will least likely change the point of view. It's not only an act of revenge, but also being insensitive. \n\nThis is what I concluded for my project for college, a project over the people's reaction to regrets and their grudges. Thanks for participating in the experiment I did on you all! \^\^\n\n&#x200B;
32	didn't someone comment on your first post that you were going to end up doing this?\n
38	We still don’t give a shit leave our subreddit alone.
17	Judging data is not the same as judging people.  Exhibit shit data, receive shit label.  It's not about values or grudges, just evidence.  Apologizing doesn't entitle you to forgiveness, and your careless manipulation is enough data to write you off.  The odds of you being this way and also worth spending time on is very low, and it'd probably be illogical to waste time listening to find out. \n \nWe're just being efficient.  If you proved the judgment wrong, it'd change.
13	But I wonder how many ISTP's on here aren't actually ISTP's.
15	So this was an experiment for a class? Um, what a shitty experiment. Not scientific at all, so many problems with your methodology. So may assumptions made prior and post, your results are ridiculously biased.\n\nHonestly sounds like someone struggling with BPD to me. Get some real help.
8	This is like running a sociology experiment on cats, asking for them to participate. \n\nWhatever they end up doing, it sure as hell won’t be following the instructions. 
12	If this was a project for college, I wouldn't be surprised if you got shit marks on it, what was the experiment based on? What were your variables? Your control group? Hypothesis? I don't see how you could possibly gain anything from posting this nonsense. \n\n
6	[Somehow...](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/I-dont-believe-you.gif)
5	??? I'd say "Don't you have anything better to do" but I'd probably be ostracized by the tribe for ruining their fun.\n\nWhy do you hate us so much?
5	Hi, person who predicted that you were pulling an experiment on us here. I never take your "criticize" seriously, just thought you were trolling us and y'know, doing an "experiment". \n\nThe upvote thing for me, is just a "Lol m8 u tried lmao 1 updoot for your effort". \n\nOriginally, I downvoted it while reading cause I don't like people trolling around the subreddit. But then while reading the comments I just found the whole situation fucking hilarious so I changed my vote. I feel like you were clearly trying to piss us off and bait us into arguing so I did the exact opposite of what I think you'd expect us to do. \n\nAlso found it would be a waste of time & effort to argue with someone who title their post with very immature baity wording "yOu cAnT sPeLl sT00pid w/o iStPo0 (insert emoji)" I dont think you can convince a lot of people that you're giving serious criticism with something like that.\n\nOnto the apology post, which is also a part of the experiment(?). There's a mere 5 hours gap between this one & the apology, I don't think that's enough time to draw a conclusion. But now that you've revealed it, there's no way back. So basically you FEEL bad that we *might* FEEL bad so you apologised. We (ISTPs) in general are pretty chill and not a lot of things can rile us up. Didnt care about the first post, will also not care about the apology. People are entitled to their own opinion, why apologise? Apologies just because you assumed we feel bad due to your opinion, sounds like some lousy youtuber's apology.\n\nAnyway this is way too long already I'm ending it.
6	You realize everyone here acts overly "ISTP" then they really would in reality, right? Even if your "experiment" was done better it would still have skewed results.
4	This guy really doesn't ever shut up
3	You insulted us?\n\nYou insulted yourself by posting your little rants. I never up or down voted you, but I thought you might be kind of funny when you were sober.\n\nYou sounded like a run of the mill self loathing democrat. Not anyone to be taken seriously.\n\n
2	Can we get rid of this guy already pls. I got the pitchforks
1	Or maybe we just dont care and upvoted your stupidity to mess with you and get more of us to read it for a good laugh.\n\nYour experiment seems kind of stupid and poorly done, especially considering the fact that we are a lot more extroverted on here than in real life. If you want to truly see how we would react, gather up some ISTPs in real life. I dont feel like the results would be much different, it would range from indifference to agreeing with what you say in a joking manner
0	I am so sorry for what I said about you guys.. :(	Some of you probably remember my post from last time about criticizing you all. Even though you guys didn't care or ignored it, I still felt bad for you all. I feel guilty for what I said, all of it wasn't true but is just pure opinions. Forgiven or not, I still apologize... ;-; 
49	We still don't care and will continue to ignore you
24	I think he's just trying to get us to read his other post. 
16	Take it to /r/ENFJ. Even though you never said anything about them, they’ll actually respond nicely. Unlike us. 
9	Ok
8	Who is this pleb
9	Im not an istp, but im here to say I also don't care.
8	And how is this information going to help me?
8	This post is fake and it’s also gay.
4	His other post is actually pretty damn true about us. But I like it, it’s hard to take criticism, but boy I’m going through shitty emotional phase recently, so that post actually helped me get some perspective from outside the ISTP world.
1	Don't fuck with us fam
11	Which areas in your life you are improving these days?	I've been working hard on website analytics and data analysis. I discovered there's money and high demand of this skill for online businesses. I think I can utilise this skill for more lucrative and independent projects. I can see long-term opportunities as well.\n\nIn term of self-improvement, I'm doing better in Martial Arts (Jiu-Jitsu). 
14	social skills
12	General fitness. Just started mountain biking.\n\nLearning better money management skills.
7	I'm working on my people skills at work mainly. I want to not come off as that asshole who's good at his job, but more the guy who's good at his job and is pleasant to talk to as well. 
3	Re-establishing and maintaining the same level of discipline I had when I practiced Taekwondo. Between WTF years and depression after high school my drive and motivation flew away.\n\nApart from that I'm working on my social skills, but I put this one in the back burner after I broke up with my first GF to focus on the former.
5	I'm working on ways to counter what you're working on. 
2	Olympic lifting - I'm starting a full-time 12 week program and doing my first meet in January\n\nCommunicating in my relationship. Previous relationships didn't go so well because of my lack of talking, so I'm fixing that with my current boyfriend. \n\nMoney management and planning; I've been living life day-to-day, but as I'm nearing 30 it's time for me to start planning my future. 
2	I’m building a race simulator and a race car. Race car will hopefully get raced once a month at the local AutoX. The simulator is for daily practice. I’ve also got a racing school lined up next year to get my HPDE racing license. \n\n\nIt’s a slow process and a lot of it is idle work while I’m saving money. But the car is almost done and I’m a few weeks out from having the money for the rest of the simulator. \n\n\nMy dream has always been professional driving. And now I have the time and money to give it a shot. So I’m going balls to the walls with my own project car and simulator. I have an extensive history in performance driving and building cars. Have raced AutoX in quite a few different cars. I have always been good at it, but now it’s time to become great at it and make it a career. 
2	Working on physical improvements and trying to get a GF
2	Losing weight, quitting smoking, and trying to be less of a grumpy recluse.
2	Trying to get 8 hours of sleep.
1	Nice, may I ask what resources you are using to learn about these subjects?\n\nI recently bought this deal on appsumo for Google analytics and PPC courses, but didn't have time to check them out yet
1	Artistic skill.  In VR Google Tilt Brush, I'm building Dagobah and the submerged X-wing.   [https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8jj1tpc1syh1tl/Dagobah-4hrs.mp4?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8jj1tpc1syh1tl/Dagobah-4hrs.mp4?dl=0)
1	Health. I'm stop smoking for the second time, hope this time last forever.
1	Being more attentive to others, less rough. I always get the moral things right, but the details I lacked. Also believing or improving for the right reasons. Being more loving, being authentic.
14	Spot the difference between INTp and ISTp?	I have a friend who I always thought was an ISTp (engineer, no nonsense, not a touchy feely person). However, he told me he thinks he’s INTx. \n\nHow do you spot the difference? Thanks!
35	I'm an ISTP and my boyfriend is an INTP. Here are few of the obvious differences:\n\n1. When we dine at a restaurant, my INTP has a tendency to scan all details in the menu (ingredients, names of dishes, etc) and sometimes openly wonder how they taste or whether they'd like them. This is how Extraverted Intuition works. As for me, I simply look for my favorite dishes and if they're not available, I look for anything that sounds/looks delicious (pictures). This is how Extraverted Sensing works.\n2. When we are having a conversation, he tends to go on tangents around a topic. These tangents can analogies, examples of events, similar ideas and points, theories, associations, perspectives, metaphysics, everything. Again, this is Extraverted Intuition. I find it exhausting. Whereas I can only ask questions, follow his train of thought and then digest everything and pick which are most important or useful to me... I get to the fucking point (my kind of point). This is how Introverted Intuition (paired with Introverted Thinking) works.\n3. Clothing. He has a uniform type of style. White shirts, cargo pants, and socks. All same material, brand and functionality. (Introverted Sensing maybe?). I can but prefer not wear same type of clothes every day. I care about how I look and I secretly want to look good all the time without being obvious in my look that I put so much effort into it. I'm a sensor after all.\n4. In social interactions, ISTP is quieter than INTP.  I also get easily/openly bored.\n5. When it comes to emotions, I guess it's all about the level of maturity in that department. I'm open about my emotions to my INTP. ISTPs value and put action on genuine declaration of feelings. We're realists, after all. WE love the real thing. My INTP prefers to think of what he should feel and needs time, unless asked jokingly. He enjoys masking his feelings with dry humor. I do it as well, but for the sake of trolling him.\n6. Actions. I'm more action-oriented. He needs time and reasons to decide whether he must do something or not. Even if it's a simple chore (good god I hate this about him) or paying taxes. I simply do things whether I hate it or not.\n7. I appear charismatic and hot (he said). He looks like a total awkward adorable robot and rejoices in these qualities.\n8. I love to touch people when I want to talk and connect with them more empathically (if I like that person). He doesn't do touching. He'd cringe.\n9. He cares so much more than I do. About energy-saving, the world, the soap melting without use, and all that shit.\n10. He's very confident, even if he's awful at making it real. I am very self-critical and don't like compliments that much even if I ace things most of the time.\n11. I can write this kind of answer in a heartbeat. He would not. \n\n&#x200B;
4	You don’t “spot” the difference. You’re looking at his mask, not his interior. Anyone can wear any mask they want. They hide whatever they want and display whatever they want. Only the individual can decide what suits their nature best. But you, being outside his brain, can’t really make those decisions. You can make assumptions and maybe come up with a close assessment. But without knowing what goes on his brain, assuming/inferring is all you can do. \n\n\nIf he believes he’s an INTx, there’s likely something going on inside of him that you don’t see. 
5	I'm an INTP. My husband is an ISTP.\n\nHe is very aware of his surroundings and I trip over things due to being lost in my own head and forget where I am more times than I'd prefer to admit.\n\nI have a lot of creative ideas. He dosen't as much but is good at fine tuning mine and figuring out how to make them work.\n\nWe both dress casually (jeans, T shirs or flannels) and also both prefer the other in casual clothes than formal wear, though he's appreciates things like how a certain pair of jeans looks on me. I'm not visually stimulated. Exchanging ideas or jokes is my turn on.\n\nHe's also far more in to physical touch than I am. I appreciate it but only by him (I don't like hugging my friends or other family members much) and only some times. I need a lot of physical space.\n\nHe needs a lot of alone time to recharge, possibly more than me but I get sensory overloaded while sensory stimulating things (such as loud music, not people) seem to charge him. I enjoy being alone with my thoughts. I can stare off into space and be entertained with my own thoughts. He has no interested in just sitting and thinking, though he is quite intelligent.\n\nI like to debate far more than he does. He finds it draining and pointless.\n\nWe're both very quiet in group situation usually. He can get slightly more talkative if he has a few beers. I can get talkative if a subject I'm very interested in is brought up and then I can talk very enthusiastically. He's pretty mellow in his speech even when his interests are being discussed.  We both have a dry/sarcastic sense of humor.\n\nHe is more self motivated than I am but actually has more of a problem with punctuality than I do.\n\nI like learning for the sake of learning. He likes learning for practical purposes.\n\nHe is slower to process new information. I have more initial anxiety but  I also get over things more quickly. When he is upset he tends to brood longer and  you better leave him alone or he'll have to start from the beginning to recharge.\n\nI worry a lot more than he does in general because my mind is always wondering "what would happen if...." he takes things as they come and always lives in the moment which is very difficult for me.\n\nHe's better at being concise than I am. He could probably find a way to post this using 1/4 of the words I use.\n\nWe both are very blunt but he tries a little harder to meet social protocol. He sometimes tells me I'm being rude and I don't understand why. However I like to help people more than he does. If a friend has a problem I like to try to help them fix their problem (pragmatically, not emotionally, we're both weak in that area). He'd rather not get involved but is very willing to help someone with a project like running an errand or fixing their roof. He sometimes gets taken advantage of in this respect.
7	Do you mean ISTp or ISTP? Cause those are actually different things.
5	Do you mean INTJ and ISTJ?  If not, capitalize your damn letters. 
2	The biggest difference I see is the INTx is going to be looking way in to the future for possible problems with everything, where the INTP looks at immediate practicality.
2	Roughly one letter 
1	There you go https://youtu.be/P-meUdrD2Y4
47	Bad time to be ISTP 😩	
49	But I’m passionate about being smugly uncaring....
33	Be passionate about the things you're fucking passionate about. Fuck everybody else.
20	Don't sweat the haters. Smug dispassionate and uncaring will never go out of style.
15	Since when have the smugly uncaring cared about what was "in?"
10	I dont care enough about what's in to think its a bad time to be me
9	None of this matters. Who cares.
8	INTP but that's what I thought too lol, RIP introverts.
3	I'm not gonna be a stepping stone
7	I disagree. I shamelessly enjoy boobies. I'm passionate, fascinated, and invested in them :D
2	Who wrote this tripe?  Esme Squalor?
2	In a world of melladramatic actors, someone needs to, build the theaters so they have a place to put on a show, build power plants so they'll have spotlights for their narcissism, and distill the vodka so they may throw it in the faces of their critics.  Without us, nobody would realize just how amazing they are.
1	Ouch 
1	Speak for yourself 
1	is this even true it seems like people are getting more apathetic by the hour
13	Grown up male ISTPs, how do you become a man?	By becoming a man, I mean a person who everyone respects and looks up to. A person who can handle his own shit and the shit that others throw at him. A person who doesn't cower during difficult times. A person who always has something to work towards in his life. Any ISTPs here like that? How did you become that person? \n\nBeing an ISTP, I suck at social situations. I don't know when it's appropriate to say what. I don't know how social statuses work. I don't know what makes people different from others, or how they're different from others. I aim to understand that. And I think the only way to do that, is by understanding myself.\n\nEdit: I'm 17
26	What's a man? What's an adult? You can either go by what society says or what you think about it. For me it's about being independent and taking care of my responsibilities. Having fun in life and knowing when to be serious or not.\n\nJust don't be an asshole and you'll be fine. Try things. Fail. You'll learn with it.\n
7	Anything you don't know how to do, are afraid of or just haven't tried. Do it.\n\nBe the most interesting man in the room. \n\nBecome a man doing so. It's what i did.
12	Maybe you’re not an ISTP. Honestly, if you don’t understand social cues and people you might have aspergers or be on the spectrum. I know I’m an istp because I worked at a Fortune 500 company and for two days we did “tests” and then given books that explained our personality, leadership style, etc.\n\nI was the only istp in the class.\n\nLastly, I would get this “becoming a man” stuff out of your head. I know plenty of “men” that I don’t care for and have no respect for. I have been an army officer, a cop, an operations manager in the rail road so I have seen my fair share of “men”. You need to work on being an adult. No adult just starts fearless and can handle everything. We learn how to with experiences. \n
3	You are young, do not listen to this guy measuring his dick here, we all had problems like that.\nDo have you have to do, face the responsabilities for your actions.
3	By telling the hopeful ISFJ in your life that she'll never be more than a friend
2	Societies idea of a man changes every year, so I wouldn't go with that\n\nI think it has to do with developing your own ideas and opinions then openly talking about them not afraid of what others will think (not closed off from other opinions)\n\nOf course it is subjective and by that logic couldn't anybody be a man? \n\nI guess it just one of the bigger things I think of
2	Be yourself. And be happy doing so.
2	Is it being prepared to do the right thing... whatever the cost... Isn't that what makes a man?\n\nMmmmm, sure. That and a pair of testicles.
5	1. Join the service. Learn a trade or earn money to educate yourself. Serve a cause higher than yourself while building respect and social capital. \n2. Become very good at what you do. If you are a tradesman, specialize in a particular niche, and become "the guy" to call for that type of work. Specialize and nerd out on what you do, and try and make sure what you do is something that you gain some feeling of satisfaction from. \n\n3. Make a respectable income. You don't have to be rich, but if you follow the steps above, you should be able to earn a wage that meets your primary and secondary needs, with some left over for fun or savings. A man pays his debts. \n\n4. Start a family. This can happen t any stage above, but best to not start bringing children into this world until they can be cared for and adequately supported. Do this with a good woman who shares your goals and outlook on life. Also, have a dog. \n5. Die on your feet. Don't force your children to care for you when you become old and infirm. Face death on your own terms. If you get diagnosed with a wasting or incurable illness, quietly do what needs to be done. 
2	Your definition of a man is skewed.
1	At 17, it's natural to be hyper-vigilant about other people's perceptions of you.  It happens to all of us.  High School is especially bad about this, because you're basically trapped in an artificially small social bubble.  I refer to it as a pressure cooker for emotional angst.\n\nHowever, you will find that as you pass from High School, the world opens up.  Learn to accept that it's okay to just be you. Stop worrying about meeting everyone else's expectations of what you should be, and focus on your own expectations for yourself.   Take a look at what kind of person you want to be, and then stop doing things that don't advance that goal.\n\nHope this helps. 
1	Just do little things to get in the habit of not being humble and submissive. You can be as immature as you want if you're assertive and mean business you'll be treated as an adult, it's pretty strange.
1	Lol dude don’t try to hide behind some personality label to justify your own situation, it’s counterproductive. You can’t say “oh being an istp i suck at this and that and can’t do this or this”. I’m an ISTP and your age, and I know for a fact that this personality type we got from a little test doesn’t make us automatically severely autistic and socially inept. Even the fact that you’re asking the internet how to become a man at 17 is a red flag your mind is just wandering and not grounded. Get your own shit going, became a man yourself, and just ignore the fact you’re an “ISTP”, a few differing behavioral patterns doesn’t make you a different species. 
0	* do things that have a big positive impact on people\n* keep your word to yourself and others\n* be nice, be respectful, be tolerant\n\n(based on “anecdata”)
21	Unluckiness	Do y'all also hav thie feeling that the world is against you ? It's like I can never rest happy without something shitty happening in my life, it's like the universe works hard as fuck to make my life the shittiest possible. But then I realize it's a pretty selfish thought and my life is pretty good compared to most humans (like homeless people for example)
17	This is probably not going to earn me any popularity points, but I’m quite sure it’s a matter of perspective. Of more likely, a lack of perspective. \n\nWe’re all wired to give way more weight to negative events than positive ones because that’s where threats lie. 
9	+1 word by word... 
8	Its me against the world baby
8	I feel like the luck stat was on the back of the character sheet and I forgot to assign points to it on character generation.
8	Damn, so I'm not the only one. Although to me I'd say my life gives me some of the best luck in the entire world followed by fucking me over in order to balance it.
6	The world is against me, but I'm still very lucky.  
5	Luck is on my side. I am grateful for that.
1	100% agree. I also think that this is perhaps also the reason why I'm so weak-minded
1	Sometimes I feel like luck has to do with the people I’m around >> changes the choices I make >> impacts my circumstances >> luck. I don’t know if that’s a factor here too?
1	Here, here.\n\nIt's hard not to become jealous of people who breeze through life, whereas my husband and I struggle with every.damn.step.
1	People who get fucked over by turns of events are usually have an inferior perceiving function. Maybe your Se/Ni needs work. \n\nI would think though that ISTPs have a very realistically sobering perspective of the world due to having relatively balanced double observers. Ofc the whole inferior Fe loner status will give it an additional me vs the world vibe. So maybe it's just that.
1	No. I’ve had my fair share of shit in life, but as a whole I am happy with all the good things I do have. \n\nThis sums up my feelings on the “can’t catch a break” stuff: [https://youtu.be/74QoYIOGNvo](https://youtu.be/74QoYIOGNvo)

28	You can't spell 'Stupid' without ISTP :)))	I really do hate ISTP, I literally cringe just by seeing them. As much as I hate INTJs, ISTPs are literally fucking difficult it's not even funny. Hmm, but I wonder if I have any other reasons to hate these idiots. Let's see...\n\n1. Extremely stubborn\n2. Doesnt even understand emotions\n3. But then say that emotions are for pussies just because they lack it\n4. Lack imagination\n5. Stingy as hell\n6. Believe anything that isn't practical is stupid\n7. Believe anyone has a different lifestyle from theirs are stupid\n8. Unpredictable in the shittiest way possible\n9. Their social life wants to make you go insane\n10. "MIGHT AS WELL PUT OTHERS IN DANGERS BECAUSE WHY NOT"\n11. Obviously Boring\n12. Obviously Reckless \n13. Obviously Edgy\n14. Obviously Violent\n15. r/iamverybadass\n16. Please dont get me started on the women\n17. Doesnt even understand others\n18. Chooses not to understand others\n19. Now they say a bunch of "blunt" opinions that hurt others\n20.

1	It will all be okay once you see that istp dude's are an asset , respect rationale above society and emotions, we are always ready for life. We have taken time too think things through.  So we are not stubborn but confident. Think of us as those who can bring balance. I have personally sought today correct my typical istp shortcomings. I understand feelings now but I'd rather not use them. They don't exist. Be strong as we are...

0	Hi ISTPs	So how was your day today ;)
5	Wicked nice. Went down to a tunnel / stream for old times sake (filmed a Vidya there) and I found a geocache completely by accident. I watched some old experimental films that were super trippy. My cat got dental surgery so he's delerious and high, so I'm loving hime. Now I'm playing a lil drinking game with my girlfriend to "the room"...
3	Not moving 10 meters away from my bed so it was fine.
1	Idk I don’t have emotions 
1	Why do you care?
2	I can sort of relate to this song (Since ISTP music is dead)	
29	How would you guys say your friendships started?	To me, all my friendships just sort of happened. If I make a friend, it's usually always because the other person initiated a conversation with me and kept it alive.
53	Adopted by extroverts.
19	Rigid standardized testing, performed over three grueling hours, followed by a stringent physical challenge round, and of course, swimsuits. \n\nNah, just hung out with people I got along with, still get along with them now. 
11	Yes I made lots of friends in high school but after high school I never saw them again. Now I don't have any friends. Only family. I have a big European family.
7	Usually either by someone extroverted coming up to me and forcing themselves upon me until I either tell them to fuck off or I think "hey, they're actually not too bad." \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr, me going out to parties and having a good time and meeting a few people who I then think while looking at my phone contacts "Oh yeah, that was you from the other night, you were pretty cool actually. Let's go out again sometime." 
6	Either had a common interest, met at work/school, or was introduced to them by an extrovert friend.
2	Always be the guy who brings beer
2	My study group for my Japanese class in College. \n\n One guy at my job kept asking me to go to his place and kickback and smoke and I kept turning him down and I felt bad so the next time he asked, I just went. Thought I was going to be there for 30 minutes, turned out I spent the night. We're right friends now. 
2	i make a bold joke and that's now i know who to waste my time with or who not. if i'm even going to bother socializing with someone i'm at least gonna enjoy it
2	It just kind of happens. My best friend is an ESFP and I met her 7 years ago on the first day of highschool. Her locker was right next to mine. She just started talking to me and telling me shit about her dog.\n\nMy ESTP friend, my other best friend, I met on a bench in my first year of uni. He was talking about how he was trying to get with my INFP friend. Then she led him on and we both unfriended her cause she was boring as hell.
2	Usually with people that sit next to in class or people that I'm forced to work with. 
2	I'm a shameless flirt, so it's usually an attempted romantic interest that fizzled and turned platonic. This is also why most of my friends are women and the ones who are dudes are ones I know through being active on NBA Twitter.
1	I do not have friends, I just tolerate them.
2	Any ISTPs in IT?	Can anyone suggest any certifications that would be good for an ISTP? I am looking to get into the hardware/infrastructure field.\n\nI've got the A+ certification already. Working toward the Net+, but I'm struggling to grasp the material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	Im in IT, just started working towards a CCNA. I think all IT certs are good for ISTP? if you enjoy it anyway
2	Easy route would be cisco and juniper networking and then find a career in it security. Jobs for life if you are ok with continual learning.
2	Consider engineering, comsci or similar too. A little bit more effort but software development can be a very exciting career field where you can build really cool shit\n\nSource: am in tech, work with a lot of ISTx people
2	I'm a software engineer, can say I enjoy it so. I don't have any certifications to speak of, just go with what is the most interesting to you.
12	This gets me angry (minimal wage)	As an Istp, I have a hard time explaining to Fe people that raising minimal wages incresases joblessness Spain, my country, had a minimal wage of 730 this year and will increase it to 900.\n\nWTF seriously!!! We are poor already, most of the jobless population is below 30 an living at their parents place... \n\nMeanwhile, feelers are claping their hands, oblivious and doomed, hey, when the job market colapses they will ask for more public spending, which is actually taken from the productive sectors, which can not create enough jobs already. \n\nSo the mechanism is going into debt for social protection. But then public debt rises and our dear socialists will blame capitalism. \n\nGoooooodness whyyyyyyy????? \n\nPs, i did my best to write in english\n\n
21	Sure seems like a lot of people in here haven't actually studied minimum wage and what the affects are when it's raised. And I thought ISTPs were interested in the practical application of something, not all the theory behind it, which can often be wrong, as is the case with the OP.\n
8	The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, but the illusion of knowledge.
12	same this gets me so angry because practically every economist would agree with you that price floors like minimum wage, almost always do more harm than they do good. but increasing minimum wage? that’s just asking for a higher unemployment rate. 
8	I understand that raising minimum wage isn't really a good thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I look at it though, is if I get paid about $22 an hour to teach children, why should someone flipping burgers at McD's get paid $15? It just fucks with inflation, then it makes MY money not worth as much.
8	Minimum wage increases only decrease jobs if there isn't a strong labor movement to force employers to take the money from profits instead of screwing other employees. Stop kicking downwards.
3	If you're going to raise it, you practically have no choice but to increase the amount of production so that way you can keep your marginal contribution per employee and there's a cap to human production before you add technology in.
4	First off your english is good, Second off idiots are gonna be idiots. They don't understand that not only will raising minimum wage eliminate jobs, it will also raise prices, effectively doing nothing but taking jobs away from them
4	if corporations acted with a conscience, they'd take the money from their profits to properly pay their employees. but they specifically lay off other workers and pile more work on existing employees because people like the op keep falling for it and believing multi million dollar companies have anything but their bottom line in mind.\n\nalso? if a small business can't afford to pay its employees a living wage, it can't afford to stay running. you'll find that in places with an across the board minwage increase though, that business usually also increases because people have more money to spend and more time to spend it.\n\ncmon, I thought istps were all about gathering information. 
6	Without any cited sources this is just opinionated non-sense.
3	What's your problem with feelers?
3	> most of the jobless population is below 30 an living at their parents place... \n\nAnd raising the minimum wage makes this problem even worse. Minimum wage jobs are for young people with no experience, mostly because they don't have the skills or value to pay a lot of money for yet. When I was 17 years old (in 2004), I worked for $7.25/hour. Yea it was nothing but I was living with my parents and didn't need much money. If the minimum wage was $15/hour, like a lot of people in the US want it to be, I would have never gotten that job and would have never earned that work experience to be able to move on to a higher paying job.\n\nAnyways, I feel your frustration. Just keep explaining it calmly, clearly, and rationally and maybe you'll change a few minds. Buena suerte.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I have the same problem in the states trying to convince people not to let the government enact rent control. The real solution is to build more residences. In the long run lowering the rent will only exacerbate the problem.
1	Just tell them 900 is too little. It should be enough to make everyone millionaires (or whatever is considered "rich" in Spain). Reductio ad absurdum works well for this one. 
1	Political views	Just wondering what fellow istp views are on the political scale. I assume most are conservative/libertarian leaning but that’s just my guess. Explanation on why you go a certain way also appreciated 
8	Moderate Democrat. Because (off the top of my head and not necessarily in any order):\n\n* Climate change is a real problem that needs to be addressed \n* Social safety net programs are helpful to the needy\n* Democrats have demonstrated higher competency and are better stewards of federal spending. Deficit spending has skyrocketed under R's and decreased under D's for as long as I've been alive\n* The government does a good job at addressing public goods, such as defense, physical infrastructure (power grids and roads), public health, certain research projects, and public education, and deserves adequate funding to do so.\n* Progressive taxation is the fairest way to fund the government\n* I'm in favor of LGBT rights, racial and gender equality, and not in favor of the death penalty. 
3	as far left as one can get
9	Centrist with libertarian leanings; vote mostly libertarian or republican. My political views were established back in 2012 when Ron Paul was running for president. \n\nI think the government is too inefficent and we spend wayy to much on the military. 
5	Moderate Republican. Pro-2nd amendment, pro-choice, pro-military, pro-lgbtq...etc.\n\nThe government has too much power and neither of the two main sides want to change that, just apply it differently. 
3	Slightly left of Marx. \n\nI don’t care for the current political climate, it seems like people choose whichever side carries their shadow projections most readily. 
3	The federal government should be small and do very little. Your local government should be where you and your neighbors decide on what's best for your community.\n\nI have very little right to decide in Virginia what happens in California, and vice versa.
3	Libertarian AF 
2	Libertarian, more conservative leaning though 
2	I study international relations and politics in university. Politics is always in my face but I think I’d say I’m a classical liberal. 
2	Moderate conservative (but believes in gay rights and legalizing marijuana).
2	National Socialist
2	classical liberal, seems more in line with modern conservative
3	Moderate conservative

16	I love my ISTP	I am an ENTJ female and I've always been in relationships with feelers. I met my ISTP on tinder. I liked him because he was witty, hilarious and genuinely interesting. Things moved pretty quickly which was weird because things never move quickly for me. \n\nAfter almost 2 years together we're living together and he let's me rule the roost. He likes to show his affections by buying things for me or my daughter and taking care of any wants/needs monetarily for us. He enjoys taking care of us and vice versa. I tend to think of more futuristic things and human needs like new shoes, car maintenance, new house fund, etc... We've been thinking of getting married as well, but we both think it's still too soon.\n\nHis only flaw I'd say is that he flip flops between no kids and wants kids. He wants my daughter as his kid and sometimes he says shit like: It'd be cool to have another one. Then immediately changes his mind. Lol I have zero clue on that.\n\nAlso, reading all the posts about ISTPs have helped me love him better. So thanks. Bye.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n
16	I'm an INFP and love 'my' ISTP very much...more than I've ever loved anyone. We've been together for 2+ years and things moved very fast for us, as well. I basically moved in after a couple months.\n\nI browse this sub to sort of remind myself of the ISTP perspective in certain areas. From what I can tell, ISTPs are not afraid of commitment, but are very sensitive to the risk/reward of everything. I would just keep an open mind, to his open mind, if that makes sense.\n
9	If you want to reduce the population have 1 kid.  \nIf you want to maintain the population have 2 kids.  \nDon't have more than 2 kids.
2	ok.... ʕ ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°ʔ
2	As an ISTP, here's how I interpret this:\n\n\>  he says shit like: It'd be cool to have another one\n\nThat sounds to me like he's putting the feelers out to see how you'd react. If he truly 100% did not want kids, he wouldn't say that. He's at least open to the idea, but maybe looking to see what you want or what insight you may be able to offer that might swing his decision.

38	Sometimes it sucks to be the level-headed one	My wife's cat has been in kidney failure for over two years and took a pretty bad turn a few days ago. We've been going back and forth with various treatments to stabilize him but they weren't working. The decision was made last night to put him down. Since I am the level-headed one and am able to semi-detach myself from the situation, I made the call to set it up. Was one of the hardest calls I've had to make in quite some time and it sucks. [Here](https://imgur.com/T0hF3fy) is a pic of him from two years ago, after he came home from the hospital with the kidney diagnosis. 
9	sorry about your cat, dude, he's adorable & I know how hard it is to lose a cat. you did the right thing, hope things look up for you soon
10	It's better than not being the level headed one, trust me.
3	Such a cutie! Sorry about what you have to go through.. I can’t imagine how difficult that must have been 
3	Sorry to hear that. :/ Yeah being the one that has to make the hard calls and has to act okay can suck. 
2	I'm sorry for your loss.
2	Yeah it's really a choice for me just like it is for you. We can shut our ability to feel on or off. If my parents were to die, I think I could just shut out the feeling and not cry but the emotions would build up over time and eventually explode out. I think that's the way we inferior Fe's function. We choose not to feel and sort of stow those feelings away until the pot boils over. 
2	what was his name?
1	Sorry about your cat man 😕... I feel you though.  I don’t know what I’m going to do when my animals get to that point... mainly cause I know my family will be a wreck and I’ll be in your shoes when that time comes.
6	For those of you who watch mma, ufc	Do you think khabib nurmagomedov is an ISTP and Conor an ESTP? Why does Conor come off likable and khabib stiff and not as likable? Do ISTP's have a better chance of being the best at MMA than ESTP's (I think fedor emeliananko is an ISTP as well). 
6	[deleted]
6	On a more serious note, I wish there were more discussions about types and sports because I really think that certain intelligences come easy for certain types because their brains are more inclined to be interested or satisfied with specific areas/topics/subject. \n\nI've seen a lot of people type Conor as ESTP and I don't disagree with that. Not into MMA so much, but when I watched videos and interviews of Khabib, I actually had affinity for him. I haven't seen enough of him to type him as ISTP though. \n\nBut I've read before that ISTP's are likely to be good in sports because of extroverted sensing, made a lot of sense but of course a lot of things come into play as well like body type etc. but I think their biggest competitor would be ESFP. \n\nNot an expert, so maybe I'm just rambling.

2	While I'd say both are likely STPs, it more a matter of principle and priorities.\n\nI see Connor more as a showman, and businessman, who's personal priority is to make drama to sell (there was one clip where he whispered to khabib "it's all business" while in the octagon. Plus he owns his whiskey company, using ufc to promote it.\n\nKhabib is definitely more like your straight headed stp, man of principles like family and faith. Definitely pent up his feelings in front of Connor for sake of principle, until he blew up.\n\nKhabib win against Connor is more because the first is a better fighter.
2	Istps are supposed to make the best athletes. I think in mma, istps might have a slight advantage because it is an individual sport and istps tend to be a bit more strategic than responsive as we lead with Ti versus Se.
1	wot?
1	Definitely agree with this 
1	Khabib is not likable? 
1	No these airheads would be Fi users. It's all about their emotions, their glory and dreams.
15	istps has this thing....?	i noticed alot of istps are so raw,especialy with there line liners,almost poetic,they have that same thing that nfjs have....take clint eastwood with his one liners,or eminme with his lyrics,or simon cowell with his insults,bruce lee,snoop dogg ect.....anyways why are you guys so good at those witty one liners,or insults?
21	It's a gift.
16	Dominant Ti > Accurately finds the answer, the truth, and values it above feelings, so, We blurt out the truth with little care for how anyone feels about it; its the truth, thats all that should matter. i dont think we're actually TRYING to hurt anyones feelings or "make cool one liners" or anything; We're just saying it because we want to, because it deserves to be said, because it's the truth. Stuff like that.\n\nISTP's with tempers are likely even more susceptible. Developing Fe helps even it out so that it can be done in more appropriate, needed fashion, rather than just letting our mouths run wild and offend everyone all the time.\n\nI have noticed i myself do it, but only because others have pointed it out. I don't realize I've done it until one of my friends is running around the room with his hands over his mouth and yelling, "OOOOHHHHHHHH!!!!". Friends have called them "burns" rather than one liners though.\n\nEDIT: I think INTP's have it too, though you don't run into it as often for various reasons. Any INTP care to weigh in?
8	The only way I can explain it is an odd way, probably: good memory. We've learned over the years by analyzing everything to death and we remember what makes people laugh, or what presses people's buttons. We can recall it quickly give a real stinger or zinger because we've boiled everything down to the core and removed the rest of the BS? 
6	We tend to process events, think them over, come to a conclusion, and categorize them which allows us to access them easier.\n\nFor example, I had the option to either go into a management or a technical career. After pondering it over, I decided to go the technical route because you can tell a computer what to do and it will do it, but if you tell a human what to do they may rebel against you. One day a user was having problems with his computer and he said "Why are computers so frustrating?" I candidly replied "Yeah.. computers are frustrating, but not as frustrating as people." He processed it for a second, smiled bright and thought it was the most brilliant and poetic thing ever.
6	If you talk less you can listen and think more about what your going to say.
6	Sometimes I blurt out one liners and then realize it was kinda brash after people call me out. Most of the time it's funny stuff but other times it's comes off mean, not like I intended.
3	I think what you're seeing is Ni + Ti/Te in action. Ni sees patterns and connections easily and Ti/Te presents it through the lens of the individual. Ofc this comes natural for INTJ's but ISTP's with developed Ni will also do this.
2	I do what I can when I can
3	Why the disliked posts or spam posts never go below 0 votes?	Just curious, maybe we don't have the necessity to "punish" the post or something.
6	75% of the time I forget we can even do that
5	Oh it absolutely goes negative, it just doesn’t display as negative. It’s up to the mods to choose how it’s displayed. Many mods choose to not display negative numbers because it tends to lead to a downvote brigade. A lot of people will see something with heavy downvotes and add to it without even looking at the content. “Everyone’s decided this shit sucks so let me downvote and move on”. But that’s not how we should operate. People are more likely to read and vote appropriately when they don’t see -20. 
5	Computer Science Vs Mechanical Engineering?	Any other ISTPs had to choose between these two fields?
5	Yes and no. I chose ME over CS but ended up in corporate finance. Long story. \n\n\nBut initially I chose ME over CS because my main personal interest was working on cars. So I though ME would be a better fit. Turns out both of them school the same way. 5% hands on, 95% math on paper and computers. It’s just different math lol. \n\n\nEither way, I left engineering because my love was numbers, not designing or building shit. I haven’t finished my degree yet, but when I do, I hope to get into a corporate financial organization role. I’m really good with money in that sense. Business budgeting is my shit. (Can’t handle my own money for shit tho lol. I’m better suited to handle large sums of money that are not related to personal finance.) \n\n\nBut I fulfill my need to work with my hands by working on my cars. I like having it as a hobby and not a job. Well, I do actually do some vehicle maintenance at my job, but my primary position is in the office. I do shop work for extra hourly pay and commission. 
4	Intro to compsci was the most **boring** class I ever took. 110% theory, no practical curriculum. Why should I spend a semester programming in assembly, converting binary to hex, and talking about ipads? Those aren't practical to the idea of getting a degree to work in business. \n\nI was going to get a minor in compsci but after that class I noped out of it. Maybe the later classes would have been more practical but I just didn't care. My professor was head of the department (I think) and I knew this wasn't going to work well for me.
3	I took up Computing (\~Computer Science?)@ uni.   \nUnlike what the other comment said, I didn't have to learn about converting binary to hex (though I've already learned about that in high school, pretty useless, really.) or talking about ipads, or programming in assembly. The first half of the first semester just dive straight in programming in C#. Next is Networking I believe. I've only started learning this September so I can't say much about it, but so far so good. Not too heavy in theory, more about actually get the program running.   \n\n\nPersonally I wouldn't take Mechanical Engineering because I sucked at Math/Physics. You'd have thought Mechanical Engineering is more about getting your hands on parts and assemble stuff but in reality it's quite physics, engineering mathematics heavy. Because of this, I wouldn't choose Mechanical Engineering.
2	Yes, I've been that route. Mechanical was ok, but it almost drove me to the point of hating mechanical things, too much of a mix between clean and dirty (math, integrals and mechanical parts), while I wasn't exactly in the right mental state to be doing school work at the time (tldr), it felt like shorting out wires and blowing fuses in my mind. However, I was still able to program somehow, where I made a program during those days that would sniff out via WiFi which one of my roommates would be home, and made a schedule what time they'd be there so I can avoid them, I just wanted to be left alone. So, I decided to go to a comm college, do computer science, as far as success goes, I'm not looking to jinx anything.
2	Kinda.... may I ask what you plan for your carrer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNowdays I work really close to progamming, but I'm not the hardcore progammer. I do the connection between the business, corporate side to the developers team, mainly accessing how to make the best use case of each technology to improve company results, or to create new products, and I really enjoy it.\n\nI did one year of chemical engineering and dropped because I couldn't see any meaning on the classes, and even when talking to senior students, professors and alumni everything seemed useless.\n\nAfter that I went to a business school, because I decided to get in investment banking (we live in a society where money is all, so this could have more meaning, right?)  I finished, and I enjoyed all the finance subject, but I quit the idea because the work enviroment was not suited for me. Now I work mostly at startups, and I self-taught how to code, and a lot of database technologies, so that's why I'm capable of working in this position I'm now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNowdays, if someone asked me if I wanted to do things different and doing CS. I would refuse because at the business school I learned how to see the world in a very different way, and how it really works. For me almost everything used to be on black or white, and the world is much more complex full of gray scales\n\n&#x200B;
1	I'd choose Mechanical Engineering. You get to build and design physical stuff, whereas in CS, you design and build software. I prefer working with my hands to typing on a computer. 
1	I would go the computer science route if I could do it all over again. I got my degree in economics but I’ve been working in the supply chain industry on the more analytical side of things which I like a lot but I do wish I had chosen computer science. The main reason I didn’t is because I took my first and only course during my final semester. I’ve been teaching myself sql though to fill that void and help with the reporting and analysis I have to do at work. 
1	I always thought robotics would be the coolest thing in the world. I might get into that still as I'm only 21. God I gotta get my life together.
1	I originally wanted to go into CS but since I didn't try hard enough in school my grades in humane subjects like literature were low I my application got denied. \n\nHowever, my mom pushed me to take up ME claiming I have a talent for it. She wasn't wrong, it wasn't instant and my grades are still pretty average but I fell in love with ME.\n\nI think it's different for everyone but tl;dr if you preffer physics (mainly the mechanics part) go into ME and if you like math better go for CS.\n
38	Everything else...	Ever feel like you're either constantly paying attention to everything else and ignoring the one thing you're trying to focus on, or ignoring everything else and paying full 110% attention to the one thing you're trying to focus on?
20	Absolutely. I go through periods of intense focus. Sometimes it’s like hyperawareness where I’m super focused on every surrounding detail. And sometimes I’m completely one track on a project and any other concepts (such as time, hunger, people around me) disappear. \n\n\nSo far I haven’t quite figured out how to purposefully induce either state... they just sorta seem to happen whenever my brain feels like doing it. 
14	I’ll start to look something up, like... how sake is made. Just because I don’t know how they do it, why sake? Idk, just popped in my head. I’ll check on google or YouTube, get distracted, and suddenly I’m halfway through a 20 minute documentary on the Mariana Trench. It may just be an addiction to knowledge or learning. As soon as I see something I know nothing about I’ll get sidetracked pretty easily. I’m constantly reading articles that provide little to no real meaning in my daily life. When I reference them to my wife she’s just blown away that I was trying to figure out how a rotary engine works. I DONT KNOW WHY I NEEDED TO KNOW BUT NOW I DO BABE
7	Yep thats why I have a job that allows me to do many different things. I just schedule everything way out from when its due so I eventually finish everything on time.
4	Yes all the time. If I have something important coming up I'll  start worrying a bunch of stupid things I don't need to do yet as a way to distract myself. It's annoying because I know I'm doing it but I can't stop myself.
3	Yep. 
5	Haha this is really relatable.
3	I can zone out everything in the room if I'm focusing on something specific. It's literally been to the point where a child was banging a spoon up against a bowl in my ear and I didn't notice. Only reason I found out was cause the mother yelled at the child when she noticed... and then explained when I looked at her all confused. But then other times it's like I have ADD.
2	lol yeah
0	ISTP DJ giving constructive criticism	
8	ISTP commitment problem	I've heard lately an opinion, that the commitment problem ISTPs have, is nothing else but "gathering information" as much as possible, before getting into something serious.\n\nWhat do you think of that guys?
16	From personal experience, it's a maturity problem.\n\nIn my younger days, I would often get caught up in analysis paralysis. That is, hard to commit to something because it might not be the optimal solution, or maybe I'll find out later that the other option would have been better. \n\nAs I got older, I stopped giving a crap. "Good enough" is good enough and if things change, I can re-examine later. I don't have time to be stuck in an endless loop anymore.
4	Well one thing to remember is that there are two types of ISTPs: those who use TiSe and those who use TiNi. The commitment problem idea would apply to TiSe ISTPs but TiNi ISTPs have the problem where they skip the auxiliary function and do not gather *enough* information. This is called being in the loop. It really depends on the person. However, the commitment problem would be something that every ESxP has since all they do is gather information. They are very insecure about committing to anything, as their Ni hunch says. Same applies to ENxPs with dominant Ne.
1	I just have wanderlust. I don't like the very *idea* of being tied down to one place. I'm pretty much the guy Gerry Rafferty warns the girl about in "Baker Street" (but you know he'll always keep movin', 'cause he's rollin', he's a rollin' stone...)\n\nLess about gathering information and more about the ISTP penchant for moving on after gathering basic proficiency and not sticking around for full mastery.
5	some useless whining	\[deleted\]
2	I'd argue your sleep problems are actually the root cause of your frustration.\n\nYou really don't need friends. Taking care of yourself should be your #1 priority. Friends are a secondary priority.\n\nStart focusing on solutions. You already know the first solution: regulating your sleep schedule. You need to accept that there's no other way and make it a top priority. I think you'll find a lot of your problems stem from not sleeping enough, because while we sleep our brain sorts through our experiences and memories and clears our mind for us so we can function properly. \n\nWhenever you come across something you dislike, or you find some sort of problem with something, write it down on a notepad or phone, and then later devote some time to reflect on what you've previously written. It's a very effective way to get to the root of problems and makes it extremely easy to identify what to do about it (if anything at all - sometimes it's simply a matter of perspective). It also saves your brain the stress of having these problems constantly building up in your head. It keeps your mind clear and keeps you happy.\n\nAlways stay solution focused as well (not problem focused). Focusing on problems will bring you down, focusing on solutions will bring you up.

9	How to help depressed ISTP	Hey there, a good ISTP friend of mine just told me that he’s been feeling depressed. Before I go all mother hen and release my ESFJ on him, I thought I’d ask you fine people what I can do to help without overwhelming or embarrassing him. 
15	Do you need or want anything repaired or installed? Ask him for help with that but make sure he has enough time after to go to that awesome pho place nearby (or whatever), your treat.  
10	Recognize that sometimes its an emotional processing issue. And it sucks because if it is the case, then theres nothing you can do but offer hugs and comfort-- and do offer hugs and comfor gently either. ISTP's are hyperspecific people, so handle him like he's a hyper specific case: By going in and listening to him to the best of your ability, and asking questions with good intentions to gain more information, and more listening.\n\nWe seldom talk about ourselves and personally I always find it easier to talk about myself when I know someone genuinely wants to hear the answer. You can remind him of that-- that you care and that you want to listen and you want to hear what he has to say, his words are important- in order to get him to open up a little bit more.\n\nUnlike feelers, we really are not good at knowing how we feel. Our own emotions can be an enigma to us, and so it takes time to process them. I know that sometimes ive been depressed because i was upset, but couldn't figure out why or in what way i was upset. Other times i was depressed because I was burying my emotions too well and needed to think about them a little in order to figure it out-- Yes, thinking about our emotions doesnt come naturally or easily. Weird concept, i know.\n\nMost often as an ISTP I'm depressed because I've convinced myself that everyone hates me, or that no one likes me, or can love me, even though I know from past experiences that thats not true. Faith is not something I think we have an easy time cultivating. When talking to him, give him Reasons to believe what you say, give him evidence and stuff like its a debate, dont just say you'll pray for him or keep him in your thoughts or say you HOPE he gets better. The more tangible, proven, and Real you can make your support, via action and sincerity, the more convincing you will be. Just tread lightly. There are times when I have completely wanted, wished, for someone to prove me and all my depressing thoughts wrong and fight me on it. There are other times when I just wished someone would shut the fuck up because nothing they were saying was true and would help-- usually when someone is feeding me more personal beliefs that dont help anyone but themselves, rather than facts.\n\nJust listen to him and his cues and watch for his signs. Ask questions, dont be afraid to be blunt. Treat him as his own case, and remember not all the advice here may work.
5	I try to get him to do stuff he enjoys. All the talking in the world doesn't seem to help my husband, it just wears on him. If it is related to a problem that can be corrected, you can suggest going about that, but sounding like a motivational poster (you're a good person, people love you,  you're stronger than you think, etc) isn't going to work in my experience. (Actual ISTPs, correct me if I'm wrong in your case). \n\nAnd yes vitamin D does make a difference for my husband too. 
9	he's hopeless. let him fester in solitude and existential angst until he attains enlightenment.
5	I echo the "make him know he's important to you" angle. But unless you are a doctor or psychiatrist, it's probably best to be left to the professionals. You may be able to play the "fixer" angle -- we love to fix things, so pique his interest in "fixing" the problem with the best available tools (doctors) -- which also piques his ISTP efficiency tendency (why bother with things that won't work when you can just go right to the fix).\n\nI'm always nervous about saying this is true for all ISTPs, but it's true for me: feeling like you aren't cared about is a spiral that's really hard to get out of. If you make the effort to show him you care, it could go a long way to get out of the funk.
3	I like to grab my istp's booty and make sure to have all his favorite foods handy. Surprises they will actually enjoy also helps. This can be food.\nDefinitely hold off on the Hallmark card approach. No "live, laugh, love" speeches. Actually, no talking is preferred. 
2	Physical activity. Working out, going on a hike, taking some kind of class. Doesn't have to be crazy or intense.
2	work out together! it will get him out of the house and it is something that does not require a conversation between you two. 
2	Do something extreme with him.  Adrenaline always helps.  The more the merrier.  Extreme sports are great.  Its coming in to winter, try backcountry skiing/snowboarding.  Or just a local rock gym if that's easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr just get him into an environment totally unfamiliar, like a dance, marshal arts, or pottery class.  Aim for something with both physical and mental challenges that reminds him of the joys of figuring out unknowns.
1	Just let him know that he means something important to you.  I'd talk about "the depression" rather than talking about *him* if that makes sense.\n\nRemind him (and yourself) that a healthy outlook requires nutrition via a functioning brain, and Vitamin D especially for us people who get little sun and too much screen time.  Some 5-HTP (to boost serotonin recovery) or a multivitamin may be all that he needs.  Often, when depression seems to come on without cause, it's because of a deficiency in nutrients and neurotransmitter activity as a result.  It's that time of year with less sunlight and less outdoors activities, but D supplements or a tanning session can really restore mood if there's nothing eating him.
24	ISTPs, what’s your greatest weakness?	Asking for life’s growth perspective.

56	I have obsessive phases where I find a new thing and get extremely immersed in it. Then I quickly move on after I feel like I have even the slightest level of competency in it. It sucks because I learn something new, feel accomplished, then no longer feel the need to continue on with said activity.

3	Metaphorically spitting in the face of people who tried to help you out because you're too selfish and socially awkward to realize what kind of effect your actions can have on others.\n\nI'm in the military so my SNCO (boss) has went out of her way to vouch for me when my most senior leadership basically called me a shitbag (he's not really wrong though). Through her guidance, I pretty much became a star in the unit and was promoted to Sergeant. But due to the fact that I hate being in the military, dislike my job and having only a few months left on my contract, I just became a shitbag and took advantage of a lot of things at work. It eventually caught up to me and now due to a recent incident, I'm in a whole lot of shit. Today, she told me how disappointed she was in me and how I basically spat in her face. She's still willing to give me advice even in spite if my actions, so I just kinda feel ashamed of myself. Not gonna lie though, I'm still gonna look out for myself even if others aren't really pleased with my actions or decisions. But, I kinda wish I took more time to really consider how others feel, thinking things through and not acting impulsively, and relying on others to help me out. Although I'm proud of my stubbornness and my free-spirit, sometimes that shit just backfires on you, y'know.

3	Girls with knee high socks or stockings, would gladly sell my soul for that
4	I do not have any, I am a God.
1	shiny things. and  shoes. makeup... clothes. I just like to spend my  money, lol. But it is why I enjoy being single and no kids...I can buy all the bullshit I want. 
1	My tendency to have my relationships instantly accelerate to 100 mph before I (and she) know we can safely operate at that speed.\n\nIt tends to crash and burn in the first corner.
1	Planning anything at all
1	Going to the gym. \n\n\nFocusing. 
1	Bullets

5	It's 2am and I'm drinking an increasingly incredible "Folk Metal" beer from Burlington Beer Company. So sure, let's give this a shot. \n\n1. What's your favorite color? **Blue**\n1. Where are you from? **Vermont, USA**\n1. Ugly and live forever, or attractive and die in a year? **Depends, is "live forever" until the end of time, including floating in space after the Earth no longer exists? If I can chose to die, then the former. If not, the latter.**\n1. Who is your hero? **Dunno, maybe Tim McIlrath or Mike Shinoda?**\n1. If you could live anywhere, where would it be? **Where I am now, in Vermont. I've already lived in Barcelona and Cluj-Napoca, and I'll move on from VT soon enough.**\n1.

What is your favorite thing about your career? **That it has a fantastic balance between mental challenge, variety, stress, and compensation.**\n1. What is your biggest complaint about your job? **It takes a LOT of mental energy and I usually don't have any left for other aspects of my life.**\n1. What is your proudest accomplishment? **Either living in Europe or being able to keep myself in good physical shape.**\n1. What is your child's proudest accomplishment? **N/A**\n1.

Which would you rather do: wash dishes, mow the lawn, clean the bathroom, or vacuum the house? **They're all kind of the same to me. Depends which needs to be done the most.

It's a camping pillow.**\n1. Do you collect anything? **Athletic shirts, not by choice though.**\n1. Do you work out? **Yes. Climbing gym, bodyweight exercises, free weights, and hiking/running. Staying in shape is one of my main hobbies.**\n1. Favorite childhood memory? **Ignoring all the other kids on the bus throwing shade at each other and reading fantasy novels. I was not picked on at school, at least not that I remember. I'm not sure why I wasn't, because I was never popular or athletic and I'm pretty awkward, but I think I understood quickly that if bullies don't get a rise out of you, they'll probably leave you alone.**\n\nWhew. There goes 20 mins. Why did I do that?
1	1. Moderately dark grey.\n2. CA\n3. the latter option.\n4. I don't know. Albert Einstein, I guess?\n5. Taiwan or Hong Kong.\n6. Arguing with stupid or ignorant people, I guess? Not in an introspective mood right now. \n7. I'm not sure. \n8. Not in an introspective mood. \n9. Stupid people that think they're smart. "You are not entitled to your opinion, you are entitled to your educated opinion." -Harlan Ellison\n10.  Intellectually stimulating, novel, or interesting topics. \n11.  I don't need to have a job.\n12. Being a student sucks. \n13. Don't really have anything worth talking about. \n14. N/A\n15. I've read too many to choose. Perhaps Flatland and Sphereland together?\n16. Again, not in an introspective mood. \n17. Avengers Infinity War. Finally one where the "villain" wins. I believe Thanos had a justified reason and a solution, while the former Avengers are just trying to stop him without having an alternate and superior solution themselves. He identified a problem, and created a solution, though less than ideal. However, unless you have a better one, don't fuck with the solution that's already in place. Identifying the issue is good and all, but talk is cheap. Thanos "walked his talk," so to speak. He identified an immediate issue, and created an immediate solution.  Morality is petty, and subjective. It is far too unreliable to use as a judge. \n18. Mechanical engineer.\n19. N/A\n20. I'm not sure, too much to choose from and not enough information to pass judgement. \n21.  I don't really watch sports. I do exercise, but I don't do sports.\n22.  Bike.\n23.  "All You Need is Hate" by the Delgados. \n24. I don't listen to the radio. \n25. How is this relevant?\n26. Yes. It's Chinese, so I doubt you would understand it.\n27. None. I'm a back sleeper, and I like having my back straight. \n28.  Memories, thoughts, and information. \n29. Not seriously, mostly just to keep myself from getting too fat. \n30.  I'm not sure. \n\nThis took way too long to fill out.

1	Sure, I got a few minutes to avoid doing what I'm supposed to be doing...\n\n1. Dark blue, especially when paired with silver as in my alma mater's colors (Nevada-Reno)\n2. Originally? Boston, Massachusetts, but now make my home in Seattle.\n3. Ugly and forever. I must be travelin' on now, 'cause there's too many places I have to see.\n4. George S. Patton.\n5. The heart of a girl I loved and lost a couple years back. She was one of the few ever to breach my castle's walls emotionally.\n6. The only thing bigger than my fear of a "The Stand"-like global pandemic is being one of the survivors. Living in a wasted post-apocalypse after watching everyone I cared about die...not good.\n7. One where I get to stay home.\n8. I wish I was better at communicating my emotions with people. I tend to date INFx women and I know how much it hurts them (seeing them cry; dead giveaway) when they feel like they can't reach me.\n9. Single easiest way to piss me off is to waste my time.\n10. Food. And my ability to pay for some to eat.\n11. I get to work at home in a quiet space. I hate offices.\n12. The pay is shit.\n13. The time Teddy Atlas gave me a shout-out on ESPN's Friday Night Fights show. Compared me to Ray Arcel (Roberto Duran's trainer.)\n14. I'll let you know as soon as some woman's insane enough to let me get her pregnant.\n15. It's between "Guns, Germs, and Steel" (Jared Diamond) and "Ball Four" (Jim Bouton.)\n16. A good NBA meme. Or great sex. I always get giggly after great sex.\n17. It's been years...maybe American Hustle? Or the Monuments Men? I dated a girl who liked movies, like, five years ago.\n18. I wanted to be a sportscaster. Sean McDonough had my dream job when he was the PBP guy for the Red Sox.\n19. A person who exists in reality and not just some future fantasy with a romantic interest.\n20. Be God. I figure I could make some helpful modifications to the world from up there.\n21. Basketball is my favorite sport. I like the way they dribble up and down the court.\n22. I'm scared shitless of horses and have awful balance. I'm safest in the car.\n23. "Turn the Page" by Bob Seger. I can hit the notes.\n24. I just stick it on the classic rock station in whatever city I'm in.\n25. Wash dishes. Seems the shortest task.\n26. Most nicknames people come up with for me are just variations on my actual name. "Fantastic Mr. Fox" I get a lot.\n27. 2. A firm one for support and a soft one for comfort.\n28. Disgruntled ex-girlfriends who call me their greatest regret.\n29. Nah. I just walk everywhere to get my exercise.\n30. The time I messed around and got a triple-double in a pickup basketball game. It was a good day.

6	What's your opinion on relationships?	Do you plan on finding one? Are you engaged? Do you have a lover? Do you simply hate them yet you have needs? \n\n&#x200B;
46	I want one, but I want to skip right to the part where I'm already in a comfortable relationship and bypass the whole "meeting new people" thing.  
16	well for what it's worth tomorrow im gonna face my fears and talk to a girl in my class
4	I’ve always been in LTRs since I was 15, with the exception of the past few months. I’m 24. \n\nI like being in a relationship, but I have a tendency to get overly caught up in relationships at the expense of my other interests, friends, and responsibilities. Right now I have no desire to get into a relationship, but after 9 years of back to back serious relationships, I don’t think it’s all that strange. I’m sure that’ll change in a few months though lol.\n\nI miss the sex and companionship and having someone to go on adventures with all the time, but I’m enjoying getting to do my own thing without having to worry about another person all the time.\n\nI do want to get married and have kids one day.
3	Horrible, avoid them at all costs. Life is much better doing so.
3	I was always in a relationship without as much as a six month break from age sixteen til about two years ago. \n\nI would like to have another one at some point, but I’ve been burned pretty hard so I’m taking an indefinite break. \n\nCasual sex has been fun, but it isn’t as fulfilling. But it’s fun for now. 
2	I’ll be moving in two months or so, so I’m not actively looking for anything serious right now. When I settle down on my new home though, I would like to find a girl and start a serious relationship with her. Last romantic “relationship” I was in was with a very unhealthy girl, and while I don’t regret it (mostly), it’s something I would definitely not want to experience ever again. I will admit, however, that it left me a lot of valuable lessons on what signs to avoid before getting into a relationship and how to establish healthy limits and boundaries during one.\n\nI think having a healthy romantic partner, with mutual respect, trust, and boundaries would help both parts be happy together and help each other grow. 
2	I'm straddling the line between wanting a LTR and wanting to be singld my entire life to work on my own pursuits.
2	I want one, but the fact that I haven't stayed in the same city for more than 2 years due to studies and exchange program and that I don't know which city, or even country, I will end up staying in the future makes me not want to bother at all. Moreover, I haven't been in any relationship since I was born, which is 20 years already, so a few more years properly won't make much differences
1	It’s hard as my mind is seemingly wired against romance. I’m hopefully, ardently getting closer with an INTP, though. He’s like the lightest anchor to my aimless, freedom-seeking nature. Yes, I can drag him into whatever interesting things reality presents to me. Also, he has a world of hobbies to enjoy on his own. We’re more partners than lovers. 
1	If you want more relationship advice, you could try /r/mbtirelationships!
1	I'm single and commitment-averse, but I also have a way higher need for affection and comfort than most ISTPs.\n\nSo I guess I fit into that last category. I could do without the "relationship" stuff and just take the cuddling and sex and flirty conversation (but don't want something as casual as an FWB. It's a conflict.)
1	don’t get into one just to get into the one. i’ve had a lot of opportunities to get into relationships with people, but i hit a point where i realized that i shouldn’t commit myself to something i don’t even feel that strongly about. i haven’t felt that strongly about anyone ever so it’s been a single couple years, but it doesn’t mean down the road i won’t. \n\n(i’m single but i tend to flirt with more guys and start backing out once things get serious)
0	I'm too awkward to just go out and have sex with girls. I don't want to have to use my Fe. I have fallen in love many times though. Quite a few girlfriends, but they all left me eventually. I don't think it's necessarily that I was a bad person but they just got bored. People only ever want to be love high, but the infatuation never lasts. They don't actually want to develop a long-term companionship. I don't exactly know what I want anymore. I guess I'll just let it happen if it happens. I doubt I'd miss having sex either. Porn is just as satisfying as sex. And I wouldn't want to get anyone pregnant, so being alone is a plus, since I don't like wearing condoms.  \nIf I were to start another relationship, I'd allow us both to have sex with other people. Maybe. I still haven't reconciled the fact that you get bored of being with the same person for a while and the fact that you get jealous even after many years in a relationship. Maybe the jealousy is something you need to work on... I have no idea. Sex and relationships are a love/hate thing.
0	Happily married to an INFP in a fully committed, nonmonogamous (open) relationship. Best of both worlds.
0	Physical stimulation all the time and maybe some variety. I guess open relationship is a perfect case.
6	Is this ISTP interested in me? (from an INFP)	Prepare yourselves people, because this is going to be long post.\n\nI'm a lost INFP trying to understand whether my crush(?) (a male ISTP) is interested in me or not.\n\nFrom the moment I first saw him at school (which was about 2.5 years ago) I knew that he was the most interesting person I was ever going to be meeting. Since we had very much in common, we instantly grew closer over a really short amount of time. I was realizing that he was always distant with other people (especially other girls), and other than me, there were only 2-3 more people who he could talk freely with. Since we were both residential students in our school, we occasionally started to meet up (mostly late at night) just to chat about random stuff. We most of the time stayed up till past midnight- and the conversation with him always seemed "endless". We would start chatting from general school stuff and the conversation would always get intense and we would start debating over stuff such as our favorite type of porn or the meaning of existence. I knew from what other people said or from some observation that he was usually a reserved person, usually spend time alone in the dormitory rather than hanging around people and often decline their invitations for going out, however, whenever I called him to hang out he always immediately appeared next to me. It was usually me who initiated our meetings, but he never seemed to dislike the idea of spending time with me. Anyway after 1 year, he became one of my best friends as nothing has barely changed between us. I was pretty much adoring him (I was in love with his personality and how he saw things as simple problems to solve in life, rather than having emotional meltdowns over them as I do). \n\nAs an INFP, I fall for people quite quickly, so whenever I had a new "crush" I would always talk with him, and he would be pretty chill about it (as he is with pretty much everything) - analysing the guy, determining whether he was good enough for me etc. Whenever one of my friends joked about him having a crush on me and secretly feeling sad about me crushing on other people, he would usually laugh and change the subject. So here is me, 7 months later, haven't crushed on someone for a VERY long time, unable to get "him" out of my head ever since. I know it sounds wrong since we have been close friends for over 1.5 years before I started to develop a crush over him- but for some reason, I cannot help it.\n\nOne other key detail about him is that he hates physical contact, but he always hugs me back whenever I hug him- and he held my hand on several occasions (I'm probably the only girl he has ever done this with), and placed his head on my chest while allowing me to play with his hair (he has very pretty curly hair UwU) \n\nSo yeah, maybe I'm just INFP-ing over a guy who only sees me as a close friend, but I'm pretty sure that I'm the only girl who he has a very close relationship of this kind. Are there any specific "methods" or "key details" that I can use to understand whether he is interested in me or not? Because I do not plan going and directly asking it to him any time soon considering that it could ruin our friendship and make him vanish away if he sees me as only as a friend.\n\nIf you read this unnecessarily long post, I thank you very much & apologize for errors in the grammar since English is not my native language. \n\nTL;DR: I have a close ISTP friend for 2.5 years from school whom I am starting to develop feelings over, and I am wondering if he is feeling the same way about me or not. I'm probably the girl he has the closest relationship with in his life & we get on really well, but I have mentioned him about my past crushes on a few instances (when I wasn't developing feelings for him) and he was pretty chill about them. \n\n&#x200B;
14	Yeah he likes you 
8	I think he likes you, but that doesn't mean he will know how to tell you that or act how YOU understand when someone likes you. \n\nWhat's your goal?\n
5	Honestly he probably likes you but he’s just as afraid as you of saying it out loud because he’s afraid he’ll ruin the relationship (assuming he doesn’t know you like him back, something we’re generally clueless about). Look, if he’s not going to say anything anytime soon, you might as well ask him. Either he likes you back and then y’all date and be happy together or he doesn’t like you back and be chill about it. I mean, it’s clear you are an important person in his life, so even if he doesn’t like you back he won’t cut you out or make things weird if you don’t make them weird yourself. \n\nTL;DR: go for it and good luck, if it comes to the worst you’ll still have him as a friend.
4	He likes you, but that fucker might never ever admit it. See his actions first, not whatever he might probably say, most might just probably be said in passing, or what faces he'll be making that simply don't mean anything at all.\n\nTell him next time you meet, "Hello, my super crush". And then laugh and squish yourself after, showing a big dumb smile on your face. It'll work.
3	just ask, even if he ends up not liking you back, more than likely, he’ll disregard it or only bring it up as a joke later when you’ve moved on. \n\nbut just so you know, even if he’s interested, there’s no guarantee he would want to be with you or further your relationship. he might just want to stay where you guys are now and wait for the feelings to fade out. 
3	Whenever I have a crush on a girl I won’t make the first move. I will become great friends and become very close and hope they make the first move. Even if it takes 3 years and me helping them through 3 other relationships. 
3	Just ask him. We do well with blunt honesty and its really the best way to go with us. If he values you, and if he's worth anything, he wont let it ruin anything between you if he doesn't reciprocate it. 
3	Way too much text for this ISTP to read.\n\nDoes he like you? Ask. Best way to find out. But that makes people nervous, so how to tell without asking: does he spend time and effort on you? Does he make an attempt to remember things you said you liked and try to connect with you over it? I'm talking beyond smalltalk. This is incredibly difficult and not innate for us (I assume, could just be me though), so if he makes the effort, it means he likes you.\n\nOur likes aren't always a romantic like, however. I think you're gonna have to ask to figure that one out. It's possible he doesn't even know if he likes you romantically or just as a friend.
1	You can also try /r/mbtirelationships for further advice! 
8	Falling under pressure	I am an ISTP. However, I can't thrive under pressure. Am I still ISTP?
14	You mean pressure from like public speaking or such? ISTP workflow is basically putting something off until pressured to finish, then releasing a massive burst of energy into your work.
3	I don't really do well with stress. If I can't find any logical way out of a situation I break down and my mind just shuts off. But pressure on the other hand can be a motivation for me to work harder like an upcoming deadline.\n\nIt's things like not being able to afford bills and shit that get to be because you can't just "work harder" and expect money you don't have to just appear.
1	I thrive under pressure, but recently my MB type has shifted from ISTP to INTJ. I mercilessly break things down and analyze them until I find a solution. It’s not about working harder, but smarter. Sometimes working smarter means you need to put in extra hours.\n\nI dunno OP. Some ISTPs are more adapt at working with pressure. 
1	You just have a smaller breaking point. As you get older and experience more life, it’ll become harder to hit than breaking point. In HS, I did not do well with pressure. I would crack, especially in sports. \n\n\nNow? Now I do my best Work under pressure. But I’ve got a lot more useful experience to come up with solutions. 
1	Would join three sports: cross country, wrestling and basketball. In wrestling, my best friends told me to imagine that my opponent did something to piss me off. Didn't work, so I just started doing the best I can. Don't need pressure or bs. Just dew it
0	Can ISTPs be into the occult and stay ISTP?	Are we supposed to be technicians to the point of disregarding superstitious beliefs?\n\nI read somewhere that we are inclined to consult fortune tellers under stress. 
13	I'd never consider consulting a fortune teller. That would be akin to believing in Star signs. It's about as b.s. as you can get.
8	Its not a secret club with strict requirements. MBTI isnt even hard science in the first place. Dont try to conform to the idea of "What an ISTP should be".
18	I don’t think your religious/spiritual beliefs have much of anything to do with MBTI and rather more to do with experience and nurture.\n\nI was born and raised Christian. A fear of hell and tremendous guilt tortured me mentally until I was about 22. I was not a good Christian. I did what I wanted, what felt natural. This lead to the tremendous guilt. I cared not for church or scriptures. I just tried to be a good person but was constantly told that was not enough.\n\nWhen I was 14, a friends father showed me documentaries and videos to basically destroy my faith out of spite. It succeeded. It was tremendously uncomfortable for me. Reason being: my fear and nurture was telling me I would go to hell. My brain was telling me there were too many fallacies and inconsistencies.\n\nI fell away until 21. Re converted via a horrid near death experience. I knew I was going to die and the fear caused me to re convert to avoid hell. Then came a year of day and night studying scriptures and once again I found many fallacies and inconsistencies but this time my brain ruled. I believe this was because this time I was mature enough and ready to ask uncomfortable questions. Before it had been forced on me.\n\n I studied Hebrew and noticed in Genesis that Elohim the word we used for God was plural. The Gods hovered above the waters and made earth. I read about the Chaldean Genesis.\n\nThe religion transformed from Polytheism, to Henotheism, to Monotheism, to Dualism, to Dualistic Soteriology from Genesis to Revelation. I studied the history behind the books and religion. Books like Enoch. The first and second temple period which lead to me studying more religions.\n\n This was all necessary to free my mind from illogical fear.\n\nToday I am spiritual in a sense. I believe in nature. There is some sort of God force but it’s not a man. It’s 2 opposing ideals. That there is chaos and order. A sort of balance needs to be struck between the two. And that chaos is aggression that needs to be opposed. Order is natural peace. You want to be at one with the peace. That’s the basis of every religion. Christians want the Christ within, Buddhists seek enlightenment, Hindus (Sanātana Dharma) seek to be one with Dharma. Just different names and filters for the same exact message: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Be a good person. Do the right thing because it’s the right thing to do.\n\nOur Tertiary Ni can give us a spiritual side. How you choose to use that is your business.\n\nI used a lot of Ti to come to the spiritual conclusions that finally brought me peace.\n\nTo me it’s all metaphors to explain the hard truths of life. Pagan religions use anthropomorphism to describe the elements as Gods. Dualistic religions try to explain good and evil.\n\nI came to the conclusion that there is no devil. The truth is worse. The devil is us, inside us. We are the ones that cause evil. But we can also cause good. We have to actively choose to be better than the devil inside. Order and chaos. Wisdom and ignorance.
5	There is value in divination, but not because it’s supernatural. It is a method to access your total self, rather than your normal ego consciousness alone. \n\nThat said - going to a fortune teller wouldn’t qualify. 
2	Personally I don't see why not, to an extent. We're not exactly the types to be blindly, devotedly into anything.
2	My question to you: why being an ISTP and be curious about something that is not logical seems to bother you?\n\nIf is something your mind caught your attention and you're learning new things, go and have some fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOvertime probably you'll start to be more critical  about this subject due to our strong Ti, and moving along to other interests, but it was a unique experience that you passed, just for that I guess it worth it\n\nI don't know what caught your attention for the occult, but just be careful to not being scammed, and I said all this assuming no animals or humans will be hurt in the process ;)
1	Yes. Even when youre at your WTF years and/or running on shadow functions, youre still an ISTP, albeit, an unhealthy one.
1	Yes, its not typical but I think it has something to do with our tertiary Ni. 
1	ITT: delusion.
1	Sure. You would stay ISTP even if you are in coma. Even there you will try to find useful solutions and figure out mechanisms.
-1	I am an ISTP, who is now testing consistently as an INTJ, which is even more ruthlessly analytic. I dabble in the occult and what-not. Nothing wrong with it as long as you can leverage some reasonable expectations from it and make “sense” of it.
32	Emotional people are the worst. (Me bitching)	Tbh... i used to think that i should try and be nice. That i should make sure i dont hurt anyone's feelings, that i should be considerate. I thought that I was the jerk. That i needed to be less of a dick...\nBut feelers are just as bad (if not worse) as us. They are selfish, self righteous, intrusive, and closed minded. I am brash and rude sometimes, but i always give people the benefit of the doubt as much as possible, whereas they just blatantly judge people they've never met. I like things to be FAIR, all they care about is making sure that everyone is following their subjective morallity. They have absolutely no big picture mentality, and the worst part is, they think theyre "deep" and "insightful". Omg give me a fucking break. Grow a pair of balls and admit that you lie to people because you're afraid, not because you want to "protect them".\n\nOk I'm done.
21	> I like things to be FAIR, all they care about is making sure that everyone is following their subjective morallity.\n\nFairness is a subjective morality.
6	If they need to grow a pair of balls just to admit to lying,\n\nWhat do they need to grow in order to tell the truth and honesty instead?
10	I empathize your experience.\n\nPrinciples of live and let live, or other similar golden rule stuff is pretty common amongst ISTPs with exceptions. \n\nPeople are what they do, not what they claim to be.\n\nBut sometimes you meet with people you spoke off, whose understanding and reasoning of the world just clashes: they claim to be one thing but their actions does not correspond, or its totally impractical. \n\nI guess if we are to reason their behaviour in terms of mbti, they have less awareness of reality? Probably. If so hopefully they grow out of it.\n\nEmotionally mature with good wit people are a godsend. My grandmother is one, and it's people like these who makes you believe that humanity can survive.
4	Right on all accounts. You are painfully aware of emotions including you own. They will continue to make you uncomfortable, especially when they seem manipulative. It helps to accept emotions as a fact, messy and sometimes hurtful. Showing compassion even if you don't feel it helps the emotion resolve and let's the offending human get back to being reasonable more quickly.\n\nI literally am offended when people share their feelings with me. I work very hard to maintain my balance and I don't understand why they would not. Fact is, the crazies gravitate to us for our stability.\n\nFigure out how to teach people to manage the feelings or isolate yourself. That's how to be happy. 
4	Speaking in absolutes loses credibility. I have known thinkers and feelers who are selfish and closed minded etc.  Big picture mentality is usually something attributed to the N/S divide rather than thinking or feeling but all types are capable of it. Also I know thinkers who lie because they don't want the hassle of emotional response. 
4	I just got back from an extremely emotional conversation with a feeler and it's nice to see someone else going through the same struggle. Emotional outbursts override all logic and I'm clueless on how to deal with them effectively. Sometimes I get the impression that feelers just use weaponized emotion to impose their will and get what they want. \n\nI feel like emotions in others (and myself) have more significance when you feel like you're unprepared to cope with them. If I had the ability to cope with them better I could probably spend that energy on pursuits that matter.
8	lmao but really, this is hella accurate. idk why this whole sub isn’t applauding you. 
5	>  They are selfish, self righteous, intrusive, and closed minded\n\nBut also\n\n> but i always give people the benefit of the doubt \n\nChecks out?
2	I completely share this viewpoint. I do think I've been kind of blind to the other social ques and red flags that emotional awareness can bring, and i know sometimes it can be better to rely on those than just logic and facts (especially if youre a woman) but i really agree with fairness and the desire to be reasonable and act on facts, not feelings. \n\nIdk why the people below are being such fucking assholes to you
5	I completely disagree with pretty much everything you wrote.\n\nYou sound very young.  Maybe i sounded like that before.\n\n
1	Good rant! 
1	i remember when i was like 10 i'd probably qualify as a feeler, however, i guess some things you just grow out of.
1	> you're afraid, not because you want to "protect them".\n\nI'll have to remember that one. Yeah .... most NFs / SFJs are trash, SFPs are alright. Kinda prune them out from your life.
1	damn you have 5 accounts?
8	Apparently I'm judgemental?	Many articles and websites say that ISTPs are not judgemental, and I agree since I don't really make horrid judgements about people internally. But apparently an acquaintance thinks that I look at her in a judgemental manner, and a friend told me that I'm a judgemental person. \n\nAre you judgemental and misunderstood?
23	“Look at her in a judgmental manner”\n\nYou need to get this person out of your life. People who complain that you look at them wrong are dangerous. Men who do it can get physically dangerous, women tend to destroy you behind your back by using mutual friends or what not.\n
7	We may not be judging as in how mbti defines.\n\nBut at least for me. With our Se function I use gather information, and read a person.  With Ti, I naturally  end up classifying how the person might behave. \nSo in certain ways I'm judging them, but I hardly externalize this to anyone to avoid this kind of comment
5	Well how judgmental you are doesn't really have much to do with MBTI. When it comes to our judging functions we just have Ti and Fe. We may repress the Fe social rules to stay true to our Ti principles but that doesn't mean we are necessarily judgmental. 
4	People are just really insecure and pathetic and think anytime you look at them you're judging them. 
5	everyone is
3	Some people think that if you are not emotional enough they should help you feel. \n\nSome people are jealous of you emotional balance. \n\nSometime people say crap like this to see if they can get a rise out of you, and when they fail to do so, they end up losing you. Because you don't need that level of crazy in your life. 
3	A friend is like this with me too. But that's only because I call her out on her bullshit all the time, or if she's insisting on her illogical ideas
1	Ugh used to have a customer like this. She only read these Christian books (not religious texts) with pictures of a bloody Jesus crucified on them and wore a probably 2-3 inch crucifix around her neck. If you so much as glanced at either she would go off on you about how you were prejudiced. I think she just wanted to start fights. Wrote nasty reviews online about a bunch of places too got my coworker in one of them.\n\n I avoid these people at all costs. Any judgement they sense from me is based purely off prior interactions with them. 
1	I guess our stare may be quite uncomfortable for most people, the blank and lifeless eyes. Yes, people will assume that you are judgemental, if it really bothers you, do not come so intense.
7	Getting over/out-of Ti-Ni Loop. WTF years x2. ?	I'm in my WTF years for a second time in my life and I don't know how to get out. 28yo\n\nI don't understand how Se can help us make decisions or propel us in any way. When I read about Se and how it works, I don't understand how it practically does anything for you except make you more aware of the physical world around you and your sensations. It's basically primal awareness. \n\nI crave energy and intensity but I have neither and I'm really not interested in any physical activity I can think of. I work out but that's it. I'm just bored out of my mind, over analyzing, doing nothing, stuck. I've tried, skateboarding, rock climbing, martial arts (Was fun but too expensive and time consuming), soccer, hiking, biking etc. The thing I enjoy the most is competitive gaming because it hits all the markers but its also completely useless, I'm too old to make a career out of it and honestly it's too sedentary. And the skill doesn't translate to anything at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've gotten into music on and off my whole life and if I could afford lessons I probably would do that more. I want to earn more money so I can afford to have fun and live life but I also have no energy or interest in any career what so ever so I'm just hopping from job to job. Overall, I'm just Apathetic towards everything and I can't figure out how to get out of it.\n\nPlease help.\n\n&#x200B;
9	Sounds more like depression than WTF years
2	Try lying on your bed, face up, breath deeply five times or so, quiet your mind just enough to relax, no worries if you keep having thoughts here and there.\nBy now you should feel the sensation of good 'apathy'.\nIt is patience.\n\n If you cultivate it, you will recall how to stay patient when apathy strikes, easing your feelings. \n\nIn the one hand it is easy to achieve, just do nothing you know, in the other hand you have to actually cultivate it to make it work. 
2	I have a lot of ISTP’s in my life, one thing that you could try is lending your SE to a friend/family member/stranger. I love when my ISTP’s ask me for help w anything. SE is my trickster and they give me honest feedback about literally anything (typically workout form, also home aesthetics/maintenance, any activity I’d like fun competition or critiquing on). Or check out Tom Bilyeu’s podcast. I heard he’s an ISTP.  
-1	If you’re anything at all like me you just need to get laid. 
13	DAE Have an istp parent (as an istp child) who is upset with you ?	My father (an istp as well) always tries to give me wisdom he's acrued throughout his life. I am 17, so I'm only in like phase 1/2 of my istp development, whereas he's well done with phase 3 so he is quite sociable etc... He always tries to get me to be outgoing or to do things the way he thinks is best. Since we have the same thought process, whenever I disagree with him I usually think I am right and don't listen to him. When istps try to mentor and it is not recepted well, usually dislike is directed towards the student. This is made clearer in C.S. Joseph's ISTP Virtues vs. Vice video (https://youtu.be/6QLmKIXb1ho) where he even says it can be possible to where the istp can dislike their children or feel like they're failing them because they're not receptive. I'm wondering if this is relatively common and if so what are some ways I can reduce the tension and show him it's not personal and he should not be hurt.
7	Hello me and my dad. \n\n\nBut no really though, you’re spot on. The one crucial thing that he forgot while parenting me was that *he learned it all on his own*. He grew up with very little parental assistance. He is where he is now because he had to figure everything out for himself. Life lessons are cemented when you experience them, not when you’re told them. \n\n\nSo all of these life lessons he was trying to shove down my throat were useless to me. A good chunk of them *were* right and very good advice. But the problem is, his word isn’t good enough. When I am making my life choices for my life, I need to know that what I’m doing is what I need to do. Not what somebody else told me to do. I needed to be able to have freedom to learn those lessons on my own. If I can’t figure something out, I have no problem asking for advice. But before that point, I have to try it myself. \n\n\nHe is the way he is because of his past. He wouldn’t be the man he is today if he didn’t learn his lessons the way he did. So if he wants me to end up like him, he needs to let me live, make mistakes, and learn lessons on my own. Being spoon fed lessons with no current practical application is hard to receive as an ignorant child/teen. When you can’t fully grasp why it’s important, it’s hard to view it as important and apply it. You can’t give advice to a teenager like you would an adult. They don’t have enough life experience to understand it. \n\n\nSo I spent most of my younger years listening to other people and ignoring them. The mistake my underdeveloped brain made was forgoing the good advice. When all I wanted to do was figure it out on my own, I shunned advice I was given. And I almost wouldn’t do it because it wasn’t my idea. And I needed to figure it out myself. But now that I’m experiencing life and cementing growth on my own exploration of life, I finally feel at peace. There’s no constant turmoil. I’m finally learning how to be a person. Everything I’ve learned means so much more to me because I got it on my own. The sense of pride I feel digging myself out of the deep pit I was in is immense. I didn’t do it alone, but I’m proud of myself for knowing what I can figure out on my own and what I need help for. It’s the sense of self awareness and understanding the extent of my capabilities. So even though many people played a role, I’m proud of myself for knowing when to *let* them. \n\n\nTo handle this with my dad though, I financially separated myself. I made it so that I relied on him for nothing. And at that point I basically told him “you have two choices. Accept me for who I am, regardless of how you feel about my life, or I can walk out that door and you’ll never see me again. I’m finally happy with where my life is going. If you can’t get on board with it, I’m going on without you.” I made it clear that he has no power anymore. And if he wants me in his life, he needs to let me live the life I choose to live. And he was pretty receptive to that. Now we’re pretty good friends. And I think he finally understands where I’ve been coming from all of these years. 
1	I like to mentor people. One of the few people I've tried mentoring is my girlfriend is handling her life. She's an ESFP and you know, they can be really down to earth and in the present, that they don't realise the chances they've missed. So I tell her that and try mentoring her. But she  never listens because she takes it as being controlled and she doesn't like it. I dislike her after she says No without giving a reason. But I've decided to just not do it because she doesn't like it and I don't like her not listening so yeah.

1	As much freedom as humanly possible?
8	Do you get bored with sex?	 People talk about sex as this drug they can't get enough of and I've never quite got it. \nI have had a healthy sex life for years now but even before I often got jaded towards it. 
20	No not really, I just get bored of people and sometimes get bored of pursuing sex. Some of my friends live for sex, love talking about girls they've had sex with, and spend all their energy chasing sex, but for me it's an emotional exchange and I have to make sure my partner is worth the pursuit. If I have to jump through hoops and fight other guys for you, you can go fuck yourself.
14	Nobody loves me like me
12	Sex is only a big deal when you aren’t having any. \n\nI’m in my 30’s and it hasn’t gotten old for me at any point so far. 
3	Are you male or female? Are you circumcised?
3	I can relate. I wouldn't say I was ever jaded towards sex but definitely just uninterested. To me there has always been more important things to do. 
3	Yes I don't get it. It's nice but it's not air. I'd rather eat some awesome weird Asian food or visit Nepal. Sex is so basic. \n\nI actually posted a huge rant about on FB a few weeks ago lamenting the fact it's even more hypersexual in gay culture. \n\nPeople talk about their numbers but if you lower your standards enough you can get your dick wet daily. I guess I'm also sorta pissed people think I'm attractive and never actually get to know me more than wanting to hookup. \n\nAsk someone who I had a great conversation with to get a beer and they ask what I like sexually. You think no one calls me attractive or I can't tell when a straight girl likes me?
3	Yeah man I feel it. To be honest, I’d rather just get a BJ and call it a day. Something about vaginal sex just seems to bore me. I don’t get the same physical sensations as with head. No matter how much her body turns me on and gets me going. I have to be like *super* in the mood to really be into it. And that mood happens less and less often the longer I’m with someone. \n\n\nHonestly it doesn’t bother me though. I think I may be a touch towards the asexual spectrum. I do like sex to a certain extent, but no where near what normal people do. It’s like a theme park. I just wanna visit every now and then. And when I’m not into it, It’s almost “gross” in a way. Sex in general is a gross act. It gets nasty. But the pleasures way over power that factor and nobody cares. But when pleasure is removed, you see how gross it actually is LOL. \n\n\nAlso, I haven’t always been like this. When I first discovered sex it was the bees knees. But now I put so much more stock into the relationship itself. Sex is the icing that I sometimes don’t want. Plus, it jades my perception. It’s hard for me to see the relationship clearly. At least In the early days. So now I focus more on cultivating a healthy relationship before getting sexual. It just muddies the emotional waters. \n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I was diagnosed ADD when I was 21. So my adderall prescription could very well have affected my libido over the years. Oh well, less sex less drama. I’m 23, there’s plenty of time for that down the road. 
1	No, I don’t think I’ll ever in my life get bored of sex.\n\nI can however get bored of bad sex, or sex where there’s just no chemistry if it’s not exciting in another way. 
1	Depends on the girl. If I'm with a partner who bores me, I tend to ditch and find someone who doesn't.
1	I guess I'm just weird lol. Cause I can't have enough tbh. The physical sensation, to me, feels amazing and never gets old for me. Personally, I like doing it so that I can remember those sensations when the feeling of sex wears off afterwards. I guess it can be to extraverted Se or maybe I just have a high sex drive? Well, I'm not really bothered either way lol.
0	ISTP	Found this sub via random.  What is ISTP? Can't seem to figure it out based on the post
34	Independent Studies in Taking Pot
6	ummmm. ...why are you here ? Google is still a thing last I checked. 
5	As one who likes to play the random game, I can definitely appreciate how sometimes you can't figure it out. But this sub actually says what it is on the sidebar (or the about section if on mobile). It's a personality type test, and ISTP is one of the 16 types. You likely won't identify with much in this sub if you aren't an ISTP because we're a bunch of weirdos. But you could google the MBTI test and see if you can figure out what type you are.
9	Sleep habits	What is your typical sleep schedule like? I'm usually to bed at Midnight and up at 7 feeling super rested and ready to go. I also have no trouble falling asleep, i lay my head down and I'm out in 10 minutes. Meanwhile, my wife is in bed at 10:30, tossing and turning all night and is up at 8, still tired in the morning. 
16	I dont
11	I have to wake up at around 7 to be ready for work so I try to go to sleep around 11pm. This doesn't always happen sometimes I stay up until 3am some times I go to bed at 9pm. Usually its around 12-1 though. I still feel tired no matter what when I wake up.
10	honestly my sleep schedule is best described at short bursts of motivation and productivity promptly followed by short bursts of naps that last for 4 hours at a time. \n\nnot sure if it’s healthy but it’s been working thus far
6	When I was younger I never slept, and I functioned just fine. I distinctly remember basically not sleeping on a 3 month deployment and never being tired. I probably slept 4 hours most days, at best. \n\nAs I've gotten older, if I don't sleep 7-8 hours I'm gonna have a bad day. 
3	I usually fall asleep between 10-12. I generally take Melatonin before I go to bed and it still takes me about an hour to get to sleep. I've never been able to fall asleep that quick.\n\nI get 7-8 hours of sleep every night. I wouldn't say I am super rested when I wake up, I could easily sleep another 3 hours if I didn't have to go to class. But by the time I eat, shower and make the trip into the city I am wide awake and ready to go.
2	To fall asleep quickly and sleep straight the night is a rare occurrence for me. I go to sleep around 10:30ish and get up at 6:30am. I usually lay awake for at least an hour. Maybe longer. Wake up several times throughout the night and lay there awhile again before falling asleep. I probably get 5-6 hours of sleep on average. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I'm feeling pretty good if I can get 6 hours straight but that's rare as well. When I was younger, it was worse. But I function just fine without sleep because I've been this way my entire life. 
1	Midnight to whatever time I have to wake up. Usually it’s after 10am, sometimes 8am.
1	Bedtime is usually between 12 am and 1am. I sleep-in between 12pm and 2pm. Take more naps during the day after that. Active hours are between 6pm and 11pm. \n\nI think I’m mostly dormant during the day, and active at night. 
1	It takes me one to two hours to fall asleep no matter how tired and I wake up about three or four times per session. Ten hours in bed is generally about 5-6 hours of sleep and I always feel like a zombie all day until around 8-9pm where I suddenly wake up.\n\n\n When I disregard schedules and just sleep when I'm tired I generally fall asleep pretty quick and I sleep solidly for 4-5 hours then I'll need a nap later in the day. I still feel tired but but as much. Normal day routines kill me even at 31.
1	I wake up at like 1730, get ready for work and leave at 1930 for work at 2000. Get home at 0630 and am usually in bed by 0800. 
1	11am to 8am, on weekends I wake up at 10am
1	I try to be in bet by 10-11p and I’m up at 6 every day. Sometimes 8 on the weekends if I’m lucky. \n\n\nI struggle to fall asleep and wake up. The weed takes care of the falling asleep part pretty easily, but I’ve never been a morning person. My body is used to it as I’ve been getting up at 6 daily for years. Even without an alarm I wake up around 6. But my brain can never seem to be used to it. I can never shift my morningness into a non-life-hating state of mind lol. \n\n\nI honestly think it’s my pillow and mattress though. Both of which are at least a decade old. The mattress is 11 years. \n\n\nBut hey, the mattress place over by me has a twin-price sale where every mattress costs the price of the twin. Even the sleep number adjustable one I can get in a Queen for 600$! I’m seriously hoping better sleep conditions helps 😂. Hell I might go pick that bad boy up today. 
1	I'm about the same as you, though I try to be asleep before midnight.
1	I just stay up til I'm tired, and either stay up longer or go to sleep. 
1	Asleep from 1-2am and awake 7-9am
1	I sleep when I get tired 😴 
1	I can fall asleep anywhere... I can shut my brain off and just pass out most of the time.  but for times...it’s 830 or 9 up at 5
16	Driving in early afternoon traffic right now and...	I'm not saying that all slow drivers deserve to die (esp those in the left lane), I'm just saying if they all caught smallpox right now and dropped dead I probably wouldn't notice...cuz I'd be too busy driving the appropriate 10 mph above the posted speed limit everywhere I go YEAAA BABY.
17	I live in the Bay Area. Commute time is for practicing compassion because otherwise I would be behind bars. 
8	Maybe you shouldn't be on reddit while driving.
6	Me, except with slow walkers. And groups of slow walkers who disperse instead of FUCKING STICKING TOGETHER SO THEY DONT BLOCK OTHER PEOPLE.
6	[deleted]
5	You are the traffic man. 
2	I don't mind traffic. It's my alone time most days. 
8	What keeps you guys happy and wanting to stay in a long term relationship/marriage?	What keeps you guys happy and wanting to stay in a long term relationship/marriage?\n\nIn case anyone cares to read, my story is...\n\nI'm an ISFP getting married to an ISTP. Our relationship is great and we're both complete goofballs who enjoy a lot of the same things and are affectionate and encourage each other. I've never been happier.\n\nWe have had trouble in the past though. He has broken up with me out of the blue and we would get back together, then he would want to break up again, then we got back together AGAIN. It was always his decision. I've read that ISTPs will do that sort of thing because they live so day to day and that counts for their relationships as well.\n\nIt kind of terrifies me that you guys can wake up one day and not feel the same about your spouse anymore, for whatever reason that may be. So what can I do to keep the relationship exciting and new and not boring to him? He already says he's happy with me, and to get an ISTP to propose to you must really mean something right? (Hah). I just am worried he'll break up out of the blue again because he'll get bored or curious. \n\nThanks all.
19	To me it's simple, don't be a pain in the ass. Don't make it a less stressful option to just be alone. Take him at face value. Enjoy what you have
6	Bored is such a tired word. I don’t speak for the others but I don’t really seek thrills or other stereotypical ISTP things. If I want something I will say I want something (not just referring to material things). And those things are usually very reasonable so as long as I feel that my needs are met I would have no problem.\n\nWe don’t get bored of people we get tired of dealing with people. Listen to what we have to say, don’t be too controlling and give us enough space when we ask for it.\n\nI don’t believe feelings can just change in a snap that’s not really what happens. We just have a hard time processing emotions and thoughts and it can take a while for something to completely sink in. That’s why it seems so out of the blue but it’s little things that pile up day after day. 
4	Well he's made a big commitment by proposing so I'd say the chances of him leaving randomly rather than trying to work it out are slim (after keeping to himself for a while/seeming huffy).  You just have to give him space. We feel trapped easily and like to feel free to do what we want to do, when we want to do it.  Obviously doesn't have to apply all the time; He should make sacrifices to do things you want to do too, just don't force him if it isn't necessary. Give him his space when he's stressed (even just after a day of work if it was particularly stressful and he doesnt seem like he's into talking right now) )and things should be fine.
3	Leave him alone. I know that sounds counter intuitive but it might just make him like you more. Read the top sticky post on this sub reddit on how to treat your ISTP and stick to it. Don't get emotional. Telling him you don't feel loved is like asking him to not love you and if nagged enough, he will. Be independent. ISTP respect that. Don't complain all the time and expect him to just listen. There's nothing worse than listening to people complain when they don't want to fix it. "They just want to connect" or some crap.   \n\n\nGood luck. 
2	Manipulate his inferior Fe to your advantage.
2	I asked my husband (an ISTP) after reading this and he said "Make my life better or at the very least don't make it worse most of the time. It'd be unreasonable for me assume you would never make my life worse. People have bad days." \n\nNow after that I want ISTP greeting cards to be a thing. 
1	Just be loving, not controlling. Also just be yourself, there's a reason he keeps coming back to you, and has now proposed to you. 
1	ISTPs are like cats, keep us fed, give us affection when we seek your attention, and don't smother us when we show you our vulnerable emotional side.
1	As an ISTP, I need my space, but appreciate the spouse being available or simply telling me she's here if/when I need her for anything. A simple hug, kiss, or any empathetic gesture during moments of stress goes a long way. No need to pry. We'll open up at our time, when we are able to express our thoughts and after processing things out. The occasional reminder that we're still a team helps to ground me—it makes me want to open up more.\n\nPhysical contact, intimacy - we like variety and being creative. I take more pleasure in giving, watching and hearing reactions — enjoying and using all senses in that area.\n\nISTP can easily walk away it is true. We are pretty independent, but we are problem solvers and like things to work. My spouse is ESFP btw. \n\nI've learned that her extraversion and my introversion balance each other while recently appreciating how our common S trait really works for us. On the surface, from most people's perspective,  we are opposites. However, we are both in the explorer's category (16personalities.com).\n\nWhile we have had our differences, when we both reviewed together our MBTI personalities and expressed our needs, we came together much stronger. An ISTP is willing to adjust and give what their partner needs as long as their needs are being fulfilled too. \n\nNever force or give ultimatums to an ISTP. We will walk or distance ourselves.\n\nMaybe review your personalities together and needs. A mature ISTP will be willing to to do this for the relationship.\n\nISTPs are day-by-day moment-to-moment creatures, but that doesn't mean we will give up on a relationship if we know that our partners are putting equal efforts into meeting our needs.\n\nBeen together 20+ years. All relationships will have ups and downs and each likely have their own red lines that shouldn't be crossed. Understanding each and respecting that line makes it worthwhile. Long term can work.\n\n
1	Opportunity to be free beside someone we love.
1	You could also try /r/mbtirelationships for further advice! 
-1	Married to an isfp myself for almost 20 years.\n\nYou are complete fucking control freaks. On its face it’s a terrible match. Control freaks and anti control freaks.\n\nThere are no easy answers, you ain’t gonna change, he ain’t gonna change, but perhaps this insight will help.
-2	There is nothing you can do. and yes, we do wake up and realize that we dont like someone or something..even though we were obsessed with it previously. I am happily single, I am a woman though, live alone and have no intention of settling down because I dont like commitment. there is nothing you can do. you will always be afraid that he is going to break up with you again, and he WILL, so you either put up with that or move on and find someone more suitable for you  because he will easily move on. I know this is not what you wanted to hear but i am answering as myself and how I would react.  Also, if he says he is happy with you than he is. so dont keep asking him because that gets annoying. I bet he is like me and does not say things he doesnt mean. But be prepared for a day to day long term relationship..because he might not be there the next day. 
5	What are your results?	So recently I've stumbled across this new theory: The Apology Languages\n\nwww.5lovelanguages.com/profile/apology/\n\nI wonder if there is a correlation between this and MBTI types so do comment your results below.\n
12	I couldn’t even finish the quiz tbh. For each question, it gave 5 very specific apologies, most of which being platitudes. None of which were really anything I want to hear. I don’t want to hear some progressive kindergarten teachers “now I am acknowledging that you are upset and I am sorry for my actions. Now I am asking for forgiveness.” \n\n\n\nNo. Tell me exactly why you did what you did, show me that you know *why* it was wrong and *why* it upset me, and tell me how you plan to avoid it again. Apologies are useless if you aren’t actively analyzing why the situation happened and how to avoid it. I don’t want someone’s apology. I want to know that they will actively avoid it again. The past already happened, the future is what I’m concerned with. \n\n\nAnd at least one of them was something I wouldn’t even want an apology for in the first place. If my sister says something insensitive to me, I’m going to say it right back. And then we’ll both laugh. I don’t need some “I apologize for being insensitive. I shouldn’t have upset you. Please allow me to retract so I can get my reputation back” Insensitive things don’t upset me. And that’s a ridiculously over apologetic reply. All of these answers seem to be catered to delicate flowers who’s emotions break when a house fly sneezes.

3	7 Responsibility, 6 repent, 3 regret, 2 restitution, and 2 request forgiveness.
3	If someone doesn't take responsibility they haven't grown, period. Most of everything they say is just band aids. I'll take responsibility for things I do wrong immediately because it allows me to focus on doing better instead of thinking of ways to shift focus off myself.

12	So I just realised why INFJ’s are my actual weakness. Anyone else experience this?	If we’re Ti Se Ni Fe\n\nAnd they’re Ni Fe Ti Se...\n\nThen y’know. No shit, Sherlock.\n\nAnyone else have a major soft spot for INFJ’s?\n\nSomehow I excuse them treating me in a way that I wouldn’t dream of letting anyone else...
7	I find all the Beta quadrant people fun to be around. We all *get* each other even despite stark behavioural and possibly ideological differences. 
6	I was in a sorta relationship with an INFJ girl once. She had a ton of mental issues tho (surprise surprise am I right), but I definitely get where you’re coming from. I don’t know if it applies to all INFJs but she jumped into conclusions hella fast, overthought absolutely everything and looked too much into things. There‘s very few moments I can remember when she actually enjoyed the moment and relaxed, so it never really felt like she was enjoying herself. Meh/10 would not do again. If I had to admit a weakness for types though, I’d go with ENXPs. 
3	INFJ here. I have a weakness for you all as well. Got the S sprinkled on top of some risk taking.  Like how your minds work. 
3	Yeah, totally. Tends to be the case when dom and tert meet in that fashion. 
3	I married one
2	i don’t know what kind of witchcraft this is but an INFJ has recently caught my eye, that’s crazy
2	My bff is INFJ.
2	The INFJs I have dated or contemplated pursuing have all been very paranoid, suspicious, controlling and stuck up. I had to really stick around in order to see the goofy playful side and even by then I was too burnt out.\n\nI am sure those girls were the minority. There are probably many lovely INFJs.\n\nENFP girls are my weakness. The ones I know are carefree, extremely out going and never shut up. As a man that seldom speaks, I enjoy someone who does all the talking for me and isn’t afraid to be themselves.
2	How do you even figure out which one of the 16 someone is lol\n\nDo you just… ask them to take the test…?
2	Literally only ever had one genuine "crush" in my life. All other crushes have been just lust. Just something about this girl. We kinda dated for a little.\n\nShe is an INFJ. I didn't realize this was a thing. 
2	Too eager for commitments.
6	Magic the Gathering (xSTP)	Hey.\nFor those that play or used to play what are your favorite color to play?\n\nAlso what colors combinations do you think fit for a ISTP and ESTP?
3	Used to play in high school. Green was the easiest to learn on so I stuck with that and my first deck of my own was green-white.\n\nBlack was my least favorite but I'm sure you could make any type of deck with any color tbh
3	I always tend to play Orzhov (black + white) because of high amounts of kill spells and lifelink mechanics. I always liked that idea because you kill your opponent and gain more health at the same time. 
3	aggro and aggro
2	I played back in the 90’s. I was always into black and green. Can’t recall why, honestly. I tried checking that game out again a year or so ago and it’s completely unlike the game I used to play. 
2	Red deck wins all day. 
2	I used to be really invested in M:tG. I always played control decks, required extensive knowledge of the metagame and most times have to predict what your opponent is trying to do to truly win. \n\nMy decks were most often Grixis (Blue/Black/Red).
1	Anything but blue, really. But archetype is more important, and I'll mostly do aggro, with what control I do is normally just straight up creature killing. Combos normally reserved for Commander 
12	wayyyyy too quiet	idk if this is a type thing or anxiety thing or whatever.. but i've noticed that i've been REALLY REALLY quiet lately. when a family member greets me or tries to talk to me, i literally, LITERALLY, do not say anything  and just end up walking away just cuz i couldn't be bothered to give a response. the most i'll do is just say "mhm" or just nod and stuff. can anyone else relate to this in some way?
16	Yes I'm like this with my family because I don't feel like I can a) Change the person I've been all this time and randomly be outgoing, talkative and extroverted because then they'd call me out on it and it's just feel weird. And b) Expressing myself outwardly can just feel super wrong to me.\n\nUnderneath that quiet person is actually some body quite outgoing or who desires to be. I can actually be myself when I'm with people that don't know me, they have no ideas in their head of what I'm supposed to be like. I am the ESTP or ESFP of the party. This usually requires a couple drinks though.\n\nWhen I go back to my family, the more time  with them the more closed off I become and the less I talk. Moving out has helped me be myself because I have a fresh start with new people. Now from the get go im outgoing and free.
6	Ti-Ni loopers are extremely introspective and observant
6	My husband is this way unless he has a beer in most social situations. He's even sometimes like that with me and his father whom he has is close to, but less with us than anyone else. After a single beer he's still quiet but more relaxed and can give concise answers and some hilarious one liners when least expected. It doesn't bother him though I think it makes certain people intimidated.
4	Mmhm.
1	When I am tired or not into the mood I do that, but just with my family. With strangers it takes me a long time to give a response.
1	I do that more at work then anywhere really (except when I have to talk for my jobs). I suddenly feel really lucky that my family is like 90% introverts and like 70% avid readers. Holidays/get togethers don't include a lot of small talk, usually at least one person is reading. \n\nThe worst issue I had with family was a judgy aunt I lived with who was very rule oriented, structured, and organized. It was both 'shes always right' and 'your never right'...and she was a drama queen when I proved I was right. Super stressful and annoying BUT that was luckily only a thing in about a quarter of our interactions.\n
1	There are very few things that interest me enough to have a conversation about and fewer people I actually want to talk to. I still feel exhausted just by being around people even when I'm not participating. I don't really smile or wake up until I get to be alone again.
2	For those of you who may struggle with social energy or feeling lost, here’s some words of wisdom!	
4	This short video is summarized concept of wise energy investments. It’s about how to choose who is worth spending energy on and who is not. After that, it gets into seeking happiness in life. \n\n\nIf you’re stuck in WTF years or seriously struggle with social activities draining your batteries, this may have some insights for you! 
3	My mom was like this. Especially after my dad died. Didn't help that I was down too. She needed to fill that void, too bad she only cares about her own needs. I want to cut her out completely, but don't want to devistate her either.
35	Thank you.	A year ago I was very lost in life, in the second half of college and still not knowing where I was going. I had no real career ambition like the rest of my peers, and was struggling to sit down and study. The careers my friends were going into - pre-med, pre-law, investment banking, private equity, and accounting - these failed to motivate me. I applied for internships and landed one over the summer, but I always felt like my interest wasn't genuine in interviews and on that job.\n\nI made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/7asp2s/cant_decide_what_makes_me_motivated/) asking for advice here. And I've taken everything that was said into serious consideration.\n\nIn this year I’ve read this sub regularly. I finally felt like there were people who understood me, and there were so many people bouncing ideas off each other in how to navigate the world, which often doesn’t play to an istp’s strengths. \n\nIn particular, thank you to those who suggested the Marines or any other military branch. Now I am going for aviation with them. I've never been more motivated in my life. Flying is truly exciting and will keep me on my toes - both physically and mentally. No career gets me out of my seat like this one. I've been "networking" naturally and I'm talking to as many people as possible in military aviation - whereas networking in "normal" careers seemed so unnatural for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot everyone in my life has been supportive. In my community, everyone becomes a lawyer, doctor, or banker. Military is considered unconventional, so it never crossed my mind. I may lose a relationship and my mother is still adamant that I be an accountant, consultant, or actuary, as I studied math and finance. But I know I have found what motivates me - that's what counts for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, organization and study are necessary evils. But now that I know what I'm working towards, those two no longer bother me as much as before. I need to study hard and improve my GPA in order to get selected for OCS. I need to be structured in my running (something I hate but need to do ) in order to get a full score on the PFT. I need to remove my belly button piercing, as much as I'd love to keep it, because it's a rule in the job I want (and the rule is there for safety). But these are VERY small sacrifices I have to make to get a fulfilling career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThinking outside the box, outside of my community's norms, is what led me to my passion. Thanks reddit ISTP!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I read somewhere that a higher proportion of ISTPs are in the Special Forces than in regular military. It makes a lot of sense now that I think of it. Always something to consider! 
9	Would you look at that! /u/acepincter suggested marines to you and said exactly why. You followed through and are now happy. Funny enough, he was the major contributor to *me* climbing out of *my* hole starting early 2017. I followed his advice to the T at first, and then began working into my own personality. And now I’ve reaped the rewards just like you. Let’s just give him a huge fucking thank you. The number of people in this sub who have actively bettered their lives thanks to him is astounding. Dudes a godsend doing all of this out of the good of his heart without anything but expressed gratification in return. I hope he knows how much we appreciate it. \n\n\nOP, I’m so glad you found your place! A lot of us tend to wander aimlessly not knowing what to look for. It’s incredibly freeing to find a path. I wish you much luck on your future endeavors in the service and thank you kindly for serving! 
7	Good on you for following your own path 👏🏻👏🏻
3	Awww I'm so happy for you! :)
2	Just remember, the military is competitive and someone else is always going to be trying to get the slot for the “cool” jobs. Don’t ever settle for the minimum, especially when it comes to fitness.
10	DAE worry about what other people think?	Just realized I'm probably an ISTP, and found this sub. But a lot of people on here seem to not give a fuck or are proud to be an asshole. \n\nI'm constantly self conscious of how I sound to others. I don't want to offend anyone, but saying it nicely is hard most times. A lot of times I hold my tongue or lie (I'm a shitty lier). And that sucks since I'm not being myself.\n\nI Think the only person I'm honest to is my gf, a very select group of people, or online. I think things would be easier if I didn't have to worry about other people's feelings. I have some funny fucked up things to say.
16	Humans care about what others feel and think. We are all human. A lot of the chumps on this sub care a bit too much about making sure that EVERYONE knows they dont care.
12	Are you younger? Maybe teens or 20s? \n\nWhen I was younger, especially like in middle school, I was super self conscious. I grew into my DGAF attitude, starting in my mid 20s, but especially in my 30s.\n\nA self aware ISTP can use their shortcomings to compensate (true for any type) and put extra effort into caring about or respecting other people because we're aware that we suck at it by default.
3	Everyone worries about what other people think.  It is the difference between worrying, admitting to yourself that you worry and putting on a brave face to make people think you don't worry.
3	It is like I tend to avoid making social mistakes, they make me unconfortable. But once I made it, it is like I do not give a fuck, and my way to deal with it is like veing proud with it. I do not know if I made myself clear, but it is more or less how I think I see myself.
3	As much as I am laid back, I'm still awful with women and the need for validation from women that I'm interested in consumes me and becomes overwhelmingly difficult to fight back. \n\nI'm still forced to wait until after this weekend to ask this chick out and the anticipation is killing me on the inside. 
2	I think what you're describing is inferior Fe in action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't say I worry about what other people think. I am completely comfortable with myself around people I don't know and couldn't care less about any judgments they might be making about me.\n\nBut I can relate in a way to "worrying" about making offensive or rude comments to or around other people. Getting offended by something someone says is something I can't really relate to, so I'm not good at knowing how to avoid offending other people. This is one  reason I talk so little around most people.
1	I think what I was trying to say, was that I worry too much about what others think. I want to get away from that. At least to where it doesn't affect who I am. Not trying to be sociapathic though .\n\nAnd I want to make sure I am an ISTP. Pretty sure, since I pretty much relate to all the charcteristics. \n\nAlthough I'm not a handy man. Wish I was, but I lack motivation to learn new things. I am a master forklift driver though, wish it paid better though. I stick with shit I know, but I probably have to find something new if I want to get out of my rut. 
3	ISTPs and Introverted Intuition	I'd like to know how your introverted intuition manifests itself... and maybe help me determine my type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI usually test as an ISTP but was typed as an INTJ by an MBTI "specialist" about a year ago. I kind of assumed he was right at the time, mainly because I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrom as a kid and it seemed to make sense.\n\nI just don't really think I lead with Ni. I think my Se is stronger.\n\nI didn't even notice any of what I know now as "introverted intuition" until I was about 25 years old. I started having these premonitions, and they were usually very negative. These really bothered me. I had really negative scenarios playing out in my head, and sometimes I had to leave where I was or call someone to make sure things were okay.\n\nNow, I really just use it to plan my future, what my next steps in life are going to be. Sometimes I try to predict how events in the news will play out. With some people I will answer questions before they are asked. Sometimes I can anticipate what people are going to say and don't have the patience to wait for them to finish talking before I answer their question for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I think my Se is strong is because getting out of my head and focusing on my environment is pretty easy. I'm actually never not aware of everything going on around me. Even when I'm in my head I notice all the sounds going on... dogs barking and birds chirping outside the window, the fan of my computer whirring, conversations going on in my vicinity. I'm never so lost in thought that I don't notice my surroundings. Also, as a kid my hobbies were geared towards sports: baseball, soccer, wrestling, skiing. P.E. was my favorite class as a child, I didn't care much for academics growing up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes my use of Ni sound familiar to anyone else? Does my Se sound like the use of someone who would have it as their inferior function? Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	You sound like an ISTP to me. Your use of Ni sounds similar to mine, as does Se. Ni for me is basically like a gut feeling, it fills in the information physical input alone (Se) can’t provide. It gives little predictions about situations, it tries to come up with a definitive answer to a case. That’s what Ni is to me.
2	I get Ti Ni loops when I'm stressed, esp. when in school (like now). In class, if the information is important, I shut out all external things going on. My friends also think I'm an INTJ, but that's just me stressed out. It sucks...
2	See how SPs and NTs differ from decision making and problem solving if your doubt is about being ISTP or INTJ.
2	>I started having these premonitions\n\nI used to have what I assumed were precognitive dreams. When I consciously became aware of my Introverted Intuition, those dreams stopped completely.
22	Shower Thought: Trolling/Intellectually outclassing people doesn't afford you many friends...	But dammit does it make you feel alive and victorious.
11	I typed an essay about how bears need to be hunted for everyone's good because they have a runaway population if left unchecked that will hurt bears and people. Pretty easy to follow logic, I put most of the blame on humans because it's really 100% our fault. But nope, I guess nobody considered the scene from the Revenant could happen in backyards if we don't manage the population because we think bears are just misunderstood.\n\nNah, hunting is bad because it's all trophy hunting because a dentist shot a lion once and we felt bad for but didn't go on more safaris. Apex predators/huge animals are pests to anyone who is a local, and without a reason to keep them around they get slaughtered.
10	I've never understood the desire to feel superior to someone, it doesn't accomplish anything, so it's wasted effort.
6	yes power over the weak of mind
5	Friends are overrated.

1	these are the posts i live for
11	Being a dad	I was wondering what other ISTP dads are like. Have my first baby boy who's almost 4 months now. I know I need to make ma girlfriend feel more loved and appreciated. She said I'm good with the baby. And I know I need to be more, lovey to her. Told her it's something I know I need to work on. Just not much of a mushy-love kinda guy. We always make each other laugh and smile tho. And we talked about going on a date before winter (walking to the airstrip to be specific tehe, we walked there once when we first started). Blah
13	My Dad is ISTP, he has a pretty hands-off parenting style, prefers to set an example rather than impose rules. I picked up on how intelligent he was whenever we watched quiz shows on TV, he'd know the answer to every question. Time spent playing sports in the backyard was always nice, it was disappointing when he didn't have the energy to play with me (can't blame him though, his job was tiring and I had high energy levels). I could always rely on him to fix something for me, or help me out in emergencies such as my car breaking down. We didn't show much love towards each other, the relationship was sort of just about presence - being in the same room together, helping each other when either of us needed assistance, sharing opinions or teaching small lessons every now and then.
16	DAE get their mood turned off?	You can't smile, and you're mood is just fuck-it-all, and you don't know why. Then you think about it, then realize that what triggered it is that the floor of the diner is wet, or because your co-worker is reading on his phone. Then you think about how petty this is and you shouldn't be annoyed by this. But you're still off, then you get distracted a little, after a while you'll have a oh-I'm-fine-now moment. But by then, the people around you is already wary and try to avoid you cause you look like you're about to kill people.
5	Yes
5	I can somewhat relate. I do get moods where, as you described, I’m “just fuck-it-all”, but I’m usually able to force those moods down and resume being in a “neutral” state where I don’t feel anything. 
4	I do this. I also have a friend that does this. When we know it's happening, we message each other something like "need you to pop my angry balloon" and then we message silly things and it usually works to lighten the mood. It's a lot like a balloon, once you pop it, it lets loose and you can move on. Being self aware helps a lot (as does having someone who knows how to pop it for you).
2	Are you me? \n\n\nI think this is one of my defense mechanisms to be honest. Having my emotions turn off keeps me from getting angry. And I’ll tell ya, with how bad my previous rage problems were, a couple hours of being an empty shell is so much better than blacking out with rage and being a massive cunt. Idk if it was a subconscious change in my psyche or if at some point I intentionally started it. I just know that at some point I placed a fuse in my emotional pathway. An overload of any emotion trips the fuse and sends me into empty shell mode. As unhealthy as it may sound, I think it’s beneficial to me. Due to some childhood traumas, my emotional development was severely hindered. I wasn’t able to identify or handle strong emotions. It caused lots of problems for me. So now it’s like I have a fuse that protects my brain from overload. As I’m learning and developing my emotional intelligence, it sorts keeps shit I can’t handle yet in check. Kinda sucks going into shell mode, but it’s been far better than experiencing intense emotions I can’t control. Ya know? 
2	Haha.. Yep. Today I got outraged because I was cooking something and someone was just invading my personal space because they couldn't wait two damn minutes for me to leave the kitchen, I got very irritable. Then I got distracted and later I was hanging out with said person like nothing had happened. I don't hold grudges but I tend to look like I'm gonna murder someone when my space is invaded, according to some people. I need to work on that probably.
3	Yeah. That's when you should be checking for any obvious chemical imbalance. \n\nDid you not have enough caffeine? Too much? Low blood sugar? Or is there something causing you stress that you haven't identified? \n\nMBTI is an attempt to add structure to something without much structure. But it's not real. What's real is that we're just bags of chemicals, and some bags have different mixtures than others, but it's not hard to temporarily throw off the balance, resulting in moods, which we often don't even try to attribute to specific triggers.
20	I hate interaction	I'm stuck in school now and my *friends* are all talking about matters that I have no interest in, or that I'm private about and I really want to go home lol\n\nI'm also actually worried about failing a major exam but i have no motivation to study at all \n\nAnyone relate 
11	I was never good at making and keeping friends, I’m still not. I just really don’t see the use in putting all this work and effort that I don’t want to put in, into a relationship that I don’t really want to be a part of. It’s nice to have acquaintances though and side rant, the term friend has also been way too diluted by social media where most people have +500 “friends”. Imo the word friend and acquaintance are basically synonymous nowadays so as long as you talk to someone on a semi hat regular basis, you can probably consider them a friend. Anyways, my hobbies and interests change so frequently that I don’t even keep online friends. And I’m okay with that, because people bug me and I always feel like I bug other people so I’d rather feel lonely once or twice a month than keep up a charade for years just for appearances so that I can say I have a group of close friends. I’m happy with it and that’s all that matters, and that’s all that should matter to you. Don’t go alienating everyone though because networking and acquaintances are important, but if you don’t like social events then don’t go to them. My philosophy is that I value my free time and personal enjoyment too much to waste it doing things I don’t want to do. Those who tell you you’re gonna miss out on the best time of your life if you don’t go to (social event), have peaked. I’ve been to parties, if you don’t like parties and people, they suck. \n\nAs for exams I totally feel you bud. I’m in my last year of college so I’ve been through it all. I’ve actually stooped so low as to use a coin to flip for answers and decide my fate. Actually worked though and I got a C in that class by the skin of my teeth instead of a D like a few of my friends who took the class with me. But the secret that I found out a while ago, is to actually pay attention in class so that you don’t need to study nearly as much. Take good notes, figure out what the teacher is talking about before you walk out of the classroom, and build up your memory retention skills. When you finally start studying the night before or day of the exam, it’ll all start coming back to you. Reduces panic, stress, minimizes overall work time and distributes effort, and is also just good habit building. Work around your weaknesses, don’t waste time trying to fight them. People are always amazed at how well I can do in class when I barely study, procrastinate the way I do, and do the bare minimum. Takes practice and knowing your limits. Deadlines are where I draw the line, you start missing deadlines and everything can just start getting away from you. \n\nAlso, grades matter - at least in for the near future. GPA is a lot easier to bring down than it is bring back up. It’s all a matter of weighing costs and benefits, and current vs future effort. Slack off now and work your ass off later, which puts a lot of pressure on future you that will probably not work out, or do the work now and do the work later but only worry about what’s in front of you instead of everything crashing down on top of you. Get studying, good luck!
6	You getting enough protein?  Seriously, this can cause a lot of antisocial feelings and irritability if you aren't getting enough.
6	Just move out into the forest and live as a hermit
3	I used to relate. Until isolation and lack of motivation was causing my entire life to fall down flat. No friends plus a long hour laborious job = never cleaning apartment and bad hygiene. Just gonna sweat my balls off tomorrow anyways right? Not like I’m gonna be around people who care. \n\n\nNext thing I knew, I hadn’t seen someone outside of work in months, I wasn’t showering often, just plain wasn’t taking care of myself or my apartment. \n\n\nI wasn’t okay with that lifestyle so I decided to fabricate motivation. Got a hair cut, cleaned the fuck out of my apartment, cleaned the fuck out of my body, slowed down on the weed, and stopped spending all my time alone or working. \n\n\nI wish I had more tangible help to offer. But honestly a flip just switched in my brain and I was tired of being the way I was. I’ve never been a social butterfly or felt the need to be popular or anything like that. But I noticed a drastic decrease in physical and mental health when I completely secluded myself. As introverted as I am, these days I need a certain dose of social activity each week to stay sane. I’ve still gotta have my alone time to charge my batteries, but if I don’t ever spend that battery, it goes to shit.

21	How to become less of a jerk	So I’ve always just thought I’m a blunt, honest person and that there’s nothing wrong with that. If someone gets offended by me telling them the truth, that’s a personal problem. But recently, it’s kind of hit me that even if it’s the truth, it can severely hurt the people around, including the people I really care about. \n\nFor example, what sparked this post was when my friend and I was just having a casual conversation about how we’ve both changed a lot since we met each other. Then he goes on to talk about he noticed recently he’s actually prioritizing his studies and building better money habits (he used to buy designer clothing with only $100 in his bank account and had to borrow from me multiple times), but he doesn’t know why. So a little context, he’s a senior in high school and currently thinking about applying to college, but because of his bad grades (3.1 GPA, 70th percentile at our school), his choices are very limited. I didn’t think much of it at the time so I responded, “Well it’s probably because you were hit with a reality check when you realized you couldn’t make it to x college. Failure is a pretty good motivator most of the time.” He left me on read so I assumed he was just busy or didn’t feel like responding, but common friends have messaged saying that my message was uncalled for and it isn’t fair for me to to bring that up. \n\nThough I still believe that telling the truth will always be more important than people’s feelings, I feel like I should have been much less of a jerk about it or possibly have sugarcoated it. So I guess the underlying question is how do you guys deal with balancing between telling the truth and not being a jerk? \n\nThough I definitely
25	A good way to handle this is to ask yourself "does this really need to be said?"\n\nIn many cases, the answer is no, and you can avoid a lot of BS by just not saying it. \n\nIt also helps to assess the situation first: "is this person asking for my advice or my help?" (or are they just wanting someone to listen to them vent)\n\nJust because we're good at fixing stuff doesn't mean we always have to.
18	My husband chooses to just not talk unless someone asks him a direct question. 
16	Yeah as I've gotten older I've found that you're right, it's best to be honest and say what needs to be said. It may open your friend's eyes. The thing is though, being straight up blunt is hard for anyone to take even for you I'm sure. You gotta soften it, sandwich the blunt honesty in between some "hey man, you're such a great guy but....". That kinda stuff, ya know what I mean? Try to word things softly but still get the truth across. Coming at him like a friend rather than a critic can completely change whether he receives it or not and it could make him really end up liking you even more for your your honesty (presented with tact of course).
10	In my experience, when people tell you about an accomplishment they are usually expecting encouragement, a pat in the back if you will. Most people do not take criticism (constructive or not) well, specially when they aren’t asking for it. You gave a too-serious answer to what probably was a light-hearted comment, so it makes sense he took it the wrong way. It’s all about reading the mood of the conversation and choosing the right words to express yourself. In small talk, keep it simple, impersonal, and light-hearted, for serious conversations, give your honest thoughts, be objective but not offensive, and state your intentions clearly.  Hope it helps somewhat.
11	Ask before you say your piece.\n\n"Do you want my advice?" or "Do you want my input?".\n\nIf they say yes, tell them bluntly. If they say no, say something like "I'm sorry bro, sounds rough."
5	I think you can say what you want to say, but there is a way to say it. Be tactful with your words. 
4	It's more important to be kind, than right. Rather than all of your friends thinking that you're a douchbag, tone in down a bit. My biggest problem is lack of hindsight. I'll blurt out something, and people will misunderstand my motives. My sense of humor is quirky to say the least, and I often make a wise crack that is taken out of context that ends up making someone angry, or butthurt. 
2	[deleted]
2	Given the other responses I'm sure I'm in the wrong but I really didn't say much wrong with what you said. If anything I think thats kind of shitty of your friend to borrow all that money from you like that. I hope he paid it back?\n\nMaybe just tell him its not meant to hurt him or anything, the art of padding and sugar coating is unfortunately very necessary today, but its a nice etiquette too for people you really care about. IMO i dont think being blunt is the same as being intentionally mean or nasty to someone, but it seems like a lot of people today think it is. \n\nBlunt would be: "Yeah that seems like a big mistake you made, it was probably the cause."\n\nMean would be: "Yeah you were a big asshole doing all that stupid shit, you were probably too dumb," or something. 
2	You should always know, that you can gain more of a situation, if you play right. So every time ask yourself "is it the most efficient way to handle the conversation". After some time practicing you will acquire social intuition and predict when you can potentially suck. Good luck.
2	[deleted]
2	It’s the same concept as giving advice to people to people who didn’t ask for it. Unless he specifically asked you for that opinion, it *was* uncalled for. \n\n\nIf someone asks you a question, and you answer honestly, that’s not on you. They know you’re blunt and honest. So if they didn’t want it, they shouldn’t have asked. But if they aren’t directly asking you, leave the commentary to yourself. \n\n\nBeing blunt and honest isn’t wrong or bad. But there is a time and a place. Being right isn’t always the best thing. 
1	I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/BESJqphtp2U) after my ex broke up with me and it made me realize how I needed to value Fe. Our dominant function is our weakness, not our strength.
1	In my view, true friends are honest with each other.
-4	As an ISTP, you should be thinking before you speak. What is this bullshit?
10	Social tips	Several comments / questions, respond to whichever you see fit.\n\na. I know a key to making friends / acquaintances is showing an interest in others. A lot of times I just don't find others that interesting or maybe it's hard for me to get to the interesting parts?\n\nb. What do you do in group situations? I find myself typically very quiet / uninterested and others start to assume I'm angry or something along those lines. Inevitably someone will make a comment. Not really the case I just don't find much to say in those situations.\n\nc. How do you handle every day pleasantries? Passing a coworker in the hall, leaving a small talk conversation, etc? I find it's more of these small interactions that make me uncomfortable.\n\nd, I try to look people in the eye but sometimes feel like I'm staring them down / could freak them out. I think it can come off as stern but again, not really mad or anything I just have a neutral expression. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks
10	I know I’m not an ISTP but I think it is a matter of finding the right people. I’m friends with a couple ISTPs and we get along well. I understand their need of space and can tell when they get bored of what I’m talking about. You shouldn’t have to change anything to find people that understand you. I’d just suggest being more open/putting yourself out there a little by hanging out with small groups (literally just 2-3). If you’re involved in any activities, try talking to people in those since you know you have similar interests. I hope this helps.
9	A. Fake it til you make it. Pretend to care. Eventually you will care. I didn’t give a fuck about my roommates girlfriends African dance class. But the more I heard about it, the more I became interested. She was a tiny white girl with “black girl assets” (sorry if that’s insensitive) in a traditional African dance class comprised entirely of native Africans who immigrated here (or parents did). Basically it was like starbucks walked into Nigeria. She did really well in class and fit in despite the cultural differences. See? How do I know this? I just listened and pretended to care until I did actually care. Makes no functional difference to them unless they’re smart enough to realize you don’t care. But also, as you begin to care about a *person*, their boring anecdotes often becomes less drab. Sort of like that girl you weren’t attracted to, but got to know her, and now she looks better for some reason. It’s the same sort of logic with peoples stories.\n\n\nB. I’m the same way. Use the opportunity to become known as the “man who only opens his mouth when he has something important to say”. Sit, listen, absorb details, paint a picture. At some point, someone is going to say something you can comment on. If every time you open your mouth, good shit comes out, people will listen. And they won’t care that you don’t talk all the time. Because when you do, it’s worth listening to. This way you can adhere to your nature while making it work for you, vs. against. \n\n\nC. Practice, and a little bit of A and B as well. Pretend to care and do more listening than talking. Over time, you’ll start feeling more comfortable joining in on the one sided conversation. It’s all about pretending you are comfortable until you actually are. \n\n\nD. When you find an answer to this, please let me know LOL. Eye contact is something I’m really bad at. I’m either showing insecurity or staring through their soul. This is why I like sunglasses lol. When I put on sunglasses, a massive part of my social anxiety disappears. Because I can’t control the words my eyes speak yet. Being a very detail oriented person, in always looking. At shirts, at doorways, at the crack in the concrete, at the smudge on your shoes, etc. And I like to do that in “private”. Unfortunately can’t wear sunglasses inside. So like I said, I’ll take a solution to this when you find it 😂
6	D. Don't look in the eye, it can intimidate people easily as you've said. Look at the area of mouth & nose instead, don't stare at a point, but keep the general gaze there; it works better, easier to pull off, makes you look more approachable & friendlier. You can look in the eyes for short bursts to show you are interested too. Works like a charm.
5	C. Steve: Good morning!\nMe: what's good in the morning?\nSteve: ok you're not in the mood, *walks away\nMe: wait, it was a joke Steve wai, alright then fuck off Stevenson!
4	Best book I read in my teens\n"How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie\n\nLearnt how to deal with social interactions
4	Charisma on Command on Youtube. Keep practicing. 
3	a. In my case, when I decided I wouldn't even try to make friends anymore and just ask questions if I really was interested in someone, then an INFJ liked me and we became friends, then she brought an ESFP along which also somehow likes me. The INFJ said I came off as laid-back and 'cool' when we first met lol. Becoming friends with people you find boring ends up being a chore in the long run imo.\n\nb. I try to have a pleasant and relaxed facial expression and ask someone to explain something to me so they do most of the talking and maybe give them a compliment related to the topic they're talking about.\n\nc. It's usually awkward unless I've been physically active that day or have previously laughed. Although I have a kind of predertermined smile and voice tone when greeting someone so that I don't look mad. I've been told I look like I'm gonna murder someone when I don't actively try to be nice.\n\nd. Same. I usually look at people as if I were to draw their features, I remind myself not to though and it makes me kinda anxious. I look elsewhere when having a conversation and look at their eyes from time to time bc that's customary to not seem insecure or uninterested. A therapist once was weirded out by my habit of looking at objects intead of her eyes when explaining something hah.
2	Appreciate all the response.\n\nI guess it's that back and forth between understanding / accepting my tendencies and feeling like I should be different or better at them.\n\nI can be decently dry / sarcastic to lighten a mood but I don't always use that as I think it can be taken the wrong way and if it's all the time I think it can get old.\n\nDef think it takes practice and have heard others who are 'socially adept' feel like they wish they could improve.
2	A. This is hard for me, most of my friends are extroverted and approached me and showed an interest in friendship. I made one friend recently on a group hiking trip. Come to think of it, I think most of my friends were extroverts that "adopted" me.\n\nTry to find activities that you can do with others and you'll end up naturally finding friends.\n\nB. I'm quiet in groups and listen the majority of the time I'm a passive observer.\n\nC. After being in ROTC, I greet co-workers with "good morning", "good afternoon", or "good evening" which is a standard way to greet people in the military. \n\nIt's quick, easy, friendly and not as pointless as asking "how are you" when both parties know we don't actually care or want a genuine answer.\n\nD. Eye contact is an issue for me. With new people I'm not familiar with I'm pretty sure I avoid it, with people I know and having a one on one conversation with I think I tend to give too much. Sometimes I realize I've actually been staring at the persons eyes I've been talking too.....\n\nI need work with social skills...
1	a. I don't, unless people ask me I hardly interact socially, I just do not posses that interest. Do not have many friends either, but meh :)\nb. I tend to get quiet vs how much energy the group drains, start out high end up really low\nc. Usually end up having nothing to talk about, if the other party is talkative I'm a good listener, since I'm really curious about people I tend to stay and listen. Most of the times its a short "hi" while passing\nd. Think it's fun to look people in the eye, because it tends to either get them really nervous or open up more. Plus it helps me reading their emotions
9	Instantly know what to do?	City roads can get pretty slick in the winter, so one time I was driving my mom somewhere, road was going into a gradual dip, and there's a bridge over the long dip. The light was green when I could see it, guess it must've turned when I couldn't, and of course everybody in front of me was quickly piling up. As was slowing down, brakes locked and was sliding towards the car in front of us. As we got closer, I (instinctively) jerked us halfway onto the sidewalk. Got the control back and avoided bump. After crossing intersection, looked in rearview mirror, somebody went all the way on slanted hill.\nAnother time, ma dad started a small fire on stovetop with a plastic utensil. He calls for ma mom as usual and I tell them, "Wet rag(!)" They take too long so I wet a rag and cover the small fire up, killing the fire. Solved. Blah.\nCurious if anyone else had to quick react and to what kinda situation (avoiding/stopping accidents from happening, since ISTP's are notorious for being awesome in emergency situations).
21	I feel like I just do things without thinking, good or bad. 
6	Little brother was driving 4 wheeler for the first time. The owner of the four wheeler and myself were also riding along. We were going around a pond and I suspected my brother would have a hard time keeping the steering straight since there was a slant downwards toward the pond. At one point the ground slanted downward a bit more we started going right for the pond. Before the four wheeler made it into the pond I had already hopped off and was on land while the other two guys were wet and in the pond. Keep in mind this all happened within seconds so i had to act out of instinct. \n\n
6	Yeah we are generally calm under pressure and good at understanding the physical world/how our physical actions will affect our surroundings. Those two combine to make us good at what you listed in your post
7	Yep. We tend to have a stronger fight than flight. We tend to stay calm. Because we’ve already been paying attention to the situation and are naturally good at taking in lots of details quickly, we seem to be good at this kind of thing. \n\n\nI’ve been making last second “saves” my whole life. And it’s rarely a conscious decision on my part. It just sort of... happens. Ya know? 
3	I’ve worked as an EMT and as a Police Officer... I’ve always been drawn to jobs with a lot of action. After I found out I was an ISTP it all made sense as to why.
2	Had similar accident saves while driving. Mountain road, I'm doing 80 kph (roughly 50 mph), opposite lane is full, and then someone tries to pass ones in front of him. I did clutch brake & move right to the limit while honking long at him. I was like going normal at the save time, after I was in clear the adrenaline side effect hits me. This happened twice in the same day, twice I've saved myself & my parents from death. \n\nI also have saved myself from a crash I would've caused. I was going in slightly hotter than the corner limit, understeer happens, I take my foot off of gas pedal and apply feather light braking to steer inwards. I had rails at around 40 centimeters to my left side, My uncle, front passenger at the time, was scared shitless while I was like nothing had happened. He then gives a short saying about my fast driving (which is justified, he technically drives for a living and he is scared easier if he isn't in control). \n\nThese all happened while I had under 10000 kilometers (6213 miles roughly) of driving distance. Basically Gold Nova 1 of driving, not too experienced, but has technical & theoretical knowledge. \n\n\n\n
6	Can't stop second guessing everything.	I'm literally stuck.\n\nI'll get an idea, start it, next day I can shake the feeling that I should be doing something else.\n\nRinse and repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you feel like you know what you're doing or have a direction in your life that you actually give a damn about?\n\nDid you have to develop one?\n\nI'm so fucking stuck trying to figure out what I should be doing and what I want to be doing. I get a big blank nothing when I ponder both questions and it's stopping me from enjoying almost anything.\n\nI rely on drugs when it gets too much and I need to get out of my head. The drugs literally are a life saver, I was at the end of my rope.\n\n Hobbies don't really get me out of my head. 
3	i’m exactly this way too. drugs and all lol. try setting a single long term goal (like a career goal) and working toward it little by little everyday. some days you won’t feel like doing shit and that’s alright. it’s more about just having some sort of plan in the back of your head each day, which should help. this is all anecdotal, but it worked for me.
2	Next time when you start something, just finish it for the sake of finishing it. I hate starting something and just leaving it. I mean, it's easy to do and I do it all the time. But if there's no finished product it's like nothing even happened. I think the more I leave stuff unfinished the more confused I get, at least partly because even when I try to finish something I have like a hundred different unfinished projects to choose from.
1	What's your age? 
58	She looks like one of us	
26	Not all ISTPs are traditional craftsmen/handymen(and women) Its a bad stereotype that many do fit but still more do not.
22	Idk if this is an accurate comparison... Unlike her, I usually curse out loud every few seconds while I'm working because I always screw up something along the way towards the final product lol
8	As an INFP, I can't even explain how inconceivable this is
9	April Wilkerson is a beast. She built a massive shop with just a few people to assist. Check out her YouTube channel.
2	While I know I can do shit like this, I absolutely hate manual labor. 
1	That looks like my ISTJ mom. I'm usually lazy af for that kind of thing.
1	I watched that video where she built the lean-to for her compressor. Very easy to learn from.
1	One of us...
1	Oh yeah, I could absolutely do that if I needed to, or atleast figure out how. By my count, that staircase took her a full 7 days of work to put together. If I had a full 7 days, all the materials and tools I needed, and I *needed* a new set of stairs like that, I'd be happily in her shoes.
7	Any Adult (40+ yrs) ISTPs here?	Wondering how you guys have changed over time, how your tastes have matured. 
15	I thought we all die before we get that old\n
13	Yes. I turn 61 on Tuesday. 
7	[deleted]
3	31
0	On sociopathy...	I recently read up on sociopathy (not psychopathy) out of suspicion (confirmed) that I might be one and boy I gotta say, ISTPs sure seem to fit the bill on this one 😂
26	no. we are definitely NOT sociopaths. sociopathy is completely separate from mbti. i wish this stereotype would die already. going by the functions, sociopathy seems like it would correlate with Fi rather than Fe anyways.\n\n-overly empathetic ISTP.
8	[deleted]
6	Nah
5	I went to double check the definition of sociopathy and ended up on tvtropes.  I hope you're happy.
10	if you genuinely believe you’re a sociopath, seek professional help please
1	You're not a sociopath or psychopath. If you feel fear and love even in small amounts then you're a normal human being. 
16	Developing physical habits when nervous	Do you tend to bite your lip, fidget, or develop some weird ass habits when under stress? \n\nAll replies are appreciated. 
12	Yep, nails and fingertip skin.  If I didn't constantly feel them for rough spots, they'd heal smooth, and I'd not have rough spots to try to smooth down by biting them...
7	I button and unbutton things. Maybe not purely when nervous, but when slightly stressed or when talking to someone about serious/important things. It's why I don't wear anything with buttons. My phone case has a little cover that flips open so you can charge it, I've almost broken that thing off like 20 times from absentmindedly flicking it open and shut. Buttons seem to be the most common, but it may be general anxious finger-fidgeting. 
3	Had to have it pointed out to me on stage because im completely unaware of what i look like: I grab my clothes, pants or shirt, when nervous or stressed. I rub my thighs up and down to relax a lot. Sometimes I do the thing where you rub your thumb and forefinger together during sadness and it feels nice and comforting. \n\nUsed to bite my nails but not anymore, glad i stopped that. My friend ana, another istp, does the nail biting real bad though. The most detrimental thing I do is I'll pull out eyelashes when under a lot of stress and anxiety, and I'll usually get a pretty immediate urge to pull them out (to the point of baldness) before I've had the standard ISTP three days to process the emotions.
3	I do something with my legs like... when you push a pedal, but really fast and constantly, where i live we call it the tailor sindrome (sindrome del sastre), is similar to the restless leg syndrome but it can be controled.
3	i have a key fob identification card i wear on a pull string badge at work (the only place i really get uncomfortable now that i’m a little older), and i always wear my picture off of it from using one hand to slide it in and out of the case when i’m uncomfortable. this is a really interesting thread lol 
2	I bite my nails. A lot. It’s a habit that I try to cure myself of, but then a stressful situation comes and bam! My nails are as short as stubs again. The thing is people have told me I’m one of the calmest people they’ve ever met, so I guess it just seems like I’m outwardly living a stress free life. But my nails tell a different story lol. 
2	I keep pushing my hair away from my face and I sometimes tap my finger tips against my thumb. 
2	I have so many but here’s a few I can list off from the top of my head \n\nFeeling my buttons on my collared shirt \n\nClosing my lips inward and biting down/ licking them\n\nPopping my fingers/neck\n\nScratching part of my face/itching my nose\n\n\n
1	Yes. I do tap my feet like I'm using twin bass drums, hold a rhythm with my hands like drumming, biting & eating fingernail side skin, Excoriation (picking at scabs). \n\nSome of my normal state weird habits is playing with my beard very much. I have a goatee with soul patch and I play with both of it, used to play with my hair when it was long, too. I do random stretches, walk fast, silently with almost non existent head bobbing & pass people with some excessive flair like near passes completed with half and full spins. Rhythm holding with music in general is my habit; Joint cracking is like my crack, I feel different when my joints needs cracking, rhythmic head movement with music is also existent in my weirdness list.
1	i pinch my arm or the back of my shoulder, and if i’m especially anxious, nervous, or frustrated, sometimes it gets really bad to the point where i bleed and rip off skin :/
1	Depends on the situation.\n1. Restless leg.\n2. Scratch my head with my shoulders.\n3. Gnaw on my clothes or whatever I can find.\n4. Nail biting.\n5. Head scratching.
1	Tapping my fingers sometimes. I talk to myself and purse my lips when I'm deep in thought, but that's about it.
1	I bite the shit out of my nails and twist my hair.
1	Also, kind of random but just stumbled upon this other sub-reddit: r/CompulsiveSkinPicking/ that seems to be entirely focused on this issue
1	I feel my thumb with my pointer and not in a way you won't know I'm doing it. It's almost a snap. 👌
3	Have you ever wrote poems to a girl?	I have wrote love letters to gfs.\n\nWhen i was ten i gave a love letter to a girl and she trashed it. \n\nWhen 28 i read a love letter to my crush. She said she was not interested.\n\nI keep doing this shit like i am a ten years old infj.\n\nWtf?\n\nMy current crush lives in a different city and i have wrote a poem already. I wish to send her a recording reading it aloud. I know i should not, i am not an infj nor a medieval poet but i cant stop the enthusiasm to love. 
15	Roses are red\n\nviolets are blue.\n\nI bang'd your mother\n\nshe was great too.
7	When I was a teenager. \n\nI’m glad social media didn’t really exist at the time. 
4	Yerr back in my emo band days haha 
2	I almost did this the other night. I got a few lines in and then trashed the whole poem. I’m good at analytical writing but have trouble with creating the imagery that poems need. \n\nI think it’s good to try though, I figure writing mushy poems builds up our feely side. 
2	Same story, back in school, I gave a love-letter to a girl I liked and she answered me with another one "Eat my foot thumb". After I figured out that some people have foot fetish😂
2	That's how i expressed my love in 6  grade to a girl. :). I love poetry for all the possible meanings of words and mental images it gives me.
1	I wrote a farewell letter(my crush was graduating) that left a lot of clues that I really like her. I dont think she got it. She just said "thanks" 
1	I've always loved writing, it's just so hard to get me to start. But no, the only thing I've ever made for a girl was a handmade "magic" wand after she lost the one she bought at a Ren Faire we went to. I think both that and poems come from the ISTP's urge to show affection through making something for someone. 
12	Anyone ever gotten fired from their job? How did it happen and how did you fare afterwards?	I hate my job, shocking, I know. I've gotten past the anxiety and have gone straight to not giving a fuck. I do the bare minimum and have made a couple mistakes. I know losing my job would flip my life upside down, which is usually enough for me to toughen up and get my shit together, but I really hate it that much. The thought of getting let go crosses my mind a lot. Have any of you guys ever gotten fired before? Why?
10	I've been fired a ~~couple of~~ few times.\n\nI once got fired for "potential fraud", which is nowhere near as bad as it sounds but was mainly to do with it looking like I'd done something I shouldn't to get my bonus. I might have done that thing, but it wasn't to get my bonus. I was very young and naive.\n\nI got fired from a bakery because the manager there considered the environment "too fast paced" for me. I'm sorry if they asked me to get a ladle and I stood in front of 8 giant spoons hanging on the wall wondering which was a ladle for too long. \n\nThe job before this one asked me to quit or they'd make things hard for me because I wasn't hitting sales targets.\n\nUmmm... I got fired from my first ever job (I think, that time in my life is *f u c k i n g   v a g u e*) but that will have been due to having too much time off sick. \n\nI've definitely been fired from jobs that I only lasted a week or so where I just eventually assumed I got fired because I stopped turning up. Several jobs have kept paying me when they shouldn't have.\n\nI did a temp job once where there wasn't enough for me to do so I only went in for like 2 hours or so a day. My manager didn't seem to notice, but I only ever put down the hours I worked on the timesheet he signed off. He tried to call me one morning but I didn't answer, and shortly after I got an email saying they were "taking another direction" and not to go back. \n\n...I think that's it.\n\nKinda hard to tell at this point. \n\nFor the past... 3/4 years or so I've learned to be responsible / accountable. 26/25 years in the making!\n\nBut quitting jobs that I hated in the past has always worked out well for me. I currently hate my job, but I now have shit to pay for so I have to do the nonsense "sensible" approach to work and wait until I have a new job to go quitting this one.
10	Yeah. I was bartending at a tasting room for a small distillery, job was great, but the manager was fucking crazy. Everyone just put up with her shit, but I couldn’t. I was definitely a favorite of the owners and I thought that would be enough to keep me around, but as I found out later, she gave them an ultimatum of “either he goes or I go.” And they fired me.\nBUT\nLike I said, the owners still liked me, so a few weeks later they reached out and asked if I wanted to help on the production side of the business! I was washing dishes during the time in between, so i jumped at the opportunity. They started me part time, so I was there a few mornings out of the week, and washing dishes some nights, bartending at another bar some nights.\nAt this point, I’m full time at the factory, and the  bar manager quit! I’ve happy to say this is the best job I’ve ever had. Being on the production side of things is a dream. No longer have to deal with stupid customers, and I get to be hands on in the production of booze! It’s a small company like I said, there’s really only three of us doing the behind the scenes stuff, so it seems like every day I’m doing something different. Couldn’t have asked for a better outcome.
10	If you hate your job that much then find a new one and quit your current one when you find a new one. Getting fired is not good for your wallet or your resume.
7	I work a trade and I am very efficient. I am crucial to my company. \n\nMy motto is work to the best of your ability for every dollar you are paid. Work intelligently and efficiently and make it to where you are an asset and a key player. I am the guy that keeps all hell from breaking loose. When shit hits the fan and everyone shuts down is where I shine. I outpace, out think, and solve every problem. \n\nIf you don’t feel like you care enough about this company or job to be that person, find a place or company where you are that person. Our personality type can be a power house when it comes to trade work or computer work. I have to work with my hands, but I know some guys who thrive in tech. So you may need a change up.
5	I did once. It was actually a great place to work, but the other developers didn't know what they were doing. Didn't understand inheritance, or OOP in general. I far outpaced them, but since they were in Lead positions, and didn't understand what I was doing, they shot everything down and instead took what the most junior guy wanted to do. A little bit of politics went into that, unfortunately. So the products got worse and worse, and I pushed harder and harder to make it right, so they canned me. Lol.\n\nI was there for years before it went to shit, so I had a fat severance/unemployment payout. I spent the next 9 months across the country with my brothers running rivers and trails (they were guides, so it was their job, and I tagged along for free). Came back and got the job I'm in now.
6	I was once fired unjustly from a job I liked. But life goes on. I got over it quick.\n\n I got fired twice and quit twice at another job. I was good at the job, but I didn’t fit in with the corporate culture. This one manager was really good and kept asking me to come back. She was really a good boss, I couldn’t say no to her.
5	I decided to quit before the shit hitted the fan. \nI was starting to feeling depressed at work, as almost nothing new was happening, and had to solve the same problems over and over, and I couldn't get resources to fix them permanently\n\nSo after a medical leave due to stress I asked to quit. the bright side is I still have a friendly contact with most of my coworkers and bosses at that company\n\nAnd they even helped to reallocate in other companies
4	Sort of? But to be fair, I was already quitting. And the reason I got fired was due to an action that was supposed to be my “I quit. I’m done with your bullshit.” They, being completely clueless business owners, did not realize I was quitting and tried to fire me. I laughed. I mean come on, I came in with regular clothes and my uniform in my hand 😂. \n\n\nBut I *have* quit jobs in the spur of the moment because something got so bad. So I have been dumped into unemployment unexpectedly before. \n\n\nBest thing to do? Hit the ground running. Don’t take a break until you have a new job lined up. “I’ll rest today” turns into “I’ll take a rest weekend” and then “I’ll find a job next week”. Don’t get into a routine of not working. \n\n\nBut, to avoid this all together, find a new job now. Start looking. Even if you find nothing, you simply wasted some free time. But if you do find s better job, you can ditch the shit one. 
5	I got fired from my job a little over a month ago. TBH I was fed up with the job and about to quit but my tardiness and an over zealous co worker sealed my fate. I lost the site and could have stayed at the company, but decided to cut my losses and quit.\n\nI got another job 1 week later with better pay, full benefits, and significantly closer to my house. I’d say I fared pretty well.
4	Currently unemployed. Fired for insubordination and attendance but it was actually retaliation. \n\nThey tried to throw me under the bus and contest my unemployment claim but they had nothing concrete to back it up. I disagreed with the process the lead wanted to do for safety concerns and unnecessary labor. So he told the owner that I lied on my time sheet, late everyday, insubordination, lazy, and trash talking. We rented a telehandler to lower a few thousand cages from several units 40 feet off the ground. He wanted to tie up tarps using clips and bungee cords to roll 10' cages down. They were unpredictable and someone still had to gather them up and put them into a pile. For the price of materials he bought to do this, he could've bought a 40' construction garbage chute. Regardless we had a telehandler rented for this task... Put hands on the cages once and drive them to a neatly stacked pile or put hands on them twice, risk damaging clients property/equipment or worse personnel. No brainer.\n\nThey took me off the schedule and jerked me around for 4 days. I knew i was going to be let go. No one had a straight answer for me. Jobs unfinished and I'm not scheduled at any jobsite. So I showed up anyways and cleaned shop. \n\n"There's nothing for you here, you might as well go home." \n"I guess I'll take X off Y job because we're shorthanded. You're not needed here, you should go home."\n"I'm unsure why this is, you have a meeting Tuesday."\n\nI just told them I'm here and ready to work and if they didn't have a jobsite for me that there's plenty to be done in the shop. All managers were acting shady, avoiding my questions, and suggesting i go home. However nobody would fire me...\n\nIn my exit interview I was told "Sorry, I feel like I'm doing this for someone else." I explained myself clearly and that I cannot be negligent to safety. Tho the manager I met with did not want to fire me he said he had no choice since I was accused of lying about my timecards. The kicker is that the other owner left shop before me each day that week. I finished cleaning up and set the alarm for the night after working 12-13 hour days. The day I was accused of being late, the lead called in sick. Instead of arguing for my job I thanked them for the opportunities and certifications they've provided. Wished them well and said goodbye.\n\nI'm counting this as a blessing. That company was dysfunctional. I am financially stable and looking forward to my next employment opportunity. 
3	Only been fired once. Led me to a great position that I have now. Except this job isn't remotely challenging or exciting and I've since come complacent. I'm beginning to think I'll never find a job I actually like. I've never had any sort of "dream job" for as long as I can remember, so it's not like I can go chasing that. I just sit on reddit all day and hope that someone catches me. I totally get where you're coming from. 
3	I got fired once, boss called me back 2 weeks after with a raise.  
3	I've been employed since the day I was legally old enough to get a job... 15 years later I got laid off (a few months ago) making me unemployed for the first time in my *adult* life. It sucked, big time. If I didn't have any (or many) expenses it wouldn't have been so bad, but paying $1500 rent, $400 student loans, $500 health insurance, etc on $800/mo income from unemployment benefits is impossible. It's really stressful, tbh.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go get a new job, don't wait to get shown the door at your current job. Fortunately for me I had already interviewed with another company before getting laid off and was only out of work for a month, but things could have gotten really bad... 
2	Got fired from my first job for being "talkative", never heard so much bullshit before. The real reason is that they want to get rid of employees without bond (there were 3 of us). They can't handle the fact that I can leave whenever I want, that's how petty they are ^^its ^^a ^^japanese ^^company. I'm in a better company now, but as for you, just quit man,
2	Yeah. They said I was texting on the job. I was actually flipping through my ipod, I had the touch so it kinda looked like a phone. But after six years I was more than sick of the place so I laughed asked if I needed to sign anything and left. Felt hella good walking out of that place though, didn't realize just how much I had hated it till then. Took me around two months to get a new job, been here six years now. Hate it too but better than my other options at the moment.
6	Do any of you have aphantasia?	
7	Yes. Though until maybe two years ago or so I didn't know it was a thing that existed. I always just figured I had basically the opposite of a photographic memory.
5	I do. I think it's why I can't do math "in my head". I don't see the numbers I'm adding.
6	If I think really hard, I can see pictures in my head. Like, I can think of what my wife or kids look like, I can think of what a baseball looks like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it's always like looking through black smoke at the object/person. And if I don't really concentrate, the smoke infulfs it.
4	Yes but I'd say it can be explained by having Ni and not Si. Si users have better memory because their inner world is concrete and based in the senses (AKA introverted sensing), whereas an Ni users' inner world is abstract, filled with shapes and colours and patterns. We can't really hone in on the detail of something, we just have a vivid hunch of what we are trying to grasp.  \nIf I tried to draw something from memory I would fail. I need a reference to copy from right in front of me.  \nThis is something [C.S. Joseph](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCELhS3lbQQ8GVa2UeoVXAkQ/) described as having good RAM but a poor Hard Drive.
3	I do not, and it still baffles me how so many people do.
2	No, not at all.I didn't know that this was a thing until you made this post.
2	Nope. I have extremely vivid mental images and memory. That’s part of our detail and observation oriented brain. It’s one of our main functions LOL. \n\n\nAs far as I can tell, it’s not related to personality type at all. If you search “aphantasia MBTI” you get zero science or studies. It’s all forums posts of random users guessing which it correlates with. \n\n\nBut not every mental characteristic is personality related. Not being able to visually recall memories sounds more like a physical brain error than a mental mindset thing. Like there’s a short circuit somewhere. 
9	Bad with names?	Having another insomniac night so I was reading other threads out of boredom and an istp in one made a comment about being bad with names. And something clicked in my head and made me want to ask if most ISTPs are this way... Cause I know I am.
16	Yes this is the problem with having Ni instead of Si. Your perceived inner world is abstract not concrete. You can't remember the details, but you remember the big picture, the gist of something - the pattern. You try to recall something, it's on the tip of your tongue and your hunch knows what you're trying to say but it just doesn't come to you.  \nhttps://youtu.be/1Ms65ihKPeI
8	It's a flaw we can overcome.  I try to make it a point to say the person's name three times during the course of the first meeting.  \n\nI don't say it lightly that it's a "flaw".  It's not just a "cute little thing" we do, no, it's a flaw.  It hurts people when we fail to remember their names.  To a person, their name is the sweetest sound that exists, and to lose it is to do them a disrespect, even if unintentional.  To get it wrong (as I've done accidentally) multiple times (as I've done, yes, while drunk) is a major embarrassment and to be excluded from their micro-circle for good unless amends are made.\n\nI've had to come to learn that after having someone forget my name every time despite having what I thought was a serious conversation.  The third interaction where he still forgot my name, I was ready to punch him out, that's how mad I was.  I forgot him instead.  All because of that.  He didn't think I had enough importance to occupy two small syllables in his brain.  I can still remember his smug and innocent smile and glassy eyes as if he had said it to thousands of people "Oh, sorry man, what was your name?"\n\nIf you're meeting people so often that it becomes untenable, then your best bet is to come up with a few saving lines to get them to casually announce to you (or someone else) their name so you can hear it.
3	... I don't remember. When I moved a while ago (I'm in hs), I just stopped remembering people's names because I couldn't keep up. Everything just started getting mixed together... couldn't separate the Jack from my old school and the Rebecca at the new one to the Jacob at the next school. Stopped trying. I also now can't even remember who's in my classes lol. Running joke that every time I talk to someone, I ask them "wait are you in my [subject] class?" for the (as I'm told) 10th time lol. Not sure if I was always that way, though. 
3	I'm horrible with names. I can forget a new name in one minute, lol.\n\n Face recognitin is actually interesting. Did you know it's a specific part of the brain in charge of facial recognition? If you have the condition where it doesn't work you cannot recognize faces. The brain can't compensate and use a different part of the brain.
3	I have a brilliant memory ^ always have
2	I am, and I am also very bad with faces. Once, a colleague of mine had changed her hairstyle and I utterly failed to recognise her, until she said something and her voice clicked in. That was... weird haha. Same with another one who had lost weight quite suddenly (I hadn't seen him in months).\n\nI'm not sure it's related to the name thing though, but I wonder if other ISTP have the same problem? I would think Se should actually help with this.
2	I have that problem. It is hard to solve, but try to use their names when first meeting them a few times. This should help a bit to aleviate the problem partially. \n\nBut for forgetting the name of someone who you know is bad, I did that once three years ago and my friends still joke about it. I have no solution for that other than to wait to heat their name again, nicknames work fine too.
1	Very rarely actually 
1	Almost everyone is bad with names in my experience. Or thinks they are. 
1	Meh. Takes me forever to find out someones name because I never ask but I usually remember it after I find out. I am however horrible with faces. For some reason I remember voices and how people move before I remember faces.
1	Yeah can't remember names at all.
11	Decadence, Degeneracy and Depression	Hi,\n\nI would like to share my feelings, feel free to share yours. \n\nToday, i have binged on food, smoked almost two packs and hired a hooker. I think when I am depressed I mess things up so I get in a worst state to rise from the bottom. \n\nProblem is I can't keep this decadent lifestyle for too long, it is expensive, health hazardous and doesn't fix anything. \n\nWhat POV to adopt? \n\n\n
14	stop doing it. no excuses... just stop OR at least try to do shit in moderation. I used to smoke a pack a day and now it is a pack every 5 days. I dont eat fast food at all but once a month go to a really good taco shop and I have no desire for the other garbage or burgers. Nothing wrong with hookers and again just use moderation, oh and work out. That helps the depression. 
5	You only live once. Use your hooker money on expensive vacations instead. Go see the world! 
5	Bro. Yolo.\n\nDo what you want to do or die trying.\n\nUnlike many other types we're actually good at risk taking and can work out most problems.
3	have fun for a bit and then pack it in and realise that money isn’t endless and you’re bleeding yourself dry 
3	Try to start thinking ahead. Like, where do you want to see yourself in 3 months? By next year? In a few years? Just stuck in the same place? 
2	Being healthy is popular now, which means theres more resources and social rewards and encouragement for it than ever before. I would definitely find some form of exercise to do everyday in the morning, that really helped me get out of depression. \n\nanother thing that really helped me during dark depressing times was making goals for myself that i knew i could accomplish; things that would make me happy, even if it seemed risky or unrealistic; If it makes me happy, its a reason to live, its hope, so its worth it. I would live for that, just to get there, and it did so much. It's a magic formula that i think i need to be repeating on a smaller scale everyday to reduce sadness and remind myself theres endless potential everywhere, and its all up to you everyday whether you tap into that or not. \n\npossibilities are endless. you just have to reach out for them. the choice is always yours, no ones gonna hand it to you and you gotta fight for it, but when you get there, its worth it. \n\nfind things that make you happy besides hookers and smoking and things you can buy and focus your energy into things that make you happy that are fucking free dude. get a hobby, make some friends, spend time doing stuff you like and get your highs off THAT. \n\nno gf? look at yourself and make yourself a better ass person, physically AND mentally. Be a more emotional, considerate, kind, thoughtful and respectful human being and you'll find someone. This takes time but while youre doing that work, dont forget not to place your value in the eyes of others, which, is something im currently struggling with. be better than me yo
48	how much do you relate?	
22	When I lack sleep I noticed that I zone out a lot. Like words coming out peoples mouths might as well be random noises in the background, I would have to ask them again or pretend I was doin something I forgot to do.
17	I can relate to that. (ISTP here) I've also generally noticed that Se users have this "alive and alert" type of look in their eyes and they're easily distracted by whatever is going on around them. 
16	I have to draw the curtains if I'm watching a movie, because every single car that goes past, I catch in my peripheral, and turn to look at it. Back road, so not much traffic, but I catch myself mid-turn saying "stoooop turning"\n\nSame thing when just out and about. I see everything. I look at everything. Handy for driving, at least. I always know where the other cars are, because I'm always looking around.
8	Hmm, Well, I certainly do have a tendency to be easily distracted by external stimuli. As for my "stare" or gaze, people have told me that it can be very intense. It's partially my body language and partially my facial expression I assume, but people have told me that while they found me really pleasant to talk to (I do have ok/decent usage of Fi/Fe, but not nearly as much as Ti/Te) after meeting me in a small group environment or 1 on 1, they found me extremely intimidating at other times, giving off a sort of aura of high intelligence and being too good to talk to, as if I believed myself to be vastly superior to the other people in the room. My tendency, as such, is probably to be either ridiculously focused on something to the point of ignoring virtually all external stimuli, or unable to focus due to sensual overstimulation.
7	Wheww I thought I was crazy lol I'm pretty sure I have ADHD tho too 
6	Relate 100%. It gets awkward when I catch someone picking their nose and we make eye contact.
5	I have selective hearing and if someone is boring, I am noticing everything around me and I pick out keywords and nod. But if I am lost in thought (Dominant Ti) I can zone out.
3	Ive had this problem with my ex, when something new enters my immediate environment, I gotta look. If it's a girl, queue a fight. 
2	Whats the source for this? Curious, i just wanna read the rest for the other functions. 
1	I'm hyper aware of my surroundings all the time and I can't turn it off. \n\nIt's seriously a problem.
1	Very. 
1	I've talked about it on r/istp once before describing a problem I had where I actually physically COULDNT tune out the outside world around me. My personal bubble is as wide as a house- I'm going to catch everything in it, and unless it stops moving or being in that bubble, I'm not gonna relax, ever. Thats why isolation and quiet rooms are the sanctuary I need where I \*can\* relax and process stuff. \n\nI also relate to the intensity, the stare, the physical alertness, asking others where the fuck they're looking, totally hit the nail on the head. \n\nIdk if other SP's have this but physical reaction is similarly second nature, in the way where if I am about to trip or fall, or am tripping, I'll naturally balance myself or right my body, ect. Without much thought. Similar reactions can happen with catching objects, and other timing/ in the moment stuff. The ability to take action instantaneously, the good physical instincts, all that good stuff. \n\nIt's all very nice but it doesn't help me much with life outside of being able to say I can do a backflip. Would much rather have the NF emotional people skills or something. 
1	I relate to noticing everything going on in my environment, and being distracted by it... but I've also been told I have an intense stare. I thought the intense stare was an ISTP trademark.
15	Pet peeves	Hello fellow ISTP’s\n\nJust here to find out the pet peeves of other ISTP’s out there. Here are some of mine, pretty much all of them have to do with people:\n\nHighly Emotional/sensitive people\n\nObnoxiously loud people\n\nSlow/stupid drivers\n\nPeople that show no respect for others\n\nSmall talk\n\nToo much talk\n\nPeople invading my alone time\n\n*People that presume to know what you’re thinking/how your mind works*\n\nPeople that think they know what’s best for me\n\n*People that think they know me better than I know myself*\n\nPeople that doubt or question your intelligence\n\nRules\n\nArrogance\n\nIdiocy\n\nWhen people pressure you to do things when THEY want it done\n\nWhen people ask me to do something they can do themselves\n\nBeing treated unfairly \n\nWhen people complain about trivial shit\n\nWhen people assume I’m emotionless or want me to be emotional \n\nWhen I know I could have done something better\n\nNeedy people\n\nPeople that don’t know how to have fun\n\n\n\nWhat are yours?
43	Long lists.
12	1. People that don't get out of your way when they see you walking in their direction. \n\n2. Cluttered or otherwise bad UI in programs or apps\n\n3. People that think AI and machine learning is synonymous with an artificial human and it's supposed to be sentient. This is basically just ignorance, but this example in particular I find very annoying.\n\n4. People that complain about problems that have obvious solutions.
12	Inefficiency \n\nLong, basically repetitive lists, for example.\n\nBut seriously, inefficiency.
5	I dunno. Things frustrate me from time to time. But keeping a master list of things that annoys me sounds like a perfect recipe for a bad day. People do things all day that are illogical or without reason. People and things bug me. \n\n\nBut dwelling on these negatives is no way to go through life. 99.999% if the time, that specific action will not affect you more than a short period of time. Wether it be 5 seconds or 5 minutes. But most of that shit is so mundane that it’s over as it begins. \n\n\nI let everything go to the best of my ability. I don’t dwell on minor inconveniences/annoyances/frustrations. I only put mental/physical effort into a problem if it’s one that will persist without being fixed. Somebody not using a blinker or making an illogical decision or getting in my way are all examples of shit that needs to be gotten over. It’s not a situation you can fix. And it’s not a situation that will affect you long term. So waste a grand total of 0 energy thinking or dwelling on it. 
2	Me too thanks
2	Lol. That's all sounds about right. People who think they know what I'm thinking are always dead wrong so it's incredibly irritating. And I really hate complainers. 
1	Hit em right on the head
1	Pet peeves? WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME WHAT I SAID BECAUSE THEY MISHEARD ME! I can't stand when I ask someone a question and they mishear and promise me I said what they misheard. It's silly. 
1	one pet peeve I have is when people call me tall/lanky and say stuff like "how are the clouds like up there?" or "I wouldn't mind stealing some of your height" or "wouldn't it be cool if modern medicine could cut some of your legs off and give them to me - then we can be the same height!"
6	ISTP and RPG Class ?	what is the rpg class of this type depending on their cognitive functions? I know that it can be any class but if they had to choose one what would it be?
15	ROGUE.
12	I always like playing ranger classes in games. My first serious D&D game was with a ranger character. Reliable, consistent damage at range, knows a lot of survival stuff and had a pet bear. I didn’t roleplay that much as I wanted tho.
7	Rogue, Ranger, Monk. 
4	Artificer. \n\nPretty much the mechanical MacGyver.
3	Any self-sufficient class that requires a lot of mastery.  \nProbably something like tinker, hunter, monk, scout.
3	Rogue (wow)
3	Ranger, Hunter, Marksman, Rogue, Shaman. My favourite classes and they seem to fit a ISTP profile.
2	Rangers might be the closest. It's a fairly universal class with good weapon proficiency and useful spells to complement it (unless you play it like Belkar who only took the class because two weapons = twice as many stabs and doesn't have the WIS to cast any spells).
2	I play support healer in Tera. Responsible for healing, buffs, cc, thralls, totems, and dps 
2	I always like being an adventuring sellsword who picks and chooses the things he wants to do. Someone who is also a master of many skills. In real life I am always constantly learning new skills and systems because I just want to and then get bored of them. Then way down the road there comes an instance when I need them. Jack of all trades kinda stuff.
20	ISTPS and insensitivity	Hey guys, I'm an ENFP here talking about my ISTP friend.\n\nI was just curious if insensitivity is a general ISTP weakness or just an individual weakness. To explain what I mean, my ISTP friend seems to be very intolerant of other people's religious and political beliefs. He often will criticize and insult my other friend on his religious beliefs (he is muslim) and when I tell him he should respect other people's beliefs he says he feels no urge to respect something that in his "logical" mind makes no sense. 
37	We like verifiable truths.  We value hard facts.  We abhor anything that doesn’t add up or make logical sense.  And we especially dislike it when falsehoods and fallacies are presented as facts. And, yes, our arguments can be biting and harsh. 
45	That’s simply being rude or being an asshole. Whatever you wana call it. Sounds like he’s got a good amount of narcissism. \n\n\nDue to the way our brains work, it’s not uncommon to develop a sense of narcissism. Our detail oriented brains tend to exude a certain sense of intelligence. But those of us who are *actually* smart enough to justify being narcissistic are also generally smart enough to realize how counterproductive narcissism is to social frameworks. \n\n\nI definitely started down this path. I spent a good amount of time feeing superior to my peers and authorities. I felt like I knew more and was better at analyzing life for productive results in any given scenario. I felt like my brain was more based in logic while others were based in emotion. But what I quickly realized is that I was separating myself from friends and family. Even though I was justified in feeling smarter (I genuinely am above average intelligence), expressing it was destroying my only ties to my social existence. Humans are social creatures. Our bodies are biologically designed to fail when our social quotas aren’t met. And I could feel it. I could feel the mental degradation stemming from social isolation. \n\n\nSo instead of using my higher level of intelligence to justify superiority, I used it to help people. When I see people making simple mistakes that cause problems, I help. When people have difficult emotional battles, I help. When people have shit being thrown into their fan, I help. I’ve turned my intelligence into a system of advice to help people where I can. So instead of feeling isolated and superior, I feel included and beneficial. \n\n\nI was able to find my social niche in this way. I’m not good at developing relationships or creating emotional bonds. But I am really good at is giving objective advice, even when my own personal feelings are effected. As long as I’m not advising *myself*, I can be fully objective. And that’s the one talent I have that I’m truly proud of. It gave me a way to fit into a social framework without all the traditional social skills that I did not possess. And all I had to do was shift my perception on intelligence. Instead of using it as an excuse to shit on people and separate myself, I used it as an excuse to get down and dirty with their problems and forge my own social niche. It’s a mutually beneficial relationship. They supply me with my social needs, I supply them with access to my problem solving and logic. 
14	Could be an emotionally immature ISTP. When ISTPs are young, we tend to completely disregard emotion and fail to recognize it in ourselves and others. We focus on logic, even though emotion is running the show from behind the curtains. Many ISTPs at this stage may be very angry, unaware it's affecting their behavior, until a last straw breaks the camel's back and we blow up with anger over the smallest thing.
6	It is worth considering how completely opposite an ISTP’s reaction to immediate social interactions, compared with someone comfortable with Ne and Fi. \n\nI’ve found if I speak my mind immediately in social situations where things like religion come up I will invariably draw a rebuke or some kind of nervous quick coverup from my ENFP friend. \n\nYour tendency seems to be to always see multiple other sides of the situation simultaneously, while I dig in hard on one facet. \n\nUsually I just shut up and smile for a bit and let my reaction mature for a few minutes. 
8	O o f. \n\nThis isn't an ISTP thing, this is an individual thing. And it's not an insensitivity thing, it's an asshole thing. Your friend doesn't have to like muslim or Buddhism or christianity or anything, really, but he doesn't have to be a dick to people about it, and needs to rationalize that too much life lived by logic and fact traumatizes the children, Harold. Just let them believe what they want to believe. \n\nThough many ISTP, myself included, can have problems with insensitivity, and generally being emotionally (and therefore socially) unaware, this example really takes it to the extreme. I want to say most ISTP when insensitive are much more passive and unintentional about it. More oblivious to it, or unaware, not intending to be disrespectful or cause harm. However when confronted with Harm, a healthy ISTP will generally apologize and correct themselves. Your ISTP hasn't done that, and should be considered a problem child in a type full of problem children lol
22	That seems pretty rude. I can see an immature or unhealthy ISTP doing this but most are pretty tolerant of others as long as they aren't jerks. 
5	This is him. Most of us aren't outgoing enough to be purposely harsh like that for no reason. Like yeah, we may be a little insensitive and not realise that what we say can be hurtful, and we may mock stuff we don't agree with when in the company of our friends, and we can be the meanest people on earth when tempted, but we are not purposely harsh without cause. 
6	Yeah I think we can be insensitive at times. We strongly dislike things that aren't backed by facts, and we sometimes have difficulty gauging the impact our words have on people. But it also sounds like your friend just needs to shut up and choose his battles better.
2	When Ti principles repress Fe values you get insensitivity - Ti doms who look down on people they think are stupid.  \nhttps://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/135002965032/how-functions-work-inferior-fe-istpintp
4	That your question getting down voted is showing how messed up our type is. \n\nAsk your friend how he would feel if someone dismissed out of hand his expertise on something he feels is an expert in. Let him know that’s how others feel when he dismisses their faith.
1	You say weakness, I say strength. He might be the most open-minded person you know.
1	He should be nicer, but no one is entitled to respect on a mental level. Idk.
-1	Religious and political ideologies are worthy of ridicule.
1	Please help with my suspected ISTP brother!	I say suspected because I don't remember his results, but he's pretty ISTP and my mom is a hardcore ISTP. ANYWAY, my brother's 24 at the moment and also suffered a traumatic brain injury to his brain stem when he was born. This has resulted in a time delay in terms of his reactions(physical reactions and responding to people). He gets lost in thought a lot, chooses not to interact with most people(I think he's self conscious), and is on his 6th year of college because of his chronic procrastination. \n\nUltimately, I would love some tips which have helped you guys organize your lives! None of this would matter if my brother was happy, but he's told my mom he was suicidal in the past and he really just wants to be independent in life. But, since high school his amount of social interaction has gone way down and it also seems like his ability to complete tasks has suffered too. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. What jobs have you landed in without a college degree?\n2. What tools do you use to complete everyday tasks and get your work done(planners, apps, executive functions coaching??)\n3. For those who have consciously tried to make friends, how and where?\n\nThank you so much for any help you have to offer. This probably has more to do with his brain injury than his mbti, but what works for one personality may not work for another. In addition, if there is anything you think a worried INFJ sister could do to help the situation or persuade an ISTP mom to do would be great!\n\n 
4	Istps lead with Ti Se. We do things and real changes are proof in our eyes of our ability.\n\nWith that we generally gain self confidence.\n\nThis ties to feeling of "independent".\n\nSo one idea I can share is for him to find something he can be really good in. \n\nJobs, friends, self confidence etc can naturally branch off from there. Maybe. My Ni is rusty.
2	Support him in what he enjoys. Most things can become a job these days. Don't suggest things to him, he has to think of it himself. Otherwise he'll feel like he's just following other people's directions. \n\nIstp get stuck in ruts when progress isn't made and when we think too much and do too little. We also need a fuck ton of privacy. I can't think straight if I'm not alone 6+ hours a day. Preferably weeks tbh. I get confused when there's too much socializing. I recently switched too a night time schedule and I'm tons more productive just because I'm alone half my day. \n\nJobs where he can have independence and make an impact on people would be ideal. 
2	Sounds like me about 10 years ago to the T. I suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq and had problems adjusting to civilian life and dealing with depression. I was also 24 at the time.\n\nWhat got me out of my head was physical exercise and a motorcycle. The motorcycle gave me the freedom to travel since at the time i couldn’t drive a car because I drove in Iraq and that messed me up. It also allowed me to converse and socialize with other motorcyclists.\n\nAs far as work without a degree, I got into security and worked my way into hospitality.\n\nProcrastination is still a problem for me as I tend to live in the moment and do what I want to at the time. At the same time, I also realize there are things I must do even though i don’t want to as I have bills to pay.
2	I don’t really “work out” as I find gyms to be boring. I just run and do a few body weight exercises. I also run as stress relief so if something is bothering me, after my run I’m not even worried about it anymore. \n\nMotorcycles are fun. I’m working on getting my nieces into dirt bike school. That may be something you can facilitate and bond over.

97	My school life.	
13	One of my best college essays was written between 4 and 8:30AM before a 9AM class. 6 pages about the history and aftermath of the east coast/west coast hip-hop feud of the 1990s
12	I've started just getting things done as soon as I get it. It's more efficient and I get to do it right. Took a while to train myself to do this, and sometimes I slip up. This is post-school stuff though.
6	[Same](https://i.redd.it/n8i4oh04h4cz.jpg)
6	Cut this shit out if you're hoping to be gainfully employed.
4	And this is the reason why I failed uni and ended up dropping out lol
2	This is me at work too. Damn paperwork\n
2	I always just did the work when I got it so I wouldn't have to worry about it. I procrastinate on  just about everything else though. 
1	Did this for years😂 luckily I had a few classmates that also always was slow starters, usually we did two weeks of worth of studying during the weekend.. and went drinking mid week😎 low pressure equals low effort for my part..
1	Same, even now tbh
13	Processing emotion, showing emotion, and oversharing	Wondering how you guys deal with emotion. I've experienced some trauma in the past and I have been left pretty confused about emotion in general. \n\nI am unable to cry when thinking about personal issues or my traumas. Ever. However, I sometimes cry randomly. Not totally randomly, but for example I was listening to a song I love in my car before class a few days ago and I just started tearing up. Not a sad song and I don't have any negative associations with it, I just started crying. The reasoning was totally undiscernible and I couldn't tell if they were sad or happy tears. I only cry maybe once every three months, and it's always about something totally impersonal, like a movie. \n\nI also tend to overshare. I often tweet my deepest feelings. I'll tell a friend everything that I'm feeling, then realize how inappropriate/burdensome it was the next day.\n\nDo you guys relate? How do you deal with stuff like this? 
6	>The reasoning was totally undiscernible and I couldn't tell if they were sad or happy tears. I only cry maybe once every three months, and it's always about something totally impersonal, like a movie.\n\ncan relate. sometimes i'll see something mildly emotionally provoking and start tearing up and it's soooooo random, because 99% of the time, it's something that wouldn't affect me. i also have a soft spot for things in bad situations that can't help themselves (think: animals or really old people) and that can make me teary eyed.\n\n>I also tend to overshare. I often tweet my deepest feelings. \n\ndo not relate at all.\n\n>I'll tell a friend everything that I'm feeling, then realize how inappropriate/burdensome it was the next day.\n\ncan relate.\n\nare you an istp? you don't strike me as an istp.
6	I relate to this so hard. Grandma dies? Well she was elderly and had health problems and cycle of life...  Watch Saving Private Ryan? Why is my chest so tight?\n\nOversharing, its weird. Like when I know someone is "in" I let them have it. It isn't on purpose per say, but it is like a "I think you can be on the inside, so here is the real me. Do you accept?" but after such a emotional info dump, I'm back to my stoic self.
3	I’ve cried, like, properly cried at least 3 times in the past 6 weeks. Just blubbing, inconsolable, ugly crying. \n\nI have been through phases where I thought I should be able to cry at things. Or I’d think about something really sad that had happened to me and I’d get super melancholic, but I still wouldn’t cry. I’ve tried forcing tears in the past too, by listening to sad songs. But then they kind of come out as sort of happy to be feeling tears. \n\nThe things I’ve cried about recently haven’t really been all that bad. It’s mostly been when something jarring happens.\n\nI got temporarily banned from driving; cue many tears and an un-winnable argument with a technician in a hospital, which at one point I had to walk away from because it wasn’t going well.\n\nAnd then I’m dating... Or trying to. And one guy I really could have seen something with told me he didn’t find me attractive. LOTS of tears. I felt a major way about him.\n\nI went on another date with a different guy and exactly the same thing again. 3, 2, 1... Cry!\n\nBut I didn’t cry when my Grandma died. I didn’t cry at the funeral of a friend of the family who’d been around forever and died in genuinely tragic circumstances, way before his time. I didn’t cry when I decided that I was done making effort with my dad. \n\nA lot of melancholy and not really feeling anything. But major events that seem like they  “should” make me cry? Nothing.\n\nIt’s weird.
3	I think the "random" crying we experience isn't actually random, but actually the boiling point for internalized (compartmentalized) emotional stress that we chronically ignore, both by conscious choice \*and\* unconscious repression. \n\nWe unconsciously repress because we naturally do not have very developed emotional intelligence, and often aren't conscious of all that there is to feel (ever notice how other people have so many thoughts and so many feelings about so many different things, and we just... don't? Not consciously, anyway.) and we consciously repress because emotions are difficult, scary, and not easy to handle. The combination creates a bottling so strong that we are actually able to forget about it. So when the emotions are ready to burst, and the stress is too high, we start to cry or laugh. \n\nIt only feels or looks random on the surface because we can't pinpoint a source, because we are designed to look for physical external sources, (like an injury or recent incident)  and not emotional internal things, (like events or memories that could've happened at any time, and simply resurfaced.)\n\nThis was a huge thing for me to realize, that I literally do not know how to feel all of my emotions. That I am only conscious of about a 3rd of them at any given time, and that small portion of emotion alone can take days to process. I will often have to wait 3 to 5 days before I realize something made me angry, or upset. Instantaneous emotional reactions will always have days worth of lag unless the person is very close to me, or I am very comfortable with them, and even then it can take sometime. It's an incredibly weird concept that took a long time to figure out because you obviously can't compare your ability to feel to anyone elses.\n\nSometimes when I'm emotional I don't even know which emotion I'm feeling. Only that I'm upset, but have incredible difficulty articulating what I'm upset about, or if I'm angry or sad or both, and usually need people to help me sort them out. \n\nOther difficulties include emotions being very strong despite being mostly unaware of them. Its' terrible, because it means I have to not be regularly bothered, I have to be really REALLY bothered and upset if anything is to come to the surface. \n\n&#x200B;
2	TV shows make me cry sometimes and idk why exactly. I’m not really emotional and don’t express much emotion. I think it’s because it’s a “safe” avenue for me to express emotion. And by that, I mean the expressed emotion holds no bearing on my life. It isn’t tied to complicated emotions, drama, difficult events, a loss, etc. Its simply an emotionally charged piece of fiction. \n\n\nIt used to bother me, but now it doesn’t. I’ve found that it actually helps a lot with my “real” emotions. Sometimes a man just needs a good cry. And it’s easy to enjoy when you know it’s not because of anything that affects your life. As soon as the scene is over, and the tears are gone, it’s completed. There’s no need for afterthought or problem solving or critical thinking. It’s a simple trigger emotion, experience emotion, move on type thing. \n\n\nIt’s a straight forward and painless way to experience and express healthy human emotions, in my opinion at least. 
10	Disrespecting Se	This is a hyper specific complaint but I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels the same way about it:\n\nPeople who have a tendency to disregard facts, or facts given, really bothers me. Usually this is Nf's, particularly me with the INFJ and ENFP, though it can happen with INFP but I've had a fairly good history with them and they tend to be respectful. I most noticeably have the issue with Ni doms though. Like reality and Se just doesn't exist or something. \n\nIt's like you're a tool to be milked for information they won't even respect, and it really pisses me off. The basic example would be an INFJ/INTj asking you any question (usually easy to tell as it will be pointed and specific) and then when you've given the answer they either immediately disregard it, come to a loud verbal conclusion that what you said is either not true, you are wrong, or it must be something else because what you've said can't possibly be true, but really it's less about whats right and logical and more about what they would personally find more appealing to think themselves. They'll just never admit that. \n\nThe only time I've ever seen them shut up and accept it for what it was was if I could physically show them, through an act. If you ever have the opportunity, please do it. It's so funny. One time,  one thought it would be "impossible" for me to cut off a plasticpaper wristband with a butterknife at our table, for whatever reason. Still confuses me to this day why they thought that, but having the paper band snap off my wrist in the middle of their banter about how I'll have to keep it on the rest of the night and wait agonizingly until I found some proper scissors, was hilarious. Their mouth hung open in the air. A solid "How" makes it's way from the INTJ. Like it was unfathomable. An holy act explainable by man, science too lowly for weak mortals to understand. \n\nFavorite memory. \n\n&#x200B;
12	Its just a matter of different perspectives, and maturity as well. Since ISTP has se higher in their stack, along with ni directly after, they see the value of tangible data being used to support ideas. INxJs have ni as their first function and se as their last, so they subconsciously disregard se in favor of their ni, thinking that their ideas are so well thought out that se need not apply. I have an INTJ friend too, and its fun to see the look on his face as i physically accomplish what he thinks couldn't be done.\n\nDon't get too worked up about it, if your INxJ friends are decent, they'll grow up to learn the value of se, and appreciate the fact that they have se oriented friends to help develop them
4	I think INTJs are just instigators. Your story sounds very similar to arguements I've had with my sister and most of the time it wasn't because she thought she was right but because she knew I would get mad at her, which she finds hilarious for some reason.
4	This is more about maturity levels than anything MBTI related. \n\n\nIt’s a little unfair to peg these accusations to a specific type, rather than a specific person. There isn’t one single quality that every person of a type carries. MBTI isn’t a specific description to each person. It’s simply an outline of tendencies. \n\n\nWether or not you want to accept it, putting people in these boxes can be harmful. You expect a specific behavior and end up getting a self-fulfilling prophecy. It’s the same way racism and sexism came about. Races and sexes were boxes that people were put in. And they were given stereotypes. Next thing you know, you have a bunch of people acting out their stereotypes while also demeaning the existence of said stereotypes. \n\n\nHaving negative opinions toward an entire personality type, and not to specific individuals that you know within said type, can cause prejudice. It causes you to tack those stereotypes onto other people in that type, regardless of wether or not they’ve displayed the behavior. You end up expecting that behavior, looking for it, finding it, and going “see I was right!” Even though there are numerous variables *aside* from personality that played a role. \n\n\nSo I highly suggest that you rethink dolling out these types of opinions that are directed towards the type and not the person. Because at the end of the day, every person is an individual and cannot truly be placed in any boxes. \n\n\nMy point here is even shown by your post. You’ve attributed this negative quality to an entire type(s) due to some experiences with people in it. But what you’ve appropriated as a personality trait is actually more based in maturity levels. While someone’s MBTI type may allude to their rate of maturity progression, actions directly committed due to immaturity are not personality traits. They are about an immature person acting in self interest. An immature ISTP is just as likely to act in self interest as any other type. It just shows in different ways and different types of actions. 
2	I'm sorry you've been unappreciated and disrespected. :(\n\nI (INFJ) would think that way a lot when I was younger.
1	I think its kinda funny that you are basically pissed about them making and assumption, then you lump intuitives together and make an assumption based on that... xD Good stuff man.

10	ENFP x ISTP ...is it even like...possible?	I'm sure that it's possible...But I've never felt so lost about a person.\n\nSo I'm a sophomore in College and I met this freshman girl one day. I literally just saw here and I walked up to her and I was like "I love your hair, you should add me on Instagram." She was just like, super chill about it. She was super chill about everything. \n\nSo I invited her to hang out the next day and it was supposed to just be she and I, but then all my friends came out of nowhere and she got really quiet...like...she didn't talk at all...and we sat around for about an hour talking...but she didn't talk...and I thought it had to be because she was just a super introvert because she seemed to be able to hold a conversation with just me...\n\nSo I texted her about MBTI...I guessed that she was an ISFP because she's an art major but she told me she is ISTP...when we text she doesn't give me much to work with...and it kinda freaks me out that she doesn't want to talk moreeee.\n\nSo then a day later I invited her out to chill again...and it was just me and her and we talked and I got her to smile and laugh a bit. She told me about how she wanted to play rugby and shit...she is just like...way too chill. She almost seems high lol...I noticed that when we talk I use kinda heavy eye contact...and when I look her in the eye she kinda looks away...which implies that she might be a little shy or nervous Idek...\n\nI feel like...so I invited her to another thing for tomorrow and she is down to come. So like...how can I tell if she likes me or not? Should I just ask her? And I feel like I'm doing too much. Should I stop talking so much? She keeps coming to hang out with me so...that's a good sign right? She is just like...super hard to read... Ugh...thanx... I know I'm rambling...sorry
24	ISTPs are hard to read because we don't share what we're not 100% certain of. Also we don't share with people we don't like.\n\nKeep the people to a minimum. Crowds suck. If she's hanging out with you she's interested and she's assessing you basically.\n\nIf she wasn't interested she wouldn't even try. But it's too soon to know if she actually wants to pursue anything with you.\n\nI don't know if it's an ISTP thing but I generally don't like looking into peoples eyes. Weirds me out. I'll do it if I have to.\n\nMy relationships all kind of just happened to me, it was usually the other person forcing themselves into my life and as long as they were nice about it, I let them. Go with the flow kinda.Don't stress about it, don't force anything, don't get emotional or she'll run for the hills, definitely don't make any ultimatums. Be chill about it, like she is. But be yourself, obviously. Respect her privacy and need for solitude. You will have to instigate most conversations and activities but make sure to give her choices. Ask her questions about herself and her beliefs and be ready to discuss at length.
9	Give it some time but simply put, if she’s spending time with you and seems to be enjoying herself, she likes you. Whether romantically is yet to be seen. I’m going after an ENFP girl right now and I’m noticing I tend to open up more emotionally to people I’m romantically interested in, though YMMV on that one. \n\nISTPs also value directness. Once you guys are more comfortable together you could just straight up ask how she views your relationship. You’ll get an honest answer. 
3	lmao this is every person who's ever complained about how i behave ever. female ISTP here, sit down son. \n\nOkay so the first thing you want to do is acknowledge that ISTP are not normal. We are a very different type of brain and a very different type of person. We will put all normal social cues, expectations, and behaviors you have learned and been taught to look for right out the fucking window without much effort and not feel bad about it. No, we cannot change to be more normal, don't attempt to make us. Just accept that this girl is genuinely cool, as we are, but she's also going to throw you a curveball when it comes to courting. Expect it, accept it, go into it with an open mind and just ask questions if you're confused. To her, specifically, in a setting she's more comfortable in. \n\nSecondly, we are at our most comfortable and our best in one on one interactions. We can chill with groups and party, sure, it's possible, but not all ISTP's have the confidence for that, or the desire. She probably felt ambushed by the sudden appearance of all your friends coming out of the wood work. Give her a warning next time, and leave her the option of choosing to socialize with all of them or not. She's going out to see you, and that's what she expects. Not you and ten people she doesn't know. \n\nAsk her questions. Ask her about her preferences. Ask her about her boundaries, ask her what she wants to do and what she feels comfortable with. We do not like to push our standards on other people so we don't openly say them, and often don't have the social skills to tell when others would actually like to know, so please just ask her and tell her "hey i want to know xyz things!" and it will encourage her to tell you about them beforehand so neither of you has to play mindgames trying to figure out why shes so weird. \n\nI have often been called "too good to be true", "way too chill", "really cool" ect. It feels narcissistic to say but... people seem to really like us or sometimes see us as really cool people, like this, and all of it is 100% genuine. IDK why we in particular, esp ISTP females, always end up with this kind of awed comments-- Are other people really not better?-- But we don't like lying or acting or being fake. We can, but we don't unless we have reason to, and we can even be very aggressive or feel very strongly about being ourselves, unapologetically. This is where you get a lot of bad boy stereotypes, and often will find a lot of ISTP even going out of their way to show they may not be like others, often getting tattoo's, piercings, dressing or acting a certain way to send that message. 
3	Let me say one thing.\nI'm a female ISTP, and I don't spend time for a man who is not interested.
2	I’m an ENFP and my husband is an ISTP. We’ve been together for 19 years. It can work, but as an ENFP you have to remember that ISTPs sometimes just aren’t capable of showing the kinds of feelings/emotions that we show. We can come off annoying as hell and they can come off so aloof you wonder if they even LIKE you, let alone love you. 
2	Yep. You'll get used to it, don't worry. Just remember that they don't like unnecessary talking. If you just share something with her like "Oh I saw this movie and I liked it", don't expect to start a conversation if she has nothing to say about it or if you don't clearly ask a question back, same through texts. They dont care for keeping small talks alive. I've noticed they usually don't mind comfortable silence- which is something I wasn't used to but was actually pleasant. \nAs ENxPs, we often don't realize how much we tend to just overshare whatever our Ne picks up, and with ISTP mindset being so different, it definitely made me realize I should shut up more sometimes haha.\nBut when you get them started, you know it'll end up being an interesting conversation. Sometimes they come off as really at ease with strangers, and some other times, not. I have yet to understand why and how lol
2	I'm an INFJ and my husband is an ISTP.  Until recently, we have struggled with communication.  MBTI has helped bridge the communication gap for us because we have that knowledge about our communication preferences.  As an NF, I want to talk about all the feels and he wants to talk about none of it.  He views it as "wasted communication" from his perspective.  So when I talk to him, I try to approach feelings from a logical perspective.  "X happened today and made me feel Y" so it's more like a problem to be solved rather than "OMG I am so stressed out about X" cuz that just makes him shut off.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we first started dating, he was the persistent one, he was eager to impress me.  (I loved it!)  So I'm not sure how to address her super chill mode.  I do know, though, that talking incessantly won't win her over so you have to try to focus on reigning it in.  I would maybe suggest trying to activate her Ti by asking her about things that interest her.  Get her talking about things she likes and she'll get more comfortable being around you.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also suggest diving more into the MBTI stuff with her.  If she's like my hubby, he was interested in how it worked and when he understood it in depth, we started having long conversations about emotions.  He thought it seemed all touchy feeling kumbaya stuff at first.  When he started learning the process of like, the function stacks and stuff, he found it much more engaging.  And it has lead to a lot of open honest conversations.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also found that ISTPs like bluntness, so I would be flat out honest with her and tell her you like her.  Share your intentions with her up front.  She won't appreciate your subtle hints.  
14	How did you decide you weren't an INTP?	I often confuse myself with ISTP or INTP. To those with a similar dilemma, how did you figure yourself out to be ISTP over INTP?
28	I'm cool and if I was INTP I woudn't be.
21	Im better at hiding my crippling antisocial tendencies
18	Books/Theory. I hate those.
12	Not being into lenghty conversations.
9	idk im pretty much a stereotypical intp for most parts except I have social skills and I like being active/outdoors and making sure I look good so there's that 
7	Do you know anyone of either type IRL?\n\nI find Ne types *very* noticeable, but in a way that’s difficult to briefly qualify. \n\nLike the thread of conversation is constantly jumping in a direction I didn’t quite anticipate. 
6	Because I like doing things.
6	Motorcycles.\n\nI've never met an INTP that would not view a motorcycle as a Deathtrap waiting to happen.
4	I'm right on the cusp of ISTP/INTP. More ISTP leaning but not by much. On every test I always get like 49% vs 51% on S vs N. So I'm right on the edge there. I Also find myself relating much more to INTPs than I do ISTPs.\n\nISTPs supposedly have energy and a drive to action and gut instincts, I cant say I've experienced these things.\n\nThe deciding factor for me is my need for practicality. I will sit and analyze and discuss and do all the Ti heavy shit but the moment it goes from practical to theory I will quickly lose interest. I can discuss theory for an hour or so but INTPs tend to be able to discuss theory with no practical value for HOURS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also prefer to improvise my life. If I could, I would probably improvise literally everything all the time. I prefer being in the moment and problem solve as I go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis compared to needing a perfect plan with steps to achieve said plan for INTPs. Look up the temperaments; Improviser (ISTP) vs Theorist (INTP). [http://www.bestfittype.com/Models/Temperament.cfm](http://www.bestfittype.com/Models/Temperament.cfm)
2	Read about the difference of Se-Ni interactions and Ne-Si interactions. It should start to become pretty clear after awhile even if function descriptions on their own were unhelpful
2	Yeah, I used to have this problem. Here's the differences: http://www.practicaltyping.com/2018/08/27/ixtp-ixfp-am-i-an-n-or-an-s/
2	i tend to associate intp’s with thinkers and istp’s with doers, and i by far fit the latter 
1	You can see the diference between decision making of NT and SP.
1	I always thought I was an INTP with a lot of Se as the mechanic stereotype and being into sports didn’t fit me. I like to look good and am very active and don’t like long winded discussions about theory
0	To this day I'm still thinking inbetween ISTP/INTP. I scored high Ne overpowering my Ni but for some reason I still scored higher Se than Si. Even though I have this laziness and indecive/overthinking as INTP type would, I also have this boorish attitude toward theories that can"t be applied in the real world. I'm never really a bookish person nor into reading information that I prefer real life examples and hands on experience. I have terrible memory to recall things too.\n\nThis whole MBTI theory even fucks me up more just overthinking (esp when I remember this personality types is all a theory) which is why I just try to forget this dilemma and settle for ISTP cause this is where I relate most of the time. I'm just waiting for new informations to come up to be really convinced. In the meantime, I'm still in the same boat as you and you made me brood over it again.
7	ISTPs, how do you use your Ti in daily situations?	
28	How to do something with the least amount of effort ;)
23	let me sum it up for you:   🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔\n\n### 
16	Think, all, the, time
12	Example: I did well in school but also didn’t see the long term point when younger. I never connected what I was learning to what I wanted to do (something I realize SP’s have trouble with). So it became what do I need to do to get out of here? (Immediate problem solving vs long term planning). \n\nI could study hours a night to get a 4.0 or I could just pay attention in class and not study and get a 3.2. So...I’ll get a 3.2. \n\nSame result that I graduated but saved myself crazy hours and effort that IMO wouldn’t pay off. \n\nLooking back, I see now that we need the end goal first then fill in how we want to get there. Otherwise, we can get aimless and cut corners. \n\nSchool would have been much better if what we learned was actually reinforced directly with real world applications. \n\n\n\n
6	My question is how do I stop?
1	see coffee cup needs refilling. wait out how long i can go without coffee. get bored. go to kitchen. refill coffee cup. 
0	Is having chronic migraine proof for using Ti too much on daily basis that I cant even sleep at night? I cant relax most of the time
9	Quit smoking?	Did any of you fellow ISTP managed to quit smoking? If so what worked best for you?
17	I did. Smoked for maybe 10 years then just gave it up. Just like that. \n\nI mean, it was hard, that first week is killer and even the first year feels wrong. But if you can make it past a year, it's pretty smooth sailing after that.\n\nDidn't do anything fancy, just quit. Willpower, mind over matter, or something like that. Quitting means not ever again, not even one, not even a puff, just nothing ever again. Anything less than that is just a crutch and not an actual fix.
13	The way you frame it makes such a difference. Dont think of it as quitting.  No one likes a quitter, no one likes to quit. \n\nWhat you are doing is returning to breathing normal air.  Say that a few times until it sticks.  \n\nThis is the positive way to frame it.  
9	Sort of! I vape now.\n\nWhich went really well.\n\nIt’s cheaper, (as far as we know) the health effects are nowhere near as damaging, it doesn’t stink. What’s not to love?\n\nI still get the nicotine but now I have taste buds.\n\nIt’s magic, man. Give it a go. 
4	I stopped after 8 years 50 days ago. It helps if you quit with someone
4	For me it was wanting to quit for me not for anyone else. When I stopped enjoying and wanted to quit I was able to cut way back then quit with in a month. When ever I had really bad cravings the quick mist was the only thing that I found helped. I stopped using that about I five days  after my last cigarette. But I did keep it on my person for about three months just in case. 
2	Vaping. Smoked and dipped for two years. Took about a month of vaping to put the dip down for good. Took about 6 months of going back and forth to put the cigs away for good. Now I’m just a vape man. I keep a little pocket sized vape that produces about the same throat hit of a cig and about an equal amount of vapor to smoke. So it’s a pretty simulated cigarette hit and is extremely convenient for getting a fix without bothering anybody with clouds. \n\n\nI feel ten times better afterwards. Getting my sense of taste back was the best part. 
1	I just stopped buying them, I find food more addicting.
23	Finally reconnectin with my inner self	Don't know if it is the right place, but I just wanted to share my recent accomplishments. It's been a rough year, I'm a undergrad student and I had so much on my mind for the last 3 years because I invested all my time in studying with almost zero results, got slightly depressed because of it and felt like something was wrong and I was basically stupid. I finally took that ugly exam that stressed me out and now I have some time off before my internship starts.\n\nI've always been more a practical than a theoretical person, but I think during this time I almost forgot how it felt like to have something to achieve something because I was so focused on studying and overthinking about it.\n\nSo I bought a penny board, I always wanted a board since I was a child and it felt so good, I tasted again the feeling of learning something from ground zero and loved it. \n\nAnd in the last few days I also picked up the guitar, I could play along some chords but I never learnt music theory and god it's challenging but   I finally understand what a major scale is and I  even learnt to play it. \n\nIt's not much but finally I feel like I am actually not stupid but just been stressed out all the way. I hope this could be helpful for anyone whos struggling with something similar, just find the time to explore, pick up that thing you loved as a child and experiment. You will feel good. \n\n(Thank you for coming to my TEDtalk)\n\nEdit: sorry for the typos!! 
10	I feel you man. You chose the life path that society told you to. We all did. And at some point, we realize we are the vast minority. Societies plug and play adult life programming doesn’t work for us. \n\n\nCongrats on coming to this realization and taking control again! It’s Suh a freeing feeling right? 
9	There's a exercise that may help you and everyone else get a fresh look at what this existence is going to be used for. Set a timer for 10 minutes, find a pen and paper, and write down everything that you want to do. Don't think, don't ponder, just run through your mind and desires and everything that you want to do. Then get rid of some silly ones (first man on Mars, Playboy playmate, ect), get rid of some completely unrealistic ones (NASCAR driver, professional footballer, CEO of ______), and from what's left you can do some research and find a passion. Then you keep 2 or 3 of the best things on that list, and you work towards them every single day until you make enough money at one of them that you can do it for a career.\n\nI wouldn't say to *completely* disregard any of them, but it depends on how wild or far-out your desires are. In a year, do it again.
5	Yeah, I met somewhere a thing that for ISTPs the best method to overcome depression an stress is to take something simple and master it.
5	Odd thing happened	I'm curious what other people think about the situation.\n\nI work in a store. A lady came in, I know her by face and some about her, like she had sisters. She's older, probably 70ish. I don't know her name. I'm sure she has told it to me but I'm miserable with names. She told me that 10 days ago she found it she had cancer. We talked for a minute about nothing. She tried to give me $100. What do you do?
7	That's a super weird situation. I wouldn't take her money... I mean, I don't know. It's just weird. \n\nAlso, like, why? Was it a crazy big tip? Or was it, um dying and money has no value to me anymore. \n\nI don't know. Just weird.
8	Make it 200 and you’ve got a deal.\n\n...Actually, I hate situations like that.
5	Umm take the money. Who cares about her intentions she's offering you money.
4	Idk. Depends on the vibe I got from her and the conversation. \n\nIf I thought she was depressed/distraught, I would decline.  (Suicidal people often give away money/possessions)\n\nOr I may just ask why are you giving me this? See what she says. People are usually good about explaining something like that. \n\n
2	I probably wouldn't have taken it, but a good idea would be to take it and buy her something nice.
2	I’d take it and ask why then regret asking why 
23	I heard or somewhere that auxiliary Se with Ti dom sometimes causes ISTP’s to undervalue information we take in; we notice, we acknowledge, we deem irrelevant and ignore because it doesn’t fit what we ‘want’ to see. This is very me! Anyone else particularly prone to this? Do you have any examples?	
17	you say undervalue, i say correctly deem irrelevant. i definitely do this a lot, but i’m scary accurate at picking up what truly matters and how everything fits together.\n\ngranted, this is only true for me in regards to people and their motives and politics. i suck at traditional academics, often disregarding important details. i’m about to start dissertation but i’ve only gotten this far because i’m a fair writer and i’m interested in my particular field, not because i’m smart. lol
14	it is stuff that is not important or needed in the moment. Not just that it is something we dont "want" to see. Nah, I see it but will come back to it if it is required and can be helpful to my problem.  
13	It's not aux Se that causes this. It's a Ti-Ni loop that makes us ignore Se. What we "want" to see comes from Ni.
8	I don't think that's me at all. Isn't a hallmark of the ISTP to be vehemently opposed to bullshit and/or lying to oneself (or others)?\n\nI take in information that I'm not always happy about having to value, but the fact that I hate lying to myself means I have to process it regardless. I can't let something go just because I don't like it, that seems completely counter to our realistic nature.\n
4	[deleted]
2	Sounds like something that should apply to everyone, regardless of personality. This is a known psychological effect similar to selective perception.
1	This is exactly how I explain why I'm so bad with names.
1	Yes, but the.outcome compensates when I make this mistake.
5	Just like that Faith No More song, it's a midlife crisis.	Hi friends.  After a decade spent in a culinary trap I literally stumbled into, I find myself wanting to switch careers.  It was all well and good before I got promoted into management, and the years since then have turned me into an ornery old man well before my time. :P  I've been reading a book called *The Pathfinder*, a book designed to provide you with some self-diagnostic tools that will aid you in whittling down potential career paths.  I've actually learned quite about myself in the course of this, particularly the bit about me being an ISTP type, but I have a problem.\n\nYou see, damn near every job I see listed as a good fit for the ISTP personality type involve some form of B.S. degree, like engineering or computer science.  I have a B.A. in English, which I only have because I'm a former journalism major who ended up HATING it so much that I swapped my major and my minor just so I could get out of college in one more semester.  I got no interest in going back to school, man.\n\nI'd love to hear some ideas from some fellow ISTPs in non-science fields of work, or just generally from anyone that might  be able to give a suggestion I can look into.  Is there hope for an ISTP with the most worthless degree there is? :P\n\nI guess I should add that my only natural talents are a natural eye for detail (a la proofreading) and wicked lead guitar skills.
2	College drop out with a long career in graphic design. It's garbage, can't recommend it. I've had plenty of jobs too but nothing sticks. Nothing feels worth doing. I'm getting into music, would be cool if a few years down the line I could make something good enough to sell. Don't need a degree or anything for that, just learn online.
2	I really enjoyed law. I didn’t finish it because reasons and I’m a flake, but it really appealed to me and I was getting quite good at it.\n\nIf you already have a BA, you could do the GDL which is a year or so course in law and look into becoming a solicitor or a barrister. It’s not quick, but it’s fascinating. And there are so many different areas of law to go in to. \n\nIf you’re good with words too, you’d probably find you’re pretty good with some elements of law. There are some very dense and complicated principles, but once you understand them, they always make sense. \n\nI’ve attempted it twice, failed, and I’m still thinking about going back to it!
1	Is getting your pro pilots license off the table? That's what I did, and I'm enjoying it. There's plenty of BS you have to deal with in the industry, but if you can get past the beauracracy it's not bad. 
9	Not sure where I’m at tbh	So I got scammed. True istp here by a damn long shot. But BOY is this shit embarrassing. I was trying to buy an Xbox One S and like six games on Craigslist. Dude took my money and literally sprinted off. Istp in me just accepted the shit situation I was in, I immediately knew. I essentially paid $220 (that honestly I shouldn’t have even been spending on video games) for a likely stolen copy of GTA V. Anyway fuck people. But also some people are fine maybe idk. Whatever fuck it
14	Shit happens man. Just learn from it 
5	lool, I'd have gotten in my car and put my wheel on his leg. At least, that's what I'd like to tell myself.
4	lmao this would be me as well. i just accept stuff like that too. 
3	Why not chase his ass down? Just giving chase to him might cause him to stop and give it back. Was he a much bigger guy than you? That I could understand.
2	this is so me... i sometimes tend to get fucked and move on like nothing happened which now that i think about it kinda scares me
2	I dunno. I have an easy time to just move on whenever bad shit happens. Like, it happened, nothing left to do about it, next problem. It doesn't even bother me years down the line either, like some think its repressed emotions or memory but..\n\nI guess it's just being pragmatic? realistic? shit happened, unless I can fix it best thing to do is just move on and it comes easily.\n\nI know people think I'm a pessimist but I have neither negative nor positive expectations from life. I know bad shit happens, I know good shit happens, I have a rough estimate of how likely certain things are to happen but I'm never surprised when good or bad shit happens.. I don't see it as being pessimistic or optimistic.
2	I wanna say I would be super cool and kick his ass but honestly I always freeze up in social conflict situations, whether someone is yelling at me or insulting me suddenly, or something like this. Only if its an emergency and no one is verbally fighting me, does it feel like I can do anything about it- give myself permission to act instead of letting it steamroll me, because I'm scared of the social ramifications. In this case, it mightve been assault, the cops couldve gotten involved, ect. In other cases, it was a lost job. \n\nthe only accounts I know of where I have been able to act were not ones of social conflict. One such happened very recently. I was at a group meeting and saw a 100$ bill left on the seat of someone who had just left. I didn't even hesitate. My eyes widened, I stood up, grabbed it, saw the 100 marking, looked to the group leader and said, "He left his cash!" and jumped over the table to the door. One person pointed and said, "he went that way." I knew he could stil be in the area. There was a chance to catch him, and that was all the reason I needed to act. I open the door, and break into a run.\n\nMiraculously I find the guy and give him back his bill, to which he then turns to me and laughs, before telling me it was fucking FAKE and he left it there as a prank. I felt so dumb and embarrassed, but his other car passengers did give me some stares and ask me if I really did just run to give him back his money, so which i just sorta dumbly went, "yes?" "That was a really kind thing you did." que shitty Fe response, "It's no problem," before they drove off. \n\nI would go back to the group and explain the prank, but in hindsight I kind of loved the experience. Made me feel like a fucking action hero, and I loved being able to take the action I wanted to when I wanted to without having to internally fight over it, or hesitate, or take too long internally debating wtf to do before being able to even speak. \n\nConclusion? Choose jobs and social situations where you can act how you want to. I'm learning not to do sales and customer service because I suck at deliberating social choices, having to smile and be very deliberate in reading feelings, those of mine and others. Intentionally seek out places you can be as confrontational or offensive or honest or anything as you would like to be. I think this is the answer. This and a combination of having a genuine interest in something. 
1	Yeah, been on a similar situation some days ago. I just accepted it and tried my best to move on.
1	I saw a guy riding my stolen bike in front of my house and few days after it was stolen from the basement. I should have tackled him :( I had time and opportunity. I was just dumbfounded I saw it roll by. A literal jaw dropping moment, lol.
12	Friends tell me I complain a lot	Recently a few of my friends have told me to stop complaining about stuff, but the thing is to me, I don't even feel like I'm complaining. I feel like I'm stating facts. For example, my gym/health teacher (she's my teacher for both) didn't show up to school all week and we get to leave early since she's not here. I tell my friend who goes to another school through Snapchat "My gym teacher isn't here again" and he goes "Stop complaining kid." It's not that I'm complaining, I'm just simply making observations and saying them. Is it just me or is anyone else here like this?
12	I’d say in this case, your reputation as a complainer had them loaded to take that as a complaint even though it wasn’t actually
16	This could be seen as a complaint about your friends.  \n\nYour friends just aren't interested in your life.  Find new ones or stop sharing with them, idk.
7	Yes. It happened to me several times. I end up just completely shutting up and not talking anything for weeks. No real solution I guess. 
3	Everyone else speaks their mind about literally everything so why shouldn't you be allowed to?  \nWhen I was a kid in school I let it get to me and I just stopped talking, eventually I stopped being myself and had a bunch of problems due to suppressing myself for years. What I should've done is just keep being myself. Sure, don't complain all the time but if you can't just talk around people, fuck'em. If they don't wanna hear your shit then you have no obligation to listen to their shit either.\n\nAnd stand up for yourself. Say like "I wasn't complaining" they might ask "what were you doing then" and just tell the truth, always. Don't let people box you in or try to make you someone you're not. I've had so many problems because I let people do just that.  \n
2	I think it must be Introverted Thinking because I get the same thing. The way I see it is that I am trying to help - "things could be better" (might be different for you because of Se, maybe more "this is not how this really is") - but people just hear negativity. I've stopped trying to defend myself about it, though. People around me will have to just get used to it or not because it's what's going on in my head and I don't want to keep it in all the time. 
2	It could be your tone of voice. "my teacher isn't here again" could either be a complaint, a question, or something good depending on how excited you sound about it. unless it was in text which would not have your tone to go off to figure out your mood so your friend assumed complaint.
26	Productive ISTPs?	I know personally I fucking hate routines and schedules. I can't deal with them and do my best work when I'm left alone for several days at a time. But that's not very reliable and I can't do it all the time because responsibilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow are you guys with routines and schedules? How do you manage to actually get shit done other than just brute force your way through it?  \n\n\nPeople talk a lot about the dopamine release when you accomplish a project or cross something off your to-do list. I can not relate what so ever to that :p \n\n&#x200B;
32	I don’t consider myself “productive”, I just do what needs to be done when it needs to be done. A ton of homework for tomorrow? Plow my way through it for 7 hours straight or more if needed. No homework for tomorrow? Procrastinate. Not the best life advice but hey, I have done shit this way for a while now and the only subject I was ever close to failing/having a low grade was German (bc I suck at languages). You do need to know how to manage your time though, not to maximize productivity, but to do what you gotta do on time. 
16	>  brute force your way through it?\n\nThat's pretty much how. As an ISTP you should be realistic and pragmatic. So you gotta know, practically, you have to work to eat, to survive. It's all about playing the game. \n\nIt's plenty boring and annoying, but you just gotta play the game.
12	As a person with a Te dom parent, I can totally relate to hating routines/schedules and having a shit ton of work to do. Here are some tricks I've learned to deal with this:\n\nHigh Stakes: If I have an assignment that I need to get done quickly, I give myself a time limit to complete a certain amount of work. I would add a "high risk" like "if I don't finish this, then my house will explode". Putting "high stakes" on an assignment will give you the sense that you are under pressure and force you to focus your brainpower to complete your assignment.\n\nLittle Bites: If you have lots of work to do, try breaking it down into little pieces that you can complete easily.\n\nDon't forget to rest!: If you spend too much time working, you'll cause your brain to fatigue and then you'll be more prone to making mistakes or quitting. Even if it's for five minutes, make sure you take a break and let your mind relax (just don't let that five turn into fifty).\n\nReward yourself!: If you don't naturally feel a dopamine release when you complete a task, then make yourself feel one. When you complete a task, give yourself a reward, like candy (I highly recommend M&M's. They're fucking delicious).\n\nGet rid things that distract you: self explanatory\n\nMusic: This depends on if your are the type of person who isn't distracted by music, but for me, I tend to become more productive when I listen to music. Genre doesn't matter as long as I enjoy the beat and  it makes doing work less painful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you find none of this useful, then brute force is the way to go.
10	ISTPs have 5th slot Te, which means we hate using it even though we are really good at it. It is the complete opposite attitude to introverted thinking. But because they are both thinking functions, we would be very good Te users if we ever developed that side of us.
5	Just sounding off to say that I'm the same way. 
4	You have to power through it and enjoy the surprises that come up. I use google calendar a lot and give myself lots of opportunities to do routine tasks. Know your limits and capabilities and do lots of different tasks at once so any one is not terrible. 
7	this sounds kind of stupid but....I joined the military and realized I love being told  my schedule and what to wear. otherwise I procrastinate on everything to the last possible second.  
3	i like to be productive, but that happens very rarely.\n\n> People talk a lot about the dopamine release \n\nonly if that heap of shit can drive down the road at 60mph or that code finally compiles and runs with no errors, else no
2	Outstanding time management.  That's my only asset to combat the lack of motivation to do the responsible adult stuff.\n\nI can stack so many chores together that they all complete at the same time, from laundry to cooking and shopping, cleaning while something is on the stove and the dishwasher is going and I know that piece I need for the cabinet is on the way from Amazon so I don't have to drive to the hardware store because my car is in the shop during the week I have off and all the bills are auto-payed and my rent comes in next week so I ain't even worried about the bills.\n\nSo, I end up with wide swaths of delicious free time.  Today, I've already organized lunch and dinner and done my shopping.  Every time I pass rooms I try to find at least one thing that I need to move from one to the other or throw away, so cleaning is a constant (but non-time consuming) process.  I've already lined up some experiments on troubleshooting a sticky backup problem that I only have to check back on in 3 hours (so I can play Rocket League or Nier for those three hours).  I rode my bike to the stores earlier (6 miles)  so I don't even have to feel like I have to work out.  I feel so far ahead of the game.  If I was a type 1 personality, I would fill that time with building a business or studying a new certificate, but that isn't the way I want to live.  When I was working full-time I used to squeeze in shopping and dry-cleaning and all kinds of personal shit into my dead time.  I'd even do pull-ups from the water pipes and pushups in the server room, climbing stairs every few hours, etc.  When I got home, it was *my time*, fully.  That was bliss.\n\nI'm going to lay around, enjoy life, reflect on the great time I had yesterday with the lady, maybe visit some friends later, chat with you guys in meaningful ways.  I type a lot here.  I guess it's easy when you have the time.

1	The only routines I follow or enjoy are organic ones (e.g I'll get up, dick around on social media, have breakfast then shit and shower go to work and settle at my desk then have a coffee) but if you try and force me to do shit on your schedule we're going to have a big problem.\n\nSome bright spark at my company decided I should manually write out a schedule, I wrote out 5 different baselines and photo copied a few copies of each (80% of my work week mapped out) then fill in the rest with random shit to do with my job even when I don't do it.\n\nI'd be so much more productive if I could work from home or be locked away in my own office, with aircon and no lights on and music blasting.\n\n\n**To answer your post** Yeah, I just have to brute force shit. I'll typically get a coffee or some other stimulant and put my headphones in, block out the world and work.
1	I do not like routines and schedules but I do need them. I have no executive functioning to speak of, so I need these to be a functioning human being. 
1	Not a fan of them but I find it helps to get a job were you aren't gonna be doing the same thing day after day and the shifts alternate. But I used sell weed a long time ago. That was so far the best "job" I had.
1	drugs help. treat yourself to some adderall or vyvanse or mydayis. but yeah, calendars and a good scheduling system are pretty indispensable if you have a lot going on. 
31	Why the hell do I only attract mentally unhealthy people?	Just got out of an unhealthy long term relationship with a person who suffered from serious depression and all the new folks I've been seeing all have some kind of mental illness of varying degrees.
44	I think it partly stems from appearing very laid back and non-judgmental. \n\nI’ve had this problem a lot in life, and have had to learn to impose boundaries with such people. \n\nNot that I’m the poster child for mental health. 
31	we like to fix stuff. we can’t fix people though.\n\ni’m mentally ill. would u like to date? LOL
27	ISTPs being magnets for the ill and damaged is practically a meme at this point, lol.\n\nAnywhom, I think it stems from the generally easy-going, still, yet optimistic nature of the ISTP which people can see as a potential calming anchor, a comfortable cold like freshly laid sheets. \n\nAlso, I think that very easygoing nature some people attribute to being a pushover who would let people walk over them, and some (not all of course) ill/damaged people will pray on that.
9	We're generally calm and collected individuals who don't get frazzled easily.\n\nPeople with anxiety generally aren't calm, collected and DO get frazzled easily. \n\nThey're attracted to that idea of stability I think. But we can't fix them, nobody can fix them except themselves.\n\nI've got anxiety and I'm on meds for it but I can compartmentalize that shit when I need to and I don't let it get the better of me most of the time. If it gets particularly bad I just excuse myself and make it known I need time to recharge my introverted batteries.\n\nThe meds also helps keep it in check so I dunno. I think the fact that ISTPs are so independent and tend to solve their issues and take responsibility for themselves is admirable among those who just can't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can relate to OP.
9	Dude, this is like the third or 4th question in the last 6 months about this. We should all be therapists, we'd make good money off of that and have plenty of customers, all we'd have to do to get them is go looking for a date
6	I can usually figure out who a person really is by month 3 of a romantic relationship. People can put on a good mask to make themselves more attractive, but by 3 months that mask is gone if they truly have a mental issue. 
5	Both mentally ill and mentally healthly people like me. I just always end up going for the mentally ill. Not out of pity but because it's risky, exciting, and never gets boring, but it never works out. They always disrespect my boundaries, beat around the bush, plays too many games, and they are pretty illogical. Id rather have a healthy relationship but playing with fire is sooo fun. 
11	Last I heard, the psychology community estimates that up to 80% of the population has mental illnesses. It’s just a matter of to what degree they are affecting the person.
4	I think it’s because many people *arent* mentally healthy. I’d wager there’s pleeeeenty of undiagnosed depression and anxiety and abandonment issues. Everybody has baggage, everybody has experienced some sort of suffering. \n\n\nI think the difference is that our very detail oriented brains can pick up on this kind of stuff easier than most. The longer we spend around a person, the clearer picture we get about how their brains work. I have many people in my life with undiagnosed mental “disorders”. And it’s usually undiagnosed because they don’t truly believe in mental disorders, or don’t believe they have one. But when someone has depression and/or anxiety and/or abandonment issues etc. it’s really not that hard to pick up on. \n\n\nAside from our ability to naturally spot this kind of stuff, I think we might subconsciously seek “broken” people out. I think our brains might see it as a problem to sink its teeth into and fix. ISTP’s love a good project, especially one that’s challenging and unique. Since we are more physical than verbal when it comes to expressing feelings, a person we have to constantly give advice to and help gives us a wide open avenue to express our feelings. Because there’s always something wrong that we can try and fix. This gives us no shortage of opportunities to show them we care. But people who have their shit together rarely *need* our help. When a person doesn’t actually need anything from us, it can make it harder to express our care for them. Because we can’t do it in the form of being needed or solving problems. And since we are the best at the whole words thing, it can be a struggle. \n\n\nSo I think the attraction goes both ways on a subconscious level. We seek the project and the project seeks us. We need problems to fix and they need someone who likes to fix problems. \n\n\nThis may not be the case for you, I dunno. I’m not a psychologist or ISTP dating genius. But with my personal experiences over the years plus my knowledge on the ISTP brain has led me to this “theory” of attraction between the broken. I, too, seem to attract broken people. And so does my dad, who I’ve long suspected to be ISTP.

-6	i feel, bro. i only attract the chicks who have high mileage if you know what i mean. mental illness isn't that big of a deal for me, personally, unless they're batshit insane, like bipolar x100
10	How to fill emotional emptiness?	Being ISTP I know that most of the time we are into action and adjusting systems and improving everything around us. But sometimes I feel that I am way back from other people who somehow fill their life with emotional energy. Do you do it anyhow? Do you try to fill this empty emotional hole, and how you achieve it? Thanks.
15	Get a dog. Emotional needs met. Get a girlfriend, excess of emotional energy is present in your life, only side effect is unwanted drama. 
5	I Don't have an emotional hole.  Like everyone, i have emotional needs.  I don't fill my life with emotional energy, I don't have the time nor the energy for it.  Also want.  I don't want emotional energy, there isn't any use for a lot of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	I wouldn't follow my example, but I usually tend to get emotional fulfillment through doing thrilling, sometimes dangerous things. I'm not sure if it's because my dopamine levels are depleted or something, but I've always had to do extreme hobbies such as skateboarding, model rocketry, downhill mountain biking, shooting, guitar playing, weed smoking, beer drinking, shooting, and breaking computers to name a few. Whenever I don't get that adrenaline rush I just get a little bored with life.
12	Physical Humor	AKA the top tool of the trade when it comes to activating the ISTP silly switch. I love physical humor. It's easy, fun, and always seems to take people by surprise. Making people laugh with it is the best feeling.\n\nSome examples: In the workplace (food service) I'm talking with my co-worker, and about to put away a tupperware container of sprinkles back. Mid conversation i lift the spoon in it, full of sprinkles, to my mouth like I'm about to take a bite, and her whole expression changes on a dime. She looks like I'm about to destroy a seal keeping back a fucking demon. I pull the spoon back and smile right before it reaches my mouth.\n\nUnexpected flip flopping from intense serious discussion to silly expressions, gestures. Sometimes I like to hold very articulate serious conversations and drop stupid terms into it straight faced. "Feefee's" is one that always gets a good rise out of someone.\n\n[Changing things in the BG that you slowly wait for others to notice.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/413311874323709952/492540857883557909/IMG_20180908_170136.jpg)\n\nSometimes bluntness or otherwise inappropriateness, or very surprising/unexpected honesty can make someone burst into laughter as well.\n\nAny opportunity to surprise someone with physical skill/talents, but sometimes it happens that way without intention and I'll still have people not expecting it either way.\n\nAnyone relate?
5	The sprinkles one I didn't find funny, but I can appreciate the sign change. Obviously, it depends on occasion, and at least for me, how well I know my coworkers and their tolerance for vulgar humor, but I definitely do occasionally perform this type of humor when I feel comfortable with both the environment and the people. 
3	>Sometimes bluntness or otherwise inappropriateness, or very surprising/unexpected honesty can make someone burst into laughter as well.\n\nYup. Great low effort comedy that pays off very well.
1	Yeah, good amount of my humor is this style. Like another said, depends on time and place but this is usually my go-to. 
14	Unwinding	How do you guys get out of a mood? I've always struggled to get out of it the same day. When someone really just pisses me off my day is just shot, I'm just stuck on it. It's so hard to move on without sleeping and starting a new day. What's your process?
27	This is actually one of my strong points.  I'm going to introduce you to a technique you can use all your life.  Please, follow along and it will become clear.\n\nCan you remember brushing your teeth this morning?  Go on, try to remember it.  Picture it in your head as vividly as you can remember all the details.\n\nDo it.  Close your eyes and remember brushing your teeth (or shaving if you didn't brush or whatever ritual you perform)\n\nCan you remember brushing your teeth the day before?  Or last week?  Try.  Try and when you do this allow yourself to notice how the other memories align differently.  Maybe they seem fuzzier when distant, or maybe they sit further to the left or right or the picture is greyed out, whatever.  Do this exercise.\n\nWhat you're going to find is that your brain sorts memories along trajectories we call "submodalities", for instance, a more recent memory may be brighter or more in focus than a memory that has been held onto for years.  Or, it may appear in your mind in a different orientation.  The significance of the orientation depends on you, but now that you know this, you can know that these memories and their associations can be reshaped.  \n\nThe shaping of these memories can be done willfully.  Simply by imagining that the memory grows brighter or dimmer, (as if you have a television remote control) to rewatch your memories and move or re-orient them according to the trajectories that matter to you, *this will re-write the memory* and its' association.\n\nYou can use this to brighten memories of positive things you want to feel more naturally attracted to, as well as darken or dampen distant urges you wish to condition out of your system.  Find the knob that tunes the memory's particulars, and adjust it.\n\nWhat I've written about here is known as neuro-linguistic programming.  It's no joke, although several have taken it too far.  I encourage you to look into it, if indeed you really wish to master your own mind.
9	Humor helps. Either by making light of the situation and turning it into a joke or finding something else to laugh about.
5	Weed
7	Enjoy a beer or two, and accept that the world is not as logical/mechanical as us; if we are in the wrong, show humility and contrition. If we are right then just let them burn while we enjoy the beer.
2	Drinking
15	ISTP Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
4	Chase has a good understanding of the functions. There are some things I disagree with but he is overall one of the better typology Youtubers.
3	What are everyones thoughts? 
23	Difficulty getting promoted	To all my established ISTPs out there, do you feel like that, despite your competence and capability, you have a hard time getting promoted to management positions because you give off the antisocial fuck off and leave me alone vibe? (25M)
27	Nope. Compartmentalization my friend. I become an extrovert the second I walk into work. It’s all about mind over matter. You have to figure out what your superiors want and mold yourself to it. \n\n\nGo read my last post in R-ISTP. It’s about manipulating *myself* to get what I want from others, rather than manipulating them. It’s all about manipulating perceptions. A lot is covered in my post and in the comments section. Maybe you’ll find something useful. 
16	I've never wanted to be a manager. Have to boss people around all day and play office politics? No thanks. I'd rather find the actual problems in the day to day operations and optimize things for max efficiency and keep the train running. 
6	My solution thus far - have an ESFP boss. He thinks I’m a genius because I’m good at what he isn’t. \n\nOn my way to a better job already. 
3	Nope. Always got promoted. I’m not anti-social just prefer not to talk unless necessary and I never slacked off. Always put effort into my job. 
3	You could always develop your Je functions.
2	I told my boss I felt under appreciated 2 weeks ago and laid out why I felt that way. He called me back 5 mins later to tell me I was getting a company truck and new job title. \n\nI do electrical for a small company and I’m 27
1	I'm fine with that. Don't get me underlings whose fuckups I'll be responsible for. Get me a nice fat bonus, a raise, and maybe a private office.
5	job or college?	I am in quite the situation right now, I guess you could say.\nMy family is going throigh seriously difficult times economically, and I've been basically begging my parents to let me get a job (I feel absolutely useless "focusing on my studies" and not doing anything to fix the problems of the present), but they did say that after I finish highschool they'll let me do whatever the fuck I want\nSo I'm stuck between getting a job, taking maybe one or two years before I go into studying full time again so that my family can move to a more affordable place, as we've been trying to do for years (it's a long story so just take my word for it)\nooor\nstudying full time and maaaybe getting an okay-ish job at an okay-ish amount of time after graduating\n\nthe problem is that i'm quite frankly tired of school, and although a job sounds awfully boring too it's at least a fix for my family's problems and i would finally be able to somehow help my parents.\nI could also just work and study on the weekends, which is possible in my country. but I'm not too sure if I want to have only one free day a week and be stressing not only over a job but also the hellish prison of school.\n\nI'm 17 by the way, I'm in my last month of Junior year and next year (in January) I'll start senior year so you can have some reference.\nI want feedback from people who think like me, sorry for the sort of personal post.
4	Don't go to college yet. Try out a bunch of different career paths, keeping in mind that your personality type predisposes you to logic-based, hands-on type work. You'll probably get bored of what you do but that's okay. You can always try something else. Se is a gathering function, so you need to gather a lot of information before you are able to form patterns and predict the future with your Ni.  \nAnd most importantly, don't spread yourself too thin. You probably have a lot of hobbies. I recommend doing max 40 hours a week or a little less to give you enough time to spend on your hobbies, let alone interacting with friends and family.
3	Look to your school. See if you can take any classes that could somehow be useful after graduation, and FUCKING EXCEL IN THOSE CLASSES.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was in high school, we had automotives, machine tool, CAD, etc. I really regret not making the most of those classes. For reference, I went straight to community college, then university, then became a high school teacher. I would tell ANY student that college is not always the answer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTalk to a counselor too. See if they have any resources. The last school I was at used a program called "Job Core" which basically was part high school/ part trade school. It's a great opportunity for kids who are not thinking about college but need to learn useful skills that will get them a career. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck!
5	trade school
2	After finishing High school i was so fucking sick and tired of it, i thought I could make it without college. I was so fucking wrong, and I've regretted it ever since. \n\nGo do a job for a year or a half year. It'll be a nice change of pace and get you refreshed and stuff, but do go back to college sooner than later while you still can. Don't make my mistakes. Jobs are nice and a little experience is absolutely necessary but you can't get anywhere without at least a little college. 
1	What's your country?
1	I feel your pain. When I was in school I was behind but wanted to graduate on time so I essentially did 8 years of work in 6 years. After High school I was tired of school and did one semester of college but my heart was not into it. I joined the Army as it’s something i always wanted to do. After my time was up, I went back to college with more determination.\n\nIt’s entirely up to you which you do first just make sure you complete it and don’t get complacent in the work force. Always look for a better opportunity.
1	If it's possible to work for a year or two before college, I would do that. Being a poor college student fucking sucks. Also, if you don't know what to major in by the time you enter, it could just be a time waster anyway. Working before going to college will help you financially by letting you save up some money for school expenses, and it could also help you in terms of building discipline and self-understanding.\n\nAt least in the US or Canada, it's pretty common for high school students to work part-time. It shouldn't affect your grades unless either your course load or work schedule is too demanding. Even if your parents say no, you can look around to see if there's anything you can do discreetly on the side. I mean, for example, selling stuff online isn't necessarily "working" if you do it only occasionally. Depending on where you live, there could be lots of stuff you could do for money without spending too much time and energy. Just keep an eye out. But I understand what your parents are saying. At 17, you only have a little bit of childhood left and you're basically almost done with high school already. It's not a bad idea to just focus on being a high school student for now, before they inevitably kick you out in the adult world.

6	Help - How to make a support system.	It took me up until about the age of 23 for someone to tell me, "It's obvious you've never had a support system before." And it struck me.  I haven't been able to forget it ever since. I'm about to turn 25 now and I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts. I know this is not a help center, I know the hotline numbers--- I don't expect professional advice from anywhere here and I know this is not the place to go for that. But I have tried the hotlines, and this sub is one of the few places that makes me feel understood, and gives me hope that I'm not alone.\n\nSo how do you guys develope/create support systems? Because I have none, I've never really had one. I had to have it pointed out to me to realize it was a thing normal people had in the first place, and now, I think I need one more than ever.\n\n~~The how and why is basically that I was never good at making friends, have a small and very abusive family I hate who hates me back, and when I did finally start getting good at making friends, I was uprooted via two moving sessions right before turning 18 and being kicked out on my ass with no connections or support or anything. I've been struggling ever since.~~ \n\nAs previously stated I know this is not a substitute for professional help, and I'm not expecting it here. But these subs make me feel better than I do actually talking to therapists, because we all speak the same logic. So please, any advice or help is appreciated. Thank you. \n\n&#x200B;
7	Personally I don't think you're asking the right group of people. The way I see it we aren't good with expressing our emotions to other people.  I've learned to deal with my emotions on my own and have never really relied on a support system. I will always run things by my SO but only after having thought about it on my own first. We have good times and bad times, it all comes down to where our focus lies. Try to just focus on things one day at a time and get yourself into a better headspace. I hope something I've said makes some sort of sense or helps a bit.
5	The only thing that helped me was taking responsibility for my life.\n\nAll of it. Every bad shit that happened to me could have been avoided if I had been smarter or wiser.  \nEvery single minute of my day is created by me through action or inaction. The way I feel is some how a result of something I did or didn't do. And some things are easier to figure out than others. One difficult one that I still struggle with is fulfilling my needs. Everyone has needs that if left unfulfilled makes you feel shitty. One of mine is I NEED LOTS OF SOLITUDE but it's extremely difficult to get the amount that I need because nobody understands or they take offense to it. They kind of have this "Suck it up" attitude about it which is extremely disingenuous. Like they don't have the self-awareness to see what would happen if one of their needs weren't met.  \n
3	Turn to the ones you trust the most and give them the most upfront honesty about two things. \n\n1) Be specific about what you're feeling. \n\n2) Be specific about what you want/need. A pep talk, life advice, an ear or shoulder to borrow and vent to or cry on. Whatever it is you need, be upfront. If you turn it into a guessing game then they are likely to not take the situation seriously anymore
2	I had a difficult time adjusting to civilian life after the military. I tried speaking to a counselor and was put on medication. I found that actually did more harm than good. What actually helped me was speaking to my sister and my best friend, who was a marine so he could see where I was coming from.\n\nMaybe confiding in a close friend or relative may help you more than a complete stranger. I also got more involved in physical activities as that takes my mind away from my problems and allows me to get into the zone.\n\nGood luck
1	In an abstract sense, it's like growing a garden. It takes time and energy and regular maintenance, plus choosing a suitable place to grow plants and the suitable plants for the climate, soil type, your gardening style, etc. Sometimes there are random disturbances like drought and plant disease and you just gotta roll with the punches. But overall you get what you put in.\n\nIt's also not like growing a garden because you are also a plant. Everybody is a plant and we grow each other. And sometimes we grow so close together, from watering and weeding each other's beds all the time, that over time we form a symbiotic network. Weird, huh?\n\nBut this is what I do:\n\n1. Find a group (church, meetup, class, etc.) that meets regularly. It has to be something interesting or important to me, otherwise I'll stop going eventually.\n2. After scoping it out and observing the members, I decide if I want to keep going or not. Sometimes the first impression is misleading, but I trust my gut to tell me if something's wrong.\n3. If I decide to go, I try to attend regularly and not miss meetings. And I make it my goal to be a full and active member. It's fine (and sometimes smart) to just blend in at first but over time I want to take some responsibility for how things turn out.\n4. Don't be a stranger. Get to know people and spend time with them. Try to take interest in them, help out when needed and generally just be around. \n5. Don't close up (too much). Some discretion is needed obviously but I learned that you can't really get close to people without showing each other your weak spots.\n6. Let people be generous. It can be kind of off-putting if you're not used to it. But I learned that most (decent) people get happiness from making others happy. Even the people that suck, they at least get narcissistic self-satisfaction points from doing something "nice." Just make sure to say "thank you" and all that.
7	Schrodinger Cat	What do you all think of thought experiments like this?\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_cat
12	A lot of ISTPs don't care for theory. Some, however, have a better balance of sensing and intuitive traits and appreciate theory more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is truly fascinating about this experiment, however, is not the experiment itself, but rather, the irony of why Schrodinger conceived of this experiment versus its actual usage. Schrodinger created this thought experiment because he thought quantum physics was ridiculous and a heavily flawed idea, not because he was trying to give a way for people to easier understand quantum mechanics.
5	Theory is fun but I like answers at the end
11	I ignore them.
11	This particular one is pretty useless IMO. The cat is either dead or alive. At no point in time is it ever both. There is no collision between superposition and reality because reality is all there is. \n\n\nQuantum mechanics does have a place in science, and I do fucking love it. But trying to apply it to a cat in a box is just retarded. There is no superposition to physical matter. It either is or it isn’t. Simple as that. Just because we don’t *know* the cats condition doesn’t mean it’s an ambiguous condition. Our ignorance doesn’t magically make the cat experience life and death at the same time. If it did, I could put *you* in the box and you would both be alive and dead at the same time. If a human can’t experience life and death simultaneously, how the hell could a cat? \n\n\nThe only thing about the thought experiment that I agree with is that it was used to question the physical application of a theoretical science. We simply do not have the knowledge or the technology to apply quantum mechanics to our physical world, yet. And until that day, it should stay theoretical. Otherwise you end up with ridiculous notions like a cat in a box that’s dead and alive. 
3	I think they're the coolest thing in the world and it's fascinating to think that your thoughts may effect things on a quantum level, although I feel like most ISTP's wouldn't give a damn.
2	I thought Schrödinger’s cat was fairly useless theory/exercise in absurdity until I better understood the underlying science. I now think Shrodinger was brilliant. The concept is fascinating.\n\nIf you are inclined, look up the double slit experiment. Properly explained, it is fascinating, especially to an istp such as myself. As I recall, even the Wikipedia version is interesting. Observation changes the outcome. Fascinating.
1	Stupid
1	Its cool but nothing I delve into deeply
22	YouTube rabbit hole	\nDo you guys get stuck in the YouTube rabbit hole? I’m in college and when ever I’m researching to write a paper I somehow get caught up with YouTubing a lot of different things. I tend to put off my assignment till as late as possible and use that pressure to get it done. How do I changes this? Or is the stress of my assignment being due needed to complete it? 
27	One thing I find is that setting matters a lot. When I was in college, it was pointless to try to work in my room. \n\nIt’s generally a bad idea to do too many things in one space. You get used to it in ways that can be maladaptive. \n\nStudying or working where you game and Reddit is setting yourself up for constant distraction. Just like watching TV in bed fucks with your bedtime. \n\nEver find yourself sitting in a classroom with nothing in front of you but a textbook, and suddenly it’s fun to read?\n\nGo to a library, install a program to block YouTube or whatever else you fidget with for an hour or so and make researching and work the least boring thing around you. Set a time limit and do something refreshing when the time is up. \n\nWho am I kidding, I never took any of that advice. 
10	Turn your shower on. Throw all your electronics in the shower. Done. You now have no electronic distractions preventing you from writing your paper. However typing it out and research just became a whole lot more difficult 
3	Same. Wish I could help but took me until my mid-twenties where pulling all-nighters make me feel like I'm dying and I finally said "I'm too old for this shit" and started organizing my time better.\n\nAlso I downloaded one of those apps on my phone that stops you from using it for a set amount of time and a google chrome extension that blocks websites.
3	I've been out of college for about 10 years, I still do this.\n\nGood luck!
2	You could drop out of college and dedicate your entire life to making content?
1	Doing the same right now, but I space out my work in a span of multiple days. So a simple paper - if I want the best grade - would take at least 3 days because of Youtube :)
1	> Do you guys get stuck in the YouTube rabbit hole?\n\nYes, this happens.\n\n> I tend to put off my assignment till as late as possible and use that pressure to get it done. How do I changes this?\n\nAccept that you might have hit your cognitive limit. You're actually stuck even though you may think "this is easy, I know how to do it" you've hit a wall of something you do not know and you may be having difficulty realising it.\n\nRead up on the topic a bit more and start writing, it doesn't have to be correct, that's for 'version two'. Don't worry about the layout or the formatting, that's for 'version three'. The reminder you need right now, is that if you're not typing into your document or reading about your assignment, it's not progress, and the lack of progress is stressing you out into the cycle of procrastination to relieve the stress.\n\n> Or is the stress of my assignment being due needed to complete it?\n\nEvidently not, else you would be working on it right now, the stress of needing to do the assignment is making you reach out for help and watch youtube videos to relieve it - though the best relief for you will be working on the assignment.\n\nYou can do it.
1	When in college I did all my work at the library because at home there were too many distractions.
5	Depression	I'm just extremely depressed now-a-days. Does anyone have a way to help that actually works? I just feel so empty and cold. 
8	[deleted]
3	I usually get a bit more depressed this time of the year too. Eat well, sleep well, exercise, and meditation. It won't be fun, especially when you feel like you just wanna stay in bed and cry all day, but a few days of this and you'll notice great improvements.
2	Just getting out of a depressive cycle (maybe fighting my WTF years too) but what I'm doing is jail cell style workouts like push-ups, crunches, weightless squats, running in place etc. I take St John's wort to help boost my serotonin (takes a while for it to start working). I have a goal in life where I wanna take things and am focusing on that. I'm also living each day as if it's my last. Got back into meditation and my hobbies too. Only issue for me at this point is I feel pretty lonely but in a "I'm bored and want to spend some time with someone or even just be talking to someone" type way and not a "Imma be forever alone" thought. A few things I can recommend to you is get into meditation and learn how to observe your thoughts which helps bring clarity to your depression, also I recommend you read "the doors of perception" maybe it can bring some insights. And as the other commenter said figure out what changes you need to make and just do it. Or you could just do some psychedelics and let the trip show you what needs to be changed and integrate the experience. 
2	Take responsibility for your life and your needs. Happiness, Security, Health, Wealth, something something. \n\nEvery second of your life is created by you through action or in-action both in the past and present. So start there.
1	Everything the other comments said, plus mushrooms.
1	You may be ungrounded. Do you have poor posture? If so, you could do with releasing the tension in your body through massage and mindful breathing experimentation.
14	Perfect ISTP Song	
13	Wait, why is the Dark Side of the Moon album cover, lol.\n\nThis song is on The Wall.\n\nAwesome song, I've liked it as long as I can remember.
10	The idea at all made me want to downvote, but when I saw what it was... dangit.
3	Always related to Floyd.
3	Great song. However, I'm not sure how it relates to ISTPs. A lot of music these days is emotional expression, and the only sense I can make of the lyrics is how ISTPs tend to distance themselves, and possibly an expression of the WTF years alternating from a spectator's perspective to an ISTP's perspective. However, the tendency to distance oneself is not something unique to ISTPs, just something most of us tend to do, and the WTF years also exist for other types as well. 
4	Wack 
0	I think my ISTP has stopped functioning, what do I do	I'm not gonna make this too long, because I'm aware ISTPs need time alone to process things, and don't want to show people that they actually have feelings and stuff (which I respect and can relate to - to an extent). \n\nSo, my ISTP partner (as in, romantic) is going through something really hard to deal with emotionally, and when asked how he was feeling was kind of vague about it and told me he didn't want me involved in it. After that, gone completely silent even though we used to talk everyday. We live far apart, so was worried and had to call to get some news. I got updates on his situation like, twice, and then silence again. Ignoring my messages and attempt to phone call. \n\nAs I said I'm aware he probably needs time alone so I didn't insist, but it's been over a week and I'm kind of worried. Here's the problem, I find the reaction a bit excessive ? Why can't he just clearly say he doesn't want to talk? I'm confused. Should I be the one to try to start a conversation again? What do y'all other ISTPs think ? 
20	Have you tried turning it off and turning it on again?\n\nHonestly, sounds like this individual is under some unusual amount of stress. If it were me, I would appreciate someone occasionally letting me know they’re still there without making it about the source of said stress. 
5	This comes up a lot and I have to resort to some generalities because it's hard to say this applies to all, but I can fairly confidently say that the ISTP does not want space. They're testing you to see if you **want** to be burdened.\n\nIf you present in a way that shows you are interested, legitimately care, and are OK with them dumping on you, then I'm guessing they will open up. \n\nIf you don't want that burden, then don't bring it up again. But for the love of God, don't cast them out to "space". That only makes them think more and more that you don't care about them.\n\nIt's quite possible in the ISTP's mind that you can have a normally functioning relationship outside of these issues that they don't want to burden you with. It's simply just not talked about and life can proceed.
6	You’re asking the same questions I’d be asking... it’s strange for an ISTP to not just come out with it. Usually if we don’t want to talk, we have no problems saying we don’t want to talk. I’d say you’re confusion is pretty legitimate, so I wouldn’t worry there. \n\n\nHere’s what I would say: “hey babe, sorry if I’ve been bugging you lately. I know you need your time to process, I just want you to know I care. So you take whatever time you need, and you know where to find me when you’ve got things sorted. All I ask is that you keep in some sort of touch with me. Since I don’t get to see you often, I worry when I don’t hear from you for 3-4 days. Even just a single good night text would be good.” \n\n\nObviously modify it to fit your situation better. But basically it’s just a mild apology to grease his ego a bit, then give him exactly what he wants, and then ask for a small reasonable thing in return that requires next to 0 effort. It’s all about getting what you want while also giving him what he wants. And putting it into an easier to swallow way for his currently flustered and uncooperative brain to accept. \n\n\nEither he’ll respond well, poorly, or not at all. If he responds poorly, you may want to think about a separation. If he doesn’t respond at all, he doesn’t respect you and you *really* want to consider a separation. \n\n\nI hope this helps. 
3	I can relate to him. Please take comfort that it’s a reality for (most of) us. It’s periodic for me. I can go for months not telling my friends (and even my parents) that I’m going thru something. If it’s something that affected me or my sense of competency (e.g. loss of job or a relationship), it would take sometime to change my outlook in the gutter. This is also the time I’m recharging a lot. \n\nIf I were you, I’d just check on him regularly. Maybe don’t prod. Just ask simple questions that work as reminders, like “Have you eaten?” or share new and interest things that you catch/experience out there to feed his lack of sensory data. \n\nISTPs are extremely independent and don’t like to burden anyone. \n\nBe positive. It often works! \n\n
2	Sometimes when we're under a lot of stress, we just shut down and barely talk to anyone. I wouldn't take it personally. If he's not talking to you then that just means he can't talk about it. Let him know you love him but don't add to the stress
2	I have the hardest time reaching out to people that are close to me. I genuinely care about them but for some reason I just never contact them but then I'm so happy when they contact me. Not sure if that's an ISTP thing or not.  \n\n\nSecondly, ISTPs are extremely independent so a week for you feels like a day to him, socially speaking. I can go months without talking to someone and I won't even miss it. Infact I miss the time when I COULD take months without talking to someone... I love my lady but after 6-7hours I just don't want to be around anyone anymore. :/  \n\n\nLet him know you're there but don't push him to talk or anything. ISTPs cant handle being pushed around, even if the intent is positive.
2	this is me when shit hits the fan. i don’t want to involve anyone else in my mess so i just ghost everyone. i come back when i fix my shit, he likely will too. :)
1	Hi .. I have created a subreddit for Music and MBTI discussion	That's the link -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <-\n\nThe overall goal is build playlists for each type and discuss anything Psychology, MBTI and Music. Here's the [ISTP](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/search?q=flair%3AISTP&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on) playlist.\n\nIf you are an amateur artist you can post your stuff too, but since we just have 80+ peeps I'd wait till we hit 200-300.\n
2	You linked the INTJ playlist, and I am offended by the contents.
19	Can you listen to your gut/intuition?	Me and a good friend of mine are both in this predicament where we've achieved what would normally be considered success in challenging careers that we poured our lives into. Things we FELT at some point were the right things to do.Socially as well. Great social lives and relationships according to your typical standards.\n\nHowever we're both feeling this dread of "is this all life has to offer? Is this all there is?"I know personally that feeling has been there since I was *10 years old* and never really subsided. It's basically cognitive dissonance. I have no reason or right to complain and I've earned what I have, yet I'm still stuck with a feeling of apathy/lethargy about life in general. I can feel interest in things, for example I enjoy archery, the laser like focus and control I need to perform well is cathartic. But it's not exciting. Same with rock-climbing and basically anything else that requires focus and coordination, they're interesting but not exciting and even though I do them I don't really feel Joy, it's more like I'm honing myself or testing myself to perfect difficult tasks for no reason. I believe that my ability to feel anything in general is severely impaired and it may be the reason for why I'm no longer able to move forward in my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can ask myself what the logical solution or logical path to take is. And reach logical, reasonable solutions but more often than not I feel like that just makes me my own overlord that I want to rebel against. And doing the things that are logically sound, tend to make me feel even more apathetic and my ability to perform is impaired because why bother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot of things that I could and should do right now that would push me forward in life and lead to more individual freedom. But I'm not doing them, I'm procrastinating, and when I do manage to force myself to do them, I get tired and angry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try to listen to my gut, my intuition, the thing that tells me whether or not something is a good idea, will move me in a direction of personal satisfaction but it's extremely difficult. I flip coins for a lot of decisions, large or small, and I've had some success with this method. (basically you don't listen to the coin flip, you see if one result feels better than the other.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny happy successful ISTP's out there that have good resources for how to get out of the machine like loop and FEEL good? Other than drugs. I fucking love weed but it's a crutch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*edit. I want to add that I've had a rich life too by most standards. Lot's of traveling, different jobs, different partners, etc. 
9	You sound lonely to me. \n\nReach out and try to give back and connect with people. Volunteer...do something that you can be proud of. Connect with others. \n\n
7	Don't worry, you are normal. I am exactly the same way. Having demon Fi means you don't understand your motivations at all - what you like and dislike, your purpose for living. You get stuck in Ti land and over-analyze the shit out of everything. You should get a good massage and be aware of the tension in your muscles and you will become more grounded and things will work out. The big questions don't have answers. Just live life to the fullest and take full control of your body.
3	Well the only thing that brings me joy is hanging with my few true friends. And being with a girl I can be myself around. Get those two things and you'll be good. And maybe a pet as well. I think istps especially can relate to pets well. 
3	(I’m not ISTP, I’m INTP) I heard someone say Tom Bilyeu is an ISTP. I saw your posts on your profile and I think he could provide a lot of guidance also being a mature ISTP with bigger life questions. Check out his podcast or YouTube channel. It’s a really good badass thing that you’re aware of these thought processes and loops, most ppl don’t notice or do anything about them. Also, I do listen to my intuition but it requires me going on solo sober walks/hikes in the woods. Everything in my intuition just shows up. I think the activity just halts my Ti.
3	So, what's your question? Because this post is all over the place. It almost reads like you just want to hear the keyboard click. (as an aside, it really doesn't sound like an ISTP to me)\n\nIf you think you're always going to be happy, you're wrong. If you compare your life to "conventional standards of success", you're going to be always feel inferior because those standards are 100% bullshit.\n\nI say play the game, do your work to fund your life and find the few things that give you temporary happiness. Trying to find a deeper meaning is probably an exercise in futility and not worth the effort.

25	Brutal Honesty	Anyone got any interesting stories where brutal honesty got you in trouble? \n\nI'm personally a bad liar so I'm just honest instead. I can't bring myself to sugar coat things. \n\nHere's some situations where brutal honesty didn't serve me well:\n\nTeacher: Why didn't you do the assignment?\nMe: I didn't want to\n\nThen the teacher hates me for the rest of the semester\n\nFriend: Do you think I'm too obsessed with _____?\nMe: Yeah you should probably chill\n\nThen that friend gets really pissed\n\nI prefer the truth even if it's brutal. People really do you a disservice when they lie.
13	I had a female roommate ask: "do these jeans make my legs look really skinny?"\n \n"No, your *legs* make your legs look really skinny".\n \nShe looked more shocked than anything by that reply.  Oops!
9	This is me, every day of my life. People will eventually love you for it, don't give up.
7	1 semester \nProfessor: If you want me to repeat something that I told, you can ask.\nMe: I wasn't paying attention to what you were talking about. \nWhole class looks at me and start laughing.\nMe --> Visible confusion.\n\n
4	I've learned through my upbringing to use a multitude of white lies. However, when incensed or not thinking about what I am saying, I do have a tendency to be straightforward to a fault. As such, I have learned to pay attention to my language at virtually all times without the need to constantly consider my wording. This is also why I am able to use more complicated language in my writing and speech without truly thinking hard about it, because I constantly devote a small portion of my brainpower to thinking about how I am expressing myself or my ideas. The fact that I do devote parts of my brain to this, however, also means that when I am brainstorming ideas, if anyone speaks to me, my reply will most likely be quite brusque and possibly insulting without the intention of being as such. However, among people I am well acquainted with, I will be as honest as possible without being insulting, so I have a reputation for honesty which also makes my lies more believable as a side benefit. 
3	haha I had a similar experience where a law professor asked me why I was late in class. I answered, "I have no reason." \n\nIt didn't really get me in trouble though. I think she just said okay. Maybe she appreciated the honesty? I tried not to be late ever again though. 
2	in the example with the teacher, i wouldve came up with a lie just to avoid trouble and to find a way to not get that 0 to maintain my grade. \n\nfor the friend example, they were the one who asked you first, so i think its fair to give your honest opinion. i mean, you gotta know your flaws right? 
2	I'm pretty certain that over the years i have lost friends due to my being too straightforward, too honest and too weird for some. I've come to accept my eccentricities and people around me have to live with it.\n\nExcept at work. It would be career suicide.\nI call them CLMs or "career limiting moves".\n
2	Here's a relevant video:  \nhttps://youtu.be/4LGNdX7mJgg  \nPretty much Ti/Fi vs Fe. Don't repress Fe too much or you will remain immature. And here's a relevant article:  \nhttps://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/135002965032/how-functions-work-inferior-fe-istpintp
2	I cause awkwardness a lot and people avoid me even just from first meeting me. I have one liners where I tend to summarize everything I think about on something that makes it damn confusing for other people to know what Im trying to say.\n\nI do alot of jokes and put humor to everything I say to lessen the damage of my brutal honesty. I dont want to be guilt tripped because of hurting someone's feefee. Its a struggle for me to want to be the person who doesnt give a rat ass: "I do what I want and say what I want" against to what I actually do which is: "I have what I want to say/answer right now but I dont wanna be an ass to just blurt it out so just make it like a silly insult about something trivial about him/her into one line". I believe humor is weaponized for me at this point to avoid conflict and be left alone peacefully.
1	I find that people who claim they are brutally honest are more concerned with the brutality than the honesty 
9	"Who am I, This is who I am, Am I really?"	Just curious to see how many ISTPs relate to this thought loop.
3	The thought experiment I've been on for a while is to imagine that because the stone-age tribe has been so busy, you are the first person ever to ask "where are we?" \n\nHow do you even do it?
3	I like this question but I'm not sure how to answer it.
3	Constantly
2	Yes. Helps to instead ask “What do I want right now/from this person/situation/job” \n\nWay easier and the answer creates the next action taken. \n\n
1	Umm yeah I guess I've thought this before.
12	Your temper	How are all of your tempers?\nAre you patient,impatient,angerd easily?
23	I can't stand listening to bullshit. I rarely lash out but I'm very cynical and sarcastic. I don't really yell at people but I will straight up insult them to their face and explain the flaws in their logic. When people annoy me, I get very mad, though. Depending on the situation I either leave it alone or tell them to shut the fuck up
11	When younger, I had a very low tolerance to bullshit. Older now, and once I accepted most people are dumb every now and then, including myself sometimes, I give them a break, shrug and move on. \n\nI will verbalize/cut you down when\n\n 1) I have to repeat myself over and over to someone asking the same question they’ve brought to me before.\nNow, you’re being lazy and wasting my time and energy. Nope!\n\n2) you’re throwing your weight around being an arrogant asshole. I actually love just waiting for the right moment and putting those people in their place. \n\n\n\nOther than that, I have tremendous patience. Rarely lose my cool. 
13	Extremely quick to be annoyed, coupled with a DGAF attitude and loud mouth = you're going to hear about it, quickly.\n\nI don't consider myself an *angry* person, I'm easily annoyed, which presents as angry. If people would stop being so stupid, life would be less angry.
9	[deleted]
3	Use to be explosive as a kid, I'd be calm 99% of the time but if anyone *really* pissed me off it was fucking go time, especially when I was playing hockey competitively. Nowadays I'm a lot more calm and patient. One of my best friends is an ISTP as well though and he's probably the most impatient dude I know, also gets hella mad at video games still which I used to do and honestly still understand, shit is frustrating lmao. 
3	Basically nonexistent. I went through a lot of changes over the last couple years that have *drastically* increased my tolerance to bullshit. These days I approach everything with “can I fix it? Yes: then fix it and skip getting mad. No: accept it and skip getting mad.” \n\n\nI’ve yet to find a single situation, real or hypothetical, where getting angry and letting a temper flare *helps*. Every situation I’ve experienced or can cook up in my head tells me that getting angry *always* makes things worse. So now I just don’t get angry. I’ll get frustrated or annoyed, but I don’t get angry anymore. I fix what I can and accept what I can’t fix. \n\n\nI have no idea if there’s anything out there bad enough to Re-trigger my subsided temper, but I’m praying I never cross paths with it. I’ve been living with a new sense of internal peace, even through hardship and strife, and I’d hate to see that go. I’ve enjoyed waking up ready to tackle the day instead of waking up with “oh god I hope today goes fast” as my first thought. 
2	Very patient, but blow like a nuke.\n\nI've learned to just not waste time and energy when something is starting to upset me. Just walk away, move on, ignore it and get it out of your life. 
1	Depends on the situation, waiting behind someone taking their time at a store I'm really impatient but I just deal with it but worth the drama, someone I'm around often pushing my buttons I'll express my viewpoint or facts and if they still don't listen then I'll blow up. No matter what though I've got no patience.
1	I always joke that I'm an on/off switch, in a lot of facets. I get frustrated really easy, and that always looks like anger. Real anger with me is very quiet and scary. Also impatient, I'll admit to that. The more faith/good knowledge I have with someone, the more my patience with them will be. A lot of it I think is that I'm an "action speak louder than words" person, so I want people to put their money where their mouth is when they expect me to trust or rely on them. And a lot of people, for whatever reason, don't want to do that. 
1	My temper is like a nuclear missile: you have to push all the right buttons, get all the right codes, and time all the steps down to a minute. When you do, congratulations! You've just launched a nuclear strike on yourself!
1	Very hot-headed
41	Talking about a problem v.s. Talking about how it makes you feel	For me it's very easy to talk about a problem with a poker face, totally apathetic to the fact that it's a bad problem but it's very difficult to claim my emotions as a result of the problem. \n\nAre you guys the same? 
25	Yes and it has already created strange situations at work e.g. my director once gave me an important/confidential mission for the company that I concluded successfully but his feedback was primarily "I thought you would be more excited about it, you accepted the mission the same way my secretary reacts when I ask her a cup of coffee" 
8	>  it's very difficult to claim my emotions as a result of the problem\n\nAnybody else feel like feelings are immediate and present, but it takes a lot of analysis to uncover what they mean or why?\n\nLike... I'm feeling pissed but it takes me a while to figure out what is actually pissing me off? Weird.
8	I'm an INTP, but very much relate to this. I can discuss issues as if I am almost detached from them. I have emotions but to talk about them feels almost impossible, shameful and I feel too exposed. 
5	I can discuss my problems and emotions objectively. Like yeah, I feel this or that. But I don't invest or exhibit the emotion. Unless I'm in rage mode after being pushed too far for too long. Then I'm just in my demon form. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you know, generally speaking. I compartmentalize everything.
3	One time, I was on the road with my dad. We stopped at a gas station and bought some snacks and then got back on the road. When I had finished my nutty buddy, I looked over at my dad and said: "haha nutty buddy lol". \n\n-The End
8	Flair	Why do we have to use flair?
12	Because dating questions are rampant and people don’t wanna see that shit 
6	I'm legitimately convinced that whoever implemented the flair rule was in fact, not, an ISTP.
5	Parents and parenting	How are you all as Parents?\nAnd for those that grew up with ISTP patents, what was it like?
6	I have stepkids. It is trying.
5	Dad was ISTP. He passed away before I was really old enough to think about him critically but we weren't close even when I was young. \n\nBut unlike the rest of you guys I probably would like to have kids of my own in the future as long as it's with the right person and I am financially comfortable. 
4	My mother isn't an ISTP. But for me, I have 4 younger siblings and while growing up and as an adult, I didn't want kids. I took care of a few other kids and was around some kids with my living situation when I got older though and decided I do want kids with the right person. I'm actually good with kids, especially sneaky, cunning little shits. Kids are just little people who are actually smarter than, I believe, most people give them credit for. 
4	I'd be a really chill, but fair parent. I'm not pro or anti children. Whatever happens, happens. You can do everything right and your kid can turn into a horrible person, which really scares and discourages me, but at the same time I'd love to be proud of them and just be able to say to myself, "That's my kid right there." 
6	I don't wanna have kids, but if I had them I'm sure I'd be an incredibly strict mother.
3	I'm pretty sure I'm never going to have kids.
1	I've known I don't want to have kids since I was very young. Being consistently told that I'll change my mind when I get older is condescending, frustrating, and worsened it terribly. Added anger onto and otherwise perfectly fine decision. I can't handle taking care of someone else like that, it burns me out so bad. I can barely handle taking care of a bf/gf, and thats because they've really really earned it and I love them. I would hope the situation would be similar with children, if ever the situation arose. So I have thought about it.\n\nI feel like I would fear fucking them up or being terrible, or getting angry too much, or not being emotionally intelligent enough to take care of them properly and foster everything they need, development-wise. Boy or girl, I would make emotional intelligence, vulnerability, and communication very important to know. Especially if it was a boy though. I would never want my kid to be afraid to talk to me or be close with me. I would never want them to feel disrespected, or talked down to at any age. I would never hit them, and I would try to keep yelling to a minimum, and a rarity. Essentially, I would want to give them the childhood I couldn't have.\n\nI would also not give them a smartphone until they were much older (give a flip phone or other device for calls and text instead). I would keep them off of youtube and other websites until they were in their teens. I would want to raise them with enough technology to understand it, but not enough to get hooked on it and rely on it, in the weird unhealthy way we're seeing now where people can't talk to other people and don't develop those skills. I would instead put forth that time into developing hobbies, interests, and skills I know that would round them out and they would need later in life. Give them a real child hood where they play outside with other kids, can make mistakes, have as much bad experiences as they can good, so they aren't too sheltered either. Sheltering your kids and letting them live their lives online will fuck them up super badly too, in a lot of ways.\n\nFinally I think I would want to be my childes friend, not just their parent.
13	What does it look like when you're pushed over the edge?	I can't talk about it and I just go somewhere else and ball my eyes out privately so no one will see me. Like a parking lot at night, my room, the shower. Then I suck it up and move on the next day. 
19	Full blown Alcoholism.
5	[deleted]
4	I cant cry, so i carry about like normal but feeling like a wreck inside. But if im in that state and talking to my mom, there’s a higher chance of crying, cause shes just that great in heightening my frustration. Then i go hide and cry and resume work after crying. 
3	you can cry? 
3	the one time i remember crying, i hid myself in my closet and cried for an hour and proceeded to change my clothes in said closet then leave as if nothing happened
3	I find it difficult to cry. I feel I have to force myself to cry - and normally I think I would like to cry because 'they say' it helps to process the experience better. But if I'm pushed over the edge it first starts as a blinding rage and I will say anything that comes to mind no matter how offensive, I may even get belligerent, and then I leave and those folks would never see me again unless they're family and I'm forced to see them again. 
2	Well I haven’t been pushed over the edge in a couple years because I extended my edge sorta. Or put a leash on my temper so it can’t go over the edge. Whatever analogy you want to use lol. \n\n\nBut previously, me going over the edge was fits of blind rage. I would black out and go nuts. Once during a fight with my dad, this translated to running out the front door in my underwear. Middle of a tornado and I’m mostly naked screaming profanities at my dad and running off. \n\n\nI’m glad I’m not like that anymore. Lol. 
2	A broken egg :(
2	Slow build anger as I slowly realize what is wrong, then I leave and explode somewhere else, if I can. 
1	I bury my face into a pillow or two and then I scream as loud as I fucking can until I can't scream anymore and I beat the shit out of my bed because I don't want to actually break anything and when I'm done I get a dopamine kick and start nervously laughing like a maniac.\n\nIt takes a lot for me to get to that point though. I usually just go around apathetic and depressed and lethargic for months and months trying to solve the problem until I hit rock bottom and finally drag myself out of it. I really wish I could avoid hitting rock bottom but for some reason I just can't solve my problems unless my entire life goes to shit. It's weird.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also go into full recluse mode because its the most comfortable way of existing to me. I'll be gone for weeks, not talking and just being alone with myself. I fucking love it. Gets me back on track.
14	Please use the post Flairs from now on	You can also use the search box to search for a certain flair \n\nExample *Flair:dating*\n\nIf you have any flair request let the mods know
15	Anyone think this is gonna last long?

1	That was quick 
5	Are you Turbulent or Assertive?	*16personalities.com gives the result of turbulent or assertive.\n\nHow do you feel this affects who you are?\n\nI'm a Turbulent ISTP so I'm constantly questioning my own decisions, motives, actions, and I'm pretty insecure. I'm 100% thinking and 0% feeling so I just rationally question everything. 
2	Close to the middle but always turbulent: 54% -T, 46% -A
2	always turbulent.
2	I was also told by that site that I'm turbulent - and I wholeheartedly agree. It is good and bad, I think. The good is that it forces us to be better at everything always. Even to be better humans. The bad is that good is never good enough and if we sense we're not the best, or in full control of the situation, it fucks with our self-confidence and can be really harmful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll traits are important - but this turbulent vs assertive can have huge potential. I would advise that you seek to understand and rationalize the advantages and disadvantages of being turbulent - especially if you deal with self confidence or self doubt issues on occasion. 
2	16personalities is one of the few places that gives me INTJ. As I’ve changed over the last couple years, my primary and secondary functions kinda go back and forth between INTJ and ISTP. Sorta depends on the day and my mood. But when it comes to third and fourth functions, I’m ISTP all the way. \n\n\nBut it does give me 57:43 A/T. I believe I’m more assertive on the days that I take on INTJ properties and more turbulent on the days when my ISTP shows. \n\n\nI’d say ISTP is my nature and INTJ reflects the work I’ve put into developing my weaker functions. I guess it’s nature vs nurture. 
1	If I don't know the answer, does that make me turbulent? 
1	Assertive. 
1	87% Assertive. 
1	I am typically 70% assertive and up. When I am in the grip of inferior Fe I can demonstrate turbulent qualities but I have cut out all stress triggers which is primarily nosy and annoying people. Emotional, dramatic people put me in the grip because they have an irritating way of trying to meddle with my life which I am extremely private and closed off about.\n\nI have no social media, been going on like that for a year. That way I don’t have to see politics, hear people’s problems or opinions because it’s not my business and I don’t give a damn. I am selective with my time with friends. That way my business isn’t out there. People know very little about me, where I am, what I am doing. I don’t count reddit. It’s very anonymous and I can control what I see in my feed typically. I need extreme privacy in order to maintain my happiness.\n\nI would say I am more assertive because I like to have control. And if someone is causing me problems or annoying me they either get shut up directly or ghosted without a clue as to why. 
1	turbulent as fuck
1	I switch depends on my mindset and the situation.
1	Assertive. But I don’t feel assertive? I don’t know, I just usually skip over that shit anyway. 
1	Turbulent. Can't make a choice for shit. Question everything, my own beliefs and motivations most of all. If I feel something I need to immediately criticize it and analyze it, is it true? and then I'm lost forever. Lmao.
8	A question to the mods	Why don't they make a seperate r/istpdating subreddit, or start using tags ?\nI come here for seeing how fellow istps live, what they enjoy, etc., not for dating.
11	The problem is this sub is barely active as it is, they don't want to make it worse. 
8	I can look into post flairs but the sub would be even more dead without them.
6	Yeah in a ideal world
3	Aren't relationships a part of life?
14	Possible Flirtation... Should I go for it?	I don't like wasting my time or my energy but I'm considering it because the spontaneous side of me wants something new in my life because I'm bored with it. \n\nHe parks next to me at school (we're seniors in HS) and we used to work at the YMCA and he'd always smile and wave and make an effort to talk to me there. And I'm pretty sure he purposely bumped into my at school to start up a conversation. \n\nI think I enjoyed it because I smiled after but I'm not really sure how I feel. I'm only sure of what I can physically feel. I know I get smiley and nervous but I'm not sure if it's because I'm flattered, confused or I have a crush. \n\nShould I pass it off as a waste of time or explore? \n\nEdit: I'm a 17 y/o female
17	go for it.
13	don't invest too much emotion and then it isn't wasting anything
10	You learn nothing if you don't explore. 
8	Young lady, do it. You're too young not to experience life from most angles (safely). I plan to tell my daughter if she's interested than approach and let it be known. Ask him/her out. If he doesn't want to date then it's okay. Trust me it's okay. There are so many variables even without including you into the equation.\n\nBest of luck.
7	Go for it. In my 47 years, I've learned of a ridiculous number of girls who were interested in me. I'm oblivious :|
7	Go for it, but don’t get too invested until you know it’s worth it. I made the mistake of wrongly investing too much on someone once, and it fucking sucked. Always put yourself above any relationship (be reasonable though) and you’ll enjoy yourself more.
6	ISTP gift-giving etiquette	Browsing through this sub have led me to believe that in general, ISTP prefers practical gifts (tools, gadgets, cash even). \n\nIt’s been great advice so far as I’ve fared quite well with electronics as gift giving and receiving can be awkward, stressful and downright uncomfortable, considering the social pressures put on the receiver, especially an ISTP. \n\nWith that in mind, I generally either give an ISTP the gift nonchalantly and walk away or leave it there so they can open it without the pressure and expectation that most givers wait for. That way they can process it all however they want, and choose when and how to respond.\n\nFor the next occasion, I'm considering one of the newer Apple products in the $300-400 range that they don't currently own, as the ISTP is a big fan and owns multiple devices. The previous gift was cheaper in the $150 range that they totally loved, but I'm hesitant to go substantially higher due to the perceived expensive pricing and social implications. Perhaps a gift card at a lower value might be a more practical choice, but gift giving is a way for me to show the ISTP that I know them.\n\nI don't want to make them feel like they owe me or that I expect the same level of reciprocation. It just so happens that I have the financial means to and that it fits the bill in what I think makes a good gift for ISTP. \n\nHow do you prefer receiving gifts? If at all? Does the price of said gift bother you? Interested to hear everyone's thoughts on gifting.\n\n\n\n\n\n
29	I don't like giving or receiving gifts. 
8	What's the relationship like? If yall are close go for it, just be aware the ISTP is gonna be a little weirded out
7	I like the idea of receiving presents.\nBut I hate when people give me things that will create problems for me such as clothes that don't fit, things that i won't use and food that i won't eat. I hate throwing out things in perfect condition or having to go out of my way to return things.\nUsually chocolate and things that i have explicitly said that i want are safe bets. I won't refuse money but i think it's awkward.
5	My sister gets me clothes, and it's amazing because I hate buying clothes. I think  in her head it's kind of selfish because it lets her give me clothes so I'll have more to wear when I do things with her. \n\nIt works out for me though
4	I LOVE giving gifts. Of all different types, expensive and just really practical stuff. I’ve learned that, at least for my ISTP friend, he doesn’t process/react like any of my other friends. \n\nSo I’d say, get them whatever is in your heart to get them. Surely you know what they would enjoy and if you’re able to get them something cool then go for it! Just don’t be surprised if you get a blank stare and a “thanks” and that’s it.\n\nOne time I gave my friend something and he literally went “hm” and that was it 😂😂 I used to read into it but just know they probably appreciate it in their own way. \n\nHope that was a little helpful 😁👋🏻
2	I never liked recieving gifts and the annoyance it brings but when I do, its a gift that something I would love to have/buy myself. I guess if I were in that ISTP's shoes, I'd love to recieve gifts from you (something you know I will love to have) no matter how costly they were cause I cant really afford them myself if I want to! As long as you are agreeing to give me something where you won't feel that I'm now indebt of you and make me feel guilty because of it. What an asshole, I know but I want it to be a mutual consent cause dont mind if I do! Lmao\n\nAs for giving gifts myself, nah. Never crosses my mind. Unless its for charity, I can donate my old clothes or things to lesser fortunate than me.
2	Look up love languages and that should help, your is probably gift giving which is fine but just know if his is physical touch then he won’t receive the love of you giving a gift in the same way you would receive it
2	This may sound weird but even if its something I want, I don't like people giving it to me. And if they insist, like my wife, I'd like her to take me to the store herself and then tell me that I can pick anything up to X value. That way I can do all the pros and cons myself, even if i KNOW what I want I still for some reason insist to make sure there isn't something better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of gifts that I actually appreciate when its spontaneous, it's small things. A cool wrist band or something. Something really small and inexpensive that's a token of our good relationship. Something I could put on my desk maybe. Not plants tho. I'll forget about it and it WILL die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in general. I really dislike giving or receiving gifts. It weirds me out. 
1	I hate getting gifts even when they are good bc I have to try and make them think I like even tho I really do like it but it's just not apparent I guess. 
1	No gifts, honestly if you got me my favorite chocolate bar that puts forth proceeds to endangered animal habitats I'd be over the moon. But that's just me. Big gifts make me feel kind of guilty because I probably won't know how to do something as nice or thoughtful. So maybe offer an idea as well that you'd enjoy if you sense them flustering at the gift at all.
1	I don't really like receiving gifts (common theme here).\n\nHowever, I've learned that one of the best gifts I can give someone else is to provide them with ideas for what to gift me.
0	Does anyone else have a habit of manipulating people?	I'm 17 and I usually only tend to manipulate my family members for money. For example, I could have $50 in cash but I don't wanna spend any of it so I go to my grandma and just ask her for $10 and then make up some bullshit on why I need it and afterwards I don't even feel bad about it.
15	I don't typically do it for money from family, but I will be very manipulative of teachers for getting extensions or better grades. 
14	[deleted]
9	No because i have a moral compass that stops me.\n\nThat being said... manipulation is easy... heh.
14	that's just lying, and every type can & does. it's a bad habit and a breach of trust toward people i value, so I don't do it cause I'd hate to have it done to me. it's very istp to be willing to take what we dish, so if you're fine with being manipulated, carry on! otherwise, maybe try to break the habit. 
3	yes, and sometimes i don’t even realize i’m doing it until like midway, but depending on the severity, i usually do feel bad about it
3	It's sooooo easy...but the guilt I feel for it is too much
0	Enfj who manipulates all the time. Well I used to. Not much anymore. Our shared functions really assist in the manipulation process. Being an Fe user I manipulate other people more than I do for money or grades or something 
3	Question to iSTP's from an ENTJ.	It seems like ISTP's generally tend to be the better athletes (at least when it comes to individual sports, or highly individual roles on teams). This also coincides with ENTJ's generally being the better suited individual sports coaches. (with ESTP's being better team players and INTJ's being better team coaches)\n\nHow has your interaction with ENTJ's worked out so far and what were their experiences? I don't believe I know many ISTP's so could be good to hear whatever is on the other end and whether there really could be some sort of chemistry there for mentor/mentee kind of thing.\n\n\nFor those who are interested in reading more about this:\nhttp://mbti-in-sports-leadership.strikingly.com/\n\nI think something like this definitely needs a lot more data, but I kind of see how their findings would make sense on a larger scale.
7	I'm an athlete. A pitcher, so fairly specialized role. I would type most of my coaches as ST types. ISTJ ESTJ ESTP only, can't think of an ISTP coach. Although the Blue Jays manager John Gibbons is ISTP as an example if you want one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in business school right now and quite a few classmates are ENTJ. My mom is also ENTJ. So I have non-sports interactions to draw on here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of the dynamic of our interaction: they strike me as intelligent, but I find myself challenging their reasoning and conclusions quite a bit. If I had to guess where the conflict comes from, it would be this: I try to integrate everything I learn/know from any aspect of my life into one ultimate framework. ENTJs move between multiple big-picture frameworks which they do not integrate with each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause of this I find they can be 'hypocritical.' They will apply rules/systems which contradict other rules/systems they also use and have no issue with it.  Or sometimes, they will enforce rules/systems towards others that they don't follow themselves. It bothers me and so I find myself "calling them out" quite a bit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also find that they can change their mind extremely quickly with new information, which I appreciate, but they tend to be extremely rigid with whatever framework/information they are currently using, which I don't appreciate. Compared to me, I am extremely tentative with "locking in" conclusions. I treat everything like a work in progress and I sometimes can't take it seriously when an ENTJ or anyone acts like something is 100% true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat would be the key sources of conflict that I find between me as an ISTP and ENTJs, that seem related to personality type.
2	Unfortunately I don’t know the MBTI type of anybody IRL. None of my friends or family even know what it is. \n\n\nHowever, I can say that is spot on about the ISTP’s at least. I played top varsity tennis in HS. I’ve played all sorts of team sports growing up, but tennis is what I fell in love with. Being able to work on my own time (for the most part) + only having to rely on myself to win we’re the biggest draws for me. But funny enough, I actually won more championships playing with my doubles partner. My skill was outweighed by... well... my weight lol. So having a second person to help cover the court worked to my advantage. We were almost complete opposites in our strengths/weaknesses which made us a formidable pair. \n\n\nNow, based on my knowledge of ENTJ’s, I’m gonna say you’re probably very close. When it comes to a goal oriented task between student/teacher, ENTJ and ISTP mix very well. Especially because one of the common traits ISTP’s get is laziness. During our WTF years, many of us experience laziness stemming from depression and anxiety. We learn to not give a fuck about anything as a coping mechanism. And this inadvertently leads to laziness until we begin to climb out of WTF years (obviously to varying degrees depending on person). I could see The sheer willpower and determination of an ENTJ being *incredibly* useful when coaching an ISTP. 
2	One of my close friends is an ENTJ. To me he can be a mix of supportive and annoying. He supports me in some select decisions, but if I disagree, or if I am better at something then him he begins terrorizing everything that I do. Very controlling and dominant sometimes which is annoying. Other times though he can be great and supportive. If I have an Idea that he agrees with he is great at rallying support for it in a way that I can't. So I suppose its mixed feelings.
12	What does an ISTP who had hit rock bottom look like?	Is it possible for them to completely disregard Se and to act like a depressed intuitive, like an INTx?\n\nMy Ti and Ni are very strong. Ne is strong too. I am thinking maybe I am an Ni-dom, I overindulge with everything when stressed, which could be inferior Se, but Ti-Ni loop and WTF years resonate with me the most.\n\n1. I am cynical with everyone and everything because I think everything they do is inferior and is missing the picture.\n2. It's like there's no point in doing and experiencing stuff because I already know what it leads to.\n3. I tend to believe in random conclusions or "signs" that I suddenly get and take them as truth.\n4. I believe that I can be self-sufficient and that I don't need to please anyone else, though I would really love to have someone to be with because I'm already feeling dead inside due to not having someone to have intellectual conversations/experiences with\n5. I have already accepted that it is my destiny to repeat this same shit over and over and to be aimless in life. I am just waiting for everyone to realize how much of a shit I am so that they hate and push me away so that I could just live in the woods or something.\n\nIn tests I am INTP, and I kinda convinced myself for many years that I am an intuitive too because I tend to look beneath the surface of everything and not do anything first with analyzing it.\n\nSo... yeah I know that's not really Ne. Now that I think about it I don't really think about possibilities all that much, if I do it's just to nitpick against a system that someone cares about. I think I use more Ni than Ne, but it's also just random revelations that I use to reason myself out of my current life and start a new one. When I use Ni it's like shooting my foot over and over. Not like an Ni-dom who uses his skills to deduce something that makes sense from patterns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: And despite all of this shit happening to me the only thing that is in my mind is, "lol"\n\n&#x200B;
12	Hang on... I’m trying to find a picture of me from 2005...
7	[deleted]
3	I think an ISTP who has hit rock bottom would look very much like a dysfunctional INFJ. That is, being very fearful about tribe retaliation and assuming others dislike them when there's no objective evidence for it. 
2	All 5 points are spot on with what I am going through as well. I am even tempted to move to another state onto 10+ acres to minimize human contact, and to completely remove myself from friends and family. It's almost as if in a matter of months I have outgrown everyone I know. All while feeling like nothing I do satisfies. Heading down a path to nowhere. Could it be Fe Grip and Ti-Ni loop at the same time?\n\n\n\nI am hoping this is just an inflection growth point, that will lead to great things in the next stage of life. Playing Hockey has helped. A good steak has helped. Accomplishing small tasks like cleaning/rearranging has helped. Finding the right girl would probably really help. \n\n\nDo you practice stoicism by chance? 
1	Rock bottom is when you don’t even use your 4 main functions anymore. You’re running on your shadow functions. So you can see it straight off when you’re running on Te. But honestly the most obvious is when you’re on Si. 
11	ISTP’s how do you spend your Se?	Hey ISTP’s, I’m an INTP. I really admire some ISTP’s in my life and I’m tbh I’m jealous of the Se in auxiliary. \n\nI’m looking for recommendations of solo Se activities you enjoy i.e. specific exercise, something tactile you mess with (rubix cube or something you build), weird hobbies, or favorite YouTube channels. 
26	I don't think it's a specific "experience" that we pursue.\n\nOther's may have a different experience, but for me, it's that with no matter what I'm doing, I'm 100%, fully in the moment.\n\nI can be hiking, and I'll be giddy with the beauty of the landscape.  I can be talking with a best friend, and they're the most important thing in my life at that time.  I just cooked eggs for breakfast and the taste is overwhelming.\n
4	Surfing is probably the best for myself. It’s so perfect. Depending upon the day it can be relaxing or exhausting but you always have to be scanning and reading the waves coming in. You have to react quickly and at the same time know when not to act. Idk. Hard to describe but when I’m out there I think of absolutely nothing but what’s in front of me. 
5	I enjoy working out. Not really a hobby, more of a beneficial activity that I enjoy. \n\nMy true hobby is firearms. Not a popular thing on most of reddit but ill share with you anyways. I enjoy going to the range for some target shooting. I also really like tinkering. Upgrading this or that, trying out different kinds of ammo, figuring out how things work, and challenging myself to hit difficult targets at long range. I also really appreciate the craftsmanship and history in some of the firearms I own.
6	I reload ammo, then go shoot it at the range. Alone. I work on projects around the appt. I work on my truck, qnd dirtbike. 
3	Going for a nature walk/hike would be a good place to start. I don't really know how to exercise Se while doing so you just kind of go and enjoy yourself. 
3	I bike, hike, go into nature all the time. I just like to feel the world with all my senses. I'm into parkour and acrobatics, balancing on railings, handstands. As far as what I watch, I enjoy watching mma (UFC) from time to time but mostly watch youtube videos on whatever topic I'm into at the moment. I feel like learning to use Se shouldn't be that hard because it's pretty straight forward. Learning to use Ne on the other hand, now that is more difficult. How would I go about developing my Ne from an INTP perspective?
3	Sports. Lots and lots of sports. Volleyball, softball, weight lifting, skiing, running, golf. Also on a pool league. These are all the hobbies I currently partake in. \n\nAlso I like to go to the bars with friends, go dancing, etc. I do not like sitting around and talking for too long when I'm out and about. I need action.
2	1. Playing with slime\n2. Knitting, crocheting\n3. Cooking/baking\n4. Making anything
16	ISTP Women - what is your job/career?	Any women out here feel drawn to the typical ISTP careers: carpentry, engineering, construction, IT? Tell me about your current jobs/career path and what you like and dislike about it. I would be especially interested to hear from female mechanical engineers and pilots.
25	I have no idea. I’m 26 going on 27. \n\nI want to be good at everything - but I’ve been focusing more on things that I have to pay money to do than the things that pay me. Woops... 
10	Data analyst. I love it. 
8	Right now marketing but I hate it, mostly because sitting in an office all day is the most boring thing ever. But its just a job to put myself through school.\n\nI'm studying to work in a museum or park which I really love and I hope to work in a smaller one where I can do stuff in all the departments rather than just collection management which is what I'm studying. But I like how there's always new things coming in and moving around so you're never still for long.

3	I’m a police dispatcher/911 operator. I like it most days. 
6	I'm a professional dog groomer 🖤
3	I am 23 and a speech-language pathologist. It's a female-dominated field and not something most ISTPs would think about. I love my job because I treat *my* goals, that *I* write, using the therapy technique of *my* choice. I take how *I* see fit. I very much enjoy working with children (even if I am fucking exhausted at the end of the day and need to sit in a room alone for the next 6 hours), and seeing their progress is something that is tangible and rewarding for me. I walked 12k steps at work today, so I'm not trapped at a desk which I would despise. Each child is very different, so I get to tease out what their deficits are, their quirks, and how all of that comes together to form my treatment plan.  The best part is I can decide working in the schools is too much and can switch to working in a private practice, a hospital, in people's homes, or even decide I hate children, and now I can go work with adults in nursing homes, hospitals, eta. I also have everything from speech sound disorders, to brain injuries, to feeding/swallowing issues in my scope of practice so when something gets stale, I have other things I can do.  \n\nThe worst part of it would be how extraverted everyone else is and how extroverted people assume I am. Also, fuck paperwork and all that shit. \n\n
3	Videographer/editor. It's cool but not where I thrive 🤷🏻‍♀️
3	I'm in high school, but I'll be applying to colleges in a year (hopefully) as a Materials Science & Engineering major. \n\nCarpentry/construction sounds cool, lol but I'm like 5'0 and I'm struggling just in my Intro to Woodshop class at school. 
2	Computer Engineer!
2	Board Services for a government agency. Setting agendas, facilitating meetings, liaising with Board members - It's mentally challenging but also has downtime for me to re-gather my thoughts and not speak to anyone. 
2	I'm a laboratory technician in a neuropsychopharmacology lab (by day, and a scare actor by night). \n\nThings I enjoy: \nWorking in multiple buildings each week, doing multiple different kinds of tasks in each\n\nThe "high pressure, mild peril" stuff like working with chemotherapeutic agents and radioactive samples while under time constraints. It's the good kind of stress.\n\nDoing blood draws on the animals. Mostly because I'm confident that no one else in the lab is as comfortable with and I want to make sure the animals get the best treatment. \n\nThings I hate: \nOrganization. Keeping track of scheduling and paperwork, and really anything that involves lots of correspondence or sitting at the computer for longer that 1 hour per day. I know it's important but I'm just not up to par with the last person who did that job. \n\nThere's too much work for one person to do in real-time, specifically it takes inhuman effort to keep every thing I have to do in one day straight even with multiple notes. It's like playing a T. D.\n\nOverall I like my job and take pride in my competency, I would prefer higher pay that reflects my ability and commitment. 
1	 A staff accountant for a public accounting firm. I mostly do tax work.  At times it can be interesting since accounting can be a puzzle, but mostly I’m bored out of my mind. Two weeks ago I applied to a local university for their commercial aviation program.  
1	Biomedical Engineering Technician.  I work for a large hospital repairing medical electronics and doing preventive maintenance.\n\nI ended up here after getting a Masters in Health Administration and soon realizing it was a horrible personality fit.  I wanted to stay in healthcare but didn't want to touch people. Definitely in a male dominated field now but it hasn't been a problem.  It took my coworkers a bit to finally treat me like "one of the guys".
1	I worked several construction/carpentry jobs in my life. Now trying to find the happy balance between public health academia and hands on.
1	Was working in healthcare as a phlebotomist (taking blood from people) - left due to work politics. Now in insurance doing claims... Not what I pictured my career path to be, and definitely not the stereotypical ISTP career... But trying to be practical and have more stable hours/income.
1	i'm training to become a high school teacher...lmao probably one of the least recommended careers for ISTPs
1	Late to the party here but I saw you didn't have any MCHE responses. \n\nIm not exactly sure what you're looking for but I fit the MO. Lol you're always welcome to shoot me any questions you have. I'd be glad to help :)
1	Pharmacy Technician 
1	Nothing, I've been hopping jobs and colleges all of my adult life.
1	I am a CPA working in Project Accounting for a construction firm. I like messes and construction seems to go from easy and organized to total shit show. I like working on the crazy projects. 
1	Computer programmer here, but I found a job where its half programming half engineering and I have freedom to make tools to improve how we do things internally (and then abandon them and let someone else maintain them hahaha)
1	I was active duty Navy for 9 years and my job was finance and pay. In my civilian life it is the same...accountant. I enjoy the black and white of numbers you cant bullshit your way to make everything balance. 
1	Lord of the Rings vs Star Wars	Which do you prefer if any and why?
9	Do you like potatoes or bananas?\nThis is how i perceive your question.\n 
10	I grew up reading LotR and watching the original star wars trilogy. \n\nThey weren’t in the same category at all. \n\nI always enjoyed reading more though, so I’d go with LotR. 
7	LOTR
3	Lotr hands down.\nI prefer fantasy settings usually.\nStar wars is fun though
3	I didn't grow up with either, but rather discovered them in high school.\n\nLotR for me. The strength of the main characters is what did it for me. 
3	Star Wars hands down. A wonderful blend of spaghetti western, old samurai movies, history, and old stories told in an exciting way. Just a great hero’s journey.\n\nI like LOTR but I would much rather live in the Star Wars universe. The technology, the things to learn, the things to be done.\n\nI prefer ASOIAF and The Witcher series over LOTR. Just better fantasy worlds in my opinion. 
3	Lord of the Rings
5	I grew up with Star Wars so I naturally lean in that direction. Watching the first 6 in a marathon really shows you what a great story teller George Lucas was. He was just a bad movie director imo.\n\nThis has made want to rewatch LoTR though. Ive always enjoyed the plot in general but I feel like it deserves a more in depth marathon watch like I do with Star Wars. \n\nAlso LoTR > the Hobbit
4	I'm not really a fan of either movie, I just think both movie series are just too long and drawn out. The Star Wars movies are really well made though I just can't sit still for that long. That being said I really enjoyed the LOTR books because I like Tolkien's writing and fantasy novels in general so I might give it to them. I love the 1977 Hobbit cartoon as well.\n\nSo for me best to worst:\n\n1. Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi (minus the casino scene I went to the bathroom during it and felt like I missed nothing)\n2. Lord of the Rings\n3. every other Star Wars movie
2	Star Wars - space battles
1	Am I the only ISTP who doesn't give two craps about anything fantasy? It's not realistic, therefore, boring, and not worth my time. I would say neither. I'd rather watch how it's made.
1	Lord of the rings is at least consistent in quality. Star Wars just disappointed me, then again I prefer Star Trek :p 
13	I think I'm into the wrong kind of person. Advice appreciated.	ISTP here, very interested in a gregarious extroverted feeler guy.\n\nI'm clearly intimidated by this guy because he's great at what I'm really bad at. He's really warm, open and friendly. Thing is, he's affectionate with everyone and I'm most likely no special case on his book. It sucks because I'm pretty much obsessed with him. I just can't keep up with his energy and confidence I guess, I don't feel like I am interesting enough. Today I saw him and he gave me a hug because he said I looked worried (I was kind of upset, externally just thoughtful) and later he was hugging someone else. I have no intention of possessing anyone to myself but it's kind of annoying knowing that I care and think about so few people, one being him, and that I'm not such a huge deal in his life. Should I stop going to the place where I see him? (sounds dreadful) I think about him almost constantly and I find everything else in my life uninteresting. I have hobbies and a job, and I wouldn't want to spend everyday with him I guess, but I'm mentally consumed by this situation. I'm not really close to this guy, but as lame as it sounds, I get overwhelmed by his eyes whenever I see him.\n\nJeez, that's cringy probably. Have you guys ever been in a similar situation? Any insight to share? I wish I was this invested in a practical thing but nope.
14	there’s no wrong type of person to be attracted to
8	Just gotta be straight up with him. Don’t let him in how obsessed you are though. And I don’t say obsessed in a derogatory way. I think ISTP’s have a knack for deep infatuations. I’ve been plagued by it my whole life. So were in the same boat. I just recently had to follow this advice I’m about to give you myself. It was just this summer. \n\n\nBasically you just want to keep it neutral. The less you show you want this, the easier it’ll be to remain friends if he’s not interested. Step up to his confidence level and ask him to go out. “Hey! So I was thinking. We get along really well and have fun together. Would you like to get coffee sometime? Maybe see if there’s something else here?” It’s a very unloaded and lighthearted way to ask him out. If he says “oh I’m sorry I’d rather just be friends”, “works for me! Just thought I’d ask and see if you were interested.” \n\n\nSo now, you’ve just gauged his feelings without having to fully reveal how into him you are. It’ll be easier for him to stay friends not knowing that bit because it’s hard to be friends with someone when you know they’re obsessed. So if he’s down, go have coffee and get that D. If he’s not interested, you now have a solid answer and can begin to let him go. Letting go is easier when you know there isn’t a chance. And you can do that on your own time behind closed doors without having to lose him in the process. But hopefully he’s interested and y’all can have a new beginning. 
3	You’re in the period of testing the waters (compatibility), and the discomforts are normal between a thinking type and a feeler type, which is amplified even more by the contrast between your introversion and his extraversion. \n\nMy advice is to actually know what you want from this guy, express it and make decisions on that. Being in a loop of thinking over your feelings can be draining and lead to faulting the person and labeling him as the wrong one for you. This is normal for some, but, relational productivity-wise, not good. \n\n
5	a lot of extroverts are polite and/or nice to everyone they see (I stress that 'a lot' does not indicate majority). We introverts only pay attention to a select few, so those that do pay attention to us, we often perceive as being interested, as that's how we would behave if we were to be interested. You just need to learn how to have a mental filter for this stuff. I myself am still learning so I can't give advice on how, but I *can* tell you what.
1	Also was in a similar situation. I told them how I felt and they weren't interested but it was ok cause we good friends now.
0	This is a dumb sub that is filled with extreme perspectives regarding the value of the MBTI.	Please refer to my title and promptly ban me from the sub. Thank you!
22	Not really tbh. The only reason I’m subscribed is because it’s so chill. Some of the dumb relationships/compatibility posts are dumb af, but it’s overall pretty solid around here. \n\nYou can leave any time you want. 
12	It’s like traveling to a mountain top in search of some zen state. \n\nYou will only find what you brought with you. 
6	Cool story bro 😎 👉 
6	Wow bud. Really showing your colors aintcha. You need attention so damn badly that you entered a sub you don’t like just to tell us you don’t like us. You’re so addicted to attention, you don’t even care if it’s positive or negative. You just want it. That’s pretty sad. Before you come in here hating on people who have used this place to sort out their life, maybe you should address the holes in your own personality. Nobody likes an attention whore. 
4	What do you mean?
3	I feel like the same can be said with all mbti subs. just don't go on them if you don't like them there's no need to make a post.
3	Someone wants to be kicked out so they can forever whine about being persecuted instead of what most people do, just fucking leave.
2	Go fondle your guitar you artsy bitch, maybe a drunk dumb 6/10 will listen to you talk about how "you don't vote bc all politicians are just, like, the same" if you practice your scales enough to seem talented
1	Eh. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
1	If this guy is holding his breath waiting to get banned, I think we're gonna have to deal with a rotting corpse in a few days.
8	Who is your favorite istp character? I just watched nowhere to run, and watching Jean claude kick the shit out of buearcrats from the top of his motorcycle really made me feel great.	
6	Jessica Jones from Marvels Netflix series.
4	ron swanson.
3	Jason Bourne
3	Jotaro Kujo 
2	I liked Mr. Robinson from Netflix's Lost in Space and the dad in A Quiet Place, I've read both are ISTPs. I don't really watch much tv.
2	The mechanic in Drive (Ryan Gosling)
2	Meursault from *The Stranger* by Albert Camus. 
1	John Mclane. 
1	McLane is awesome.
1	Aragon II, son of Arathorn.
4	ISTPs, how do you maintain your significant relationships (romantic or otherwise)?	I would love to know varied perspectives / realistic actions. 
11	for friendships, i’ve found that it’s best to limit them only to the people i truly want to spend time with and making it abundantly clear that i am not good at expressing my emotions and that i may not always respond immediately, but if i choose to spend my time with you, it’s because i consider you a close friend even if we haven’t talked in days or weeks. i’ve been extremely lucky since i’ve found friends who have understood this side of me and understands thought i might not be verbally affirming, their friendship still means a lot to me (even if i still cynically believe that no friendships last forever and that every friend/person is replaceable). \n\nas for relationships, i avoid them like the plague! i’ve found that commitment and i don’t mix well and i usually end up hurting the other person much more than i even imagined possible. 
9	I dont
9	My current relationship is very easy to maintain. Im Not scared of commitment in terms of this relationship but only bc he is a right fit for for me. I spend A LOT of time with him. When I'm alone with him I really am able to get that alone time with myself because he makes it so easy to be myself - my truest self. So goddamn cheesy... The maintenance is very natural and neither of us go out of out way to cultivate it. However we do both have good communication skills with each other, And being open about how we feel is something we do often to maintain what we have. Truly effortless but complex with an incredible amount of depth. I'm very fortunate to have met someone who compliments me so well. I'd be hard pressed to meet someone else who is able to do this for me that I would commit to on a long term basis. He's an ENFP. \n\nFriendships .. never had success in maintenance because I never felt the need or desire to keep most people around. Not that I didn't want close friendships but that a meaningful bond was hard to forge. It sounds shallow and snobbish but I never encountered people that I saw that potential in even though I desired it growing up .. Besides a cousin of mine. I'd consider her a best friend. We keep in touch once a month or less - whether we call or text (she lives far away). What makes it easy is that we both know where our relationship stands and are confident that when we do reunite we pick back up where we left off... Essentially we are naturally low maintenance people. I peg her as an ENTP\n
8	Well it's hard for me mostly because I have nothing to say. I'm quiet most of the time, shy but can be the life of the party if I'm feeling it. Problem with that is the people expect me to be that way all the time then but I'm only like that rarely. Idk, I've never had deep relationships or been good at making friends.
5	My boyfriend is ESTP and he maintains the relationship bc he's so high-energy and aggressive, I just show up and look pretty for the cameras
3	Blind luck.\n\nI've never had a relationship that didn't blow up sometime between the 2 and 3 year mark, and I pretty much only have one close friend and one sorta close friend at any given time.\n\nI make new friends and lose them within a few months due to fading, generally.\n\nI'm horrible at staying in touch and I'm painfully aware of how emotionally unavailable I am most of the time.\n\nObviously it can't just be luck, but whoever on board is maintaining my relationships isn't a part of the consciousness party.
3	Lol. Maintain what?
3	Friendships are no-brainers. Hang out with people you click with. Respect them, if they respect you and you can talk to them about literally anything without being emotionally invested. That's a keeper. Discard the rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRomantically. It's a nightmare. I need so much solitude and I'm so blunt sometimes that I just end up hurting those that care about me. They end up feeling unloved and lose respect for me and when they don't respect me I don't want to be around them so that just ends it right there. I try my best to be social and sugar coat everything and interact with my love interests but it's an absolute nightmare some days. My extroverted battery is like a 6year old broken iphone, it dies half way through the day and then I'm just a dick apparently. I've found one that tries to understand and respect my need for solitude but I can tell it's hard on her. And It's hard on me if she doesn't so...\n\nyeah I dont know. I've only ever met girls that need absurd amounts of attention (from my perspective, from theirs its normal amounts.) or girls that don't want attention at all where I wonder why they're even in a relationship in the first place. No interest in sex or any intimacy. It's like one or the other and both kinda suck.\n\nMaybe I'm just a dick, I dunno. But I've made peace with the idea that I might die alone and honestly that was never really a concern to begin with.\n\nI guess just try to have fun while it lasts you know?
2	Uhhhh
1	The second and third longest relationships I've had were 8 months and two weeks respectively. My SO is an INFP and he just meshes well with me. We started as friends and now are married and have been together almost 10 years. Besides normal little white lies (I got held up in traffic, of course I did not spend 20 mins reading in my car before leaving) we are honest with each other and talk about everything. We're also nonmonogamous and while our relationship didnt need that, if gives us more freedom and just works for us.
5	Not moving your mouths	Today someone pointed out that I barely move my mouth when I talk, even though everything comes out clearly.\n\nIs this something you folks do as well or am I just a bit strange?\n\n I thought it might have something to do with the whole not showing much emotion thing.
14	I think that has a lot more to do with who taught you to speak vs your personality type. Speech patterns are picked up from people speaking around you. Same concept as an accent. It’s about the verbal influences around you as you’re learning to speak. 
6	Your mouth is just lazy
4	Yah I don't move my mouth at all. It's not that hard to talk.
2	Grew up in a Spanish speaking household, so never was a problem for me.
2	Some people just talk that way. It's not necessarily a learned behavior or anything. It really doesn't mean much about anything at all.\n\nSource: Speech Pathologist 
2	Yeah, sometimes people don't understand what I'm saying because they rely too much on reading lips
2	I had people point that out to me as well, I thought it's just me who done that.
1	Dunno. I've been known not to articulate enough sometimes
1	I do move my mouth but whenever I filmed my face saying something, I've noticed that I clearly make less facial expressions than I usually think I do.
19	Fuck my life	
11	i feel attacked
10	This article basically explains why ISTPs are closed off to emotion, for fear of being negatively affected by them. 
3	All of this is true.
2	Feels better reading it with [this playing ](https://youtu.be/HKkL7DfoE3U) in the background. 
-2	Lol i don't know that anyone's emotions come and go on command. * their emotions come and go as they please* or something to that effect. \n\nAlso- there are emotions that are more appropriate than others? \nI thought you feel what you feel.  How you act is what affects your fellow humans.
3	Do you usually move slowly?	Someone I live with has pointed out that I move slowly all the time. At home I'm usually trying to stay present and appreciate things such as the smell of my coffee. I go to the gym very often and enjoy running. Before going I guess I try not to waste energy until I drink my coffee, afterwards I'm very energetic and spontaneous all day long. I care about performance and tbh working-out is my favourite activity. I've been considering getting into P.E. and I know that people who don't ever see me working-out would laugh hysterically if I told them. Are you guys also perceived as sluggish when doing mundane things?
24	I ussualy move fastly. I walk faster than everyone I know.
14	[deleted]
9	I move too fast for most people. They keep asking me how many cups of coffee I had, and I keep saying zero.
5	No. No one has ever referred to me that way.
4	only when I'm on vacation. If I'm in a new space I want to look around and absorb everything even if the people I'm with are 2 blocks ahead of me.
3	I walk fast and with purpose. But when I'm performing something that requires thought, I intentionally slow down and focus on my thoughts and make sure everything is gathered before I act. But then once that's done, I'm pretty quick again.
2	I’ve never given it much thought but I can definitely see where you’re coming from. When I am at home, especially when I cook, I like to take my time. I’ll slowly gather my ingredients and kitchen tools and take a while to cook whatever I’m doing. I also eat generally slower than most people I know, unless I’m in a rush. I’ll do whatever activity I do calmly and slowly most of the time, except walking, which I do faster than the average person.\n\nDon’t know if it has anything to do with MBTI but I’m like that too.
2	Absolutely yes.  I have been accused of walking and working too slowly my whole life.  I like to get up a good 90 minutes to two hours before I have to be out the door in the morning and just not be hurried.  Fast does not equal efficient.
2	No. Except when I really need to end the logic of the thinking happening in my head
2	Know I’m late, but I walk fast, work slowly. I usually take an hour to eat and homework is a night activity, but I’m blitzing everywhere around campus.
4	People thinking basic Ti functions are Ti-Ni.	Does anyone else experience this? 
9	Nothing about this question makes sense. Can you elaborate?
32	Outisders	This post is largely about this video. It's a song, and I think it's a good one that very much applies to ISTP's. Music has a tendency to make me think, and those thoughts led to this post. I recommend listening to the song.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U58y6axpS-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U58y6axpS-E)\n\nSo I'm an ISTP, I'll be 33 next month. I feel that makes me older than a lot of this reddit. I've had what I would classify an interesting life. I don't really know how long this will be, because I might ramble. I posted the video because it means something, and I think it delivers a message.\n\nTLDR - You are not alone in the world, no matter what it seems like. You are important, people care about you, and you impact everyone around you. Love yourself, take risks, enjoy life. You have value, give yourself a chance at life, and let others have their say in being in your life.\n\nEveryone who has ever known me has believed me to be a smart person. I think that generally is result of common sense from being able to inately and quickly understand how things work and just see them simply. I grasp things fast. For being a smart person, I think I'm a gigantic idiot. I've had a huge tendency to blow up my life completely and shut everyone out. When I was in high school I had a girlfriend for 3 years. Quite frankly it was the perfect relationship. She was happy just being together, there was no drama, we meshed well, she let me do things on my own without freaking out about it, and I spent as much time as I could with her outside of that. After high school we both joined the military, some time later I cheated on her. I thought I had feelings for the other girl, when in hindsight it was just a matter of missing my girlfriend and having spent a lot of time with this girl, who ironically was married. It only happened once, I immediately felt extremely guilty and broke down and told my girlfriend. She took it extremely well, which basically made me blow it up even more because I turned everything into a fight with a girl I don't think I ever had a single fight with in 3 years. Since that point in my life I've been seeking that relationship, because it was perfect. Not so much the person, just the dynamic. I loved her, and I would have been content, but there was never a this is the one feeling.\n\nThe one who was the one I really connected to was a relationship both before and after. It's an extremely long complicated story I won't get into. The short version is we had a thing when we where young. She's the first girl I kissed.  It was basically the perfect first kiss, which it was for both of us. We had spent the day walking through the forest in a freezing creek having water fights and holding hands and talking, until at some point we kissed standing there freezing in the middle of the forest with no one anywhere close. It was perfect (well, except for the short period before when I asked her to teach me to kiss because it supposedly wasn't her first, CLASSIC ISTP MOVE, still feel like an idiot for that one!). My parents divorced when I was young, she lived near my Dad who I spent the summers with, and this was like Freshman year high school, so we didn't actually have a relationship. There's a lot more to it, but yeah. One Christmas I took a few weeks leave to visit my Dad and I went on a few dates with her again. It was an amazing time. We didn't do anything more than kiss. At the end of it she told me she was going to be in the area where I was stationed for Spring Break and wanted to spend time together. There was lots of tears about leaving. I was someone who to that point in my life was extremely confident in both myself, and my ability to read others. I believed her completely, and believed in the connection we had to each other, it was very borderline telepathic, even across distance. The last time I ever talked to her was New Years Eve, which was just a normal conversation. After that I never heard from her ever again. This is something like 13 years ago. The being completely cut off and not having any understanding of why completely destroyed me and everything I was.\n\nI blew up my life again. My life went pretty haywire, but due to my closed nature no one really had a clue. I ended up leaving the Air Force after 4 years, when I had really planned on doing at least 20 years for benefits and retirement. Frankly I loved my job, though I wasn't that happy in general with the Air Force, mostly due to supervisors. I lost all my confidence in myself, and very much got stuck in a rut of I'm not good enough. It's something I still struggle with sometimes. A few years ago I was able to be honest enough to realize why contact was cut like it was, and it was ironic. I saw it the whole time, but I didn't want to see it. All the signs where there, and I had the experience in my life to know what it looked like. I was the other guy. She was in a relationship, and she was confused. It was easiest to just cut me off with no explanation.\n\nI spent lots of years pretty lost without a path, without knowing myself anymore. I blew up a few jobs, I cut off friends who I shouldn't have. I generally did nothing good with my life. I never really let myself have a relationship. That's not to say I didn't try to have relationships, but frankly I never gave them a fair shot. Communication about my thoughts where non existent. I essentially didn't put effort in, I was very closed. I was too hurt to let anyone else in.\n\nSomewhere around when I was 28 I had hit a hard low. I was very stuck, and I recognized it. I couldn't find a way out. I got stuck in fear. All I could see was all the things that prevented me from doing things to get out. All the things wrong, all the problems. I had cut literally everyone out of my life. I was broke, I had blown up another couple jobs, and another relationship with a person who really saw the best in me and cared about me, but my failures to really communicate drove her away. I was very much alone, and very much deep in a dark dark well.\n\nI had some very close friends in high school. One day 2 of them showed up at my door, not together but hours apart. I hadn't talked to either of them in probably something close to 3 years. Quite frankly I just couldn't bring myself to talk to them because I was so unhappy with my own life and who I was. They had talked to each other, and planned it so they both came the same day. Essentially they wanted to know I was okay, and they wanted to show hey we care and want to be a part of your life. It was a wake up call I very much needed. One of them was a girl, one a guy. Frankly if I'm being honest the Girl was hoping for a relationship, which is one I very much wanted as well (we'd tried multiple times in the past and failed, just never both in the right place emotionally). I didn't make it happen, because I care for her too much to give her not my best, and I was very far from it. I didn't want to be a burden on her when I was at my worst. That's not a choice that was fair for me to make for her, it's something if I was wiser I would have been up front and talked with her about. Let her know how I feel and what I think. Irony in that that is the story of how most of my relationships could have been made better.\n\nReally they saved my life that day, and I will never truly be able to tell them how much they made a difference. I will love them both forever, and be eternally grateful. Since then I've managed to not blow up my life, and things have gotten consistently better. Every day I make myself a better person. It took a lot of introspection, and being truly honest with myself and accepting my downfalls and working them. I'm not perfect, I make mistakes. I still hit potholes in life.\n\nI've rambled a lot, and said a lot of things. I guess what I'm really getting at here is that people matter. I think as ISTP's we kind of tend to live in our own little worlds. We are content by ourselves, but we aren't really our best selves. The relationships you make in life matter. People mean something. Don't make the mistakes I have. Don't cut people out because of your self view, you do a disservice to both yourself and others. It's not up to you to decide if other people care for you, because people do care for you. You are their rock. You are the stable support that gets them through life, and they will be there for you. They would do anything for you. You attract good people, find the good ones, trust them, let them be your friends. You are better with others. You don't have to do it alone.\n\nCan't believe I'm going to hit post
12	Uhh can I get a tldr?\n\nMaybe I'll try reading this next time in in the bathroom
3	Thank you for sharing this. I am 37, and your story is quite similar to mine (details vary, of course).\n\nThe concluding paragraph is spot on to the conclusion I have come to after getting out of the 13 year long dark teatime of the soul.

2	What a great post. Spoken like a wise sage. You've knocked my cynicism down several levels. And I shared your video link with a friend too. Thank you. 
-6	wow, you are 33 years old and you still think like this? I have a feeling that  most of you THINK you are ISTPs have it wrong. so far most of these posts are from someone who i would consider weaker minded,not confident and NOT an ISTP.
1	What’s your zodiac sign?	And your gender?\n\nI’m a female Aquarius ISTP.\n\nI know all that horoscope zodiac stuff is nonsense or whatnot, but fuck if I ain’t a sucker for those quick “signs as/if” etc posts lol. \n\nI also read somewhere that in terms of population (U.S) Aquarius are the least and Scorpios being the most.\n[here’s a google search link to the population ](http://faculty.tamucc.edu/sfriday/wordpress/?p=1317)\n
8	Fem Libra ISTP\n\nI always find it stupidly hilarious but its charming in its own way for me to slightly be interested in it. How bout Natal Charts? Those suckers can get me spinning understanding it. Its quite impressive actually how people created all this.

However, looking at the traits, I identify more with those that are characteristic to Gemini while seeing some that are characteristic to Cancer.

2	'rarest type'. Haha we're all suckers for this hence the fact that everyone and there mother is an INTJ and INFJ. I get it though, I'm no different and constantly seek out these tests to give me a little boost in feeling unique. I gotta just start believing it I guess.

10	Looking for insights on early stages of dating	Some background on myself:\nI am an ISTP but my scores put me on the border of ESTP. So while I certainly have introverted tendencies, I have no problem pulling out an extroverted version of myself if need be. In terms of relationships, I have had one serious relationship which ended poorly (mainly because I realized my ex had a border line personality disorder and was very manipulative) and have dated a few women. So it's not that I don't have any experience in relationships but one thing that I have found is that when I am in the very early stages of dating or even liking someone, my mind thinks of every possible thing wrong with them and why it wouldn't work. This causes me to go into my shell and just not deal with the problem. So my question is, does anyone else have this issue and how do you deal with it?
13	You have two options. Stop actively looking for red flags, which is like telling a pig to lose weight, or start looking for *green flags* too. \n\n\nIf you’re only looking for problems, you will find them. And your con list will quickly outweigh your pros list. \n\n\nSo here’s what I suggest. Keep a private note/journal/etc. Every time you find a pro, add it. Every time you find a con, add it. \n\n\nThis list will probably go back and forth over time. Sometimes you’ll have more cons, sometimes you’ll have more pros. But if one list starts to double the other, you pretty much have an answer. If you’re a few months in and the con list is twice as long, time to go. If the pros list is twice as long, stop the exercise and just enjoy life with her. \n\n\nWhat I also suggest is try doing the same for yourself. Add your good and bad qualities. This ones a bit harder, but it can definitely help you make sure things are balanced. That way you aren’t up on a pedestal judging her, but are standing next to her judging both parts of the equation. This part of the exercise will also help develop your self awareness. Being aware of your strengths and weaknesses is a very beneficial tool for personal growth. \n\n\nEdit: don’t forget that this is life with emotions and complex thoughts. It isn’t just a math problem. So you don’t have to stick hard to this pros and cons list. Don’t forget to take your feelings into account as well. She’s a human, not a car. So don’t solely base your decision on the “features” she does and doesn’t have. 
3	You probably do that because you're afraid of getting obsessed with them and then losing them, so you look for anything to not make yourself vulnerable. I would ask yourself what for sure is a deal breaker, and if a woman doesn't have any of those signs, give her a chance and see where it goes.
2	i relate to this entire post from borderline-ESTP to always looking for a red flag in relationships. 
2	idk bro, but from experience, it's essential to keep the ball rolling. if you stop trying, you're going to have to relearn again. my texting/talking skills fluctuate
2	I had this with my current relationship, for the first few months I was very cautious. I thought a lot about it not working out even though it was going well. But I tried not to let it affect the relationship, I had every interest in seeing where it will go. So my advice is simply to accept that you have these doubts, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm in the same relationship now and the doubts are very much gone. I think it will just take you time to finish analysing the situation.
1	wow i do this too actually. also on the border of istp/estp. i don't have any advice. i think it's something you just have to be cognizant of going forward when looking for relationships.\n\ni actually judged my last ex too quickly. he had a lot of positive traits that took longer to notice, but by that time, i'd already screwed the relationship up.
7	Where can I meet more ISTPs?	ENFP male here.  I worked with an ISTP female rotation student for 6 weeks and absolutely loved my time with her (I am also highly attracted to her, but reasons below and a long story for another sub).  I told her that I had never met anyone like her before and that I found her fascinating.  I felt like we balanced each other out very well from a listening/conversation/sense of humor perspective.  Just a really good, unique connection that I’ve never had with anyone else before.\n\nI would love to meet more people like her, but because of ISTPs tendencies to not be overly social and stay very private, I don’t know where to find you guys/girls.  Maybe I’m overgeneralizing (I apologize), I’ve heard bookstores are good, but am stuck otherwise.  Any suggestions are much appreciated!  Thanks in advance!
15	we’re everywhere, it’s just that ISTP’s aren’t really easy to recognize right away 
13	We are often doing some kind of hobby. There's probably a lot of us playing video games. I would make a claim that there are probably a lot of nerdy "INTPs" who are actually ISTPs.
10	Unfortunately for you we only make up 6 percent of the population according to statistics.\n\nIn a group of 16-17 people there should be 1 ISTP. There's about a 30% chance this person is female.\n\nYou would most probably find a female ISTP only if you had a group of around 55 people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know why I bothered to write this out.
8	On Steam, probs playing video games on a Friday night
7	Yeah my best friend is ENFP! I read somewhere that if you find an ENFP you’ll find an ISTP not too far away.
3	i go out drinking on weekends a lot. music shows and bars are my bread and butter. i might be more outgoing than your average istp in that department.
3	The bar.
3	Get involved in ISTP hobbies, you're bound to find them. We're out there. Don't stay inside playing video games: Go out, Get dirty, Get involved. Engage the "sensing" side.
2	find folks who are in tech school
2	Music shows and nerdy conventions, maybe
2	I'm ISTP my bestie is ENFP, I simply like her more than every friends I ever had. I agree with you we have meaningful and fun times. But she is like ”omg I like  guy number 1 !” and the next week ” I can't resist on the hotness of guy number 2!”  two months later ” do u think I can have a relationship with the guy number 3? I have a bad crush on him, he is the one”      So dear ENFP first of all work on that!  For ISTPs which are naturally loyal, her behavior is bullshit. I mentoring her sometimes or just laugh at the cutie immatureness. But for ENFPs I think INFJs are best for a relationship. And for ISTPs ESTJs are the best.
2	By the way we meet in the sport shooting class. She is the champion  ;)
1	That garage. The one with the light on in it at 0200 and someone rolled under a car/hunched over a workbench/shoulder deep in a project. Covered in oil or sawdust. Thats us. 
1	Honestly, I don't like the idea of being found. I find myself doing activities that require as little interaction with other people and if someone approached me at random wishing to socialize I would be greatly displeased.
45	Anyone else felt like you didnt fully fit in with any social clique in school?	
64	I did not fit into any one group but I seemed to get along with all of them.
21	Yep.\nEven now as an adult, I don't really fit in.  I basically have my husband and kids, and 2 friends i see occasionally.\nAt least now, I care a lot less.
10	Wish I’d known this was normal for our type in high school...
10	We actually don’t suck at communication, we suck at talking with people we don’t know, or when there’s more than two people in the conversation and you don’t know how to react to them yet, once you know people usually you can be fine with talking when you want to, be okay with being a quiet person, I’m still surprised at how many compliments I get for just being a chill quiet dude
7	Yup.  Sometimes I'd hear people labeling me into a clique and it'd be different every day with different groups.  Still have no idea who my tribe is.  
9	Yes, but not because I didn't belong, but because everyone seemed to follow me around bc of how amiable I am. I'd kind of appeal to other people's interests and personalities and would have jock friends, nerds, popular kids etc... The whole ordeal. But just as easily I could be alone so yeah it's wild\n
3	Yep
5	Oh yeah. I could drift between other groups of friends/types easily but ate my lunches alone outside. Hated the cafeteria. Never had an issue socializing, just preferred it come to me. \n\nBut yeah. We don’t like being put in boxes. Too confining. \n\nEven now, my friends range from hippie-yoga types, blue collar types, etc. most of my friends if I put them in a room together wouldn’t get along. \n\nWhich is like a funny inside joke to only me. 
2	Massively. I remember being aware of them all but just feeling like I didn’t belong to any. I feel like the guys I hung around with felt sort of the same. 
2	I floated between social groups, but none of them I was fully into, and none of them I felt like I was really close to. I liked having a couple of close friends that weren't into partying and getting in trouble, and they're still friends 8 years later. \n\nAfter high school was when I got into my ISTP self, didn't have to care what a bunch of people thought about me, didn't have to see the same annoying people day after day, and didn't have to spew remembered facts onto paper about subjects I had no interest in. It's amazing what happens when you cut out the pieces of life you don't enjoy.
2	Happening to me right now, i just dont fit into anything, i'm neutral with everyone tho
2	Yes 100%. I was mostly a floater, people generally let me hang out with them (mostly in school, rarely if ever outside of school), but I never felt like I belonged or I was fully a member. 
2	I hung out with the artsy/nerdy/slackers. I was a mix of all that and didn't get along with the popular kids, we sorta spoke a "different language" and they were busy shouting at each other to notice me.
2	Same, drifted in and out of many. Now that im older i just dont care. I felt the same about music genres
1	In hs now and I wouldn’t say I belong to any (but there’s really not that many anyway, and it’s definitely not very significant). 
1	Yup
1	I had a lot of aquaintences in high school but i didn't get categorized in any particular clique. 
1	Me, an INFP, and my husband, and ISTP, are both kind of (happy) social misfits. We tend to be on good terms with people though.
1	Story of my life. I tend to hang out with multiple groups of people.
1	Never fit into any one group through any part of my life. \n\nI could be in any group except the jock or party-slut groups.\n\nBut none actually felt like: Yeah, these are my people. \n\nStill don't. I have one friend that I treasure more than anything in the world. I almost never see or hear from him but he's the only dude I've ever gotten a long with at such an intimate level. No homo. I don't actually know his personality type but he might be ISTP as well. Just a more functional one.
6	How to deal with being "shy" at school?	I'm currently 17 and in high school and everyone sees me as this "quiet, unemotional kid" in class (they told me this upfront). I can sense that I'm sorta shy but in my head I can't seem to stop thinking "I don't need anyone" and as a result I don't talk to anyone. I think I'm dealing with some emotional issues right now but I can't quite make them out. I keep all my feelings and thoughts to myself except for this one friend I have online even though I have about 4 other close friends since 2nd grade but I don't really talk to them about my issues. How would you guys suggest that to just somehow strike up a conversation with someone?
6	Start by listenint to others, I think that by doing that you show concern and that way people will have easier time talking to you. Say a few words, but be impartial until you gain their trust, without insulting. If you disagree, openly admit it, but in a way that still respects their opinions and does not insults. You will not have the patience with all people or each subject in the beginning, but the more you open up, the more you should get used to. Beware, its not always a big deal when people "joke", if it does not insult you. If you can, join a club to have a common passion or inclination. \n Unlike me, you are a Fe user so this should come easier. 🙂
2	Ask questions! Especially open-ended ones about what people are passionate about. For example, you can ask about people’s doodles, their t-shirts, their jewelry. Do you like drawing? Is that your favorite TV show and what do you like about it? People love to talk about themselves, and we’re naturally good listeners because we don’t like to talk about ourselves that much. And people are interesting! \n\nIt’s ok to not share your thoughts and feelings with anyone. We’re known for being guarded, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s okay to not share yourself with just anyone. It’s okay that others don’t see your emotions. We feel things, but we just react inwardly and process inwardly. There’s nothing wrong with that. Don’t feel like you have to be bubbly and outgoing and expressive to have meaningful relationships with people.\n\nWhen I didn’t have anyone, what helped me was journaling. Journalling really helped me puzzle out my feelings and my identity without making me feel like I was relying too much on any one person. \n\nAnd yeah, ISTPs don’t need anyone, but ISTPs also like to be needed. We tend to have a bit of a Savior Complex, but if handled the right way, our desire to help fix things can really deepen bonds with people. 
1	The way I found was to practice by forcing myself to talk to people. Say hey, how are you, ask a personal question (not too personal) and share. Eye contact. A light smile depending on the situation, then names and handshakes. I also watch too much TV so shows where the characters are sociable help too. 
2	How to keep an ISTP on top of his stuff	Hey guys,\n\nI'm having kind of an issue with an ISTP who's my coworker for a student org I have in college. He's super resourceful and skilled at what the job entails, but he just doesn't see the org as that much of a priority, even though he got elected to a pretty important officer role. Our org is hosting a pretty large-scale competition in November, and we have a lot of planning, preparation, and logistics to do for it.\n\nA lot of the tasks at hand have pretty important deadlines, because we're trying to finalize certain aspects of the competition in a timely manner for marketing and promotion purposes. We both have the same position and we both report to the hospitality director of the competition.\n\nWe're in charge of many crucial event decisions, but the dude never seems to be available for any of it. As a result I end up taking on most of the workload and I have to really try hard to get him to schedule and attend important meetings. I've brought this up with him a couple times, and he said that it's really not that bad, and everything will work out. While I do trust his knowledge and expertise when it comes to making these decisions, he doesn't understand the importance of getting things done sooner rather than later, so there isn't as much stress leading up to the competition.\n\nHe's one of those guys who's too skilled for our director to fire but too hard to work with, so I end up busting my ass to cover the workload for both of us. How do I get him to do his share of the work? I'm ENFP by the way.\n\n&#x200B;
7	Don't do his work for him. He's obviously getting away with you doing his work, why should he?
3	have you ever tried explaining to him the only reason why he can be so chill and unstressed is that you’re busting your ass off? if you have and he still doesn’t change his attitude, then you’re gonna have to learn to work around it. sadly, often times you’ll have to work with incompetent people and in this case, though he has the skills and expertise, it’s not much of an asset if he doesn’t do things by the deadline. 
3	People work at different speeds. and no it isnt better to get it done sooner rather than later..that is like just your opinion, man. If he is aware of what he needs to do and when it is due than I am sure he is on top of it. also, why do so  many of these posts seem to assume people's personality types?
1	It's note-worthy that NJ types that work well with routines and schedules are the exact opposite of us. \n\nI have a friend who's constantly doing stuff, leaping left and right to get ahead and do shit as fast as possible.\n\nI find this behavior absolutely exhausting to be around and it impairs my ability to think and work effectively when I'm around him. \n\nEver since I was a young child, through out all of my education I would always wait till last minute but it wasn't always because I just didn't want to do the job or that I saw no practical value for doing it. It's because I spent all that time researching, thinking, learning, so that when I finally DID do the work, the day before. It looked perfect.  I will bide my time and strike when I feel like I have the advantage. And rushing will often leave me under-performing.   \n\n\nObviously I cant speak for this guy but treat it like a thought experiment. Instead of nagging him about what he hasn't done ask him what he thinks about one of the aspects of his job that he's supposed to work on and challenge him intellectually through debate. And leave emotions out of it. He will feel defensive and lose all interest if emotions become part of the topic. When people emphasize how they FEEL xyz I tend to just tune out and lose all interest.   \n
7	How can I (INFJ) support my guarded ISTP friend?	Hi guys! I’m a female INFJ and my friend is a male ISTP. Recently I found out through a mutual friend of ours that he got rejected by a girl that he likes. This has already happened to him before. He doesn’t know I know but is there anyway I can help him through this or get him to open up? I know opening up isn’t an ISTP thing to do but I really wish I could help him through this hard time. How do you determine who to open up to if you do? Thanks in advance!
13	He probably does not want to talk  about it and if he did he would have brought it up by now. wait until he wants to talk and do not keep pushing the issue..it will annoy him. not everyone feels the need to open up to another person. I am guessing he just needs to be alone with his thoughts and figure it out. 
10	Take him out for hot wings and beers (or some type of comfort food). Don’t ask too many questions or expect much info. 
5	Just be present, but for the love, don’t make him talk about it. 
3	Well I can’t speak for him. But if a girl rejects me, it’s not a “hard time”. It’s an “on to the next one”. A rejection isn’t some major mental trauma. He probably just needs a little time to move on. And he’s likely to move on before he’s magically built enough comfort level with you to open up about it. \n\n\nIf you suspect he is taking it hard, simply ask him. If he doesn’t want to talk about it, leave it alone. If he does, just listen. 
2	Yeah.. kinda like what everyone else has said. Do stuff with him to distract him and don't make him feel obligated to talk about it. If you try to compel him to talk and make it seem like you are, he'll probably just distance himself from you. I'll talk to people on rare occasion if I feel absolutely no pressure or judgement. And no annoying overly empathetic looks or being stared at. Basically, don't make a huge deal about it. 
2	Lol he will want to forget it if I was him. He won't want to talk about it when time passes by and possibly moved on to the next interesting thing he find. I personally don't wanna dwell with a past like that. Unless he brought it up himself as a joke and felt comfortable joking about it. Humor can be something useful that way to expressing past emotions. Dont really want that uncomfortable past to be treated seriously.
2	Don't pry into another person's social-emotional life, especially not those with inferior feeling. You'll only cause some form of annoyance or distress (negative emotion). If he brings it up and seems to want to talk about it, then that's a different matter. But for a lead Ti, don't expect them to share much, if at all. And don't take it personally, it's just how they are. If there's something important he wants you to know, he will tell you. Just be nonchalant and carry on as usual. 
36	What's the deal with dating?	I have no clue when it comes to dating. I feel like I'm so far behind in the dating world that I don't even wanna bother trying to learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context, I'm male, 23, great paying stable job, live by myself, I haven't really even been close to anyone in a romantic capacity before. Essentially I'm a completely clean slate, like, haven't even held hands with a girl before... and it's all quite daunting to me. I am currently going on dates with a girl I'm talking to, fuck all has happened at this stage and I feel really disjointed most of the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI envy my friends who've been dating since they were 15-16. All of my friends have been around the block with a few different partners, and are all pretty much settled into LTR's at the moment. On top of that, all of my friends are a good 1-2 years younger than me, and I haven't even kicked off this whole section of my life. Drawing any comparison just makes me feel worse. It almost feels like there's something wrong with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you guys think this is a personal "difficulty" I have to work through, or something more akin to ISTP's in general?
17	I don't know but I've never been in a serious relationship either. 
7	I never asked a girl out. Girls always pursued me, but I was as blind as a bat. My wife was persistent enough. We are married for 12 years so far. 
4	I have been in 3 serious relationships. I never dated. \n\nHell if i know how i have a girlfriend... but i do.\n
12	First things first, stop comparing yourself with other people. Seriously. \n\nYou are the master of your own faith. \n\nYou are inexperienced and this is what probably makes you insecure resulting in fear and self-doubt. This insecurity will then immobilize you in your actions. Other people struggle as well with their dating, it’s not a one-stop-shop where you instantly have a connection with someone. You don’t see their failures, so do not assume that it’s easy for other people/friends, but not for you. This is a biased opinion driven by your fear, doubt and ignorance.\n\nIf you want to be successful with dating women, I highly advise visiting /r/TheRedPill and reading No More Mr. Nice Guy by Robert. A Glover and The Rational Male by Rollo Tomasi. This will open up your eyes how to connect with women, but most importantly how to become a better man.\n\nSome other tips:\n- Start lifting,\n- Eat heathy food\n- Stop watching porn,\n- Have interesting hobbies,\n- Have life goals you work towards to,\n- Sleep 8h a day,\n- Meditate,\n\nWin at life by getting out of your comfort zone. \n\nDon’t settle for first woman who shows interest in you, but keep your options open. If it doesn’t work out then there are plenty of other women who want to suck your dick, you just don’t know it (yet).\n\nInstall Tinder to start dating and get some good pictures of yourself (not just stupid mirror selfies). There are posts on how to be successful on tinder at TheRedPill subreddit. Give it a go, you’ll be surprised, but again, pictures are 90% of getting matches.\n\nAll this change will need to come from yourself. You need to WANT to change/improve. If not, then you will be stuck at your computer screen watching porn with a limp dick for the rest of your life. Nobody is going to give you a beautiful woman that wants to suck your dick everyday. You need to work for this, learn from your failures and GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.\n\nShia Labeouf and Nike said it best: \nJUST DO IT
5	> Do you guys think this is a personal "difficulty" I have to work through, or something more akin to ISTP's in general?\n\nPersonal difficulty, I don't think there's a relationship between personality type and relational/romantic development in a person. \n\nAs for the rest of your post I'm pretty much on the same boat. I had my first girlfriend at 24, broke up with her 6 months later because I found out we were horribly incompatible. Now I wouldn't be against dating a person that catches my interest, but I'm not actively looking for that right now. It becomes a matter of priority, do you want to actively seek someone? It doesn't change much from, for example, actively wanting to lose weight, or wanting to advance your career. 
5	I've always been kind of reserved and emotionally unavailable, so usually girls have to show a sign of attraction first before I open up. I've tried stepping out of my shell and being more forward, but it comes off incredibly contrived and usually requires much more effort in the relationship. Expressing emotion directly isn't our strong suit, but I think our power lies in being subtle about it.\n\nI was lucky enough to have 2 girlfriends in high school, each lasting over 2 years. Both of them were kind of dysfunctional, but they started as friendships and feelings progressed the further I opened up. I find it 10x easier to befriend a woman first and advance from there instead of trying to hook up off the bat. Women are incredibly good at sensing your emotional state so they will know you're attracted to them or not even if you don't make it explicit, but still you will have to put the effort into escalating with them.\n\nI haven't been in a relationship for like 5 years now so I wouldn't call myself a hitch, but it's just the things I've observed. I don't really pursue relationships because they require a lot of effort and are emotionally exhausting, but when women pursue you, it's so much easier and rewarding.
2	>or something more akin to ISTP's in general?\n\nNo. xSTPs are known for being promiscuous, players, etc. It's likely a personal difficulty.\n\nI've been in relationships consistently since I was 15 (I'm 24 now and this is the first time I've been single for more than a couple weeks).\n\nAs for advice, use your Se to engage in new experiences where you can meet people with similar interests. Rec league sports are a great option.
2	I have two questions.\n1. What are these friends you speak of ?\n2. What on earth is a relationship?\n\nLol hope that answers your question
2	Dating is overrated. Been in three long term relationships and at points during I'm just staring at my partner thinking, "will you shut up already why am I here."\n\nIt's a lot of compromise without a lot of return on the investment IMO.
2	Probably personal. I had girlfriends in my late teens / early twenties, but now I've been single for 7 years. I know it's completely my personal issue thanks to my general misanthropy but not being good at reading / expressing emotions (or "inferior Fe" as the kids call it these days) doesn't make things easier.\n\nAn important thing though: It's not a competition. I get that being the only single one among your friends in LTRs sucks but falling into a bad relationship (or staying in one) just to have a relationship sucks a lot more.
3	don’t feel pressured to pursue anything just because friends around you are doing it. in all honesty, if you don’t want to date or be in a long term relationship, forcing yourself into them is only gonna make matters worse. listen to your gut and know that not everyone is the relationship type and istp’s tend to be noncommittal anyways so you fit right in. 
5	[deleted]
3	I think this is more personal than ISTP. Yes, we do tend to have some struggles in the dating world. But if you’re 23 and haven’t even held hands with a girl, that’s on you, not your MBTI. \n\n\nI’ve never been good at relationships. And I’ve never had one past 3 months. But I’ve been dating since 14. \n\n\nNow that I know what I’m doing, I’ve stopped dating. I’m not looking for short or mid term fun/companionship. I’m 23 like you, but I want a long term partner. And that’s hard to find at this age. So I’m just sitting back and meeting people. And one day I hope one of those new people catches my eye. 
1	I am 41 yr old woman and we are not that difficult to understand. I dont think in any of the comments has this stated but women want you to BE CLEAN. Shower daily, pay attention to how you look, make sure you clean your room/apartment etc. You dont have to be super handsome and over 6ft to get women to like you. You dont have to be rich to get women to like you. Dont worry about trying to hard with style..we dont care if your shirt doesnt match if its clean and not wrinkled. I have always tested ISTP, I am a veteran, an accountant, like to work with my hands..super into gaming and thinking "like a man"...which just means logically. Hope I didnt offend anyone but this is the same shit I told my brother after his divorce...yes , dude shower everyday and chicks will notice more.    
1	Get yourself a copy of attraction isn’t a choice by David deangelo 
1	Having friends close by Ian something that’s really been helping me, but I’ve recently been making more friends and expanding my friend group. Also keep yourself too busy to be clingy but still friendly and put an excess effort on personal hygiene and watch the magic happen. It’s seriously crazy how those two things can make so much of a difference in my life 
1	I don't know what's the deal either, you don't seem like a niceguy, and from what the text suggests, you seem like a stable minded person. Gotta go around and find places where you can regularly see single ladies. I.e. clubs. Maybe there's even clubs at your workplace who knows
1	INTP. I was in one relationship. I wasn't myself. Was not worth it. 
1	I'm somewhat in the same boat as you though I had a girlfriend from 15-22. Very long story short I was jaded socially with that. I had a great companionship with her and to be bluntly honest when things were getting dry I'd go fuck her sister. Yeah I'm awful. Since I had them both, I never needed to improve my social skills or myself really. I'm new to the dating game now since being 15 and it really is partially a game. Self improvement is key. Master that, and you will have girls coming to you. Don't let tinder/media kill your confidence, most likely your pictures just suck. Also don't continue to date a girl for nothing. Make a move or she will slowly lose sexual attraction for you. Always make an effort to be the dominant one. Also I think it's good to compare yourself to others, it's let's you have an honest analysis of self, use that to improve. \n1. Self improvement \n2. Confident dominance\n3. Try, fail, repeat 
1	Read "The book of pook" and "No more mr nice guy". \n\nGreat books on the topic.\n\nBasically, stop fucking wanting and looking for it and just focus on yourself. Don't get over invested in pretty girls just because you like them. Have a "whatever happens" attitude about it. If you feel like talking to a girl, talk to her, she rejects you? oh well, next.   \nIt's 99% a mindset thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe moment I stop wanting something, stop searching for it, I get it. I don't know how or why this works but it does.   \n
1	I was the same. No idea what people were supposed to do on a date, but that was because the tradition was the stupid dinner and a movie. I avoided the whole mess because I was way less of a talker than I am now, and I'm not much of one now. If I was aware enough at the time, I would have gone on really good dates doing *anything* but the typical trope. So maybe try that. Take a girl out on an activity date. Either find out something she likes and take her there, or take her to something you like that she might also.\n\nPersonally, I couldn't imagine being in an LTR at 23, unless she is a carbon copy of me, as far as hobbies and interests. Too much restriction on the best time to be single. 
1	Longest relationship was about a year, I've dated a bunch of girls but it usually last a month or two. I think we like the idea of having  steady companion but it's a bit harder keeping that up at, I like my free time. You get better at dates the more you go on and by get better I mean you just start to act more natural and be yourself. It also depends on finding the right person. I like to party so alcohol helps meet girls and relaxes me, that's how I've met/asked out most women. I know that's now for everyone though.
1	21 years old, virgin card intact, dating? I kinda dated a girl in highschool for a week but I wouldn't count that, we never really talked, mostly just walked around during lunch. She broke up with me cause it was too awkward which is understandable. Most of the time I have nothing to say..... EVER! My way of 'extroverting' seems to be entirely physical, eg. Bike with some friends, skate with some friends. \n\nIt sucks really and I worry about it a lot because I know I'm not getting any younger. Throughout my life I've had very little female interaction of my own age, that's a problem. I also have trouble even just making friends with other guys my age. I feel like I'm just gonna fall farther and farther behind socially and never get to experience that young social life, going out to bars, talking to girls, guys, just being free and having fun.\n\nI think being an introvert comes with a big learning curve trying to put yourself out there. 
8	What should i do with my life?	18 years old istp here\nThis is my final year in high school and i have no idea with should i do with my life,i am unmotivated,lazy,nothing interests me and i have problems with socializing\nI may have borderline syndrome and/or depression,i dont know,i hope im wrong,but all the symptoms fits me,but i diagnosed myself,so who knows\nBut im sure that i need some help,how should i get through this\n
12	Sorry, wall of text.\n\nFirst of all, go fishing. Or go do something mindless that you enjoy that puts you alone with your thoughts. Contemplate your life and what you enjoy. Do this as often as you can. Before steps, during steps, as a celebration for completing a step, whatever floats your boat.\n\nSecond, find someone near you who has their life together and offer to take them out to breakfast. Bonus points if you schedule it super early in the morning. Just pick their life apart and figure out what makes them tick. They might have profound wisdom or (perhaps more likely) they might have just stumbled into success. Rinse and repeat until you find actual profound wisdom you're satisfied with. This is how you want to align your life and this is the sort of friend/acquaintance you want in your life.\n\nThird, find the people in your life who don't have themselves together and pull them out of your life like a sliver out of your finger. They are parasites. Psychic vampires if you will. Nothing will keep you in ineptitude more than inept friends.\n\nFourth, get a job. I don't care if it pays minimum wage. Frankly I don't care if it pays *below* minimum wage. The point isn't the money, the point is to build the muscle that is discipline. **Far too many people** believe you can just "try harder". Doesn't work like that. That's foolish and makes it too easy to procrastinate. You have to create new pathways in your brain and it takes time. Every time you clock in on time, it gets easier. Every time you finish that list of tasks that your boss gave you early, it gets easier.  The key here is realizing that you're not wasting your time at this job. You're improving yourself. \n\nIf somewhere in these steps you've found something that you absolutely enjoy and you're really good at, drop everything and pursue that wholeheartedly. Now I don't mean "Guitars are cool and I like music so, like, maybe I should be in a band?". It's gotta be deeper than that. You'll know it when you find it.\n\nIf by the end of step four you haven't found something worth pouring yourself into, find a better job. Especially right now, you can find a job *anywhere*. Just find something better. You can be a millionaire as a plumber if you know what you're doing and play your cards right. Just work hard and try to be as good at your job as you can. Yeah your employer is getting more effort than you are getting paid for. Your persistence will open doors worth vastly more than the little bit of extra effort you gave.\n\nBiggest piece of advice I can give you is: buy condoms. **DO NOT GET A GIRL PREGNANT** until you're financially and emotiomally able to support it (assuming you're a dude. If you're not then don't get pregnant yourself I guess? I'm a guy so that's my expertise, more or less). If you do though, stick around. Don't be the guy that walks out.\n\nYMMV. I'm no expert so feel free to agree or disagree with some, all, or none of this. I'm just an istp who's made it to the other side of the wtf years.
8	Go to community college for two years to save money and then switch to a four year to get your bachelor's when you decide. It sucks but you kind of need a college degree now a days to get a decent job. (or at least you do where I live).
3	That was me to a god damn T—like every aspect of what you said—and I wish more than anything I had taken a gap year before college to work and travel a bit just see what actually interests me. Instead I went to a school I was indifferent to, graduated with a degree I don’t necessarily care about, and lacked the ambition in college to do anything relatively impressive. As a result my resume doesn’t stand out and the job search is painful. \n\nTime is your friend, my guy. Use it to your best ability. Don’t rush into things to fit the stereotypical timeline. Work for six months, use that money you make to travel for 6 months (if that’s your thing). Just see what’s out there. Watch a lot of movies and read a lot of books. Think about the things you DO enjoy and find some deeper qualities that underlies them all. E.g. if you like reading mystery novels, arguing politics, and lending advice to friends, maybe you’d consider yourself a problem-solver. Now in what way could you incorporate that interest into your adult life moving forward?\n\nDon’t rush. You’ll figure it out.
2	I was kinda in the same boat before, went straight to college, dropped out, went to community, back to college, etc. TBH, I wish I'd just worked somewhere for a year or two before higher ed. Use, use, use time to find your interests and try them.
1	dont know if this'll help but I watch a fuckload of ted x talks. You could do the same? 
1	Take it easy man, nobody says you *have* to have your life figured out at 18. There isn't some timeline or template we all have to follow. Do whatever makes you happy now and figure out the rest as it comes. Not saying you should sit at home all day either, definitely get a job and start your own life.
1	Go outside and do some things.  Get a job at a car wash, pizza place, warehouse, music store whatever so you can have so extra money to mess around with.  
1	Join the airforce get a free 4 year degree then get out and do what ever you want. 
1	ay I'm in high school too and might (50/50) take a gap year for financial reasons... you should consider the same if you really have no idea what you want to do. 
1	A. Less than like a 3rd of us know what to do with our own lives, I recommend going elsewhere for advice lol\nB.  Love how you self diagnosed yourself, I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with all of us. \nC.  Look into entrepreneurship and starting your own business. 
1	join the military. The Navy is pretty easy compared to the other branches. It is harder to get into the air force but the Navy welcomes everyone!lol But seriously dont worry  about being in combat on deployment you  just float around...trapped..in the middle of the ocean with a bunch of assholes.
1	I was exactly like this through high school. I had no idea what I wanted to do and never understood how people seem to know that from early in their life. Just turned 33 and I still feel this way. It really bothers me from time to time.\n I graduated community college with a degree in graphic design because I was decent in art, but had no desire to go into that field after I graduated. I don't know what I'm really good at or interested in because my interests are ever-changing and I get bored easily. I have multiple hobbies that I rotate through because I'll do one for a while and get super into it then drop it for a bit. I've worked all kinds of jobs but mainly warehouse type jobs. Currently a receiving clerk for a hospital. It's not the best job, but I have a lot of autonomy and there's no micromanagement (very important to me). It helps for me to know that I'm actually helping people and seeing a tangible end result to my work opposed to working in a warehouse moving pallets from one spot to another. 
9	Does anyone else ever feel pressure to show empathy and get really anxious about it?	My boss was diagnosed with pretty bad pancreatic cancer a while back. It is not looking good, but he manages to come in once a week or so to check up on us. Inevitably, his health always comes up and he tells us about all the awful stuff he's going through. I can never think of anything to say to him in response. Anything I think to say feels like it would come out as forced or like I'm not being geniuine even though I really feel bad for the guy, I can't really explain it. And then I feel like a huge asshole for not really saying much when he went out of his way to visit. I already feel like the weird, really quiet guy in the office. Does anyone else ever feel like this? Any tips on how to respond to this sorta thing?
8	If you don't care, don't do anything. If you do, just give appreciation that you feel is right. That's it.
9	There's nothing to say except the same tired cliches that mean nothing. I don't do empty platitudes. I also can't stand when people come up and remind me yet again about my problem, which is partially why I don't say anything.\n\nMy boss has breast cancer. I've not said anything "publicly". I did, however, go into her office by myself and tell her flat out that I am not good with platitudes, and I am thinking about her, even though she wouldn't really be able to tell. She understands and was thankful that I stopped in, so try that.
2	Tbh depending on the person he might find it refreshing that you dont want to weep with him like everyone else. Idk though. Just be nice... do you know or suspect his type?
3	If you say something just to say something it’s gonna show. Don’t feel pressured to say something. We underestimate other people but most of the time they’re great at picking out nonverbal cues and are aware of how you feel without you even having to say anything.
2	Just try to say what you think, that you feel bad for him. If they expect you to be empathetic, they are most likely also very empathetic people and will understand the "intent behind your words," even if the words are not delivered in an eloquent manner. 
2	Yeah I get it. I had a very mentally exhausting weekend. Plans changing, things happening, people saying things, no alone time, etc. Just a big ol mess. \n\n\nAnd then my friend hits me yesterday with “my big brother died yesterday”. And I was just lost on what to say. I’m good at giving advice and solving problems, just not consoling people. So if someone comes at me with work/relationship/family/financial problems, I can dive in and help. But when they come at me with “someone died”, which isn’t fixable, I’m a deer in the headlights. \n\n\nI think it comes down to our nature of being better at physical communication. It’s easier for us to have a constructive conversation other than just making someone feel better. We deal in logic and moving forward, not dwelling on current events. \n\n\nSo I Ended up just calling her and letting her talk. She probably said 90% of the words. I just paid attention to what she said, and tried to keep things going. Just to let her vent and get it all off her chest. And that seemed to help. 
2	I feel you, bro.
1	my director's dad died about a month ago, and i didn't want to say anything because i could tell she was really trying to just not think about it. i felt horribly sad for her, but i can't use my words bc i also thought it would come off as insincere. 
1	it feels weird, like pushy almost if that's the correct term, its like someone trying to push emotions onto you. then i start to wonder "hmm, its kinda strange, this person is gonna be underground in a matter of [my estimate]"
1	I cannot express in words how I feel. But I enjoy showing thought via means of action. Is there anything action related that you think could help him? Maybe cook a dinner and deliver it to his home (for him and his family)?\n\n\- Only if you want to.
4	STP profiles	Hey everyone. The majority of the tests I take have scored me a STP. The profiles for them for the most part fits me. But I'm not really into "mechanics". I have basic car knowledge and usually don't care much other than that. I also am a huge geek. I read and write fantasy stories and science fiction all the time. I collect star wars collectibles. My Bedroom is a collection of horror movie memorabilia etc. I make Halloween masks for fun. Every Halloween I help build haunted houses. I game all the time. Usually playing Skyrim or Dragon Age. I play d&d and magic the gathering I never see anything like this in STP profiles. Out of all the types the Istp and Estp are the closest ones that fit me. Am I mistyped possibly or just a geeky STP?\n\n\n\nTe (Extroverted Thinking) (40%)  your valuation of / adherence to logic of external systems / hierarchies / methods\n\nTi (Introverted Thinking) (85%)  your valuation of / adherence to your own internally devised logic/rational\n\nNe (Extroverted Intuition) (50%)  your valuation of / tendency towards free association and creating with external stimuli\n\nNi (Introverted Intuition) (45%)  your valuation of / tendency towards internal/original free association and creativity\n\nSe (Extroverted Sensing) (70%)  your valuation of / tendency to fully experience the world unfiltered, in the moment\n\nSi (Introverted Sensing) (70%)  your valuation of / focus on internal sensations and reliving past moments\n\nFe (Extroverted Feeling) (45%)  your valuation of / adherence to external morals, ethics, traditions, customs, groups\n\nFi (Introverted Feeling) (60%)  your valuation of / adherence to the sanctity of your own feelings / ideals / sentiment\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// based on your results your type is likely - istp\n\nMy other tests are similar \n
17	>I play d&d and magic the gathering I never see anything like this in STP profiles. Out of all the types the Istp and Estp are the closest ones that fit me. Am I mistyped possibly or just a geeky STP?\n\nnah just another person who can't read past the stereotype
15	Your doubting a type based on stereotypes.  The nickname mechanic is about the thought process of taking things apart to learn how they work not literally being a mechanic.\n\nAlso a lot of ISTPs are nerdy. Video games are usually listed as a top hobby in descriptions and there was even a post a few days ago on here talking about being geeky.
9	I need to fix problems. I roll up my sleeves and figure things out and when I am done they are fixed. If I run out of problems there are video games. \n
5	It might make you feel a bit better to know that Dave and Shannon of Objective Personality typed George Lucas himself as ISTP. :) Sounds like you enjoy tinkering with mechanics in a broader sense. Maybe you enjoy breaking apart the structure of a fantasy story so that you can construct your own. Maybe you can deconstruct the sensory experience of a haunted house in order to heighten the effect on the folks passing through. Just my two cents!
3	Played white weenie in tournaments and FNMs for a while.  I can go into deckbuilding and drafting mechanics all day, despite not having playing magic in years.  \n\nI once knew 3.5 inside out, because I'm that rule stickler shithead arguing with the DM, or forced to DM.  I want my damn flanking bonus.  This DOES count. lol\n\nIn every elderscrolls game, I aim to break some shit.  Alchemy/Int potions in Morrowind, Enchant on skyrim.  Once I break the games, I put arbitrary rules on myself for the next playthrough, like "no alchemy."  I've played too many videogames.\n\nI think what differentiates me from INTP/INTJ gamers is my attention to mechanics and constant attempts to master and abuse them.  I grew up on squaresoft and everquest and dofus.  Good times. :D\n\nSo yes, I'd say you are likely an ISTP.
3	Profiles are for the most part stereotypes and don't represent the person as a whole.\nAs for your question yes you can be a istp and be all that
1	If you were a true ISTP you would have like no Ne since that is our blindspot function. And your Si wouldn't be that strong either. Fi is a weird one since it shares the same attitude as Ti and is a judging function. We can think we are strong Fi users but do you really make decisions with your feelings all the time? I know I make logical decisions all the time but when people really piss me off I go all INFP on them.
44	Procrastinating Perfectionists?	Anyone else out there get that overwhelming feeling that’s like “I would clean my room, but it would take me upwards of the entire day to clean and organize it the way I want to so I’ll wait until I have the time to do it well” or similarly the feeling that’s like “I would this, but I don’t have the energy to do it well so I’ll wait until later when I have the energy?” \n\nWhenever I organize my room or desk or anything really, it always takes me a freakishly long time since I have such a particular way of doing things and I often put it off for a long time because I refuse to half-assedly clean. Which is super inconvenient when I have a pressing task, but I spend way too much time cleaning up my workplace than actually working. \n\nI’ve heard that ISTP’s have a reputation of being very picky and particular about our stuff, especially in regards to how it’s organized or dealt with, but I’m not entirely sure if this falls into that. 
29	Sounds about right. Once I start tho, I finish. Starting is the hardest part. 
18	I have developed the technique of measuring how long each activity should take me and then do everything at the last moment possible. Bad part is, sometimes I give myself too much credit and end up pulling an all-nighter to finish whatever activity I need to do. Once I get started though, I plow through anything till the end.
8	What you do is never let it get messy in the first place. Have a place for every item in your house and always put it back there. It's called [mise-en-place](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/08/11/338850091/for-a-more-ordered-life-organize-like-a-chef). I got it hammered into me when I trained as a chef. If it's dishes, don't let them sit in the sink and get hard. Clean them as soon as you've finished eating. Bit hard if you have kids but if you live by yourself this is easy to implement. Or if you have clothes all over your room, at least put them in a single pile, not scattered everywhere. Stuff like that.
6	I live with an ISTP and I can definitely say that this is a thing. He barely ever puts stuff away when he's done or throws things away, but when he does clean he does it 110%. Also he's a sweet (read: passive) guy but I can tell that he doesn't like when I touch his stuff. 
2	Yup I definitely resonate. I’m too good at justifying my bullshit reasons to procrastinate. I’ve gotten better over the years though. I’ve gotten better at not procrastinating with high priority stuff. Now it’s things like cleaning, dishes, laundry, whatever. 
2	I’m an INFJ, but I can completely relate. I want to do something when I have full energy and time. It makes it hard though because then I will keep procrastinating the task which will only cause me to be stressed which in turn leads to a lack of energy to do it. So I can completely relate. I can’t do things in small chunks or over time, which is an N trait. Maybe you have that part of N in you. Unfortunate right xD 
2	Omg...it's scary how accurate this is with describing me as a fellow ISTP! 😱 I've never lacked motivation to do things but I have a particular way of doing them, especially routine things like folding laundry, and it probably takes me twice as long as most other people. I'm not sure what personality type my wife is but we often get into little arguments about the fact that I am very particular lol. Love this subreddit so far. 
1	Starting anything is so hard for me just because of this.
1	Sounds about right. The Marie Kondo method definitely helped with organization but cleaning my room is still a multiday event that I need a lot of energy for as I basically move out everything to wash my walls and floors. \n\nI'm also notorious for procrastinating on starting projects until I have a boat load of materials and exact instructions. But I started to get better at this by breaking things down into really small chunks.
20	How to stop procrastinating?	It's in our personality to procrastinate to the very last second (and we often succeed even then)... but how the hell do I stop? (Other than not posting on Reddit.)\n\n​\n\nI'm now trying to read two 300-page books in ten hours and write two essays on them. Send help.
11	Start little by little. Once in a while you won't stop until you finish whatever you were doing fully and then you won't have to worry about it later.\n\nAlso if you have that many things to do I recommend looking at responses AFTER you finish as a reward.
9	You can find many pieces of advice like making a reward system or pretending you're an actor or some shit, but in the end it all comes down to self-discipline which will help you grow. It sucks, but I don't think there is any way around it.
3	Identify why you are struggling with your paper, perhaps you dont actually have the answer and thats why you are procrastinating.\n\nIn the end when it is done, set the paper on fire to complete the ritual.
2	I would study each book one at a time. Break the first book into sections. By this I mean, skim a chapter and write your own cliff notes for each. Keep your notes brief, but make sure you bullet point anything you deem important to the work at hand. Set goals and take breaks. Ex: I would maybe work 3-5 chapters of notes and then take a 10-15 min break (and force myself to stick to it by setting an alarm). To be honest, I think 300 pages should be a quick read, and I have faith you are able to get through it. Good luck! 
2	I find it helpful to commit to 10 min at a time. Set a timer. When it goes off, set it for another ten until you get something done....!!\n\nIt will make you realize how distracted you are letting yourself get. \n\n\n
2	Were you given an outline for these essays? If not just create one for yourself.\n\nTypically when I had essays to do I'd skim read the book until I found something relevant to the outline, mark the page and continue.\n\nThen when I actually have to write the essay it was something like 80/90% bullshit with relevent notes sprinkled on top. I feel like thats what essays were anyway.\n\nTotal bullshit.
2	SparkNotes it, read the key events and annotate those first. Then build outwards from there to add minor details before and after these events.
2	The short answer? Just do it. \n\n\nFor me, I started with small stuff. When you’re procrastinating on big time consuming projects, it’s hard to just flip a switch and stop procrastinating. But when it comes to small actions, like cleaning a cereal bowl, it’s super easy. \n\n\nSo I suggest by starting with small things. Never put trash anywhere but the trash can or leave a dirty dish. Finish a granola bar? Don’t set it on the coffee table to throw away when you get up later. Get up and toss it. Same concept with like a bowl of cereal. Don’t just set it down to clean later, go spend 30 seconds washing it out and drying it. \n\n\nYou can do this for everything. Start as slow as you want and progress as slow as you want. You can start with categories such as trash, dishes, laundry, chores, etc. Start with just trash. Every time you produce trash, immediately dispose of it. Once that has become second nature and not a forced action, pick up another one. Add dishes in now. Never let a dish sit. Even prep dishes. Just clean them the second they are done being used. 10-15 seconds of washing fresh dishes here and there is easier to swallow than 10 minutes at the end with dried on food and soaking and scrubbing. \n\n\nAfter that, add something more time consuming like laundry. Takes a little more time and effort, but you’ve already normalized the process so it should be easier. \n\n\nEventually you’ll get to the point where you just do thing when they need to be done. Some people need a few months to get there, some people need years. It’s a different process for everyone. But the point of this exercise is to start slowly knocking out each normally procrastinated job. Start with small and easy tasks and slowly work your way into big important priorities. 
2	Dont stop completely but do acknowledge that it is a trait and strength. Use it to your advantage. I love to procrastinate now..its like I love to test myself down to the last second. I work better under pressure and that I redo any of my work I do in advance anyways....so why do it twice? i am 41 and I gave up long ago on changing things that some people consider "bad". Sorry to be of NO help in helping you stop, lol. 
2	Best solution for me was to invest 30minutes into whatever it is that I don't want to do.\n\nYou're procrastinating because you don't give a fuck about it. \n\nSay "I'll do this for 30minutes then do something I like". Usually after 30minutes, I'm sufficiently focused that I just decide to finish the fucking thing so I don't have to think about it anymore.
1	You probably should’ve read them awhile ago. Good luck with that.\n\nDespite that, I think sometimes people who can work in a more flexible way can feel like shit for not being regimented as others. If you can do school or work without a planner, then just go without a planner. Long as you get it done and get a good grade, no one but you will know any different.
1	Ha
1	As you get older, it seems you naturally become more disciplined. As for me though, I still leave everything to the last minute. Literally i waited until I was basically out of money to find a job and almost didn't make rent. I need help lol!! My biggest problem is my addiction to all this entertainment on my phone. God damn. I'm turning it off now, see ya.....
1	An ISTP getting emotional	https://youtu.be/jgkMFBDyzE8\n\n\nI think Sean is an ISTP. I don't know. The thought of it just clicked. At the end, he gets sorta emotional. And this is how ISTPs do it, I guess. 
1	Yeah, that or ESTP. Hard to tell from just one vid.
18	Is being blind to The gaze of other people an ıstp like trait?	I have this trait, and I'm neither blind nor cursed with low perception. I don't notice the gaze of others (good or bad) unless I look at their general direction. Could this stem from aloofness or do I have a serious problem?\n&nbsp;\nNote: I need to add that I'm as blind as a bat in relationships. I can't say with enough certainty if someone likes me romantically for me to make a move.
28	[deleted]
16	Nope I'm very aware of people's expressions. Auxiliary Se strength. Body language tells you a lot about how someone is feeling. The thing is, I am aware that someone probably likes me, but I just don't know how to go about the situation. Inferior Fe problem.
7	I'm relatively similar, I don't think it's because you're blind but because your Se is more focused on other things than that. I only noticed people looking at me or flirting with me if I'm alone to analyse, otherwise it's generally as you described.
5	ahhhh i feel this! \n\ni’m always too involved in my own world to notice when other people are staring at me or even just interested in me until a friend points it out and is like “hey that guy has been staring your way for the last few minutes, are you gonna do anything?” before i actually realize. \n\nthe same is with flirting and relationships, thought i’ve been told i’m a really flirty individual, i don’t really notice it so when others are being flirty with me, my natural reaction is that they’re just interacting with me normally, but rarely do i get the message. \n\nmy ex (who’s now one of my friends) has called me dense during the entirety of our relationship because i didn’t get any hints. 
2	How can you not notice? You need to know your environment and everyone around you. are you talking about dating or just people in general?
0	Sometimes I worry that people will know I'm a transgender because of being istp?	I know I am transgender/intersex. But I kind of ignore it. But there are things that always remind me that I am a man not a woman.this is one of those things. I always hear about istp people it is about men. Almost always the personality seems to describe men so when I tell someone I'm an istp peorsonality I feel they'll notice how rare that is and be that closer to finding out that I'm not really a woman. It's just one of those things
13	Uh istp women exist too
7	I'm not sure how anybody could possibly know your personality type, let alone what's in your drawers. But anyway, as an ISTP, why would you care anyway? (what others think)
6	Personality type doesn't have anything to do with gender. You're probably overthinking it.
4	Anyone else feel like this girl is confused?
2	It's so rare that anyone I meet even knows what MBTI even is that I can't even fathom being worried about this.
3	I didn't think I'd ever encounter an ISTP who gave a shit about gender identity. I think we're generally too rational to care about what people feel like calling themselves. 
3	[deleted]
3	sounds like an issue for an \n# isfp #\n\nas far as i know/care
4	Im an ISTP woman...its lonely

1	Tranny. 
10	I turn into an idiot around my crush. How do I overcome this?	I have a crush on a guy who's about ten years older than me, probably an ESFP. He's really friendly and good at socializing. My social skills crash when he's around and I rather giggle like an idiot or act indifferent. I'm usually confident around other people but when I interact with him I get overwhelmed and self-concious. I already talk to him regularly and ask him stuff, he works in the gym I attend. I want to speak to him like I speak to anyone else, without overthinking, how do I manage that? He's kind of flirty and touchy and I'm not entirely sure how well I interpret his actions. I feel like he's in control because he knows whatever's going on and I don't make any 'moves' because I'm honestly clueless. Also, I've never been in a relationship because I'm rarely attracted to anyone. Not that I imagine myself in one with that person, I'd probably be ok with a fling since I'm very independent and find it weird to spend too much time with someone.\nStill, I keep thinking about this guy most of the time. I'm stuck.\n\nTl;dr: How do I avoid getting overwhelmed around my crush?
10	Honestly? Practice. You just have to do it. There is no secret or magic trick. Socializing is a skill. It takes time to develop like any other skill. The reason why he’s different than everyone else is probably because you put him above you. He’s older, wiser, more mature, attractive, friendly. It’s intimidating. I get it, I’m the same way with older girls. But the more you talk to him, the more you’ll realize he’s Just a human with flaws like you are. Hell slowly start coming down off the pedestal and you’ll realize you’ve been equal the whole time. \n\n\nI’ve come a long way in my social skills. But to this day, I’m still horrible with opening up to girls I’m interested in. Especially when I think they’re too attractive/rich/nice/mature to be with me. And admittedly, I haven’t put in much practice like with friendly socializing lol. So I definitely understand where you’re coming from. It’s easy to be intimidated when you feel like you aren’t the one controlling the situation. Especially for an ISTP. 
2	I assume you are the ISTP, as you say your crush is most likely an ESFP. Do you have the ability to just go into an emotionally blank state? Usually, that's what I do. I can suppress virtually all my feelings at will, or when stressed/anxious, so that I don't usually do idiotic things. It's difficult to describe; it's almost like I merely flick a switch, and I can erase my capacity for emotions to allow for logical thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n An alternative is to try to not think of him as a crush, but just another person you meet in your day-to-day routine, such as labeling him as a person first and foremost, and your crush, last. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA last method is to reason it out with yourself. That is, asking yourself. "why do I behave this way due to this stimulus?" This method is what I use to calm myself down when angry. 
1	> I have a crush on a guy who's about ten years older than me\n\ni've been there except i'm male, she was female, and it was 7 years, telling you right now... fuck it\n\nthey're just gonna screw around, and nothings gonna come out of it, for some people it's fun to see how much they can mess others up. sure it's rare but is quite prevent in narcissists. i mean you gotta ask yourself honestly if you legit think they're like attracted to you, even then, *why* are they attracted to you is the bigger question you got to ask yourself. imo, mainstream folk just stick with their age. finding that one that prefers younger is literally a needle in the haystack. then again it's more likely that dudes prefer younger, so there's that\n\nas for advice about turning into an idiot around your crush, find another person to crush on, then once you think of this person as a backup, or somehow feel they are more dispensable, you wont care as much, thats how it works for me
2	ISFJ/ISTJ ideal?	I noticed online that for ISTPs that ISFJs and ISTJs are supposed to be the ideal partners. I know mbti shouldn't be used for romance options but it seems either way that these are a bad match for ISTPs.\nWhat are you opinions on those types?
9	I fucking hate ISTJs and I will marry the myriad of ISFJs that want to monogamize me if I'm 40 and still single. Ideally id have hunted down and trapped an ENFJ/INFJ by then.
6	My mom is an ISTJ, no fucking way I'll get on with someone that annoying :)
5	Ideal match for ISTP is ENFJ or ESFJ. Then INFJ or ISFJ. ISTP's tend to desire the warmth of the Fe feelers and these high Fe feelers tend to desire the level headed Ti.
5	My dad's an ISFJ. I love him, but he gets pissed off so damn easily, and starts yelling at me, which I hate. I'm not sure if he's mistyped, but I've had him take the 16personalities test before, and ISFJ was the result. Anyways, I reiterate that I do love  my dad, but not because he's awesome or anything, but mainly because we're family. If I randomly met him as a stranger on the street, I would not enjoy being in his company, as while he can be very generous, kind and considerate when he's calm, all bets are off when he gets annoyed. However, if he is a poor example of an ISFJ, then judging from the 16personalities description, ISFJs seem fine.\n\nI have no experience with ISTJs, but from the 16personalities description, I doubt that they would be good fits for the ISTP personality either. I was raised on Asian values and do value persistence, but I cannot claim to be as such all the time (hence why I am an ISTP not an ISTJ), which could cause annoyance and tension if I had a partner who was a stereotypical ISTJ. ISTJs seem to be very detail oriented. I am also highly detail oriented in certain things, but my living space is not one of those things, which can cause friction.\n\n​\n\nMy ideal spouse or partner would be an I\*F\*. The two asterisks represent traits that I have no preference for. The primary reason I'd want a partner would be for mutual emotional support, and to have children (because Asian). An introvert would understand my behavior far better than an extrovert, which would reduce a lot of tension between me and a potential partner, while a more touchy-feely person would be better for emotional support, my primary motivation to have a partner. I have no preference for Sensing or Intuitive people, as my Sensing and Intuitive trait percentages are fairly close to each other, so I can see value in both types. As for Judging vs. Perceiving, again, I can see value in both. a Judging individual might be more inclined to get stuff done and be practical, but a Perceiving partner might understand me better.\n\n[These are my 16personalities results, if you're interested.](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/f249d6d61122b)
1	I'm happily married to an ISTJ. Used mbti for relationships is bogus.

9	How to stay friends after being rejected - ugh	Hey there! So I have a big crush on my ISTP friend, which I posted about a [couple of days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/9b5mbg/does_my_istp_need_space_or_is_he_waiting_for_me/?st=JLI2GLDR&sh=26207094). A lot of the responses encouraged me to confess my feelings but he beat me to it. Today he asked if I had feelings for him and I told him yes. When I asked him why he brought it up he said that he didn’t want to lead me on. I was really embarrassed but he was cool about it. He said it happens and it doesn’t have to make things weird. So I guess my question is, how do I proceed from here? Do I just act like nothing happened? I’ve been initiating most of our contact of course, but it feels weird to continue to do that now that the secret is out. 
15	> He said it happens and it doesn't have to make things weird.\n\nI think he answered that question for you. However, if you still have feelings for him, and hanging out begins to eat at you then maybe there's other things you need to consider.
12	On your ISTP’s side, the situation is resolved. He came right out and asked, you gave an answer, he gave an answer, over. To him, it’s concluded. \n\n\nFor you though, there is the problem of emotions to deal with. Unfortunately, since were all ISTP’s, we don’t have a front row seat to your personality type. We haven’t lived your type, so our scope on it won’t be as big as it is with ISTP’s. \n\n\nEither way, I will give you my personal advice that I give to other ISTP’s and to myself. Maybe you’ll be able to find something you need. \n\n\nFor me, the biggest key is to meet new people. When I fall for someone I can’t have, my biggest struggle is comparing new girls to the one I’m in love with. And that will always fail. Nobody is as good as her. Or so it may seem. The more I go out and meet more girls (not in a romantic sense), the more I realize that she wasn’t the end all be all. She wasn’t the best. Just the best *at the time*. And since she wasn’t on board, she clearly wasn’t best for me. Meeting other girls reminds me that there are other desirable personalities out there. It also reminds me that the girl I love has flaws, which are hard to see through the Rose covered lenses of infatuation. \n\n\nOf course it all takes time. And this doesn’t necessarily squash my feelings, but it gives me a better grasp on them so I can control them. This girl is still my best friend and our dynamic is the exact same it was before. My feelings for her haven’t changed, but over time, I’ve been able to open my mind up a bit. I didn’t have tunnel vision on this one girl anymore. Being able to see other girls as individual people, and not people to compare to my friend, made coping a lot easier. \n\n\nSo now when I’m with her, I don’t have these burning desires to scoot closer, lean in, grab her hand, whatever. I’d never normally do those anyways, but the desires can eat you away. \n\n\nAnd basically the best end goal I’ve ever been able to reach is “I’ll always love you, but I’ve moved on.” And it’s usually paired with “if timing is ever right and an opportunity comes up, I’ll take it, but until then I won’t be putting any effort into making it happen.” (All things I say to myself, not the other person.) \n\n\nSo I hope something in here can help you. This “plan” is pretty catered to the logic and tendencies of an ISTP, but there is some universal advice in there as well. Best of luck! 
5	i read your previous post but didn’t comment. i thought you had a chance, so this post is really an ugh-worthy follow up :( and i know how it feels to be told “i don’t want to lead you on” *(feelsverybadman)* so i kinda just want to help.\n\nbasically, place yourself as priority!\n\nyou don’t have to continue being friends with him if you feel uncomfortable. or if you want to keep that friendship eventually but you just don’t feel good enough now, distance yourself from him until you feel well enough to be friends again—even if he texts you first. you don’t have to reply until you feel okay. place yourself as priority.\n\ntbh istps (by istps, i mean, just me haha i find it very hard to say “istps” and mean all istps  because it’s too absolute but i hope you get what i mean lol) are *too* respectful of other people’s choices, sometimes to a fault aka if you don’t reply my text message(s), i’ll probably just accept it as it is. if you ignore my text(s) for awhile, especially in a situation like this, and come back being “normal” again (note that istps themselves go mia at times too; they won’t take offence if someone else does the same thing), i’ll take this friendship back in a heartbeat. it sounds like he cares enough about you to want to stay friends but don’t feel obliged to reciprocate.\n\nplace yourself as priority.
6	To him, it's possible to go as-if nothing ever happened. He probably does want to still be friends with you and to him, it's not weird. That's in the past, and I bet within a week he completely forgets it ever even happened.\n\nNot to say that's as easy for you, but it sounds like what he wants. That is, of course, if you want it.
3	>I’ve been initiating most of our contact of course, but it feels weird to continue to do that now that the secret is out. \n\nI would say to stop doing this, at least for a while. Continuing this would only exacerbate your feelings for him. If he wants to hang out with you, he'll initiate. And I've always heard that guys and girls should never be close friends platonically because one inevitably falls in love with the other. Take that as you will. I know a lot of people are very against that advice. \n\nOne more thing, the fact that everyone responding to the first post thought you had a good chance probably means that he was leading you on, intentionally or no. And the fact that he said "it happens" makes me question whether he has a habit of doing this. 
2	As the ISTP who has turned down people with the "I dont want to lead you on" line (it was also an SFJ). For the ISTP, the matter is settled, but the only hesitation is if I have to deal with the other person's emotional backlash from this. If there was some way you could show that you got your feelings sorted and aren't interested anymore then that would be great.\n\nBut also I don't know how close you guys are, but if the other person can't handle their shit I usually just cut them out of my life.
1	at least he told you he didn't want to lead you on. just move on, plenty of people in this world, you'll just keep on daydreaming about things that will never happen. tough love from me / being a realist
1	>I posted about a couple of days ago ... but he beat me to it\n\nDoes he read this sub?
-6	Don't contact him for a few days. If he contacts you first it will mean he still cares about you. 
7	Art and writing	Why is it so uncommon to read that istp don't like art or writing?\n\nDo any of you like art or do any Art?\nAny writers?
6	I like to draw from time to time, but it isn’t to express myself or anything, I just enjoy doing it I guess. I also started writing a sci fi story and while I enjoy it for a bit, I lose interest quickly. It’s probably cause I’m not a person of many words, so I don’t find writing that appealing. I work on it little by little when I feel like it, but it’s not something I personally love to do. \n\nMaking stuff up is entertaining for a bit, but I would rather be doing something that I can engage with my senses. That’s just how high Se works. 
2	I wrote a lot. Mainly short stories. I like that format. Was even considering being a writer and was encouraged by my college writing teacher to pursue it. But it is...emotionally intense to stay in those moments when writing. I sort of have to connect that way to write credibly. “How would I react realistically here?” Then overlap the character’s personality on top to tweak it. \n\nI enjoy it but not for anything more than a hobby. I think ISTPs can be good writers. Think Hemingway was an STP but he blew his brains out and that sounds about right lol. Writing isn’t easy if you want to do it well. \n\nI was not flowery at all and always envied some of those type writers. Most people who commented on my writing said I built an image in their mind and they could envision things clearly and “be there” in the story. \n\n
2	If you consider photography art, I do that.\n\nIn terms of pulling things out of my head and expressing them on paper, not so much.  I have never taken the time to learn to draw or paint well.  I can express myself efficiently in writing but I doubt I'll ever sit down and write a book, if I do it will be non-fiction (a how-to or history).\n\nI very much appreciate viewing art, I could spend hours in an art museum/gallery, often the people I'm with are dragging me along which can be a bit frustrating.
2	I do a bit of poetry.
1	Writing wants to be drawn out while I'm trying to get to the point.
1	I suck ass at both of them. I can't draw a straight line with a ruler, and would have failed every single English class if my teachers didn't fake my grade.
1	I very much appreciate the arts, but I cant make it.
1	I totally LOVE art, I'm good at drawing (copying drawings, not good at creating drawings) and I write.
1	I'm in the arts field and I'm good at drawing, painting, sculpting etc. but I appreciate design more than art. And I would identify more as a designer than an artist. I think it's a function vs expression thing. Design solves a problem while Art states a feeling/point of view so as an ISTP I'd lean more towards design.\n\nI suck at writing but if I have a writing partner or if I'm just an editor I am good to go. I know the fundamentals of storytelling and how to make stories more interesting but I suck at making up a story from scratch.
1	I like all that stuff but I'm not any good at it.
14	An ISTP dilemma	24 M. Lonely enough to wish I had more friends, but self sufficient enough to not put any efforts into making friends.\n\nI go out by myself most nights and have a great time dancing,  meeting random people and sometimes hooking up with girls, then in all cases never talk to or see them again. \n\nI live in suburban Cali. Didn't make enough friends in college, and have no interest in my coworkers. Any suggestions on how to easily make and keep friends? I like edm and go to shows often, just need a couple good tu buddies.
14	This hit me right in the feels, I feel the same way even tho if I have my roomates/bestfriends ive known since high school. I still feel like I want more friends or something deeper with someone. They’re engaged so I do feel like the third wheel, which part of my loves but part of me hates sleeping alone so much. It’s funny i was just at a rave this last weekend and had a great time by myself\n\nAddition: if you find cute girls who love to rave befriend them, especially if they have boyfriends, you friend zone them with the intention of building a rave family. Easiest way I’ve found to do that is just being friendly when you see them at raves and a few party favors go along way. Once you have a rave family in place then you can worry about getting laid again. Rave family > one night stands. Good luck out there man
10	Everything you need to know is in Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and influence people".\n\nThe short version isn't nearly as effective, but:\n\nListening is more important than talking.\n\nNotice the things that *they* put time, thought and effort into.\n\nRemember their names- say them multiple times aloud during conversation on first meeting them.  \n\nLet them *have an impact on you*, and you'll have a friend for life.  Don't *try* to have an impact on them.  That's how it's done.  That's the key.  They need to know that they had an impact, and it's like gravity.\n\nEveryone goes into a social interaction with two basic questions at heart.  "Do you *get* me?"  and "Do you like me?"  \n\nSo, listen, connect, appreciate, and respond with honesty.  You'll soon be everyone's friend.
3	I can't seem to keep friends because I'm always working on some hobby and never have enough time to give up to maintain a consistent relationship.
2	Every time you meet a random person who is partaking in the same activity as you, grab a phone number. Next time you do that activity, invite them. Or have them invite you. \n\n\nSeriously that’s all friends are. Bonding over common ground over a period of time. Instead of doing one night friends, make them potential long term friends. You don’t have to do anything special. Don’t have to text them all day, call em and say what’s up, invite them over, whatever. Just start with doing the shared activity with them. Over time, y’all will have enough mundane conversation to form a real friendship. And then you might start shifting conversations into more personal stuff. And boom, you have a friend. \n\n\nIt’s a long slow process for ISTP’s. Sometimes it takes me 6 months to actually feel solid calling a new person a friend. Not always though. \n\n\nBut basically just think of it like a garden. Plant a bunch of different seeds. Some will grow, some won’t. Some will grow into things you may not like, some you will like. And after a period of time, you pick what you like and stick to that from now on. You’re just collecting acquaintances and hoping some turn into friends over enough time. 
2	my suggestion is to pick a hobby you like, and start going to some sort of group revolving around that hobby, but i can dish out advice better than i can follow it so who knows
2	Was in similar situation at your age.  Didn’t really change until my first marriage and hanging with her circle.  Go to “meetup”s you’re interested in.  You’ll at least have that in common.
1	Talk to them about something you wanna talk about so it’s not a waste of your time. Feel the vibes man, if you feel comfortable around them, ask them if they wanna go to a rave with you. 
1	The easiest way to make friends is through other friends. \nIf you have any college friends you lost touch with that live in the area try ro reach out to them. I was really afraid to talk to this girl but I did and found out that she was really happy I did because she was afraid to reach out to me. Now I get to meet her friends and hopefully make friends with them.
1	I was lonely for a long time, I couldn't be myself and happy until I met a ENFP. Our soul friends are ENFPs, they always make you laugh, they are the fresh air for us. We are interesting for them. So find a ENFP friend. 
13	Is anyone else shallow?	What’s important to you when you’re thinking about a potential romantic or sexual partner?\n\nI realised today just how shallow I am.
21	Yea, think it has something to do with high Se. I don’t really care if I’m not able to have “3 hour long deep conversations” with a girl I’m dating (or with anyone at that), I’m just interested in having fun and sharing positive experiences with her. I couldn’t date someone I’m not physically attracted to, even if I care for her. Mainly bc the main difference for me between a girlfriend and a regular friend is that you kiss and all that good stuff with a girlfriend, so physical attraction is a must for it to work for me.
20	1.) Are they attractive?\n2.) Do I feel comfortable letting them into my alone time?
10	I like nice looking things, and I also like deep thinking things.  It could be seen as shallow, but as a person I am not.  If having physical preferences is shallow, then yes, I am shallow.  I couldn't have a sexual relationship with someone I wasn't physically attracted to. 
8	Physical attraction is not shallow btw
4	I am and I'm not.\n\nI don't want the typical "hot girl". I find them lacking in most things, like personality and empathy. I want a non-unattractive girl with a tight body and good sense of humor/personality.\n\nBut I'm also turned off by big boobs, makeup, and a few other things that most people don't think of/care about.
3	Yes, unintentionally, but I don't really have a conventional understanding of beauty. Most of the time I'm attracted to artsy girls with alternative styles, and funny enough that's the type of woman I seem to attract.\n\nI have a coworker that has been working with us for about 8 months now and I've never really bothered talking to her. Today we walked past each other at the timeclock and it was like a switch flipped. Holy shit I never noticed how pretty she is! Before I could stop myself, I was thinking up ways to talk to her more often and finding excuses to visit her department. None of that would have happened if I didn't find her attractive.\n\n
1	yes
-2	no specific order\n\n1. how many times she's been chewed; too much or too easy and it's a pass, won't feel accomplished\n\n2. face and/or good personality, sometimes the looks grow onto me and then i guess its personality.\n\n3. intelligence. if college dropout, no way in hell. though sometimes their "field" gets to their brains sometimes, and think they'll attract men by becoming a "careerist, leader woman", give me a barf bag, nothing's more unattractive than that.\n\n4. if woman can tolerate my impulsive trolling, and understand *when* i'm fucking around or being serious (that's why i don't keep a lot of friends, everyone gets too offended)\n\n5. woman isn't lazy, hate lazy
8	Magic the gathering and rpgs	Any of you istps enjoy mtg and rpgs and if so what color(s) and classes do you like to play?
3	It has been a long time i dont play mtg, but i often wish i get back to it. Colors white and black, i dispise the rest haha. I like playing multipliers, meaning tokens, angels.. Rats..\n\nAlso diy projects for mtg are great, counters, boxes, decorations 
3	MTG, but only drafting. I tend to play black, white and green primarily.\n\nI love theory crafting decks but I dislike how fast cards roll out of standard and I dislike sorting my collection. \n\nRPGs, not at all.\n\nI get the appeal but they always seem like such a time suck and I don't feel like I get enough enjoyment/entertainment out of them considering the effort they require. I feel this about digital rpgs and pen & paper. I rather balance a stranger's checkbook than level a character up in an RPG.
3	I love games like Dante’s Inferno, Dark Souls, Darksiders, etc. You only get one character option, but you can choose which weapon. \n\n\nI prefer to cater my build to the challenge. Am I fighting a hoard of little bugs with low HP or a single bad boy with high HP? For a high quantities and low HP, I like to use light small weapons with a high rate of attack and low damage. That way I can easily slash my way through. But if it’s a big boss, I want something big and heavy like a hammer. Each individual swing is planned and strategically placed. Plus, it’s only one enemy, so I don’t have to worry about other enemies attacking mid swing. \n\n\nNow let’s say there’s a combination of a few mild HP guys and a few handfuls of low HP guys. I like to use a medium sized weapon like a sword or a scythe. Something with average attack speed and average damage. That way I can effectively work my way around the field picking off enemies. \n\n\nIn like MMORPG games (like Smite, kingdom warriors, WOW, etc), I like long range characters. Wether it’s archer, magic, whatever. I like to keep my distance. \n\n\nI’m not really super fond of arena styled online RPG’s. I much prefer the solo strategy RPG’s like dark souls and Dante’s inferno. 
2	I've played mtg forever, and always favored UW control decks.\nLots of rpgs tried, but mtg is my main game.
2	I played MTG back in the 90’s. I have no idea what the state of the game is like now. Back that I was into green and black. I hardly remember anything about it except playing against friends during lunch in middle school. \n\nAs for RPGs, I also played WoW and I always preferred the Druid class because they can fill any role and shape shift. 
2	When I play mtg I usually stick with mono red, black/red or black/white, white/red... Recently tried a red/blue that focuses on the [Enigma Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=426900)
1	MTG -- my favorite colors to play thus far are Black, Green, and Blue (Sultai). Red is fine until it wears itself out, and White (to me) is just annoys the rest of the EDH table.\n\n* I enjoy being the most major threat on the board. Sultai just does this in so many ways and with great resilience.\n\nFavorite RPG classes: Mages in general.
1	MtG: Grixis, in order: black, red, blue\n\nDark Souls: Strength build usually\n\nOther games: "up in your face" builds most of the time
1	I tried MtG for a bit, used Black-Red deck, looking to get back in with physical cards or online.\n\nNormally I'm drawn to hack'n slash more than RPG's, so I tend to pick fast characters while trying to keep my options open if possible. I restarted Path of Exile with a Duelist. Now he is a dual wielder with a bow & arrow. Only difference is in War Thunder, I tend to play dual engine fighters opposed to single engine variants. 
24	Stumbled upon this comment...how ISTPs do work lol	
14	I'm the opposite.  I'm usually early.  It serves me well because the rare occasion that I am late, I usually don't get shit for it 
13	I was on time the first two days of my internship this summer. The rest 10-25 minutes late everyday. They never complained about it though and they want me to come back
9	Wish I had a boss that was that lenient even though I bulldozed through my work.
7	This matches me but only 10-25 minutes late and alway trying to leave 1 hour early
11	On one of the many "profiles" out there that I've read, this one made me chuckle because it's so true. I can't remember the exact verbiage, but it goes something like this:\n\nThe ISTP is a procrastinator, waiting until the absolute deadline to start. They lay dormant, even relaxed. But when that comes, they literally launch themselves at the problem and put everything they have into it and get it done on time. They're very good at managing time, resources, and anticipate problems that will arise. There is some chaos to this flurry of activity, but the ISTP manages it 100%, much to the confusion of everybody around them.\n\nSounds like me.
3	I wish I had such understanding bosses. 
3	This is how I was in school. I once had a teacher defend me to the class for leaving and getting coffee because when I was there I put more effort in than everyone else. 
2	I'm only late for meeting friends. Almost never late for work.
1	I just watched [a relevant video](https://youtu.be/N0tXbq0mx40) by a Youtuber called Drift0r. He talks about how nice guys always do way more work than others but end up getting shit on because people throw even more work onto them. Eventually they break down because the stress of people treating them like shit gets to them.
6	Istp metal musicians	\nAny metal musicians that are Istp?
3	I want to say I am one. Just not at the moment. Was a drummer around high school, I'm 28 now, but living conditions are preventing me from continuing that front. I try to play guitar here and there, just songs from bands I like, Amon Amarth, Gojira, Lamb Of God, among others.\n\nSomething about the technicality of drumming and the diversity of music overall is just amazing.\n\nEdit: Wow... I totally missed the point of your post... goddamn.
2	Only one that comes to mind is Lemmy, he was defiantly I, T and P and his down to earth attitude and interest in history point at sensing over intuition.
2	30 years worth of metal here, and not stopping now. \m/
2	Let me crack out my google-fu and see if I can find any. \n\n\nEdit: List:\n\n\n1. James Hetfield (Metallica)\n\n2. Lemmy Kilmister (Motorhead)\n\n3. Mikael Stanne (Dark Tranquility)\n\n\nThese are the only three I found on the first page. And idc enough about metal music to go deeper lol. But there’s two quite popular metal guys up there. 
16	Read somewhere that ISTPs make good programmers, but having tried it in the past, it bored the hell out of me. Is this unusual?	The language was Python, if it matters.
22	It’s just like any other skill when you first start out. When you suck, it’s not fun. It’s not fun til you’re good enough to actually do something useful with the skill. \n\n\nIf you like programming, push through the boring. If you don’t like it, skip it and move on. \n\n\nISTP’s have a nature that typically matches wel with programming. But it doesn’t mean every ISTP will like or be good at it. 
18	Nah, I was super bored after a while. I think if you get past the boring part to where you actually get to do something useful it gets fun though.
14	<- Sr. Software Engineer, 30 years coding. I code at work, I code at home. Love to code. It marries my creative side with my logical side. Maybe because I've always been given mostly unrestricted freedom.\n\nI didn't like Python.
6	I love the concept of programming, but it sucks when you can't do anything in it because you don't know the proper syntax, or the issue at hand. Just try to start simple with stuff like Scratch, and you might just like it. It's actually very logical, and if you can figure out how programming logic works, you only need to learn the syntax/rules for any other language. 
4	You will never "master" a languagr, there is always something you could do better ou will want to do in a different way. It is a constant research.
3	It's fun to build stuff and get creative with the language once you're comfortable with it, but it's very abstract (high level logic, not hands-on) and can be very frustrating when you start because you will have to Google every 10 minutes.
2	Being good at something doesn't mean you'll enjoy it.  On the flip side, nothing wrong with enjoying things you're not good at.
2	I'm  a programmer.  Reading about programming is awful, but I really like making things
2	Agreed. If you can program in a way to make physical things happen, that keeps the boredom at bay. Give Arduino or raspberry pi a try. Cheap investment. If you find that you like it, give PLC ladder logic a try.
2	Go in IT for a startup. The amount of stupid things do to mess up the company never gets old, and you'll always be patching something or other because there's no budget for solid hardware.
2	Programming is way too advanced for me. It seems boring and I can barely type as it is.
2	I fucking hate coding. I can't be fucked to search the entire wall of text because I missed one little mark, pisses me off.
1	I'm currently learning python online and finding it quite interesting. Only problem I'm having is remembering all those functions. 
1	I like programming enough to try to fix stuff thats broken but the prospect of doing all day as a job sounds terrible.
1	Well it's important to realize that ISTP is just a general personality type. We're not all 1-for-1 the same. I personally have been a hobbyist game developer for many years now, but programming certainly isn't for everyone.
1	I got about halfway through a computer science degree and decided it was boring so I switched to microbiology. I could just foresee my life turning into the movie Office Space. It still comes super handy for statistics and bioinformatics though.
1	I like doing it, but I would rather make 7 small programs that are unique and useful than write a really analytical elaborate piece of software.  Try breaking it down more into smaller parts.  that helps me get over the "work" feeling.
1	Just because we are ISTPs doesn't mean we are all the same. I work with pre-schoolers and elementary school kids and greatly enjoy it. You don't have to like programming or cars or engineering to be an ISTP. Your MB type is what you are not who you are
1	Python is hella fun, and accessible. \n\nDon't learn a programming language just to learn it. That doesn't give you aim or purpose, just decide on a project that you consider fun/practical that uses the programming language, then beat your head against the book until your code starts working the way you want it. \n\n
1	same here, I prefer to do something with my hand in terms of material crafts. Coding is not satisfying at all to me
1	python is overrated &mdash; even though i'm currently writing a cleverbot-based chatbot. just because you're an istp doesn't mean you'll like programming.
1	How do you deal with immature people of your own type	I figured the best people to ask on dealing with immature ISTPs would be people who are ISTP themselves. Let me stress first that I don't have any issue with any type in general. I'm just dealing with a rather immature ISTP at the moment, and it's draining the life out of me.\n\nSpecific areas that are of concern;\n\n1. He has a habit of being overly confrontational. Part of me wonders if he just tries to start up pointless freaking arguments. \n\n2. He's really neurotic about stuff. The dishwasher must be loaded a specific way. Caps have to be face up when taken off of things. This has to be this way. This has to be that way. \n\n3. He can't handle confrontation. The man is confrontational, and if he even thinks he's being challenged in some way he'll get increasingly rage filled. One time he screamed at a teenager for about 5 minutes straight, because this kid had the nerve to "roll their eyes" at him. It's like when he's confronting someone he tries to make himself out to be as big, and scary as he can. When he actually is challenged his response to scream as hard as he can to make the other person back down. I don't know if he would resort to physical violence, but honestly...I kind of think he would. I think he gets so obsessed about winning whatever confrontation he's in that he absolutley would resort to physical violence. \n\n4. He's kind of a know-it-all which is really annoying. Half of what he says to everyone including his own wife starts with a phrase like; "You need to start learning" or "What you need to do is" His wife just makes excuses for him. One time I asked her; "Why do you let him talk to you like that?" And she basically gave the pity talk about how it wasn't really his fault.\n\nSo now good/mature ISTPs please enlighten me as to how you would handle this person?
7	Not sure we're the best people to ask because personally, if something or someone annoys me deeply, my impulse will always be to avoid that shit like a ninja.\n\nOn another note I'm not clear on why you're so sure he's an ISTP, but let's assume he is, or at least admit that it's not important either way.\n\nNow about your points :\n\n1) I'm unable to comment on his motivations, but what I can tell you is that it's weird. Sure if we're backed up in the wrong corner we are more than able to abuse someone verbally, but confrontation for sport is not usually our thing, quite the contrary.\n\n2) If it's something you can live with, just go along with it, there's no sense of dying on the hill of how to load the dishwasher or whatever petty bullshit we're talking about. There's probably a reason behind each of his ways of doing things, and you could ask, but as you established that he's an unpleasant man, probably not a good idea to get him started.\n\nIf it's not something you can live with, then tell him clearly and calmly that his demand is unreasonable/unacceptable and why. Brace yourself for the fallouts. Go through the proper channels of your workplace if it is needed.\n\n3) He's an asshole. And an old one. He seems to be unable to properly function in a society. There's no fix or advice for that.\n\n4) Of course it's annoying, which is why you need to file him under lost causes, and emotionally detach yourself of him as much as you're able to. And be very careful how you get involved in the dynamic between him and his wife, it would be one thing if you had reason to think she's in danger, but otherwise remember he's a volatile unpleasant man and this kind of remark could blow back on you hard.\n\nWhether or not he's ISTP, you're describing a shitshow, so treat it as you would do any other shitshow.
3	That sounds more like an executive functioning issue which isn't really related to typing or even maturity in the traditional sense. Wouldn't be surprised if he had ADHD/ADD or some sort of learning disability which affected his ability to have cognitive flexibility (the dishwasher/caps), emotional control (getting upset over little things. Often it is a very strong but short reaction), and lack of perspective taking (being a know it all). \n\nI work with people who have these issues and the most important thing is to realize this guy doesn't choose to be like this and his brain is literally hardwired to act this way. If you look into ways of supporting people with executive functioning issues you should find some good tips. 
3	Personally I'd avoid that person like the plague. And that does not sound like ISTP behavior. Unless he really cares deeply about washing dishes, because if it's his passion or something, that is the only time it might be expected for an ISTP to go neurotic. Assuming good psychological health, that is. 
2	How old is he?
2	doesnt sound immature to me. sounds like he has anger issues.

9	Anyone studied computer science?	If you studied, or currently are studying computer science, do you find the coding field exciting? I've been thinking about getting a CS bachelor's once I graduate high school. 
10	I went to university for it, as well as Music. CS is a lifestyle. There is so much shit to learn all the time just to keep up with the industry. Could be a bit draining if you have a terrible memory. But damn ISTPs make good programmers, due to their Ti + Ni. The Ni hunch can be a very valuable asset. Allows you to blaze through your code because you just know intuitively how it's all supposed to fit together. And of course there's lots of Ti users in the tech industry. You'll feel right at home if you work with some mature people.  \nIf you want to use your Se and Fe a bit more then you could always do a trade, e.g. police/firefighter, fitness/athlete, electrician, chef, etc. But in the end we always end up going back to Ti/Se. It's why I spend a lot of time on the internet debating and playing video games. Don't think I could invest so much time in just one interest.
3	I did, and am currently employed as a software engineer. It's a great field with plenty if variety if you're motivated!
3	Yeah, eventually began to dislike it - mostly theoretical which began to bore me. (to each their own though)
2	I did, I have a BSc in computer science / engineering (it's officially in CE but at my university these are not separate programs and my specialization was more on the CS side) and an MS in AI.\n\nThere were plenty of bullshit courses with no practical use (especially not with my specialization) but there were also interesting practical problems to solve. The job is kind of the same; bullshit to make the management / clients happy and interesting stuff to make you happy. It's when the balance shifts too much to one side when it becomes grating.
2	Minored in it. My major is in electrical/computer eng. Both had lots of theoretical courses which were a PITA, but if you keep in mind the end goal through those, it's worth it. Very stimulating for me.
2	I have CS degree, and have been working in IT for 15+ years, currently an IT Manager. Before that I was a carpenter, mechanic, and dental appliance technician. A lot of the time I feel like I would have been better off staying in the trades, but at the same time I know if I had never pursued a degree taken a shot at making it in the white collar world I would have always regretted it. Personally I decided against programming while I was still in college, I did fine in my programming classes, but I just found it incredibly dull and very frustrating, I've always struggled with book based learning, and I knew that for me a career in programming would be painful.
2	I hated comp sci. I had planned to make it my minor but the class was so theoretical, it was one of my most hated classes.\n\nI'm sure if I kept going, I would have found the more practical classes, but it just turned me off. I don't need to understand the inner workings and theories behind machine code and assembly to implement something that will actually help an organization. 
1	Im still currently finishing my CS degree after 7 years of on and off, in and out of college. Its the only thing I could think of in highschool that I might need to pursue in order to earn a living where Im atleast familiar with since as a kid. In the beginning it was fun but Ive thought about switching major in Psychology or Criminology just to feel "excited" again as I reach 3rd year. It just became a chore studying programming. I wanted to switch to music school/university to study Music as well but I know I will never get a job from it and besides its a hobby anyway. I went to a community college so theres not much courses/subjects available to take. Im too lazy to pursue any of these alternatives and too lazy to continue CS degree. I still have internship left in order to graduate but, Im just too lazy man.
1	I did. I got a minor in CS and majored in chemical engineering.\n\nI did not like it. I was actually quite good at it. But compared to chemical engineering, I found it boring. I didn't like that the concepts weren't applicable to the real world, they almost only applied to programming. Chemical engineering described physical phenomena and I learned a lot of stuff which I can actually use to understand the world around me or provide explanations for things that most people wouldn't have a clue about (but still find somewhat interesting). Many concepts in chem eng were also highly theoretical, but I still found them interesting.\n\nI've also worked in CS roles and engineering roles and prefer the latter.
1	doing that now, research jobs BEFORE actually going through the whole college application bollocks. can tell you now that \n\na. the "abundance" of cs jobs is an absolute joke, it's slowly becoming more competitive, but *the best liar gets hired*, you'll see when you'll find the same jobs that rejected your application popping back up in a month\n\nb. it's not for everyone... you have to know the reasoning behind your choice, and if it's shallow, good luck, seriously. i have a highschool friend that's finished another degree, but decided to pursue cs, i am surprised he's made it this far. i'm getting straight As in cs (i have no idea how and why), and i felt the dumbest in class. but i do have those spells where i can code for hours at a time, and it's actually fun. but choosing the career because you feel like its an easy office job and high pay, especially the high pay part, it's probably not for you if coding bores you or you're not that interested in it.\n\nc. it's exciting in the beginning, but later courses become like a chore sometimes. especially the repetition. when you've made some crazy programs in a language, but then have to re-learn a language and it's the same thing but in a different way, it gets repetitive\n\nd. colleges only supply you with the absolute minimal starting package, the base model with crank windows. this is partly why i said to look through job offers, learn what they're looking for. colleges won't teach you 3/4 of the frameworks, technologies you have to know. but lot of people can get jobs somehow, but they worked their ass of getting to where they can make 80k+\n\ne. internships are near to impossible. not only that, it's competitive as hell, you need connections up the ass to even get a chance at internships, they'll hire some bloke who knows 0 code, who got a good word from their employee (i got a friend who got into microsoft/nokia their freshfuckingmen year in college because his parents told some bloke they know to see if he could get an internship.. never even finished his degree and now makes more than engineers make, literally bosses people with degrees around, at another job but because he was an intern at nokia then ms). they'll only look at your previous jobs, as long as it's computer related you'll be fine, any other work is irrelevant (e.g. walmart, sales, bestbuy, truck driver, etc)\n\nf. if it interests you, i'd say go for it. but you have to stick with it. if college majors were marriages, i'd be donald trump, i've been through too many majors, and this major is the one which seems to stick.
1	I’m in hs and hated my Intro to Coding class back in 9th because the teacher sucked. Idk if it was the actual subject manner or just the class that I didn’t like. \n\nAnyway, I think I’ve seen a couple of CS people on this sub, and there’s definitely a handful of engineers on here as well. \n\nLol make sure you really like it, though, since it’s one of the most (if not _the_ most) competitive to get accepted as in college admissions. It’s a tough one to stay in too, both in school and in industry. 
5	Does my ISTP need space or is he waiting for me to initiate?	Hey, ESFJ here with a massive crush on my ISTP friend. I’ve learned a lot from lurking around here and have developed an even greater appreciation for him. But I do have a question. \n\nI’ve noticed a pattern with my ISTP being very sweet and attentive for a time and then being more distant for a little while. I didn’t know what to make of it initially, but learned here that it’s normal ISTP behavior. The distant times seem to be getting shorter and further apart, so I think I’m responding well to him so far. \n\nMy question is, when he becomes more distant, how can I tell if he needs space or if he’s waiting for me to initiate something with him? Are there any signs I can look out for? I don’t know if he’s interested in me romantically, but either way I want to respect his needs. TIA! 
14	I doubt he needs space, ISTPs just go quiet sometimes. I think you should make a move. Theres probably a good chance he likes you. I know I don't go out of my way to be friendly to a lot of women unless I at least think they're attractive.
6	Ask\n
3	I cycle through this with women I'm attracted to. It's partially the introversion, but also a "I'm trying subtly, it's not working(she's not responding the way I hoped), why am I bothering?", and then the introversion piles on that, because it's exhausting/socially stressful to do all that work.\n\nIf it's becoming more infrequent, that's a good sign that you are responding the way he hopes, and yes, I'd say initiate a little more. Not with an activity, but just throw him a quick smiley face or a few words about what he is doing(good luck at bowling tonight!). If you can make it closed-end, so he doesn't feel pressured to respond, even better, because then he probably would feel comfortable doing so.
3	It's impossible to say for sure that this applies to all ISTPs, but to this ISTP, space is never required. It's an interest check. He's distancing on purpose to see if you put in the effort to pull him back in.\n\nIf you don't, then that's an indication that you don't give a crap about this relationship and he's wasting his time and wants to move on. Though he seems interested in you, so every now and then he'll poke you to see if you're still receptive. But one of the worst things to an ISTP is to make someone do something against their will. He wants a relationship with you if **you** want it.\n\nIf you take the effort to bridge the gap, I bet he perks right up. Also, be candid and direct with your intentions, we don't like games.
1	If I want space I disapear. lol. if I like someone i'll put it out there early and then disapear again and if I hear anything back i'll pursue. if you're teenagers, everyone develops at different rates. i've linked up much later with people from school after I was ready and aware of how the world operated. don't put all your eggs in one basket. When it comes to young adults they're figuring stuff out, all of it. 
1	Life's too short to sit around wondering, most ISTPs would appreciate being asked out as well.  Most of the women I've dated have made it incredibly obvious they were interested or asked me out initially.\n\nI'd definitely go with something casual for the first date like coffee/tea/lunch that doesn't have to last too long or have big expectations.
20	Anybody else intentionally hinder themselves in public to alter other people’s perception of you?	When it comes to knowledge and skills, I generally won’t do this. I’m pretty open about the things I know and the things I can do. \n\n\nBut there are other internal skill sets I have that I tend to hide. My reasonings will be a little more clear by the end. \n\n\nMy two biggest examples are my objective logic and my hearing. Both of which I have highly developed (in my opinion at least). \n\n\nAs far as hearing goes, I tend to pretend like it’s not as good as it is. Let’s say I’m sitting at my desk doing something on the computer and somebody says “hey celli”. I’m likely to completely ignore it. And then they come up and get my attention physically. “Did you not hear me?” “Oh no sorry. When I’m in the zone I tend to not notice what’s going on around.” And then proceed normally from there. Nobody ever really seems to question it further. \n\n\nThis does several things for me. For one, it gives me plausible deniability. My hearing is great, not perfect. Sometimes I do mishear people and sometimes and I misunderstand people. But when I’m known for being hard of hearing, nobody gives me shit if I mess up. Another thing is that people tend to pretend like I’m not present. I can’t tell you the number of conversations I’ve overheard that should *not* have been had within my ear shot. I’ve caught plenty of friends, family, and coworkers talking shit about me when they think I can’t hear them. I don’t address it. I just keep in mind that that is how they think about me. This really helps me know who not to trust. If someone is talking shit about me when they think I can’t hear them, I clearly cannot trust that person. \n\n\nAnd the other day, I slipped up. My roommate and I were in the living room and his phone was in his room on his desk. Sitting in my chair on the wall, I heard the tiniest vibration and said “hey I think your phones ringing”. Sure as shit, it was. It was returned with “Jesus how the hell did you hear that. You barely hear me across the room.” \n\n\nI will also downplay my sense of logic. Normally I’m quite good at taking in details, analyzing them, and making a logical next step. However, I tend to make small illogical mistakes here and there. I keep them small enough to keep them easy to fix, though. I want to appear imperfect, not as an idiot. This does several things for me as well. For one, it allows me to manage expectations towards me. I can fine tune exactly what people expect from me. I’ve found this incredibly beneficial when it comes to advancing in a company. It’s worked for me over and over and almost every job I’ve had. \n\n\nAlso, I’ve learned over the years that people who make occasional mistakes get more recognition and reward for doing something well than people who always do everything right. Basically I’m occasionally presenting myself as “overachieving” when I’m really just operating at normal levels. And let’s be clear, I’m not looking for compliments or validation. I’m looking to manage the way I’m perceived by superiors. At work, my boss praises me when I do something really well. And it’s because he’s used to me making occasional mistakes. The more he praises me, the more my name catches the ears of upper management. So when promotions and positions open up, they come to me. And this has really helped me climb the ladder here. I’m now higher on the totem pole than any of my coworkers in the same position as me. Including the guy who *got* me the job and the guy who’s been here 28 years as opposed to my 1.5. Also, I don’t want to be so proficient and useful in my current position that they refuse to promote me because they need me there. \n\n\nAnd the last little bit correlates with the hearing thing as well. I’m not perfect, I make mistakes. So when I’ve conditioned people to expect small mistakes from me, my larger genuine mistakes aren’t fussed over as badly. It gives me a chance to fix my fuckup without getting reamed from a superior. When I fuck up, I *know* I fucked up. I don’t need a superior over my shoulder yelling and directing me. I need to concentrate, focus, and fix this shit. Through purposefully making small mistakes that I easily fix, I also get seen as someone who is capable of fixing their own problems. So I never have anybody trying to take over for me to solve an issue that I’m fully capable of handling on my own. \n\n\nSo essentially I’m just altering the way I present myself to fit a specific purpose. 90% of the time though, it’s work related. Manipulating a superior into realizing I’m the best fit for a promotion sits better with me than manipulating friends or family for personal gain. Not about that life. I’ll walk up and down the corporate ladder to get what I want, but not friends and family. I’m not a sociopath, just very “progress oriented” in my career. I’ll do whatever it takes to move up as long as im not directly hurting somebody else to do it or lying about my skills/knowledge/credentials. I’ll happily downplay myself to make my high points appear higher. But will not *oversell* myself and lie my way into a position. 
7	Yeah. I relate. I don’t advertise some strengths or at least I downplay them, then when I need to “show” effort or ambition - do that and make it impressive. Get a result. \n\nInteresting that I recently bumped into a friend who asked me where I was working now. I told her where and what I was doing. She said, “you ended up doing what you said you would!” \n\nI asked what she meant and she told me that previous to that meeting we had met before and I had just started with the same company but in a low tier position (I was changing careers and had no experience in this new one). Most people wouldn’t take that starting job. I told her I’d be promoted past that in a year. \n\nSure enough I was. I am currently right under the VP of the business. However, I have since started my own LLC as I can’t move up here anymore and the owner has me where he wants me. So time to move on...or at least build the next stepping stone. May take some time. \n\n
6	Way too much of a textwall for this ISTP to read. But if you're getting at what I think you're getting at, I generally don't do this, I'm perfectly comfortable with who I am and don't care what others think of that. However, there is one that I do hold back: I generally process things much faster than those around me. E.g. if someone tells a joke, I "get it" much faster than most do (I'm talking milliseconds here). Or if someone is trying to explain something, I usually get it faster than everybody else. I purposefully have to hold myself back because nobody likes that person who is always the first to raise their hand, etc. And besides, it's not my job to ensure everybody else understands, I'll just wait patiently for them to catch up. (not trying to be an arrogant jerk, mostly just annoyed by this phenomenon) 
1	*I’ve caught plenty of friends, family, and coworkers talking shit about me when they think I can’t hear them. I don’t address it. I just keep in mind that that is how they think about me. This really helps me know who not to trust. If someone is talking shit about me when they think I can’t hear them, I clearly cannot trust that person.* This is funny, I realized that people will talk about shit like that around me too, but if I ever hear them talking about me I'm going to verbally rage on them. 
1	Yeah my dad pretends he can't hear me just because it can feel good in a way... I'm not sure how to explain that. It's like when someone acts like their really sensitive because it feels good almost like they're special or something. For example, someone says they're having a reaction to the cat because their body is so "sensitive". I'm still trying to figure out the psychology of it though. Does it make them feel special? Unique? Do they want people to think they have heightened sensitivity or dampened hearing? Why does it feel good to say that you're allergic to cats? I know the same feeling that others have, the urge to feel special in a way or like your body is hyper sensitive, it can feel good, I don't know why.
1	Yep. I tend to tailor my outgoing personality to the people I deal with. I find it comes in quite useful, particularly if you're aiming to accomplish something strategic career-wise, or if you don't necessarily know people super-well and you're trying to gauge what's acceptable for them. \n\nI don't outright lie or exaggerate anything, more that I'm dialing up or down certain aspects of my personality to find the best fit for the situation. 
1	I think many people do this to some degree or another. There's some people with no self control whatsoever, they're the one's ready to conquer the world.\n\nsome people are wizards and you'd never know it. the amount of times I've discovered peoples hidden talents, and i'm talking real talent that they palm off so nonchelantly is actually dumbfounding.\n\nI laughed at that hearing people call you and you don't respond until they approach you, I have a friend that does that. I noticed he expects my full attention when he wants something but if I have to tell him something he ignores me..  yeah I don't talk to him that often. 
1	This sounds like Te/Fe logic to me. Ti stays true to its principles even if not personally advantageous. Not saying ISTP can't manipulate people but this is not what defines an ISTP. I personally do not have the extraverted intelligence to manipulate others. It's easier to just stay true to myself and be logically consistent. Most of the time people walk all over me.
1	In school I used to pretend to not understand things because I didn’t want to be the one explaining it to the people who didn’t get it.\n\nI’m the opposite of you when it comes to listening in though. I pretend that I have great hearing and that I can here every tiny thing (which to be fair, I actually do) I learned around high school that since I have great hearing and can hear everything, people are either scared of me because I know something they’ve said that I may be able to use against them or scared to talk bad about me because I will know. I have no idea how they came to this conclusion but it’s pretty consistent up to college and even work. I obviously can’t hear everything though but I’ve primed people to believe that I can. I don’t know why I do this I guess it’s fun to mess with people sometimes.
4	Following a Routine?	Okay so I know ISTPs don't like routines or whatever but sometimes you have too actually follow one to get something done on time. So any tips on how to actually stick to one without it immediately feeling like a bore?
4	If you have to follow a routine to get something done in time, that doesn’t sound like a routine to me. It sounds rather short in duration, that’s hardly a routine. What’s the real problem?
7	I have 0 emotional connection to anyone	I have to first state that I dont dislike this, and I don't want to be in a relationship at all, but when I was, I had no emotional connection whatsoever. it's not even a thing of "huhuh im numb xdDDd". I legitimately have no issues at all with cutting out lifelong friends or family members. Is this an ISTP thing or a sociopath thing?
17	I'm tempted to say Sociopathic, while I often have a ton of weak friendships I have no problems saying goodbye to.\n\nI have a few close knit relationships that nothing short of a sledgehammer can break.\n\nThen again, every ISTP is different, and context is important.
11	You're 16 yo. When I was 16 I couldn't care less about myself, much less people around me. \n\nI'm in no position to tell you're wrong but I've broken down sobbing and loudly crying over a person that died and I knew less than a year, while I cut communications with family members easily in a heart beat. \n\nI thought I was tough too you know... But each year that goes by, I feel that's such a BS.\n\nLife will teach you wether you like it or not. \n\n
6	You need a best friend.
7	For someone who’s username is ResponsibleContext, you really gave us little to go off of. 
3	Well let’s break this down. The three things that come to mind are sociopathy, psychopathy, and simply being a young selfish teen. \n\n\nSociopathy: a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience. \n\n\nSo, you meet the first criteria. What about conscience? Do you ever find yourself causing someone else harm with zero regrets? Can you steal money from a friend/family and feel no remorse? If you no sense or conscience towards other people, you be a sociopath. But obviously I can’t answer that for you. People are not born sociopaths. People are molded into sociopath by their environment, usually from childhood trauma. Do you have any trauma that could have halted emotional development? \n\n\nPsychopathy: psychopaths are born, not made. They tend to have similar qualities to sociopaths, but it’s their nature not nurture that causes lack of empathy towards others. \n\n\nIf you really want to know if you fit into one of these categories, here are some common qualities. See if any of them match up to you: \n\n1. Regularly breaks or flouts the law\n\n2. Constantly lies and deceives others \n\n3. Is impulsive and doesn’t plan ahead \n\n4. Can be prone to fighting and aggressiveness\n\n5. Has little regard for the safety of others \n\n6. Irresponsible, can’t meet financial obligations \n\n7. Doesn’t feel remorse or guilt (this one is the biggest one. You cannot be a psychopath or sociopath if you experience remorse or guilt for your actions that hurt others.) \n\n\nAnd then there’s just being a young selfish teen. Your sense of empathy hasn’t developed yet. Maybe it’s slow, maybe you don’t have it, maybe a trauma has stunted emotional growth, etc. Many teenagers are very self centered, greedy, and cruel to others. Most seem to grow out of it as they age and collect more life experience. 
2	I'd say 90% people I have a hard time relating to emotionally. Probabaly because I had a pretty dysfunctional childhood so if you had any semblance of normalcy growing up I automatically assume you can't understand my perspective. \n\nMoreover if I share that stuff it's not for sympathy or empathy. It's for advice how to process it in a better way or how to get motivated. Most people think listening helps and advice is rude but it's the opposite for me. I want you to tell me what you think can fix it. I won't hold you accountable for bad advice but I will run the scenario through and think about its validity. \n\n10% of people who have fucked up histories or problems I have a soft spot for. Really rooting for them to pull it together and come out better. Gives me a ton of perspective as well from how other people deal with their problems. \n\nAs for close friends I have a handful. I'm an out of sight out of mind guy. I have a real problem instigating contact with people when they move. But trying to be better about it. But I literally hate small talk. \n\nI also have no issues with dropping friends. Regardless of how long we have known each other if I don't feel a connection anymore I won't bother maintaining the relationship. I try to talk to them about it before I ditch them in an attempt to rectify the issue. But if I'm rebuffed then it's even more evidence the relationship wasn't working out. \n\nI don't reminisce about the past relationships or friendships I've had too much. If things are meant to be people will reunite, if not there are cool people you'll meet in the future. Based on my experience the older I am getting the more selective I am about people I spend my time with and the more compatible they are with me than the previous decade. \n\nThinking about some of my so-called friends and past relationships makes me realize I gravitated towards people who put me down cause I always had something to prove to my parents and in turn sought out similar friends and relationships for validation. I got my own stuff to figure out, not add more drama. 
1	I'm an ENTP, but same. So I dont think this only pertains to your type.
1	This was a quality I didn't have growing up, but developed after being abused and assaulted by my ex. I don't feel like a sociopath - I still have empathy for others, I just don't care to get attached - so it's probably just a "you" thing. If you find yourself not caring about hurting others, as opposed to merely being disconnected, then maybe I'm wrong.
1	[deleted]
1	my emotional connections died after i realized the more you waste time trying to "put yourself in other people's shoes"the more you're wasting time, because they sure as hell won't do the same. it's a game, who's gonna waste who's time, the dumbass falls for the sucking in someone else's feelings part. they're not god, they shit too.\n\ni had a weird habit when i was a kid to start a lot of arguments with people when for example, it was the last day of school. i'm not sure why, but i stopped after i stopped caring. you are your own friend, and that's the only friend that's with you till the end\n\n> I legitimately have no issues at all with cutting out lifelong friends or family members. Is this an ISTP thing\n\nprobably because you're fed up with them, and disagree about a lot of things, therefore feel as if you're better off living without them. it may be common with ISTP but it likely applies to most people.\n\n> it's not even a thing of "huhuh im numb xdDDd". \n\nyou wouldn't be able to tell at all
5	Mistyped as ISTP?	Found this "new to me" site with an interesting 3 question assessment - got ISTJ. Description is different than what I am used to so I think it might be right. What do you get? Thoughts?\n\n[Assessment](https://www.typeinmind.com/assessment/)\n\n[ISTP](https://www.typeinmind.com/tise/)\n\n[ISTJ](https://www.typeinmind.com/site)\n\n&#x200B;
3	16 personalities and other "dichotomy" tests give me ISTP but tests based on cognitive functions (like that one, there are others with more questions like [http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm)) give me INTP or even ENTP because my extraverted intuition (Ne) is really strong. I think I'm probably INTP.\n\nRegardless of test I'm low on anything resembling J functions so I can't speak to why you'd have been mistyped in that way.\n\ne: so I just had a shower so I was thinking about this. My Ni in cognitive tests is really low, so if dichotomy tests are basically adding both Ne and Ni, then yea, I'm gonna get lower total N than S (where I get moderate amounts on both Se and Si). But if you look at how much I use Ne more than either Se or Si, then you have to classify me as a N type.
3	One might think that choosing 1.B 2.A 3.B would result in ISTP, but that is actually ESTP.  \nA true ISTP would have chosen 1.D (and the rest is history). A lot of people forget that we are dominant Ti users, much like INTPs.  \nThis a great website and this assessment shows they know what they are talking about.  \nWe are highly logical, principled people, who are very in tune with their senses.
1	Got ESTP but I struggle to really tell the difference between SeTi and TiSe anyway other than the popular definitions of "extroversion" and "introversion" (of which I'm clearly an introvert). I think it's because I chose the sensing option first rather than thinking.\n\nAnd I think ISTPs and ISTJs can easily confuse themselves for the other bc of the fact that we are at our cores, both sensors and thinkers. We can easily see both attitudes of S and T at the same time even if our function stacks only allow one. Most ISTPs are perfectly capable of organization and planning and optimization that are all SiTe traits, the difference is in our *preference* for a more free but still grounded TiSe. 
1	Oh boy, I’ve been mistyped as an ISTP before, I do think it was mainly due to a grip I was in. It was a process of self discovery and typing from others. But I kept an open mind and realised I’m definitely not a \nTi-Se-Ni-Fe especially when I don’t have introverted looping. Hhhhh
1	Jesus. I have to hand them my email to take the quiz? I’ve got a feeling their daily marketing emails won’t have a functioning unsubscribe button...\n\n\nEither way, I ended up INTJ with Ni Te Fi and Se. \n\n\nAfterwards I went through and read descriptions for different types. After reading descriptions, I think I definitely lean more towards ISTP over INTJ. However, INTJ still does have a lot of qualities I easily relate to. But while reading the full description, a few things would make me go “ehh, not really. Maybe kinda”. But when I read ISTP, it was pretty much “yep, that’s me”. \n\n\nEdit: formatting was bad on my phone so I didn’t put the most effort into reading and understanding each answer I chose. So I retook the test on the computer where I can see it all easily. I took time to read the answers through and understand how they might apply to me. This time I came up with ISTP. However, the answer choices that lead me to INTJ do still somewhat fit me. Just not as closely as the second answers I chose. Either way, I think an onlooker May see me act more like ISTP *or* INTP depending on the situation. Especially with Ni and Ti. Idk what my primary and secondary functions are because I can find many examples in my life for Ni vs Ne *and Ti vs Te. But I think I’ve just developed my primary and secondary functions well enough to be fluid in its “type”. INTJ puts Se as the last function, which absolutely doesn’t fit me. And I’m absolutely more of an Fe over Fi. So that’s why I’d wager i lean closer to ISTP. The primary and secondary of both types could easily fit me. But the tertiary and final functions of INTJ don’t fit me very well. 
1	I got ESFP on this test. I think this a first for me in getting that type. Usually I'm between an ISTP and INTP. I sometimes get ISFP on dichotomy tests (sometimes meaning twice) but my Fi is always my lowest on cognitive funtion tests. \n\nGoing through the test a few times I found it can be cheated very easily into giving you the result you want.
1	The test OP found has quite a few answers that are only partially correct, at least for me. I got ISFJ, while I have always gotten ISTP in tests. The test that u/taganaya also gave an ISTP result for me, with "excellent use" in both introverted and extroverted thinking. OP's test groups different functions together far too much, in my opinion. If anything, the function that should be changing in my results, if at all, should be Intuitive/Sensing. I have decent use of Intuitive cognitive functions, which would make it not unreasonable if I typed as INTP occasionally. However, the ISFJ result is very odd. I have virtually no usage in the "extroverted feeling" function according to u/taganaya's test, and only good usage in "introverted feeling." Also, I am a very opportunistic person, which completely contrasts with the commitment that Judging types usually give, and that also contrasts with the results given by OP's test. I think it's an interesting test, but I doubt it's an accurate one. 
4	Any of you considerd geeky/nerdy?	I've noticed that istp doesn't come up much in discussions when it comes to things associated with things considerd nerdy like science or geeky like dungeons and dragons.\n\n\n\n
15	Yeah, totally.  I love science, space, dungeons and dragons (moreso when I was younger).\n\nHowever, I'm selective about it.  Some people look at me incredulously when I tell them I'm into sci-fi but not anime, for example.  Like I need to take on all of the culture if I'm into one thing.
5	I like a few sci-fi and fantasy movies and shows, but I never delved too far into any fandom. 
4	Very.\n\nI was majorly influenced by my INTJ older brother and we share a lot of interests and mannerisms. I've come into my own later in life but I can't deny how my childhood helped define me. I don't mind it, to be clear, but it does make it difficult to relate to a lot of the "cool guy" ISTP descriptions.
3	Yeah - I just don’t tell people my interests very often. 
2	Oh, for sure. Science Fiction, Fantasy, Superheroes, Video Games, PC Building, 40k, Books, History etc.
2	Eclectic.
2	For sure. The most notable is the fact I'm pretty much a huge weeb.
2	Not in the stereotypical sense. I wore/wear normal clothes. Either classic rock, metal, or plain non-graphic t-shirts and jeans. No glasses, but I was stuck with braces for a few years.\n\nI did build my own D&D maps, items, characters, villains/monsters and all that in my early teens, but didn't do anything with it, wasn't part of any group that did it.\n\nI'm heavy into science and scientific philosophy. I've been studying astronomy/cosmology since I was pre-teen, and general astro/physics since then. Geology, paleontology, biology, chemistry as well. I'm a software architect, so I've been involved with building and programming computers and databases since 7th grade.\n\nEverything else is normalish fare. Hiking, biking, kayaking, firearms, archery, bowling, billiards, guitar.
1	Definitely, I used to be a complete weeb. I keep it low-key now.
1	So much so that it's not even funny.\n\nI love comic books, zombie movies, space operas, and fantasy series.  When I was a public school inmate, my classmates nicknamed me "Harriet" because of my reputation as being our year's biggest "Potter" fan.  When I was in college, I got hella into DnD (and now, years later, I would love to get back into it).  \n\nHell, even my OkCupid personality test indicates that I am more nerdy.
1	I enjoy traveling, and hanging with just 2 or 3 friends doing nothing really. I like to play video games, mainly online shooters. I like to cook and garden or relax with my cats. So I wouldn't say I'm in to nerdy things really. 
1	Yup, totally. \n\nI do often get the impression I am too jock/mainstream to be a DnD nerd and too nerdy to be 'normal', but fuck that. I just wear DragonBall and My Hero Academia performance gear to the gym 
1	I mean. On paper, I qualify as a geek or a nerd pretty easily. But IRL, I rarely get labeled as one. I have been labeled as nerd in the past, but I also looked the part back then. And it was before societies opinions on nerds shifted. \n\n\nNowadays people just call me smart. There are some topics that I can totally geek out on. Those have garnished “nerd” before, but it’s always been in a good way as a compliment and not as an insult to tear me down. 
1	Yep! I love fantasy novels and video games. My nerdy hobbies kind of learn towards cute anime and virtual pets. I love pokemon, tamagotchi, neopets, sonic, animal crossing.\nI also made a lot goth friends in high school over a shared love of vampires that weren't twilight.\n\nI used to be more into anime in general and wear a lot of graphic tees and hoodies but now I'm a bit more low key about it and more selective about the ones I watch.
1	Im still into anime and video games like I never grew out of it ever since as a kid so I guess yea you can say that. But I also have intimidating presence so most people I meet think I never play video games nor watch anime/read manga. I believe Im just autistic inside but people think Im cool for my aloofness and attitude for some reason.
1	Not at all. 
1	Never considered geeky or nerdy. I like science but I don't like geeky stuff. 
23	Bored of people?	Hi! Is it common for you to get easily bored of people? And if so, how do you deal with it in a relationship?
10	Very much so. Never been in a romantic relationship and I'm hesitant to ever get in one (...ever) for that reason and a large handful of others. In other, platonic relationships—like family and friends—I just take a break from them or drop them (not so much the latter with family). It's more exhausted and overstimulated than bored, but I guess it all goes toward the same eventual ending... so what does it matter? 
8	Yep, all the time. With friends/family I usually make a point of seeing people every 2-3 weeks, but still making sure I'm in regular contact with them. With relationships it's really rare that I find someone I'm not drained by, so if I start to lose interest or feel bored I tend to just cut ties and move on. 
4	Yeah all the time.
3	I don’t get bored of people but I get tired of the activities we do together or the things we talk about so I have built different circles of friends. So if I get overwhelmed or fatigued by one friend group I’ll hang out with another.\n\nMy best friends also know that I’m not a person who likes constant communication and they’re the same or at least understands why I’m like this so I don’t need to worry about them. And I don’t get bored with them because less communication means I won’t get sick of them.\n\nWith my current romantic relationship though, I like affection. So if we spend time together I try to make the most out of it. And when we are apart, he is not very needy so I don’t get fatigued by him if that makes sense. And it’s really easy to explain to him if I need some alone time or why I haven’t been replying and such.
3	Depends on the person. How much energy do they have? How much do they talk? What do they talk about? What kind of things do they do? \n\n\nI have a friend who doesn’t work, lives with his mom, and blows every penny he gets his hands on at the liquor store. He’s a really nice caring guy with a good personality. But every single story he has to tell is about something wild that happened when he was drinking. And that shit gets boring real fast, so I cut down how much I spend with him. \n\n\nBut then I have another friend with a good job, his own home, multiple hobbies, and lots of things in common. I can hang out with him a ton because it’s not the same recycled drinking stories every time. We can discuss relationships, business, tv shows, music, basketball, etc. And shit half the time were together, we aren’t even talking. Just smoking and watching something. \n\n\nSo for me, it really is judged on an individual basis. People who are interesting and well adjusted last longer than people who are good for short term fun. 
1	Oh yeah majority of the time. It is what it is tho.
0	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless r/istp would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ISTPs.\n\nThe ISTP survey link:\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JTK638P](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JTK638P) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ISTP please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.
1	Considering two career paths. Opinions appreciated.	1. Physical Education, rather as a teacher or a researcher (whatever it is they research). Why: I enjoy going to the gym, running, playing volleyball. Sometimes I watch youtube videos about bodybuilding and nutrition. Working-out is the most fulfilling thing in my life.\n\n2. Tour guide. I'm fluent in a second language and I'd greatly enjoy speaking it as a part of my job, I kinda get into a role when using it. That career involves socializing, sharing facts, being outside, moving around.\n\nAre any of these good fits for an ISTP in your opinion? They're both socially challenging (that's my fear tbh) and they don't involve selling something, but rather teaching. I'm kinda good at explaining things but very introverted.\n\nI've figured I need to do something Se related. Every path I've considered before involved avoiding socializing and being still, reading or contemplating/analyzing something. I yawned a lot and felt like I wasn't growing or developing as a person at all. I guess I could also consider Nutrition but when I learn something about it I'm like "ok, beets are good" and I store one out of ten reasons why. I hate chemistry and learn it in tiny chunks once in a while.\n\nSo, what do you guys think?
1	Go teach english in another country?
1	I don't know, the level of socialisation required for either of those roles fills me with dread.
1	My uncle is an ISTP and is a tour guide and he loves it 30+ yrs. All you really have to do is just make speeches when the bus is driving, answer a few questions, and throw in some fun activities here and there. Only hardest part is planning and keeping everything organized.
1	I'm studying to be a norwegian and history teacher. Honestly I have never done anything that feels better. You click in the moment, proper SE focus. Its amazing. Also, sharing what I know and how I think is very fulfilling. Guiding others to do the same is better. And the planning is something you learn/Need to learn anyway. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have worked several social jobs as well as teaching and honestly it isn't that hard. Usually you rely on preplanned speeches and 99% of the questions are repeats. +you can tell the same joke a million times. Its a great way to train you social skills, and its not very hard. 
1	I don't see why you can't do both. There are very few full time tour guides in my experience so you could do Physical Education as a dull time career and be a tour guide as a weekend or summer job especially if you decide to teach it at a school
29	James May has a critically underrated youtube series in which he reassembles common household items.	
6	Things like this always make me feel like I should be living in England. Just the attitude and demeanor of the British people I come across is always so much more in-line with our personality. The dry sense of humor too. So many witty comments with flawless delivery 
3	I love this. May is also my favorite on Top Gear.
2	Thanks for sharing this! I’m very amused by his style and how he speaks aloud about his thoughts of the mechanics etc
2	This is /r/istp, I think you meant this for /r/asmr
7	I like to keep 'scrap' items.	I feel like it could be really useful in the future and the idea of tinkering is really exciting by itself. Examples include old headphones, a wheel skin, a graphics card, and now I have a busted [rheostat](https://imgur.com/8Fg7lGG) from a car. I don't know what these things will be useful for but they will be. It does help that im studying engineering now.
9	I'm pretty much the opposite.  My cleaning philosophy is "when in doubt, throw it out".  My house is by no means super tidy, but *too much* clutter stresses me out.  It has been my observation that "savers" tend to be people who have lived through lean times when saving things may well have been a matter of survival, ex: great depression, prison, etc.  My ENFP mom is a big saver.  She grew up dirt floor poor but is pretty far from being ISTP. 
3	I'm the same way. It always comes in handy later on.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7FhoobLoJg4
1	I used to be like that, mostly with electronics, thinking "oh, this might be useful for fixing something in the future". Over the years, I ended up with drawers and boxes full of old computer parts, headphones, mice, etc. \n\nIt made sense, 15-20 years ago, to keep stuff because it was not easy to get a certain electronic component (the closest Radioshack-like store was about 260 km away), but with all kinds of stuff available to order on the Internet it is not such a problem these days (and we have an electronics store in the city).\n\nSo, at the beggining of this year I finally threw out almost all of it, using the five second rule - in a span of around five seconds, if I can not think of a use (inside of a month from now) for the thing I am holding, it goes into the bin. Also, I did a similar thing with my Pocket saves, while with bookmarks and browser tabs I chose the nuclear option - outright deleted and closed them without thinking twice. Recently, I cleared the books from my shelves - packed some on the attic, gave away others.\n\nNot only did that reduce the clutter in my house and on my computer, it also reduced the clutter and pressure in my mind - which was the point of the whole thing.
1	I was the same way but am now cleaning house. I realized I didn't own much of this stuff it was starting to own me. Too much clutter can inhibit the hobbies you actually want to carry on. 
1	I throw everything away that isnt of immediate use by me. If I find myself needing it again than I will just buy it.
16	I should just hunker down and be a hermit for a bit right?	I’m currently in community college and work 2 jobs. I am definitely in my wtf years and I know that physical and competitive activities and going to the bar are the few things I genuinely like besides video games. It’s hard to just sit there and let the days go by doing relatively nothing but dating at 20 feels shallow and worthless as everyone’s lives are changing and you don’t know who’s gonna end up where. If anyone has suggestions on things that are cheap and not too time consuming something to just kind of get the angst and the rage out would be great. I go to the gym but that’s competing with myself. I’ve concluded to just put my head down and keep doing what I’m doing but it definitely gets stale and I have fomo but only being 20 I assume I’ll be able to do the things I want when I’m 21 and older and in/out of college. IDK 20 is a tough age when you have money but not enough money and you have time but not enough time and people’s values and goals are all over the place.
5	Focus on school and when you have time, do what makes you happy. I hung out with friends when I could, but thankfully I have several hobbies that keep me busy but are sometimes expensive.
3	Try learning an instrument. I learned how to play the harmonica and now stuff seems calmer 
2	Priorities, long and short. Divide them. You decide what the timeline is, but don't sell yourself short. Get the most challenging one done first, you will be able to put that stress behind you and be able to rage on.
1	Right now you need to focus on education and get a degree. This will be the base for your career and rest of your life. That being said, I personally enjoy sports and competition. Join a league of some sorts.  Volleyball was my activity and stress burner in college. It still is today and its a great way to meet a few good friends. Video games are also in my life but get out at least a few times a week. 
11	What are you guys doing tonight?	I'm playing ps4 just like very weekend. Some people seem to think there is a problem with wanting to stay in alone on the weekends. 
3	Bunch of IT/Programming homework to do, probably gonna put that off until Sunday night. Until then, I forsee a lot of Monster Hunter World in my future. 
2	probably read some asimov, listen to music, play games.\nI think socializing is one of those things you should take a break from too. And weekends are mandatory break days. 
2	Sitting at a bar alone because the friend I usually go out with has work tonight.  I don't mind though
2	Watching boxing and drinking bourbon. My son is sitting here watching SAT crash course videos on Youtube because he has to take them tomorrow. I don't think he did any prep before this evening. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. \n\nDisclaimer: he took them once already (a few months ago) and got a 1250. He wants to see if he can do better. I guess we'll see if a night of cramming will do anything. 
2	beers, games, and early bedtime, going biking in the am.
2	Just woke up - I am in Europe. Last evening, played Ingress and went to see a film. Probably staying at home this weekend on account of inclement weather - well, inclement according to most people. I love a nice summer storm, and the one that is coming is long overdue.
2	Drinking and playing Stardew Valley (trying to pretty up the homestead, but those damn weeds keep messing up my cobblestone paths).  \n\nI've also been reading "I'll be Gone in the Dark" by Michelle McNamara and, I've got to say, this is the most engaging book I've read in a very, very long time.  
2	going to a party to pretend to be the social butterfly, again.
1	Last night (Friday night) I was happily drinking beer and listening to music in my bedroom alone in the dark. Having a really great time.
1	I went to a wine tasting event at a friends house. The wine expert said at the beginning he will know all our names at the end from our conversations. Cocky bastard so I made up names for everyone and made it my goal that he doesn’t get my name. At the end he didn’t know my name and didn’t try to sell me bottles. I was the only one he didn’t get. 
0	Last night I went to a concert with my friends, got thrown to the grown in the middle of two guys fighting, they ripped my dress really badly, then I got pissed off at the police because they wouldn't do anything about it and told me "that's what happens at shows" and I was like "NO THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS TO SKINNY BLONDE GIRLS AT CONCERTS". In retrospect, I wished I asked for his card. I hate police. They never actually help when you need them to.\n\nHopefully tonight is better!! Probably going to a baseball game.\n
9	Two Books That Will Help Those Struggling With Socializing	Let's be real. Generally ISTPs are introverted people. But just because we're introverted doesn't mean we're recluses or anti-social, unless you decide to be. In that case, you wouldn't of clicked the title in the first place. \n\nAs I've struggled with depression and social anxiety since basically childhood, I was "playing life on hard mode" metaphorically speaking. I had no social skills, and growing into an adult every interaction felt painful one way or another. As I've finally worked through my depression and anxiety, socializing became a little easier; but things weren't exactly "clicking" how you would witness two, or more people interacting with each other.\n\nConfused about this, I picked up certain non-fiction books that would help me discover the skills to finally connect with other people, and practice effective, realistic social skills that would allow me to grow my network and make new friends. Real friends, that I enjoy hanging out with.\n\n"How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie and "Models: Attracting Women Through Honesty" by Mark Manson are two books that knock it out of the ball park when it comes to learning through self-help. You would think that the second book - based on the title, is a pick-up book but after reading it entirely it is everything but that. It challenges your views, your values, and peels back the layers of introspection to find your own flaws, recognize them, and work towards correcting them your way. \n\nThis isn't a sponsored post or anything, just thought it might be helpful info. 
11	We're ISTPs not Autistic
7	Just grab a few beers instead. I hate reading but love some good beer. Ofc that helps with be social too. 
3	Still working on my social skills. Used to not even be able to order food from Mcdicks at the register without my heart racing. Very strange, I know. I've found diet fixes most of my anxiety interestingly enough. I believe it's related to the gut microbiome.  I also have had issues with eczema on the scalp, Raynaud's, excessive sweating. I believe it's related to the gut in some way judging by the results I've been getting with augmenting my diet. A permeable gut ("Leaky gut") may be at the heart of the issue, possibly caused by the candida fungus growing out of control.\n\nI only wrote all this in case someone random came across this thread and found this information, I believe it could change a life.
10	Do the thing I hate most, so I can do the thing I hate second most.  
1	[deleted]
1	No social skills does not = ISTP. 
1	ISTP or ESTP?	when I took the test I got exactly 51% introverted and 49% extroverted. this isn't something that happens rarely, I've never met any person or test that can pin down if I'm an introvert or an extrovert\nBut does this mean I'm both ISTP/ESTP? or does it mean im neither? 
4	The difference between ISTP and ESTP is not just that 1 is introverted and 1 is extraverted. They're completely different types. I'd suggest looking into the cognitive functions, interaction styles (Direct vs Informative, Control vs Movement and Initiating vs Responding) and Temperaments. 
3	A lot of it has to do with self awareness as well. You need to answer questions from your core. There’s three different ways to answer. From the core of your nature, from the mask you put on for society, and from the way you *want* to be. And due to the blindness we often have towards ourselves, it can be hard to determine which place our answer came from. \n\n\nSo I suggest taking it again. For each question, try and come up with all three answers. What way are you truly, what way do you pretend to be in social situations, and what way do you want to be. From there, pick the answer from your core nature. \n\n\nDoing it this way should help you get a more accurate and precise answer. 
1	Look at the lower two functions. If you get into the Beebe Model look at the 5th function as well. 
1	xistp\n\nIt doesn't really matter. Which do you identify with most? For example, I'm almost 50/50 ISTP and ISTJ... but I go with the former since I relate to it more, understanding that I'm just more -J in some circumstances. You don't have to be 100% of a personality... just go with your gut. 
11	Do you fear stupidity/ignorance/madness?	Well,\n\nI am looking for some istp perspective on how to cope with my own fears, tbh.\n\nDo you generally fear humanity goes nuts? Like it happened in nazi Germany? \n\nMost of the persons i hang out with, hold extreme views on politics and i feel very distressed when they defend communism or other ignorant / crazy/nonsense. \n\nI think part of the copping solution requires to acknowledge i am ignorant on things, i may be somewhat unconscious about my own irrationality or stupidity. But acknowledging this doesnt cut it. \n\nWhat to think? \n\n\n\n
12	I think most people make too huge deals of symbolic stuff that is only a big deal because they make it a big deal. Too much attachment.\n\nIn senior year of high school, us seniors won the spirit stick yet a group of other seniors snuck out with it, and reportedly carved it up into a bong (which is kinda poetic considering the school.) People were pissed left and right, saying “school spirit” was trampled over, yet this stress and anger was all just because of some stick with glitter dredged on it. Completely wipe their minds from the entire concept of a spirit stick and no one would think it’s anything else but a stick and life moves on.\n\nTranslate that to a lot of popular issues? People making big deals over kneeling over the anthem, people using pronouns which traditionally wouldn’t be assigned to them, the list goes on. End of the day, if it doesn’t amount to actual harm to people, I don’t consider it a true issue. Stuff about “moral fabric of society” and being on “the right side of history” is just loaded with a bunch of spooks. I don’t agree with a lot of his ideas, but I think Max Stirner hits it in the head when it comes to this.\n\nIf people want to protest by kneeling for a flag? Why does it affect me? People wanting to be a different gender than what was assigned to them? Why do you care? Keep your eyes on your own road and allow others to do the same, and if their road includes kneeling and HRT, wish them the best with their life and move on. Don’t make a 30 minute rant on Facebook or YouTube when all it does is fan more flames and dehumanizes yourself in the process.
10	I think ISTP's are better able to see through the bullshit of mainstream politics than most.  Which then leads down this path of realizing that the people who absolutely should be kept away from positions of authority, are the most likely to hold positions of power.  The fear is real. It wasn't long ago that Venesuala, Zimbabwe, Detroit, were functioning societies.  
5	Yes. Ignorance is the cancer that will kill mankind. I abhor ignorance & apathy, and become very "triggered," for lack of a better word, whenever a person behaves in such a manner, regardless of the reason. \n\nCommunism looks great on paper. In practice. . . well, a true communistic government has never existed. So we don't know. Past "Communist" states were just facades for dictatorships. 
4	wow reading the comments honestly has me believing that maybe the world of politics isn’t a complete lost cause. i’m currently studying economics in college and after a string of high school and college internships, i’ve always found myself gravitating towards public service. my philosophy is that even if i’m just a singular person and there’s only so much i can realistically do, if i can replace just one ignorant and stupid public official and help to make the world just a little less worse, then i’m happy. \n\nso i guess this was a long winded way to say that yes, i actively fear that america will eventually crash and burn, but i combat it by, ironically, involving myself more in it. it also helps when you actually meet people who dedicate themselves to staying politically literate and up-to-date on current issues, and realize that there’s a hell of a lot of good and relatively smart people out there, they just don’t do anything dumb so they’re not on the news. 
3	Don’t fear any of that. Don’t fear much at all, honestly. It takes a lot. \n\nI think we are losing and will lose our personal freedoms under the guise of “protecting” marginalized people, “fighting” racism and sexism, etc. \n\nWhich is utter bullshit because no amount of government interference ever stopped some asshole from saying racist or sexist shit to me or helped me get the job I want. I had to manage that, I had to tell them to fuck off and I had to get that job. \n\nSocialism is a feel good trap and all these young revolutionaries will learn in 20 years they’ve contributed to some fucked up future by placing their trust in leadership that tells us we can have fairness and equity (we can never have this) and eradication of offensive material and offensive opinions (aka “violence”) is the key to this. 
3	 Don’t watch Idiocracy then. I go through life watching it become closer and closer to reality.  I just thank God I don’t have children.
2	I hate more than fear, I did have a time when I was interested in political philosophy, in the end it became too much thinking and left it, as of right now I am more of a moderate nationalist, communists and nazis are people I decided to dismiss, you can educate yourself in political philisophy or just look at them like political idealists, it is up to you
1	I’ve come to terms with the fact that I don’t have the tools or power or connections to change this world in the way I think it should. So I’ve learned to stop fighting and start flowing. I can’t change it, but I can still survive it. I’ve allowed my tolerance for bullshit to climb without taking part or encouraging. I just let it happen around me without taking part. \n\n\nFighting the current for so long brings about insane levels of stress and fatigue. When you let go and go with the flow, you regain some of that energy to focus into positive aspects of your life. \n\n\nLearning to choose my battles is where I found the strength and energy to enact change in my own life. I couldn’t focus on making my personal changes when I was always so pissy about the world around me. 
1	You are young aren't you? Get on with life, don't worry about the big stuff too much because the only difference we make (unless you become part of a huge group) is what's within your immediate sphere of influence. Everything else is out of your (our) control. Don't waste mental energy or time on trying to solve world hunger.
-3	don't lump communism in with "other crazy nonsense" :(
1	Where do you sit in a classroom?	In the past I would've picked the second row a bit to the side so that I would force myself to socialize. Whenever I sat on the back I slacked. The other day I sat in the front row, it's not so bad, I can pretend there's less people around and I don't have to scream across the room to ask the teacher something. And now that I come to think about it, my two best friends I met in school/college both sat in the front row, maybe cool people sit there hah. What about you guys?
21	I like almonds
7	near the window
9	Back to the wall, wherever that is. I don't like people behind me.
4	Front row because my eyesight is total crap.  That is until senior year of high school when I decided that I was done with formal schooling and opted to sit in the back and knit.
5	Second row. That way I'm not as visible as the front row people, but still close to the teacher.
3	At the back with my sunglasses on 😎 👉 
2	As close to the front and center as possible.
1	Outside the classroom.
1	i usually sit in the middle row and the column closest to the door. that way i’m not too close to the front so i can be on my phone or be distracted without consequences, but i’m also close enough to be able to pay attention if i wanted to. being close to the door is just a plus since i hate having to shuffle through the crowd of people leaving the classroom once class ends
1	With my friends.
1	Preferably in the back, but it’s hard to see the board and then I do somewhat poorly on tests and stuff. Probably going to sit in the front or middle from now on if possible. 
1	Personally I think the cool people sit in the front. At my university I've always met the people most invested in the class when sitting near the front/center of the classroom. People way off to the sides or all the way in the back generally don't give a fuck about the class and sometimes, even worse, express it outwardly. 
1	Front row. Less distractions, prof always sees my face, no heads to block board/screen, etc. \n\n\nStudies show that the front rows will be mostly A students, middle rows will be mostly B students, and third row will be mostly C students and failing students. \n\n\nSo I also sit in the front row to put myself in the mindset of an A student 
1	Ideally I always sit as close to the door as possible.
1	Middle row to the far left
-1	Why do you think this has anything to do with mbti?\n
14	Daily thought	I was at two grocery stores yesterday and both times I returned my cart and would line up and push in all the other carts in the corral. I also take random carts left in the parking lot to the return as I'm walking into the store. I was thinking, is this an ISTP trate or something else?  Do you guys do this? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also do this at the airport security with the bins they provide to place your stuff in for the x-ray.  
12	Oh shit I do the exact same thing. My thought process is about sort of “refreshing” the cycle. \n\n\nWe all get frustrated and annoyed with shopping carts being strewn all over the lot. But some people just don’t give a fuck. So a few of those people will leave carts behind. And now that it’s already stacking up, people who *wouldnt* normally do it go “oh well there’s already a ton spread out. What’s one more?” Next thing you know, there’s fucking carts everywhere. \n\n\nSo I will go in and clean up the carts so the next person is less inclined to dump there’s wherever they please. Starting a mess takes a lot more gal than simply adding a small amount to an already large mess. \n\n\nI suppose my hope is that over time the amount of carts in the lot slowly dwindle. I know it’s probably a pipe dream, but I try. \n\n\nI have the same philosophy about the lint traps in our complexes laundromat. When people come in and see a dirty trap, they’re likely to leave their own mess behind. But when the trap is clean, they’ll be more likely to clean it after they use it. So any time I go in there, I clean out all the traps in the hopes that the next person will be inclined to clean up after themselves. Again, probably a pipe dream, but it feels good to try 🤷🏼‍♂️. 
8	Every time I shop. Along with silently condemning the people who are too important to put their cart away correct. 
7	Istp neat freaks? I don’t buy it.\n\n Probably has more to do with our sense of efficiency. Since I’m going that direction, and I need a cart, I’ll just take one from the parking lot and save some minimum wage shmo the hassle. Or, with all these carts in the parking lot, I’d better grab one in case there are none inside. That will save time if I have to look for a cart.
4	Every time I'm in the gym. I fucking hate playing Towers of Hanoi with the plates whenever I need a smaller one (some cunts there take a perverse pleasure in burying the 1.25 and 2.5 kg plates on the top pegs under a stack of 20 kg ones - I can get them out, sure, but it might be problematic for some lithe girl), so I frequently fix that shit if it's not too much effort in between exercises (when I'm reracking my own plates anyway). Heavy plates on the bottom pegs, lighter ones on the top pegs, and each peg only has plates of the same weight.\n\nProbably not a specific ISTP-trait though.
4	I do the same thing with buggies (shopping carts as they’re called everywhere else.)
4	I put my cart away every time, but I'm not taking the time to do it for those lazy fucks unless it's super convenient
2	Nope I will leave it, not cleaning someone else's mess. Unless it's close to the shopping store then I might just take it and use it for my own shopping
1	Wow what a random thing to have in common.  I thought it was just because I used to work at a grocery store.  I’ll face stuff after putting groceries in my cart too.  
1	I'll usually grab a random lonely cart in the parking lot if it's close enough to my car and then use that one for shopping. I'll never go out of my way though. It does seem common though for ISTP's to like order, maybe that's Ti.
1	I am soooo glad to have found you (MY!) people, after much mistyping.
6	Visiting INFP! Hello! My dad is an ISTP! He's 61 and just retired last week. I want to show him your reddit page and just generally get him interested in reddit. :)	He may or may not start cruising around here. He's stubborn and I *just* got him to take the 16personalities and there's no doubt he's ISTP.  For decades his coworkers called him Mcguyver and he was always the go-to senior biomedical engineer. He's a picture perfect Virtuoso.\n\nAnyway, so I like to hang out with my dad on the weekends. I drive him fucking nuts though when I get to breakfast late at the restaurant hahaha. ^(Sorry dad!)He likes to get philosophical but he's anti-social so he might just end up being a lurker. I think browsing reddit would be good for him. Give him a new hobby. He would always talk about how he'd read articles online at work when he was bored. What subreddits do you guys go to/would recommend?I like to talk about stuff with him at breakfast every Saturday but he's so stubborn and he's very cemented in his beliefs about current world events. I want him to be around and to interact with a range of demographics because I think in the end he'll like reddit, especially the anonymity part, and he can learn new things without his pride being hurt.\n\nThanks for your help :)\n\n​
7	Your dad may like /r/EDC. the acronym is for Every Day Carry. And basically it’s a sub full of people sharing the stuff they carry every day. On paper that sounds boring, but a lot of these people are EDC hobbyists and have incredible collections. All sorts of beautiful metallic items, vintage watches and wallets, hand crafted pens, firearms, etc. Something tells me your dad would appreciate and embrace the mundane, as we do over at EDC. A lot of posts are from the laboring class too. We gets lots of posts with tools and equipment as well. Your dad sounds identical to my dad, so I’m willing to bet your dad also gets a hard on for tools before he would for this weeks Centerfold. \n\n\nAnd this may sound weird, but he may like /r/aww as well. My 70y/o grandfather is your typical veteran grandfather. No nonsense, stoic, quiet but speaks with authority, follows a schedule, etc. Your typical baby boomers dad. Anyways, he fucking loves looking at cute animal shit online. He always has, but now he lives in a world where it’s socially acceptable for him to enjoy it openly *and* all at the click of a button. So he embraces the new times and enjoys the fuck out of some cute animals haha. \n\n\nAlso, you can never go wrong with general outdoorsy stuff like /r/fishing /r/bassfishing /r/boats /r/kayaking. He grew up in a world where he had to go out and make his own entertainment, which more than likely included some of these stereotypical “man” things. Every time I show my dad pictures from these subs, it sparks a memory for him and I get a story. Those subs may be a good way for him to reminisce on “the good ‘ol days”.

4	The best example of Se + Ti + Ni ... in action: John Dillinger in movie Public Enemies? Do you know something better..? So, SE and Ti better than NE+ti?	The ability to cooperate and the positive attitude that man born on June 22 manifests in relation to every human being means that people are happy to stay in his company in every area of ​​life.\n\nHe can never feel lonely, and it is very important to him, because he certainly would never have been happy if even at the best time in his life there was no one with whom he could share this joy. He is very peacefully oriented towards the world and is ready to laugh and play with everyone, and he never wants to fight, even when he has something to ask for.\n\n  He is very keen on earning a lot of money, because in poverty he will certainly not be able to experience full happiness and he is well aware of this, but he does not pursue this goal at all costs and certainly can not be called a materialist. He is devoted to his friends and other important values, and he will not give them away, no matter what price he offers for it, so he can see that he does not care about the property as much as he claims.\n\nIt has rigid moral principles, but of course within reason, that's why it is neither too arbitrary nor conservative, and can be moderate in everything.\n\n......\n\nJohn Dillinger robbed 24 banks ... he was not caught\n\nhe fell through treason\n\nhe was wearing a bulletproof vest but was shot from the back\n\nhe was the first to cross state borders and was captured by the FBI\n\neven as the first he underwent plastic surgery and went freely to the cinema !!!\n\nhe planned a trip to South America ... it ran out of days\n\nSo, is SE and Ti better than NE?

6	Are ISTP Women promiscuous?	Couldnt find an answer for Female ISTPs. Is promiscuity even part of a personality trait or is it more a social and cultural thing?
21	I could definitely see us having a propensity for being promiscuous. I can separate sex from emotions pretty easily, but I MUCH prefer sex with someone I care about and who cares about me.\n\nAlso the payoff from casual sex just seems pretty low. It would be very easy to go out and get it, but I'd imagine it just feels kinda gross after.\n
16	Lol I barely gotta ever want to even tell people my name... let alone fuck em. 
8	Pssht. I don't want any emotional complications.. let alone from MULTIPLE people. It's not part of the personality. More power to you if you are, but seems like a waste of time and energy.
7	I’m not. I went through a period where I could have it anytime. But it’s a waste of time and it did make me feel empty. 
8	[deleted]
2	i wouldn’t say so, it’s rare that i find myself actually attracted to someone and it usually takes a decent amount of time. however, since it’s hard for me to actually be attracted to people, i do find that i tend to talk to multiple people at once. but when i start getting bored or when talking to them seems like a chore, i usually will either ghost (ignore their messages) or slowly fade out of their lives, and then move onto the next.
2	Yeah, I’m quite promiscuous.\n\nI love sex, and being single definitely doesn’t stop me from having it, but I do go in phases.\n\nWhen I’m dating I tend not to know whether I’m attracted to someone until the sexual stuff starts, and if I’m just looking for casual sex then generally I can separate emotion. If there’s any emotion to separate, that is.\n\nAlso, if I’m really putting energy into trying to find someone to be with, I’m definitely dating multiple guys.
1	No
1	I could be
1	OP define what you determine to be promiscuous behavior, please. \n\nIf you’re Amish, I’m probably promiscuous to you. If you’re a porn star, I’m an angel. \n\nSo you define it per your definition and I can answer honestly. 
-1	Hmmm. Well, promiscuity is not exactly personality based. Even though sexual desires don’t exactly match up to personalities, there are some overlapping details to analyze. \n\n\nWhat type of people are promiscuous? Extroverted people who generally tend to be more open and trusting. Promiscuous people have to let down mental and physical walls to be promiscuous. You have to open yourself up and be vulnerable with strangers or people you hardly know. \n\n\nNow let’s look at ISTP’s. ISTP’s are introverts by nature. So they will already be less likely to be in a scene that fosters promiscuous behavior. And even if they are, the odds of them walking up to a stranger to start a convo they hope leads to sex is slim. We don’t generally approach strangers or open up. Now, even if we *did* approach these people, the odds of us being able to immediately let down our mental and physical walls in the name of intimacy are slim. \n\n\nSo even though MBTI doesn’t dictate what someone’s sexual preference is, the personality traits commonly found in ISTP’s wouldn’t be likely to pair up with the personality trains commonly found in the promiscuous. \n\n\nWhat I’ve found is that most ISTPs prefer to create some level of a relationship before hopping in bed. And I don’t mean dating necessarily, but they’re generally looking for *some* kind of connection. Chemistry, bonding on common grounds, sharing hobbies, having similar life experiences, etc. 
37	[Rant] I went to a party and did an Irish Exit	I went to a party and hung around for an hour or two.  Chatted with people.  Did my best to make good conversation, etc. Eventually it reached the point where nobody was approaching me to talk and I didn't feel a great compulsion to work the room, so I left without telling anyone.\n\nToday, I got this message:\n> You snuck out pretty early Friday - and I had to deal with a drunk ------ who was very upset he didn't get to say goodbye. It was very awkward..........for future please always say goodbye to him, apparently he does have feelings\n\nSo I'm being guilted for the way someone else reacted while drunk.\n\nA reminder of why I tend to stay indoors.  Smh.
15	I see you're getting alot of shade for the Irish Goodbye.  A bit of a history lesson to those folks, the term comes from the early 1930s when alot of Irish immigrants were coming to America.  At that time, in an Irish cultural context,  it was considered rude to announce your departure because it could cause a chain reaction of others leaving as well. There are other factors that go into it as well,  but mainly it was considered rude and a little arrogant.  This obviously wasn't the social protocol in America so the Irish were shamed socially for this. But that notion does still live on in some small circles of Americans.  You shouldn't bash someone for wanting to slip out of social situations with out causing a scene.  \nI use the Irish goodbye all the time,  so  I feel your frustration.  :)  
24	I get the sentiment of "I'm done, so I'll just go." \n\nHowever, there is a social protocol that, when followed, makes life easier for all parties involved.  \n\nI'll usually say goodbye to the last person I was talking with.  Then I'll say goodbye and thank you to the host/hostess.  My go-to response for "Aw, you're leaving?!" is that I have to be up early, or I left my chili in the crock pot (I plan these things so that I have a reason to leave the party)\n\n
6	Just reply Yeah ------ sure was hammered sorry I missed them on my way out.
5	I often do that, my friends are used to it, though we call it a French bye in Spain. I do sympathize but jayb151 is right. Just say bye to one or two and then disappear as a cool misterious guy. 
21	It's pretty shitty of this person to ask for special treatment, but Irish goodbyes are also kind of shitty. Always say goodbye to the host bro!
5	I did Irish goodbyes ALL the time, in college, as soon as the anxiety kicked in. \n\nThis guy is weird tho, like relax...
2	You are (presumably) an adult and can run your life however you like.  Some drunk didn't like that you left?  Not your problem.  Host missed your presence?  Maybe that's an issue but it's you said they didn't even know you were there.  I do what you did almost every time, I hate the long goodbyes, awkward pressure to stay "one more drink!" (then get ignored), and the eventual quiet departure anyway.  A big party is not the place for an ISTP to build meaningful relationships anyway.  You do you: everyone else can appreciate you as you are and/or mind their own lives.
2	what about an irish goodbye when you are the host lol
2	Next time, say goodbye to everyone except him. 
2	You need to reply with "sorry, that's not how i roll"\n
3	Don't let anyone tell you ghosting at a party is wrong.  You had a bizarre one-off experience.  I'll text a host (if I know them) after leaving with a THX.  99% of the time no one notices.
1	I’m surprised you’re being called out for that. Honestly not sure why it’s a big deal to anyone.
1	I honestly don’t see what the big deal is. People leave parties and social events early all the time.\n\nHowever, oftentimes when I leave I say bye to a few people and thank the host.\n\nI understand this was a large party and in those situations I usually just leave as many people do. I don’t think you should be guilt tripped about it. You were ready to leave and you left. If so and so had feelings for you then the person should have made an effort to speak to you.
1	That text message sounds very ESFJ  lol
4	Curiosity on Musical Interests	Hello r/istp,\n\nI'm a 22 y/o m ISTP probable. Rather, I have taken a great deal of time and had many internal discussions as to whether or not I am one.\n\nToday I come to ask about music. It is one of my favorite things and so - I am curious about the degrees of interest, tastes and other musical preferences for ISTPs.\n\nAnything you'd like to share is fine. This is intended to be open ended, though I am providing concrete questions to get the ball rolling.\n\n- Do you prefer words, instrumental, does it matter?\n- What types of lyrics do you like or not like?\n- What sorts of genres do you prefer? Can't stand?\n\n___\n\nAs for me, I feel it is difficult to accurately describe what my favorite kind of music is. My tastes are broad, as I listen to anything from downtempo to djent, hip hop or indie. It depends on the day and my mood - yes, I know this is true for everyone.\n\nI don't require lyrics. However, I can get carried away listening to passionate or deeply emotional lyrics. Multiple friends have asked why I listen to depressing music. (Steven Wilson, Opeth, etc)\n\nDuring the primary part of my youth, I'd often listen to "emotionally charged" music with intense lyrics. This includes metalcore and various types including screaming. I've begun to fall off of that bandwagon as I've matured.\n\nNow, I can't stand vapid lyrics. It seems utterly pointless - see drug abuse and objectification of women for example, even though I like drugs and women as much as the next guy. I also don't appreciate extremely repetitive music (esp. of choruses), though I do like various types of electronic music. \n\nSome of my favorite kinds of sounds:\n- Envelop the listening space (see ambient, shoegaze, "wall of sound").\n- Has a good message or lesson.\n- Has a "screw it" vibe (punk, surf rock, etc).\n- If the sound promotes clear thinking. \n\nVarious facts:\n- I listen to music I know I won't like in 10 years.\n- I use music to entertain many different ways of viewing the world, and to expand my own way.\n- I want to get into producing music, though I've had significant trouble kicking my ass into action.\n- I occasionally write poetry down that I'll try to spin into a song with help of a guitarist friend.\n- I rarely listen to the radio. I can listen to "my music" over and over, but can't stand hearing the same song twice if it's on the radio.\n- Something I've noticed between my ISTJ (Si dom) friend and I - he will go into great depth learning about a single artist (Pink Floyd for ex) whereas I will better enjoy exploring the genre (that artist exists in) as a whole.\n\ntldr; If you didn't bother reading the first section, don't bother replying.

2	I vastly prefer instrumentals.\n\nI have been searching for Electronics of whatever flavor, but everyone always dumps these absolutely idiotic voice samples in it, and ruins the whole song. I just checked Crystal Method, and it sounds like something I might like, except a minute in, some dumbass voiceover. Delete. Delete...I deleted every song I checked.\n\nFor regular songs, I don't prefer any type of lyrics. I've listened to the same songs for 30-odd years, no idea what the words are. I know the chorus, sure, but that's pretty much it. I know the words to a bunch of old Metallica songs, because I play them on guitar frequently, so I'm paying more attention to them.\n\nI prefer 60/70's rock, 80's metal (and today's metal if relatively 80's style, like Devildriver), the whole Floyd/Zep/Dead/Allman bros type of songs, and very, very little rap. I *despise* country and whatever bullshit Kanya makes is called. I've started getting into bands that are in the same circle as White Stripes, Muse, and I don't remember the other names. I have little experience with other genres, and remain open to them.
1	I mainly listen to pop now, but at other times I've listened to a lot of hip hop and rock. I tend to find an artist I love, usually one that's not mainstream, and listen to all their music almost exclusively for weeks at a time.\n\nLyrics don't matter to me (my hearing is a bit below average and one thing I'm terrible at is picking human voices out from background noises, so obviously that makes lyrics hard to understand too) but vocalists do, and I have a strong preference for female vocalists. There are rare exceptions (I like twenty one pilots, for example).\n\nSometimes I'll listen to classical, but not often. There's a handful of symphonies I really like (by Beethoven and Dvorak mainly) and when I'm in the mood, I'll listen to them over and over, trying to focus on a particular instrument and the sounds it is contributing each time. Don't really like any other instrumental music like electronica or jazz or etc.
1	* No real preference for instrumental or not. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Depends on genre. For rap, I need to have great flow, technique or a great story telling; preferably both. For metal, I tend to gravitate to emotional stuff more, but that is just a slight gravitation.\n \n&nbsp;\n\n* I prefer old school & old school like rap; thrash, melodic power, speed, heavy metal. Also I like glitch hop, trap, drum & bass, hardstyle, hardbass, eurobeat. This list is for my preferences, but I do listen to stuff other than these if I like them. I tend to gravitate away from pop music, I just don't like it too much. If I have to listen like in a car & can't control the music, but other than that my liking threshold is higher for pop music.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI do have broad taste too. I listen to new music that I liked to death, then I replace the new music, and so on. I do return back to them, but it is mostly decided by the randomizer algorithm of my music app.  \n\n\n
1	i have no preference as to words or instrumental.\n\nno preference on lyrics, but raps with every other word is fuck or its about gang banging (shootings), drugs... tends to wear on me faster than other songs.\n\nI listen to mainly classic rock (like led zeppelin, ac/dc, van halen, dire straits, metallica...). I dont often listen to pop or rap or hip hop, but i do like some songs in that genre. There are some artists I cant stand, but not the genre as a whole.
1	I listen to everything. Speed/Thrash Metal, jazz, rap, country, classical, reggae, rock, classic, bluegrass...some electronic music...\n\nI generally don’t like a lot of indie/shoegazer stuff...I just think a lot of them can’t really play all that well but take themselves way too seriously. \n\nNot a fan of massively long intros...let’s get\nto it...again, it reads as pretentious to me. \n\nLyrics or no lyrics don’t matter so long as the music is interesting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
9	ISTP vs INTP?	There are quite a few people in the border, so\n\nIstp function stack\nTi Se Ni Fe\n\nIntp function stack\nTi Ne Si Fe\n\nWhat would the differences between them be? \n
9	The thing that differentiates ISTPs from INTPs is the Se/Ni vs Ne/Si which is displayed by how they interact with the world.\n\nI like to think of it this way; When an ISTP or INTP tries to solve a problem do they:\n\n|ISTP|INTP|\n|:-|:-|\n|Gather data, then determine the best idea from that data. (Se into Ni)|Gather ideas, then determine the best possibility from experience (Ne into Si)|\n\nThat being said, an immature ISTP, or INTP may forego this; if they come up with a solution that greatly stimulates their Se or Ne.\n\nNow of course there's the issue of people who are well balanced with their Se/Ni or Ne/Si who may claim themselves as an IXTP. I'm not an expert in MBTI, but I'd like to think that these people can experience a "micro-loop", where a person who is well rounded can fixate on their tertiary function temporarily if they can't utilize their secondary function at the current moment.\n\nFor Example: \n\n|ISTP|INTP|\n|:-|:-|\n|Fixate on a few ideas from Ni until they can collect more data from their Se to determine the best idea|Fixates on a few experiences in the past until they can generate more ideas that would work better than the solutions they implemented in the past|\n|This makes the ISTP look like an INTP due to the fact that the ISTP is seemingly spouting out ideas, even though they are just extrapolating off what little data they have|This makes the INTP look like an ISTP due to the fact that they seem to be offering solutions that are practical, since they can back it up with action. Even though at the moment the INTP hasn't thought up of any new ideas that would fit the situation better|
7	*Se is cognitively static-imediate (it stays and focuses on one single pereption at a time) and objective (doesn't take in consideration previous experiences) . \n*Ni is essential-universal (goes to universal patterns) and subjective and favorising towards possibilities (choses one "possibility-path" over the other ones).\n*Ne is objective towards possibilities (doesn't favorise anyone) and extensing\n*Si is cumulative (so subjective)\n*SeNi tends toward being generally intensive\n*NeSi tends toward being generally extensive
5	Well now I'm even more confused from reading these, I guarentee I'm a 50/50 split.
2	I have a lot in common with both personally. I settled on ISTP cause I seem to have more in common with them and I'm selective about theory and whatnot. INTPs tend to be really interested in hard sciences and whatnot and finding meaning in every little thing. An INTP will watch something and theorize based on like one line of dialogue or some vague action. When they do that I get frustrated and just think they're crazy. I notice that on the Big 5 personality thingy the ISTPs will usually score somewhere between 30-70 on openness and the INTPs will usually score in the 90-100 range.
18	How do you guys get along with extremely extraverted people?	Pretty much everyone at my workplace is very extroverted and loves drama, emotions, complicated stories, etc. I’m an ISTP (F) — not great at expressing my feelings, very private about myself, tired out by small talks, have a simple life that I don’t have much to share about. I sometimes feel socially inept when I interact with them — they constantly want to know how everything’s going, how I feel about things, what plans do I have (I’m bad at long term planning too...) and I feel drained after socializing like that. Worse though it makes me feel like some awkward loser, since they all make great conversations among themselves whereas I run out of stuff to say after a few sentences.\nAny recommendations to overcome this?
33	Own it. I told people after one of my last vacations that "I didn't talk to anyone for 10 days, it was great". Extroverts don't relate to that, but I think they can respect it. The noble hermit or whatever. They think it's cool and exotic.
22	It helps to carry the conversation so you are the one asking questions. Extroverted people love talking about themselves.
7	It's easy as they do pretty much all the work! Listen to what they say, ask a question from time to time and let them talk :)
6	I just exist on the edge of the group, forgotten about until I make a witty comment.   I'm kinda viewed as jerk by some circles now, but that's fine, they get over it when they need my help 
3	My newish roommate is SUPER extroverted. She's also a high school teacher, but has seemingly endless social energy. She's an ExFJ. \n\nAt first I thought it would be overwhelming living with her, but I really like it! I am usually pretty private, but I've been very open with her. It's like free therapy basically. \n\nI don't think I would have the same relationship with a coworker though. I'd be worried about someone airing my dirty laundry around the office. Luckily all my coworkers are guys, low drama, and we all get along great.
5	Want the truth? Do it more. You'll just be better at coping and tolerating. \n\nAlternatively, become more interesting.\n\nPeople naturally want to talk about themselves. Its amazing the amount of very personal information if you just ask. Ask them questions.\n\nUltimately, square peg, round hole. 
2	You’ll get used to it. I bet you need that kind of dose when you’re in the mood for it. It’s a learning experience. However, I suggest you must be upfront when you don’t feel like socialising. Just be honest. 
2	I’m not extremely introverted but extremely introverted and extroverted people can be annoying to me. \n\nExtremely introverted- hey can I get some feedback? Pulling teeth here...God you’re boring...\n\nExtremely extroverted- it’s time to stop talking please...read the signs that I am not actively listening. I’m eating and scanning my phone, don’t care about what you had for breakfast. \n\nBasically, I don’t like socially stupid people and intro and extro can both be. 
1	I had to go to work for myself. Life is much better.\n\nI don’t do drama. Extroverts hate that.
1	Go out to lunch/happy hour or whatever with everyone else occasionally.  Some of that other stuff is nobody's damn business so either make up your work version of things or give a really short answer and flip the question.  Then when you run out things to say just say I gotta get back to work on XYZ catch you later.
1	I let them do the talking
2	What are some good recommendations that would appeal to our extraverted sensing function?	Just read the wtf years in the wiki and can completely relate to it. I'm in a stage of my life where I'm trying to overload my brain with information and want to break out of this loop. So I would love to hear some fucking great ideas from you guys.
3	From what I understand just anything at all that gets you out of your head.\n\nAnything
3	It’s always my emotionally charged / party-loving friends that would easily get me out of my ouroboros way of life. 
2	Estp here , in early 20s going through wtf years for a couple of years. Se is completely blocked and more attention is naturally given to functions like Ti and Fi along with Si/Ni.  Being more in my mind and less tuned to my environment.\n\n\nI think it's unavoidable and can only get out of this naturally after a couple of years\n
2	1. Find yourself a project, doesn't have to be physical, but it should require skill and practice(painting, skating, running, dancing, photoshop, blacksmithing, who gives a shit), If it turns out that shit isn't working or is getting boring, give it a little longer and then find something else if it wasn't just that you found it hard. Karls hot tip is improving yourself and your life. That way you are you know, improving yourself.\n\n2. Socialize: It seems counterintuitive for us, but honestly, we need people. We all do. And the only way to find a bunch of good ones to talk to, is to start meeting people. Karls guide to socializing: 1. Talk to a lot of people, if they dont have interesting opinions and hobbies move on. 2. Take the lead socially. That doesn't mean you need to be a pro, just make sure you're the one calling people and making plans. once or twice a week is good. 3. We do really good with social events that include activities. Thats why most of us complain about parties, because they dont. Buy a football and some board games, and you can make sure you arent reliant on your ability to make conversation.\n\n3. Use them for what their worth: We are really great at a lot of things, and really bad at a bunch of others. And I believe a lot of the wtf years is because we lock our feelings down and spend our time analyzing our feelings or problems etc instead of doing something about them. THERE ARE SOOOOOOOOOO MANY PEOPLE out there that are waaaaaay better than us at doing those things, so make sure when someone ask how you are doing you tell them. Failed an exam, let everyone know. Broke up with your SO let everyone know. And in my experience 1. it becomes way way easier to deal with on your own, because you are getting it out, and it doesnt eat you up and 2. Competent people will chime in and add to the database you have to work with. We solve our own problems, the benefit of other people is that they can contribute to our understanding of the problem and the sollution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: \n\n1. Make sure you always got a project in the works\n\n2. Socialize, any kind of activity makes it a lot easier, and be the one that calls everyone\n\n3. Use the people in your life as a way to gain more knowlegde and second opinions on everything going on.
17	What do ISTPs do for fun?	
52	Well fuck me for enjoying bowling apparently 🤷‍♂️
31	Escape rooms are fun
21	Our "fun" activities require no one but ourselves. But we do like competition and going out to do stuff on occasion. Best to pick something you like and see if they are willing to go along for the ride.\n\n\n\nYou: Going to play Laser Tag Saturday, wanna join? \n\n\n\nISTP: Sounds dope, I'm in.\n\n\n\nLasertag is a hoot and a half by the way. \n\n 
42	God these emojis are triggering me.
11	Also, sex is fun.. 
7	Video games
24	You talk too much
5	Sounds like he's not picky (as long as it's not bowling). Just pick a few things you would like to do and ask which one he prefers. Win win.
4	it used to be video games, but now I am escaping my WTF years and dating and personal development are infinitely more fulfilling and entertaining.
5	Go karts. Arcades. A coin flip will be fine between them. Just pica a great place to go for great entertainment.
3	god the blue texts are super cringey. \n
3	Weird! I'm ISTP girl and I like bowling like every week I want my ENFP bestie to bowling but she always said ”another day” 
2	Hah, my ISTP boyfriend also hates bowling and making decisions on what we do. Just take him at his word and choose anything but bowling. 
1	[deleted]
1	Bowling is fun, it's just that someone in that thread isn't very good at it.
1	Geocaching!!!
1	Trolling, debating, martial arts, video games, Netflix, skateboarding, going for walks/runs, sports in general, I listen to a ton of music, whack off
17	Despite the r/JustLearnedTheFWord humor, I think website is really relatable for me as an ISTP.

2	>"Good design is as little design as possible."\n- some German motherfucker\n\nLol
14	Do you have insecurities that relate to Fe function?	Sometimes I do not know what other people are feelings towards me unless they're blunt about it. This has bruised few friendships and family relations. 
16	Lol I think the problem would be to always negatively orient the Fe assuming that people think bad about us and hate us always. Along with Ni I think it's one dimensional for estps should be something similar for istps also I think. \n\nIt's a default assumption that everyone's is against me. This is due to the fact that we value and have Ti over Fe. So it's like"  everyone out there only to get me syndrome "
6	It sucks but here's the rub; A lack of Fe is a lack of interest in people. We care, we're not assholes, but none of us are interested in people, lets be honest. When we're thinking most of the time its about our interests or on fun things. Unless one of those things involves a close person, or the interest is people related, like psychology or something, we're not usually thinking about people. and if you're not thinking about people and paying attention to them you're blinding yourself to how THEY are feeling and what they're doing and how THEY feel. \n\nwe can see what the problem is because we're not thinking about them, we're thinking about US. what are WE doing wrong how come they wont talk to ME, how can I improve, why dont /I/ understand them, what did /i/ do-- \n\nIf you're not a public menace and you bathe regularly the problem most likely isn't what you DID do, it's what you didn't. aka, thinking about others, paying attention to them, studying them, and listening and trying to read into their actions, words, tones, body language. \n\nfor us its not fun and it doesnt come naturally because we dont even think to do it but its something you have to do anyway, and practice until it becomes second nature. most people dont have to because thinking about people already IS second nature, @infj's for instance. Hell even @ESTP seem to have an almost natural grasp with it that we dont, and its because they do; enough that they dont need to try. but we do, so shut up and do it. work on it. you can get better. \n\nbest advice is to self examine with an objective lens and ask for help (from others). look at yourself and write down what you did do and ask, outloud, "was this bad? offensive? not normal?" try to think of any good reasons it could be deemed as such. now think about someone else doing all the actions you wrote down and ask the same question, and if it turns out it would be weird to see someone else acting like that, you know the problem is yours. but if its not, then have more confidence in the actions you DID take and try to spend more time thinking about actions you dont and thinking about other people and observing them and paying attention. \n\nand remember that it is possible to overexamine issues that arent there. just because you're not on the same frequency with someone at any given time doesnt mean they hate you. they might just bored or having a bad day or not feel like talking. you two just might not \*get\* each other, but a lack of friendship doesnt necessarily mean dislike. sometimes people just dont wanna talk, ect. \n\nthe better i get with people the more i find myself trusting gut instincts with them, and it sucks haha. like it feels weird and unnatural and unreliable to go about socializing without like, solid evidence of interest from another, or ques that im used to receiving, but not everyone initiates relationships like that or gives cues like the ones im comfortable with, aka literal ones. but it works, and it helps, so its worth cultivating. \n\nother things that helped me were honing blunt communication but being mindful of more passive communication too; Acting and drama classes. \n\nTLDR; Listening. 
2	Yes. I can be very sensitive to criticism, take it very personally, and/or over analyze it to the extreme trying to make logical sense of it.\n\nI think because we lead with Ti, if the criticism doesn't make logical sense, it's hard for us to understand. And because we don't have Fi, we have trouble realizing that other people can have different opinions about us and that's okay.\n\nAlso, not sure if this is more related to being an enneagram 9, but I am very sensitive to changes in body language or ambiguous comments that are usually innocuous. \n\nEdit: this relates basically only to personal relationships. I don’t mind constructive criticism.
1	I’ve never, ever once in my life thought x person feels x way about me.\n\nHow in the name of crap I’m supposed to know that absolutely blows my mind.
17	How many tabs in your internet browser right now ?	
22	Only 5, but that's cause I'm not watching porn.
16	The real questions is how many have been open for days because you think you'll be willing to burn the calories some day to actually read it?
8	105 
4	1 currently. Never more than 6.
5	0
5	279 on my mobile lmfao
4	20
4	38...i have a problem
3	42 on my phone. Probably more on my laptop lol 😝
4	Mobile reddit is the best
2	At work, so 17.\n\nAt home, depends on what I'm currently doing. Coding, maybe 3-5. Researching a product, 5-10.\n\nFor me, it's how many folders do I have in my bookmarks. I create a folder for each project and dump all my research tabs in there, so I can go back to them. For instance, I wanted to buy a new guitar speaker cabinet, so I had 20 or so tabs of speaker types, cab types, materials used, urls to Sweetwater and Reverb and Amazon for the various products. Just bought the one I decided on, deleted the whole folder. Easiest way to go.
2	Six, and every one of them has a definite purpose. 
2	8, lower than usual
2	2 - Hulu and this post. \n\nI have 29 pinned tabs, though (Safari). \n\n
2	64
2	35... + another 6 on my phone. Is this an ISTP thing?
1	6
1	None I'm playing gmod and lookin at reddit while loading a server
1	Mobile right now, so :P\n\nIf on computer, usually around 1-5, unless I’m writing a paper then it’s like 40.
1	3. My webclient for work, and two tabs up related to some car research. I think I had like 8 earlier, 7 all being Car stuff lol. \n\n\nI really only open new tabs when I’m actually hopping around on all of them. Like if I’m reading something on whatever Car, and find a link I need to open, I’ll open it in a new tab because I’m not done with the current page. As I get 100% done looking at any given page, I close out the tab. 
1	4 and only because you made me click this link
1	Let's see... youtube, buzzfeed, BBC, google images 'cause I need a reference pic for art project, tv tropes, several reddit tabs... I'd say about ten.  
1	Now on mobile there are 63. \nAnother 30 on workstation at home. \nMaybe 40 to 50 at work. \n\nIt's gotten to the point that I use a chrome extension to organize manage my tabs. 
1	Over 40 and counting.  Computer  gets slow. Chrome gets stuck. Close Chrome. Reopen and press ctrl+shift+t.  Repeat as necessary 
1	28, That's a pretty low amount for me.
1	10 on my left monitor, 14 on my right
24	Did you/Do you have a lot of people that believe in you?	I’ve never really had a real reason for people to believe in me but they’ve  always have. I was average to below average in high school in terms of grades, yet all of my friends thought I’d be the one to make it. In college, in financial success, anything really. And I didn’t... I actually happened to fail out of college... and in the past 3 years while going through the WTF years they still thought I’d make it through even without knowing fully what I wanted in life. And now in my vocational school people think I can go as far as I want... and I believe it too now. \n\nDid this happen for you guys as well? It’s interesting that they see all this in me. 
23	Same here. People tend to put me on a pedestal and praise me for things I do that I think are average or unimportant. I remember being told by adults how much of a great leader I would make or how mature I was(this was 6th grade btw). Like you said, there are people who are more successful than I am, yet people put their faith in me. \n\nI think because we only take action when we think there will be a good chance of success, we are seen as extremely capable, confident, and practical.
11	I can't tell if anybody believes in me.  Don't see any churches, though.
9	People say I'm smart. Basically every adult and most of my peers that I have ever met and had a decent conversation with has deemed me "smart." Of course, they're then surprised to hear about my 2.1 cumulative GPA. I would consider myself to be well supported, being on good terms with all my family members (up to first cousins. I've never met anyone beyond that level of being first cousins, so all the family that I can confirm to exist I am on good terms with). 
7	Your trajectory mirrors mine including vocational school which was the best decision I made.  (Stick with it even when it gets boring, it will be worth it.).  I think people see our ability to quickly comprehend a type of intelligence that’s rare. It’s a strange thing about us that isn’t really measured anywhere and doesn’t translate to traditional education success.
10	I've always felt like people see my strengths better than I do.
5	Yeah they think I'm a genius or something, I have no idea why.
3	I’ve rarely cared what people think about me.
3	I have had so many people believing in me to the point that it becomes a burden of expectation to shrug off.  They seemed to expect the world from me.  So maybe I didn’t become famous or wealthy, but i do have presence.  I’ve engineered my life.  And I’ve racked up a list of achievements and contributions to the world, so there’s an almost satisfied sigh at the end of my day,  i’ve noticed that when I speak, people stop to listen more than maybe others.  
3	Most people just think you're\n an unfulfilled genius. It's easy to leverage 🙂🤨😓
1	I think I am more often underestimated. I don't know because I don't really talk to anyone, especially not about what they think of me.
1	I had and still have people believe in me, while I don't believe in myself as much as they believe in me. I don't know why. I'm said that I'm smart, but my past tells me otherwise. 76 average out of 100 for high school, granted it is at the tier of second best school nation-wide, it is possible to get 90+.  I was around 250 out of 300 for placement. \n\nCollege placemnt exams, my place was 40k in 1.8 million for my selected path, best was 4096^th in 1.8 million, for foreign language path.\n\n I have 1.3 cumulative GPA, 2 years longer to finish than it should've been, unlike high school, my college is mid tier. I bombed my summer school Differential Equations final exam, I have the risk of failing again. \n\nIf there is something I'm good at, it is bringing disappointment. But people fail to see that, put me on pedestal, try to "fix" my unorthodox ideas. I blame my childhood for it. I learnt reading when I was 2, thanks to my mum. I was great at primary school, one of the expected few to shine and go to a great high school. But there comes high school, radical changes in my beliefs about myself and religious stuff coupled with my average performance. College, just bad. Started failing courses from second semester and kept going at it, had 2 total semester failiures (all of the important courses failed to pass). \n\nPeople fail to see this side of me, or just dismiss it completely. Saying that I'm destined to be great, just put your soul into it and you will succeed. But it is hard when you are fighting your own demons for 6 years, coming back from the brink of suicide for many times, it is tiring enough by itself. Couple this with all of the peer pressure, college work & expectaitons; it is easy to see why I'm a mess like this. To end this long & rant filled reply with a line from KONGOS describing most of my social outings:\n\nI think with my heart and I move with my head\n\nI open my mouth and it's something I've read\n\nI stood at this door before, I'm told\n\nBut a part of me knows that I'm growing too old\n\nConfused what I thought with something I felt\n\nConfuse what I feel with something that's real\n\nI tried to sell my soul last night\n\nFunny, he wouldn't even take a bite\n
1	I never really tried in school, but my chemistry professor saw something in me and just kept pushing me. He was extremely disappointed whenever I got lower than 75% on a test, expecting me to always be only a few marks short of perfect, though he was happy when my classmates reached 40-50.\n\nI failed geography, Chinese, japonese and music really badly. Classmates and teachers always thought me really smart despite this. Though, those were subjects I didn't care about/hated the teacher. I spoke Spanish to my Japanese oral test just cause I was so done with it all, and taught myself guitar and harmonica after dropping music since my teacher gave up on me from day one since I couldn't play piano right off the bat.\n\nIn general, my friends tend to think I have lots of potential and told me that they love when I put effort/my mind into something, since it's inspiring how much progress I can make on a particular skill in short periods of time in which I practice.\n\nBut yeah, people tend to really believe in me. 
1	Hell yeah. WTF years are funky. I am glad those years are over. Teachers and mentors always said I could succeed in anything I put my mind to. It’s true, but I didn’t believe them and didn’t see what they saw in me: dedication, persistence, hard working, thoughtful, caring, smart, etc.\n\nSomething I struggled with when I wanted to pick up a hobby: sticking to it. I never had the patience, interest, or motivation to keep a routine or hobby after a few weeks.\n\nYou can do anything you set your heart to. Just remember, it takes a lot of patience to be successful. Don’t get disappointed with your current passion because you’re not successful in it after a certain period of time. Practice makes perfect, and you need to be really patient with the practice and with yourself if you want to succeed in your passion.
1	Yes, i guess it comes from assertiveness, I only open my mouth when i am pretty sure about what I am thinking
1	Or maybe that assumption comes from how we were raised, people nowadays really spoils childreans...
10	ISTP bff clearly has depression. What do I do?	Title basically says all, but here are some more details: We don't see each other much, but each time her "condition" deteriorates. She lives with her family and they seems unsupportive, and in typical ISTP fashion she barely complains - letting all her thoughts and worries fester. Worries center around:\n\n- not knowing what to do with life\n\n- not having enough money\n\n- wanting to move out but not be being able to \n\n- being too bored and uninterested in anything that can bring money \n\nQuarter life crisis basically. I try to be upbeat when we hang out and maybe distract her for a bit. I also avoid getting her to "open up" or anything like that, but I think it's obvious to her that I wouldn't be bothered by that. Is there anything else I can I do? I'd offer advice but I'm also in a similar life situation.
8	Just tell her that if she needs help or needs someone to talk to, you'll be there for her.\n\nI don't want people bothering me or asking too much, but knowing that I have support if I need to means a lot to me.\n\nLet her know that and just let her do her own thing.
7	Make it known that you will help. If she wants your help she will ask for it. Otherwise, we’d appreciate it if you tended to your own business.\n\n-every istp ever
1	It's time to let go most of the external things, just live as minimal as she can.\n\nthen she might realise a simple job, earning not much but enough money for living, even enough for renting a small room for independence, keep herself away from the stuck situation is just enough.\n\neasier said than done, though
1	Focus on your own life and improving your own situation. Since you're in a similar situation as her you can't really help in any practical sense. And she probably knows it, too. Hanging out with you as of now doesn't give her any incentive to change.
1	As an ISTP who has struggled with depression and had suicidal thoughts, I think you're dealing with a worst case scenario. You're job is getting them to a professional.
1	To avoid ti-ni loop into a spiral, make sure to stimulate her se by hanging out with them a lot and making sure they're appreciated.
1	OP are you my friend\n\nSend her dumb stuff, distract her with humour, don't be overbearing (I have friends who text/call me too often and now I've taken to avoiding them), don't be too mushy, and let her know that you have her back. Don't judge. Don't dictate. I've had overwhelmingly opinionated friends who were very involved in my life and tried to make my decisions for me, and I ended up ditching them because they made me anxious.

5	I need advice for an ESTP in his 20s (r/ESTP is ded)	Hello ISTP! I'm the ESTP and ye I need some advice I'm a bit stuck.\n\nI'm in my 20s and I'm struggling academically. I'm not sure whether I'm going to get a job or not with no degree and if I'm going to struggle paying rent every month, regretting my life decisions, etc etc.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. \n\nFor a couple of things\n\n1. college bores me\n2. barely any of the shit i learn is applicable IRL\n3. I can learn a lot of the industry by myself online (programming) for free\n\nwith parents and peer pressure it's sucking my soul and I just want to be alone. I don't know what I want to do with my life and where it's heading. I don't wanna end up poor and homeless and I don't want to end up saving every small penny to pay rent. Gosh it sounds sooo miserable.\n\nAny advice on how to clear my head and set my priorities straight?\n\nThanks guys
3	r/ESTP has 1.5k subscribers, most recent post was a mere 7 hours ago as of 9:38 PM PST, 8/14/18. Clearly the sub is dead. \n\nNon-college graduates earn 1 million on average throughout their working lifetimes. College graduates earn double that. That is, 2 million on average. You say that you are going into the software field, so I assume you are majoring in something software related. The software field is big right now, and will net you a decent salary, and quite possibly above average. I think you should just grit your teeth and get through college with at least a bachelor's degree with a decent grade, and you should have no problems  in life if you can find a job in your major. As for how to set your priorities, I don't know. I myself am in my WTF years, and also have trouble with that, so I am ill suited to give you advice in that particular aspect. Hope this helps.

2	Yo, I'm currently in Uni doing something akin to this and honestly, you need to go welp all of this is bullshit but the degree is gold. Do what you have to to make it through, and make sure you learn the stuff that matters. Also I wrote a rather long guide to the wtf years a couple of posts ago, linked here. Sounds like you're in a wtf years period as well: r/https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/98rvvf/what_are_some_good_recommendations_that_would/e4wyg0j/?context=3
1	I say finish your degree. If you really don't want to, then you have to be absolutely good at it to stand out
1	My undergrad is creative writing. Never used my degree at all for employment. Quit MBA after 3 months. I’m a data analyst now. Any advice can be sound, but you’ll never know what’s golden down the road. 
1	If you're no more interested in your degree, ditch it. Be sure to have a backup plan, though. It's better to be happy without a degree and with a simpler job that makes you happy than waste your time learning crap you won't even apply in your life.If you don't feel like studying anymore, try to find a job.
56	Anyone else go between feeling like they have no real connection with people to feeling like you wish everyone would go away?	Yesterday evening I couldn’t wait for everyone to shut up. And by everyone I mainly mean by best mate who’s ENFP. \n\nTonight I’m staring at my phone thinking about how I don’t seem to be able to find a real connection with anyone new that walks in to my life. \n\nI mean, it makes sense. But... What’s the middle ground and how do I get there?
28	Years ago I read or heard someone say that extroverts have a tendency of "adopting" introverts. We don't usually go out of our way to make friends, but we can be very good friends.  That's been my experience, though I didn't realize what was happening.  At some point an extrovert engages me in conversation, then I have a friend for life.
15	Make a slight effort to keep in touch with current friends or new ones. I actually have to remind myself to text people.\n\nI also think we're highly selective about who we want to be friends with. I'd say 9/10 people I meet I don't feel any need to talk to them again. 
15	I often go through short phases where the people I am comfortable with are still really annoying.\n\nI try to just be nice to new people I meet. I think it helps to accept that you won't connect with most people at a deep level. There is a whole group of people who I am friendly with (usually co-workers) and we really only get along when talking about certain subjects. 
14	You'll get too much in your head if you keep thinking things. Seriously.\n\nGet out of your head. Go do something. It doesn't matter what it is. Live life. Do things you don't like at least twice. \n\nIt sounds like i was between 23-32. \n\nGo do things. Stop thinking.
11	Hey, I go between feeling like I'm connecting with people to feeling as if there was no connecting to wishing everyone would go away, it's normal.  Still haven't found a good extrovert to be adopted  by, I blame phones and social media and my lack of any real social media presence. 
8	All. The. Time.
9	Almost never, no. \n\nI understand my friends and they understand me. \n\nI connect with new people over hobbies, usually. \n\nAfter too much social engagement, I do need to take a break and recharge and it can feel like I'm different from everyone else, but looking back on it, it's usually that some people demand more energy to be with and when I run out of that, I need to escape.\n\nSolution: spend less time with those people.
5	Maybe you need some alone time? I'm currently avoiding my life long friends too, cause I want to whine about life without their positivity. Also, sometimes they just really don't understand me, but nobody's perfect, and I know they have my back no matter what. \n\nedit: a word
2	Do you feel that connection with your enfp mate? Just curious 
9	Who is important to you and why?	I get the general idea that ISTP's are the "my way or the highway" type of people, particularly in friendships and relationships. Great to have them, but don't necessarily care or both to look for them.\n\nDespite that, do you have people important to you? friends? ex? family? How or what have they done that makes them important and what do you to show that they are important? \n\nIt's connected to my second question about how ISTP will not say what is mutually understood. \n\nIf someone was important to an ISTP and there was an understanding of that, how would that impact types that need that reassurance over a period of time? If there was a period of no contact, wouldn't some people think they are no longer a priority? whereas the ISTP could be on their merry way still thinking this person was important and didn't deem it necessary to bring it up again because it was mutually understood.
12	Your first paragraph is just wildly off. You make us sound like self centered assholes who only like people that submit. “My way or the highway” only applies up until you have a better way. So I guess I can see why you may think that about us. But due to our methodical and logical thought path, it’s very often that we’ve thought a situation through *better* than you. So it’s not “my way or the highway”, it’s “my way until you come up with a better way”. Until we feel like you’ve put enough effort into your idea to fully encapsulate the available details, we’re going to stick with our way. But remember, this is still based on our *perception* of your idea. It’s not actually indicative of the quality of the idea itself. So if you genuinely think yours is better, try to lay it out as completely and logically as possible. Complete ideas and logic tickle our brain boners. \n\n\nAlso, we aren’t that apathetic to friends and people. We arent sociopaths that see friends as a useful tool to benefit us. But we have walls in place. Walls that protect our vulnerabilities, namely emotions. We don’t tend to be the best at handling and managing our own emotions, so we put them behind walls to avoid having them manipulated. Because of this, we don’t make friends as *easily*. And because of our introverted nature, we don’t make friends as *easily*. It’s not that we don’t want or value friends, it’s that protecting what lies behind our walls is more important than making new friends. \n\n\nSo what tends to happen is that we have a small handful of people who are “inside” our walls (albeit to varying degrees depending on the person) and then another several handfuls of “surface” friends. And by that, I mean we just spend time together. Drinking, movies, sports, whatever. They aren’t deep close friends because we never go past the surface. We simply exist in the same place and enjoy our time together. But without a deep rooted bond, it’s easy to let these people go. Wether they just stop trying, or get into risky stuff, or are dating a girl that annoys us, whatever. So i can see why you think what you do about our perception of friends. We simply don’t have the emotional stamina to create and maintain a large group of deep bonds. And, as surface level friends tend to go, there is a revolving door. New friends come and go, but only the core group stays. \n\n\nHonestly, think of it like highschool. You have your 3-5 friends who were your “best friends” all the way through. And then you had your friends in each class. Most of the time, you created a surface level friendship based on similarities in current circumstances. But they always fizzle when that class ends. That’s basically the way ISTP’s live. You have your best friends on the inside and then your “similar circumstance” friends who come and go based on your circumstances. \n\n\nHonestly though, your last paragraph is pretty spot on. I don’t really need to comment on that. \n\n\nBut overall, keep in mind that the vast majority of all of this happens subconsciously. Most of us don’t think all of this out, it’s just the way our brains are conditioned. And that’s why many ISTP’s may not be able to fully answer this for you. For me, analytics is a specialty of mine. I’m quite proficient at absorbing details and organizing it into a useful thought process. And that’s what allows me to break this down for you so much. \n\n\nBut finally, I’ll say that the 2-3 people who make it inside our walls are *incredibly* important to us. We would do anything for them. A lot of that has to do with the fact that it takes us a long time to create that bond. We have to experience a person long enough to be able to comfortably let them in. And once we have that, we hate to lose it. One reason being that having someone who fully understands and accepts us is incredible. The other being that we put so much effort into it, we don’t want to let it go. So once we put in the time and effort of building a long term long lasting relationship, we fight tooth and nail to keep it. I’ve even lost friends over this. If you’re on the outside of my walls and you have a problem with somebody *inside* my walls, buh bye. That will always be a losing battle. There’s 3 people in my life that I would take a bullet for. And short of that bullet, there isn’t anything a third party can do to separate me from them. \n\n\nI hope this helps give you some detailed insight! I know I started off kinda snippy, but that wasn’t my intention. Once I started typing, I realized why you came to the conclusions that you did. So my apologies on that front. 
16	My parents and my dog. Not in the mood to answer the rest of the questions. 
5	I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but I'm often in the habit of "answering the question I want to answer", I'm sure it's an ISTP thing.\n\nAnyway, generally speaking, I tend to think people are good or important by default. Until they give me a reason to lose that impression. That usually happens when someone is dishonest or disingenuous. Lack of integrity, that kind of thing.\n\nThe people who I find most important are the ones who are doing good for the world. People who help people. People who give freely of themselves. Those are the people I will go out of my way to help support in whatever way I can. \n\nEmpty relationships aren't meaningful to me, like holding importance on family just because they're family. Or long standing friends just because I've known them for a while. Those relationships aren't automatically important to me. That is, I have zero problem walking away from a relationship if it starts rubbing me the wrong way. But if it's a person I find important, then I will spend a lot of effort building and maintaining the relationship.
5	Fucking touchy subject for me. I might contradict myself anyway.\n\nNobody is important to me. I actually live alone with two kittens. I Guess you can say my kittens are important? I am still in family chat, and if I hear about anything life threatening (depends) I would drive my ass to see them.\n\nI wouldn’t say they’re important, more like it’s my duty as a family member. \n\nI don’t have friends. lmao
3	my family, close friends, current roommate, and usually boyfriend (when i'm in a relationship - doesn't apply right now).\n\n> ISTP's are the "my way or the highway" type of people, particularly in friendships and relationships. \n\nnot true. we're Fe users - we care about other people's emotions - we can just be awkward at expressing it.\n\n>If there was a period of no contact, wouldn't some people think they are no longer a priority? \n\npossibly. my long term friends understand my communication preferences and we can go a couple months without talking and pick up where we left off. one of my ex's needed a lot of verbal affirmation, which i struggled with, especially because he kept bringing it up which made it feel forced and artificial.
2	My friends are important to me because I can be myself, we understand each other, we complement each other, and we have a fairly long shared history. \n\nI care about my family, but we have less in common. They support me though (eg never tried to keep me home when I decided to move to Europe) and I try to keep them in mind to support them.\n\nNone of my friends are the type that need reassurance.  I was out of the country for three years - I visited, but that's once a year, rather than once a month - and when I came back, it was like no time had passed at all. \n\nWe do play video games together a few times a week now, so there's frequent communication, but I know I could go for months with no communication and our friendship wouldn't suffer for it.\n\nOne of the reasons that I care so much for my friends is that we know how each others' minds work and each others' strengths and weaknesses. We're all engineers (mostly programmers) and have very efficient communication, at least verbally. Mostly. 
1	To answer your first question; yes, people that I consider family and friends are people that I have no problem stepping in front of a bullet for. I value them more than I value myself, that says something. *These people did nothing that made me go "I need to put these people in a special circle." I chose to put them in this circle, because they have shown me that they are high-value people. \n\nAs for the second question, to the person that's a "type" that "needs reassurance" over a "period of time": Nut the fuck up. People are busy, life moves fast. If someone says they find you important/of value, take it for what it is. Someone being a "type" to "need validation over a period of time" is just someone that's insecure about themselves. 
1	ISFP who used to test as ISTP a while ago, and still think I border on ISFP/ISTP. It's not really "my way or the highway", it's "do your own thing, as long as you don't get into my space". There's no real way to do things, it depends on the person. And I won't shove my ways in people's faces, it's just not right to do so.\n\nImportant people, to me, are family, and a few well-picked out people from the "outside world". I'm pretty detached with most people, but if I choose to be attached to someone, I am VERY attached, and would never leave unless they \*\*really\*\* fuck up. (For example, the biggest deal-breaker to me is betrayal. Also, if you insult or degrade me, no matter how much I love you, that love breaks into pieces and I'm no longer feeling any hint of compassion for your ass.) I'm not an emotionally expressive person, I prefer to show my love by actions rather than words. I hate when I'm asked to be demonstrative, which is a problem when I'm with my father's family (he's an ESFJ, and generally on his side there are a lot of Fe-doms and Fe-aux).
5	Anyone here have PS4?	I’d prefer to play with people of my own age range (17) \n\n
7	sorry just turned 20. #oldlady
15	[deleted]
2	Nope, last console I had was Nintendo.
1	What games you play?
1	I do! I’m 19, what games do you play?
13	What are the most helpful sites/pages for ISTP?	Share! 
28	http://www.staggeringbeauty.com/
5	Pues este tiene algunas cosas interesantes.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchandLearn](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchandLearn)

9	Constantly Condemned	I get constantly condemned for reasons that are completely irrational. People who condemn me show similar behavioral patterns. They tend to feel like they are avengers or something for punishing, for reasons that are genuinely not rational at all. I'm not against the authority, I never break the law but shit. They have something against me. Is this common for ISTPs? And how do I fix this? 
17	I think the first step would be to try to understand that no one is really out to get you. As an ISTP, it's been a challenge for me to remember that people around me don't actually have a plan to make my life miserable, they just have different (sometimes irrational) ways of dealing with things. \n \nWhen I feel like I'm about to pop my shield wall, I start counting down from 20, take deep breaths, try to analyze the situation before reacting and think; what are they REALLY upset about? Did I say or do something that will be perceived as rude to a normal person? If so, have I apologized? \n\nOnce you analyze a situation and lay out the problems in front of them, they may even realize how irrational they've been. A slight change like this in your attitude might confuse them, which in my case means the situation has been slightly de-escalated and I can go on about my business.\n\nIt's a long road to learn how to deal with people like that, who are usually insanely emotional. I still don't understand most people but showing that you're trying is a good first step. Compromised so you don't have to deal with conflict! 
14	SJs. I try to stay away from them.
6	Im an estps and generally get that from my dad who is a Te dom and my mom who's an Fe dom. \n\nIt might not be your fault but their traditional way of looking at things maybe. Te and Fe also enforce their reality onto yours for God knows why and are not at all flexible.  This could a reason maybe. Not sure 
4	[deleted]
3	I have similar experiences. I find that is nearly impossible to have a rational discussion with most women and effeminate men. I’m completely lost in a discussion which relies on emotion.\n\nThey respond much as you describe when I try to stick to logic.
5	Am i an istp?	-i don't like fixing things with my hands like the typical istp\n\n-i like problem solving and analyzing but in other ways than with your hands(ex: figuring out stocks)\n\n-i am usually reserved but around people i know/just get a long with i can be outgoing\n\n-my fashion sense is kinda plain but with just enough style imo, not crap\n\n-i work in spurts of energy and usually procrastinate(motivates me)\n\n-i don't really know what i want to do career wise\n\n-i like investments and want to look further into how to make good ones but feel i need to learn with time although im doing pretty good imo\n\n-i do care about people but i don't think im the most caring either\n\n-usually easy going but if you rub me the wrong way i can be cold although if you are someone i know i will give you the benefit of the doubt\n\n-hobbies include sports, fishing, gaming, listening to music, buying stuff(maybe clothes), stocks and investments but i need to get more money haha\n\n-in a way i kind of care what people think but then i dont at the same time. i want to be happy and not have to follow the social "norms" all the time to be accepted while making it harder on myself to basically please others.\n\n-im not usually super organised but tried to make this easier to read lol\n\n\n\n\n\nso what do you guys think i am? i just find it weird that the big stereotype of being a mechanic does not fit me really at all. so im left wondering how that is possible..
7	You're an INTP maybe?
8	When you are up late at night do you try not to disturb anyone, or does that thought not cross your mind? I find myself tip toeing around late at night. I never slam things, even in the day. INTPs are usually pretty noisy and clumsy because they lack awareness of their surroundings.   \n\n\nINTPs usually lack common sense. I had my younger INTP brother stay with me a few weeks and he would leave his clothes on the washroom floor. Leave all his towels hanging on the towel rack so no one else had room for towels. He would interrupt me when I was busy and not take a hint to go away.   \n\n\n ISTPs want to get to the point on something. We do not mind talking about something as long as the conversation is progressive. INTPs will talk about the same thing over and over with different examples.   \n\n\nINTPs are somewhat conventional. They do not mind collecting outside knowledge and putting it in their mental framework(Si). ISTPs will usually seek out lots of knowledge and arrive at their own conclusion(Ni).   \n\n\nFrom my experience, ISTPs are a lot more independent. They don't want someone to tell them, 'this is the best way.' This is why we struggle with know-it-alls. We are definitely a type that has more ability than we believe. Opposed to ESTJs having less ability than they believe. INTPs are more willing to attach themselves to things. They have heroes that they look up to. People they look to for advice. They seem to attach themselves to things more and can put a lot more time into them.   \n\n\nISTPs are visual. Out memories consist of images and videos. We can also visualize the inner workers of something. Visualize the best course of action. The most efficient way of travel.   \n\n\nMy ISFP brother is into mechanics and at first glance seems like an ISTP. I never understoof this hipster shit with ISFPs. My brother dresses pretty casual and enjoys extreme sports. As for me, I have built and repaired many computers. Fixing vehicles has never been my thing. I have met more XSTJ mechanics than XSTP, so the stereotype really confuses me. I think people look at functions and just assume shit.. Like, I am sure most bikers are probably SJs. I could just see an SP losing interest at some point.   \n\n\nI never really tried fixing things till I was in my early twenties. Before that I'd just play video games and chase girls. Go get drunk and camp. Whatever adventure was most appealing at the time.. 
4	Still sounds ISTP-like to me
3	ISTP's are known for adrenaline seeking behavior. Some ride motorcycles, some day trade. Same chemical response. One is physical risk the other financial. I'm an ISTP and prefer financial risk as it is not permanent if something goes wrong. \n\nWhat is your opinion of school? 
1	What enneagram type are you?
1	Did you take a test? It will type you better thsn anyone here.
1	If you think in the moment, you're ISTP. If you're always thinking long-term, you're INTP. The mechanic stereotype may not fit you that well if you're female.
-3	Punctuation makes you look intelligent.
3	Alcohol	Anyone else enjoy alcohol/ being drunk because it makes reality just slightly more challenging thus fun to conquer \n\nAnyone else? 
23	Not challenging, but makes me a little more social and goofy.
10	I like it cuz it makes me shake my butt
8	It makes reality *less* challenging. Social lubrication is no joke.  
7	No
2	Kinda. When I'm drunk I feel like I'm operating a crane when I move
1	Not being drunk but tipsy yes. And then drinking just enough to maintain my buzz.
1	I FUCKING LOVE ALCOHOL! Not because of the challenge, but it just makes everything more fun. Every sensory experience etc. I like going out, but I can just get tipsy at home and sing along to awesome music all day to. Its like it calms all the right processes and amplifies all the right ones.
0	Yes
15	How’s your relationship with your exes?	I have no contact with any of them. Some tried to reconnect with me, but having figured them out, I felt there’s boredom to familiar old flames. 
15	Nonexistent.
11	One is my best friend, another is a texting buddy. Hell, I’m on good terms with all of my exes except the first one. That one cheated on me while I was on deployment and then made my life hell for a year or so, so I don’t feel badly about not keeping in touch.  
6	I don’t regularly talk to any of my exes. But I’ve made up and gotten on good terms with all but two. So now at least things aren’t weird if I run into them. \n\n\nI suppose I do have one ex that I still communicate with occasionally. But we dated back in highschool for a few months. Our friendship makes up 95% of the time we’ve known eachother so it outweighs the few months we tried dating. 
3	Broke off amicably with all of them but I don't feel the need to talk to any of them. \n\nPreserve the fond memories and good moments I spent with them, and move on. 
3	Most of them, not that there's been a lot, I have no contact with at all. But I'd say I'm still friends with one of them. \n\nThough, said friendship is kind of at arms length and somewhat shallow at times. She's one of the only people that's seen a more emotional side of me, and sometimes she helps me kind of interpret thoughts and feelings. 
3	On good terms although not active in communication. On social media with most of them. Wish them well kind of thing. \n\nThe two who cheated on me I have no interest in having them in or around my life. Some people are just too toxic. \n\nI would say I have “good” breakups for the most part. I also am a firm believer that once a relationship is done; it’s done. I don’t eat leftovers. So it’s quite easy to adjust to a different plane of friendship or civility. \n\n\n
2	I do not talk to any of them. My breakups were tough, so I avoided them. There was no reason to reconnect. It sucks sharing time with someone to have to see them in another light. I'd rather just move on. Hopefully learn from the experience, so it isn't wasted time..
2	Haven't talked to one since the breakup, the others I maintained a good friendship with for about half a year then just stopped contacting.
2	I just ignore em
2	I never talk to them and they never talk to me
2	Lol, not sure. Can't remember. Maybe they all live in Texas.
3	Don't hold any grudges or anything. We grew apart, or wasn't matching properly etc. So I don't see any point in keeping in touch with them either. 
2	I’m not in contact with any of them. I ignore their texts/calls and block them on social media. I don’t give them the pleasure of closure. There is only one path, and that path is forwards with new people. There is a reason why they are called your “ex”. I don’t give them the joy to include them in my current life to just remain friends. I litteraly gain nothing from this. It’s a pure waste of time as this will only evoke negative emotions of lust and missing.
1	don't know if anyone ever watched "what i like about you" (the tv series) but there's a character who says "that's why they're called exes...you X them outta your life" \n\nand that's exactly what i do. except the one time i had to get my network provider to step in bc 2 years had passed and my ex was still calling me and leaving me voicemails. 
1	Nonexistent. Not always my fault.
1	Fell out of touch with them. Not being around often leads me to not keep contact (with anyone). Especially when I get a new gf.
1	I don’t talk to any of them 
1	No communication  but not on bad terms. Although it’s my birthday soon so one of them have been commenting on my old Facebook posts so that’s his way of probably hoping to see if I’ll contact him again. I don’t really care about him now though.
1	i’m on good terms with my exes, even the one that got mad after i rejected him after breaking up by cutting up a pineapple (my favorite fruit) and then throwing it into a river. \n\ni’m actually really good friends with one, but i’ve always been the one that initiated break ups, and they were sometimes messy. let’s just say i prefer texting and some would say that makes you a “cold heartless bitch.”
1	I hold no ill will against most of them, and think about most of them from time to time. I generally wish them well, but I'm not going to put effort into contacting them. If they called me I'd probably be happy to talk to them some, and I have no reason to avoid contact more than anyone else.\n\nIf they feel the same way or not, who knows
26	a fellow female istp	this subreddit actually makes me really happy because for the longest time i thought i was socially inept and that i just think like a crazy person. i would consistently try to explain myself to friends, but would consistently fail but this thread honestly makes it easier for not only me to understand myself but for me to explain myself to others. \n\nfor example, i’ve struggled for years to explain my “commitment” issues: i’ve never been in a relationship for long and i lose interest for everyone within a month or so. my friends had a hard time understanding why i was like that and would refer to me as an emotionless robot (a term i now embrace fully) when in reality it’s not that i have any shortage of emotions, it’s just i don’t find it wise to spend it on someone i’m not fully invested in and i just haven’t found someone i’ve been interested long enough to be fully invested in. \n\nand also the fact that i’m a hard worker and extremely driven but only at things i’m passionate about? this was something i found easy to explain considering i’ve been praised for learning things fairly quickly for things i’m interested in (such as politics and economics for example), yet i do poorly at things i don’t care about, such as studying literature yet the tasks themselves aren’t much different since it’s just retaining information and analyzing it.  \n\nbut as i scour this subreddit, the majority seem to be guys? not sure about the actual demographics of ISTP’s, but i have a strong feeling that there are more male ISTP’s than female ISTP’s. \n\n[just realized i had more to say]\n\n
18	Female ISTP here as well. 100% agree with everything you've said. I don't actually have any friends anymore since I don't really feel like putting effort into something that I don't feel is worth my time (applies to hobbies, learning new things, etc as well. Honestly, I'm fine with that. I'd rather not have any friends than have to constantly explain myself. Obviously, I still have to do so at work but on a much lesser scale. \n\nBeing a female ISTP definitely feels harder; we don't really fit with the sociatal norms, but once you accept that, life will be much easier. 
15	Hey I’m a dude but that’s pretty much the story of my dating life. I dipped out of my comfort zone and tried to get serious with girls a couple times and both backfired horrendously. So until a girl who fits *into* my comfort zone stumbles along, I’m perfectly content with being alone. Ive have plenty to do between work, friends, family, and my cars to keep me happy without needing to add something extra. \n\n\nBut yeah I’m also like you with finding this sub. It’s a safe haven for me now. I thought I was a social Retard because no matter how hard I try, I just can’t seem to pick it up. It takes me a while to warm up to people (I’ve always suspected I have abandonment issues but that’s for another time lol) and only when I’m comfortable with them do I actually start actively engaging and seeking out meaningful conversations. \n\n\nSo stumbling my way here has been a godsend. Really gave my entire life a whole new perspective. I could finally explain why I am the way I am. Because I’m just so fucking different from everyone else. And now I’ve embraced myself and who I am. I started growing upon myself instead of trying to change myself. That, paired with a handful of other key variables, have heavily contributed to my climb out of depression. Without this place, I don’t think I’d be this far. MBTI didn’t give me an identity, but it helped me understand the one I had. \n\n\nI’m definitely on the tail end of the WTF years. I owe it to this place for telling me I was *in* the WTF years in the first places and for providing me with tools to help me Work my way out. \n\n\nSorry for the ramble lol. But I’ve been smoking and getting ready for bed and I had a really good day. So I came across something relevant and just went for it haha. 
12	ISTP male here. Used to try to change myself to conform with friends and family until I realized that I was 100% normal and I get to choose how I change. Since I learned about myself I am confident, I am comfortable with myself. 
7	hey lady - fellow istp female here to let you know that you're not the only one lol \n\nmy friends also used to think i was a huge emotionless ice queen for a while, and i've also been described as one. i leave "relationships" as easily and quickly as i start them. i've learned that most people don't find that to be pleasant, but i don't understand being upset if someone loses interest. just go.  \n\ni got lucky with one though, and my s/o (intj) doesn't seem like a huge waste of my time. aaand we were actually just talking yesterday about work and if it's something i care about, i will only eat, sleep, and breathe that thing. if i don't care about it, holy shit you could not pay me to do it. i mean you probably could, but it wouldn't get done on time i guarantee that. 
3	Istp female here!!
2	I'm an ISTP chick, too. I find it interesting you feel the need to explain yourself to your friends in the first place. I've always had the mentality of "I am who I am and I do what I want the way I want and I don't need to explain myself to anyone"
1	There is a significant leaning towards males with ISTP ([about two and a half times as common](https://personalitymax.com/personality-types/population-gender/)). Also, reddit users are also more likely to be male, adding another layer of gender "divide," for lack of a better word.
11	Are ISTPs possessive?	Examples: \n\n- Hate when other people use their stuff or touch their things\n\n- Suspicious of new or strange people in the workplace\n\n\nTerritorial*
20	This is called being human. I am OK with people who ask to use my stuff first, and respect my shit so I can use it later. Not particularly attached to anything. 
13	I don’t like it when people touch my things. Do you?
5	I'm not possessive just don't touch my stuff 
3	I think you might need to explain this further?
4	i am the completely opposite of possessive. especially in relationships, my mentality is that if i have to keep you on a leash so you don’t run away, i would rather spend my time, effort, and and energy on someone who i can trust to be faithful to me even when i’m not around. and if they prove to be unfaithful, then it’s really their loss because while i just got rid of a cheating boyfriend, they lost a 10/10
1	Here's one anecdotal example to back you up.  When we first got married my ISTP husband got annoyed because I went into his FB account and posted a status that was clearly not something he would say as a joke (nothing harmful or humiliating, just not him) and he was clearly not having it. He's not unduly secretive, he'll show me stuff he looks at it and I have his passwords and stuff but unless there's a valid reason for touching his things he, he rather no one, not even me, do so. I have no problem with this because I'm actually much the same way (INTP)  and that one incident was simply me trying to pull an innocuous joke but I  understood why he didn't like it. I do know other types as married couples who share the same email account, Facebook account, etc.  ISTPs are very autonomous and need their own space.
1	I caught myself being territorial and started questioning why i was feeling that way. My friend was sitting next to me and used my eraser (which was lying on my side of the desk) without asking and i just felt like my property was taken. But its weird cause its literally just an eraser, it shouldnt be a big deal. But yea, ive been more easy going with my space after catching myself on that
1	It's not often I have visitors in my home aside from my one friend. I have a spot in my living room where I always sit, with all my effects and such I would need to use while relaxing in the end table directly next to this spot (with no other spot close to the end table). For context, I smoke weed, and if I'm stoned and need something from my drawer, I sure as hell don't want to stand up and walk all the way across my living room up get it. \n\nMy one friend and two room mates understand this and my reasoning for having "my own spot", yet everyone else I try to explain this to just calls me a "Sheldon" and makes jokes. Sometimes people don't even listen. \n\nThat shit really pisses me off. 
8	Do you also draw conclutions out of experiences?	This is something I do often. I go out and do something, take mental notes on my surroundings and their effect on my thoughts and perspective. Afterwards I'm like "ok, this is the facts, what happened, it's reliable info to analyze" and then proceed to draw conclusions about how society works, what I'm interested in, what's relevant and what should I focus on next time I get out 'in the field'. I know my conclusions are not absolute and might only be useful to myself, but I have this tendency to try to figure out how the world works including its variables. I wonder if other ISTPs do this, since idk anyone irl who does it conciously. I know that because I asked them. Other people seem to be much more mentally chill, including introverts.\n\nBtw,"draw conclusions out of experiences", should it be "from" instead of "out of"? English is not my first language.
5	You sound just like an ISTP friend of mine. He's really annoying.\n\nSo I guess the answer to your question, in my friend's case, is yes.
3	/r/circlejerk
2	Yeah that's relatively normal
2	ISTPs are masters of the details. You could argue we have the most realistic point of view of the world out of all types, and the most common sense. I really do not know why they say INTPs are the most logical type. They lack common sense. How the hell can you be fully objective without common sense? Typical sensory prejudice :D
1	Have you ever heard of the book [Games People Play](https://www.amazon.com/Games-People-Play-Transactional-Analysis/dp/0345410033/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1533791643&sr=8-1&keywords=games+people+play+book&dpID=41F1N98XsaL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)?  
4	Anyone here from Melbourne, Australia?	
3	Me! 
1	I used to date an introvert from St. Kilda.  In hindsight, he strikes me as being a bit of an ISTP since he share(d) a lot of characteristics of one.  
12	Random Musings	I have lots of random thoughts, I will share some. Maybe people will be inclined to share some, or comment.\n\nPeople can really just fuck up my day with a single comment. Gets stuck, can't dislodge without sleep. Then get annoyed at the thought being stuck, that's a bitch. \n\nI smile too much. I don't think I realized it for a long time, I generally just come off as a happy person to most people. Recently though I've caught myself still smiling when talking about serious things, and wonder what other people think of it. I used to laugh at my Dad when he yelled at me as kid, that never went well for me. \n\nI have lots of conversations in my head that I think about having with other people. If I think about saying words, I will rarely ever say those words. The filter that prevents me from just spewing the first thought prevents me from saying things, because I think about it and then decide it's not relevant. It's rare that I cut out the filter, though when I do I'm usually hilarious to most people. \n\nI hate being lonely, but I want to be by myself. What a contradiction. \n\nI feel like I could/should have done so much more with my life. When I look at others I grew  up with and they appear successful it gets to me some, because I know I have the ability to do so much more than almost anyone I've known. It's a little depressing at times, but I realize I've probably enjoyed life more than most of them because they just stress themselves out over the jobs they do and "being successful" instead of just being happy with life. \n\nAccording to some polls ISTP's are least likely to want kids. I don't want kids for entirely selfish reasons, because they are a lot of work. I think I'd be a great parent, and raise kids with good values, and I'm sure it'd make me a better person. I think I'm unlikely to ever have kids. \n\nI feel like the male stereotype is largely an ISTP. I wonder why that is. Is it just that people want to be like us/want to be with us? \n\nI posted way too many words
5	I have the mental block, too. I had to make this, because if I didn't I wouldn't be able to make friends easily. Only way this filter stops is I say what's on my mind without thinking to take the edge off. This bit me in the ass yesterday, again. I was able to mend it with the help of my friend though. \n\n \nI do feel that I should've done so much more, too. For example, because of me having hard WTF years with depression/depressive episode (killer combo), my college degree went from 4 to 6 years to finish. I could've been relaxing at home, but here I am, fixing my fuck-up.\n\n \nDid you try mindfulness to help with comments sticking? I'm not talking about new age stuff, just breath control like square breathing. It does help. \n\n \nFor the same reason of yours, I don't want relationships, let alone children. It's just such a big hassle to meet & greet new people, open up, get screwed from your weaknesses, rinse & repeat. \n\n \nI do smile a lot too. It's subconscious. They probably think you're a bit weird, not too much to stop communicaiton, but weird enough to be a bit more careful around you .\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nMy thing is that I live in the vagabond lifestyle. It has its positives, mainly ease of going around the world, not missing the old places so much you have to return, ease of acquaintance & friend finding. Negatives are, ease of letting go (seen as a giant no, same with not caring about them at all), lack of communication starting from afar (not having old friends). \n\n
5	Way too often when my dad was lecturing me growing up I would smile, smirk, or straight up laugh out loud because it was this feedback loop where it was something that you shouldn't do and the more I thought about it, the more amusing it was to me until it happened. I think it had a lot to do with my dad's lectures were often about stuff that I already knew but didn't follow anyways so it was kind of pointless.

3	FUCK SOCIETY! I HATE YA ALL CUNTS! AHHHH AH AHHHHH 
2	I replay conversations in my head and navigate through potential outcomes, but know that what I already did was what was correct and true to me in the moment. Sometimes I'll wince or sigh loudly when I remember something embarrassing or of when I did something completely wrong, but it's more of a "Damn Kevin, if only you knew then what you know now" moment and I savor the lesson for a moment and move forward. \n\nLoneliness... Is a weird concept for me. I'm 33 and grew up only being able to count on me. Loneliness really never had it's chance to bare its fangs, because I always had me to rely on. With that said, I find myself in long term relationships that try to strip away that independence and, in the end, find the other person to be really invasive. \n\n\nI'd write more, but I'm away from my PC. Got things to do. 
1	Here's another random thought.\n\nMy Mother just told me my Nephew got in a car accident, she's completely in tears. "He was turning into work and someone smashed into him, spun his car around multiple times, completely totaled it." So my head is going, damn this is really bad. "Is he okay?" "He's fine"  You'd think that would be the important part you want to lead with, especially when you are unnecessarily crying

I hate asking for help but im looking for some now. I think im xSxP.\n\n-Im not one to just follow everyone else. I like to do my own thing on my own time.\n\n-My boss and some employees and I butt heads because they tend to micro manage. I hate that and usually say something. I speak my mind and im very opinionated. I do tend to question dumb rules.\n\n-my family and wife would describe me as rebellious, a smart ass, and jokester.\n\n-I grew up in a religious family that teaches the bible and at a young age I started to question and when I got older was given the option to believe and live under there roof or leave.

39	Does anyone else always attract people who have trust issues or mental health issues?	Cause I do. Why do you think that is? 
49	Yeah, I think it's cause I'm always supportive and not judgemental. Also, they seem attracted to my self-reliance and independent attitude. After making a few terrible life decisions, I've learned not to get too heavily involved with people who can't love themselves because they'll use me to try to fill their endless emotional void. They are also incapable of fully returning my affections, which I rarely give to anyone else. I'm not soft and vulnerable to anyone else, so it would be nice if they wouldn't treat it like a mundane thing
15	[deleted]
10	There was a similar question asked a few weeks ago. The consensus: none of us attract mentally healthy people.
22	I'm 28 now and I have had many relationships and, most recently, a failed marriage. I mainly attract damaged people but I've come to learn about myself that it's not that I attract them, it's that I seek them out. I have a hero complex, I like to save people from themselves or try to anyway. It never works out and it always hurts but I've been doing it to myself. I'm trying to be better now that I've realized it but it's still there and I still find damaged people attractive and interesting. 
9	A desire to fix what's broken makes ISTP interested, extreme pursuit of emotional balance makes them interesting. 
9	Istps understand how stuff works, this isnt limitted to physical stuff, we understand social concepts as well. Many of these people talk to an istp about their problems and we are able to tell them exactly why they are feeling / acting a certain way(or why people who cause them grief act a certain way, and why they should cut those people out of their lives). We have the ability to explain what cause these life problems to these kinds of people.\n\nIf you pay attention other personalities don't think about stuff Like "what makes an abusive person, what symptoms do they show" or "why do I feel sad, why am I upset with society" They will know they are unsatisfied but lack the understanding of all the parts that added up to make them dissatisfied. \n\nTl:DR Its like a persons mental health is a car, we posses the ability to understand how all those parts work and effect each other more than most.\n\n 
6	Yes
5	I’m always told that I’m calm and collected and I think that really attracts less stable temperaments or people with certain mental health issues. I’m not anyone’s mom though so I don’t quite feel a savior complex that others might lol 
6	Yes. In addition to the other reasons listed here I also think my personality as a loner tends to make me seem more approachable to certain kinds of people.
4	oof yes. I can never really help them, either. 
3	Abandonment issues, former trauma, maybe?  What I do know is that the women I attract are FUCKED UP.  It makes me feel bad (kinda) because I dont want to deal with it.
3	Yes
3	Yes. 
3	Used to have the problem....well, still kind of do. But now I just don't get involved. I'm much better off that way.
3	Istp's are so fkn stable and chill - Infp
3	Yes. I try to help them. But you know "there is no help but self help"
2	Yes. Why? Because I have trust issues and mental health issues myself. Granted, I seem better equipped to handle it than most. But I still have the problems. \n\n\nPeople with problems are like magnets for other people with problems. Because people who have their shit together don’t tend to hang around people who don’t. 
2	I want to help and protect people, but it's at conflict with the fact I know that it's a bad idea most of the time. Let people make their beds and lie in it.
1	Yes \n\nAs far as why, I think I see someone who needs help and triggers something in me to want to give and fix and improve them and take them on. Something similar to the "faith in the underdog" trope you see in INFPs. \n\nPart of me wonders how much people with those conditions constitute in population density. \n
1	I do have a tendency to be Captain Save-A-Hoe. Fortunately, I also have an aversion to trashy people, so I tend to get nice girls with some self-esteem issues. If I was to grade my past gf's, I'd give them all a B+ except my last one, that got expelled.
4	I'm stagnating, directionless and way behind in life, advice?	Long post. \nSome context: just turned 25, living with my family, currently unemployed, about to re-take college (it's free), social anxiety, with vague goals in life, two friends, a few aquaintances, one romantic interest, never been in a relationship, going in circles inside my head. \nI'm currently interested in fitness and I'm good at doing stuff with my hands and learning foreign languages.\nIn two days I'll be heading back to college (yep, I dropped-out before bc of anxiety) to study Linguistics in a foreign language+probably translation. It's kind of cool but most of the time I'm anxious feeling that I should be moving around doing something physically challenging related to being in nature and beating my social anxiety. I can't afford to go on an adventure but I also need to get economically independent and grow up. I've never dated anyone because I know that I never try hard at anything so I don't have something good to offer to a potential partner. If I think I'm shit then I'm not gonna bother someone I somewhat admire with that. I've figured I should get a job in customer service besides college but it bugs me not having a major goal and I'm afraid that my current college major might not be the best choice for me. I've been jumping around in the past between unrelated majors and decided that I should do something I can actually finish even if lectures are boring. \nIn your guys opinion, is there anything I'm missing? Besides having a love interest, I'm not certain about anything and turns out I don't share common interests with my friends so I can't really get anywhere discussing this topic with them.
5	WTF years. Been there. Look it up. At some unpredictable time you'll fit back in and have some motivation and direction. 
4	I don't know if this is the best advice, so take what you think will work best for you:\n\nConstantly switching majors will continue to make you stay at point 1. Meaning, you go backwards instead of forward. Choose a major that you're good at or HIGHLY interests you. You're probably more likely to finish a major you're good at because it requires lower effort and you'll feel more accomplished when you don't fail every other test and get frustrated. Your major doesn't always correlate to the job you do anyway. (You can major in music or English and still become a doctor.) I suggest you pick something and grit through it. You could probably major in linguistics and satisfy your physical challenge craving by just going out on the weekends? Try to break new limits: go for marathons, set a personal swim distance record, go on difficult hikes.\n\nI think for most of us, we're always unsure of our decisions, especially those regarding our permanent future. I am highly ambitious, but most times I don't know where to direct that ambition to. In high school, I strived for stellar grades and joined a bunch of competitions to maximize my chances of getting to a good college, but I didn't even know what college I was aiming for and I was even more lost about the career I wanted to pursue. Deciding on a career has been stressing me out for the last 5 years.. I was good in biology and I liked studying the heart and blood, so I decided to go to the medical route, but that's very vague. With so many specialities, how do I choose? I recently picked something though, and I'm sticking to it. I'm not sure if I'll make it or if it's right for me, but having a goal helps me to direct my focus and willpower. Even if you shoot for the moon and don't make it, you'll still land among the stars.\n\nIt might not be wise to find a job so early when you're just returning back to college. Both will be highly stimulating to you it seems, so try to get one down before trying the other. Juggling too many things at once will make you lose your grip on life. Also, on you becoming financially independent, getting that degree is working towards becoming financially independent.\n\nNo experience in dating so no comment on that.\n\nYou are not "some shit". Everyone has their own flaws and problems to work through, and we're all going through the same shit show we call life. It might actually be more beneficial to tell your problems to friends or someone you admire cause likely, they've gone through something similar and was able to overcome it. They can relate to you and help you out. I find that for me, I usually find a solution to my own problem just by telling someone my problems lol.\n\nYou already know your anxiety is holding you back. If you can pinpoint exactly what you are anxious about, and solve it, the other steps will come naturally.
4	1. Just get a degree. You don't want to be in college forever, so just pick something, finish it and get out.\n2. You can't fix everything at once. Don't try to manage everything, just manage a few things.\n3. The anxiety is you thinking too much. Stop thinking and just do.\n4. Not everybody should have major life goals all the time. Sometimes you don't know what you want and that's fine. You should spend your time figuring out what you want instead of trying to set up goals based on nothing. But don't try to figure it out by sitting still and thinking. Go out and physically test things out for yourself.
3	Don't be so hard on yourself.  You're only human.  Trite, I know.  But true.
1	You are 25. Why the fuck aren't you working?\n\nI've had some form of job since i was 12-13.   There is no work above you.\n\nIt just sounds like you are being babied by your family. Go out in the world and live it.\n\nSocial anxiety? So does everyone else. Learn to  cope with it.. it probably will never go away.\n\nFinancial independance first. Always. Then you can choose to learn, or adventure...\n\n 
2	"le simulation"	Hey do you ISTP's ever get the vibe that your mind's been hijacked and you're living in a simulation? I'm starting to think it's the INTJ's. Something about their Ni-Fi combo. It tends to make you miserable/guilty because it gets in your Ti-Ni web. I could be wrong, but I'm seeing way too many ISTP's with low self-esteem. Doesn't make any sense.
9	My self-esteem varies based on different subjects. When it comes to my skills/intelligence and nigh indomitable will, I have a lot of pride for those qualities (maybe too much occasionally). However, I'm struggling with body dysmorphia, so my self-esteem in that department is fairly low.
6	It may stem from how we look at the world, too (at least for me). We look at the problems we face, not at the ones that we've solved before. That robs us from some self-esteem. And you add the flak that we get for our reclusive nature, it can be easy to break an ISTP's self-esteem.\n\nSimilar to /u/SteadfastDrifter, my self-seteem also varies by the subjects. Great with the stuff I know I can do, not so great at everything else. \n\nAlso I have a different problem, I can't accept praise if I know I didn't work for it; even if I do accept it, I put myself down while accepting it. For example, if you comliment me about something I've done, no problem. But if you compliment my brain or looks, I can't accept it easily.
3	Yeah I suffer low self esteem and do occasionally feel like I'm running through the motions instead of living, like me se quit; but it's whatever :)
3	What
2	It’s too early for me to comprehend what’s going on this thread... I can’t tell if this is a joke, a metaphor, or serious. \n\n\nI’ll revisit when I’ve had a chance to wake up 😂
1	Being an ISTP is a thankless job in a society centric around the useless turds that shamelessly promote themselves.  Your self-esteem may suck but so does (just about) everything else.  Self-value is where it's at.
14	How to help an ISTP through a difficult time	Hello! My fiance is an ISTP and I'm an ENFJ, making us basically polar opposites - which sometimes really proves difficult. Recently, he received some news that he will not be able to pursue his dream career, which has ultimately been very crushing to him. He tends to stop eating, taking care of himself, sleeping, and takes to his mind where he beats himself up. I'm doing my best to support him, but I'm worried he's going to quit all of the extracurriculars he loves and basically just let himself waste away while this eats him up inside. I want to help without being overbearing (because I like fixing things) but thought I'd check with some people with similar personalities before doing anything. We're planning a wedding and he's basically shutdown about it, saying he doesn't want a wedding party, bachelor party, or many of the guests he originally wanted. These things aren't important to me but I'm worried he'll regret that decision later.
39	I’ll tell you what helped me during my times with similar destructive behaviors. \n\n\nI had friends who forced me to go out. I never wanted to. They would guilt me and I’d resent them the whole way out to wherever we were going. But then I’d get there, have fun, and forget that I never even wanted to go. They knew the process so they were guilting me knowing that it was my benefit. They weren’t just being asses. \n\n\nAnyways, the thing about depression and ISTP’s is that they don’t mix well. ISTP’s are very much inside their own headspace. Always thinking always analyzing. So during depressive bouts, you spend all of your idle mind time thinking about these bad things. At first, it may be to fix it. But after a while, it just becomes sulking. \n\n\nYou have to help him get out of his head. And to do that, you have to occupy his mind with something productive so that he doesn’t have time to think about negative thoughts. One single negative thought can torch a day for a depressive ISTP. Speaking from experience. One thought can wiggle its way in, burrow deep, and grow to day-crushing proportions. \n\n\nSo your job is to keep his mind busy. Things like TV, movies, or idle activities won’t work. It will allow him time to zone out and get into his head. His brain needs to be actively working on something. Wether it be a conversation, a painting, working on a car, typing computer programs, whatever. He needs to be thinking, analyzing, making decisions, etc. His brain needs to be too busy processing current events to be able to let intrusive thoughts in. This is why I leave for work at 6:30 am and tend to not get home til 9-9:30pm. I’m not working that whole time, but I’m avoiding sitting alone at home. \n\n\nNow girl let me tell you, this isn’t going to be easy. He’s in a really low place. And he’s likely to not recognize that you pushing him is for his own good. He may get upset or lash out. Don’t. Take. It. Personally. Seriously. When your brain is drenched in negativity, that tends to be all that comes out. Keep trying, keep pushing, and keep showing him your love. Your actions will speak monumentally more than your words. After he has a few really good days while he’s busy, he’ll begin to remember what happiness is. Once he remembers it, he’ll feel more inclined to look for it. And that’s when things get easier for you. Once he is working with you and not against you, it’s just about giving the healing process time. \n\n\nI know this hard, and I’m not sure how you feel about the future of the relationship. But just keep in mind that he’s still the man you know and love. But life broke him. It tore his dream career from his hands and left him directionless. Being directionless is the bane of every ISTP’s existence. It’s our worst nightmare. \n\n\nJust be patient. Show him love and affection. And don’t give up. You have to trust that the man you know and love is still inside. He’s just sitting at the bottom of a hole and needs help getting out. But let me tell you what, if you successfully help him out of his hole and get him back to normal, you two will create a new bond that you could never imagine. Once he knows that you can handle his Dark Passenger, he’ll be more likely to let you inside sooner if this ever happens again. Speaking from a decade of moderate-severe depression experience, having someone understand me and know how to help me who never gives up on me changed everything. She gave me my life back and I’ll always be in her debt. I’m literally tearing up writing that sentence because of how much she means to me. \n\n\nBut that exactly is why I’m saying that pulling him out of this will create a new bond. If he’s anything like me, he thinks his life from here on out is just going to waste away. He’s going to be on autopilot without ever experiencing happiness or joy. And if you can stop that, you will be saving his life in a sense. If he’s anything like me, he’ll fall in love with you all over again. While he’s recreating his idea of happiness, you will always be at the forefront of his thoughts. Every new happy experience will include you. So by the time he has a solid grasp on his happiness, every item on his list will be associated with you. You will become his rock and new source of life. The girl who brought me back to life shares a bond with me that’s stronger than anything I’ve ever experienced. It’s stronger than any friend or family member I’ve ever had. We’re always on the same page, we never fight, we solve every dispute quickly and painlessly, and we provide a sort of “filter” if you will for each others pain. Crippling emotional pain can be mitigated simply by being in the same room together. When I see her face now, I can’t think about anything but happiness. Because that’s the face associated to everything on *my* “happy list”. I hope to make her my fiancé one day. But while we’re still working on ourselves and fixing our problems, being best friends feels healthier. \n\n\nI really hope my word vomit can help you. Keep in mind that all of this is based on my personal experience as a depressive ISTP who’s been at rock bottom. I don’t know you or your fiancé, so obviously take my words with a grain of salt. But hopefully my words can give you an idea of where to start and idea of what the future recovery may look like. 
4	I'm interested in the answer, too. My ISTP partner is happy for the most part but he is in a similar situation in that he's trapped in a job that has nothing to do with what he loves. (I am as well, but I use my free time to pursue my dreams; he does not.) He \*has\* become sullen in the past but now has settled into complacency. I know ISTPs don't like to be pushed (which I don't do) but I really want him to do what he loves. Will be checking back.
8	Give them ultimatums. Istps get stuck in their own head and sometimes a quick swift mental kick to the balls can help them snap out of it.\n\nPersonally i always get stuck on the "what if there's another option?".   Limit their options. Make it simple.\n\nAlso give them space to think it out.
3	The longer he goes without fixing/upgrading something, the worse it will get. Luckily, since June I was forced to:\n\nRedo 2 bedroom hardwood floors, using a hand sander (never done that before)\n\nChange brake pads on my car (never done that before)\n\nFix inside car door handle- I could only get out of my car by using the outside door handle (never done that before)\n\nInstall new bathroom faucet and drain (never done that before)\n\nWithout the sense of accomplishment by completing these tasks, I would have been in a bad place.
2	Find problems for him to solve and/or things for him to fix, preferably with his hands. \n\nFor example, ask him to change the oil in your car, or even better, ask him to teach you how to change the oil in your car. If he doesn't know how, find a youtube tutorial he can learn from. Leaky faucets, small home improvement projects, etc. Little things like that will make him feel able and of value.\n\nThis is pretty much how to make any man feel better about himself, but especially an ISTP.
1	leave him lol  \nthat's what my ex did
1	What was the career path he was hoping for and what happened that made him not be able to go for it?\n
19	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
5	Goes to ISTP sub. Taking a survey. Crickets.\nGoes to ISTP sub. Chick needing advice dating ISTP. Gilded. 
2	What will this information be used for?
1	I like dat Gang$ta shit 👌
1	Results OP?
11	How much fun do you have?	How many things are you doing purely because you enjoy doing them and for no other reason at all?
38	Almost everything I do :P\n\nI have zero discipline for doing things I don't want to do. I procrastinate those, unless I'm being paid.
10	I'm a little boring right now.\n\nMy pure pleasure actions are watching Breaking Bad and playing video games.  \n\nHowever, I'm doing a lot of things that are investments for the future, or my current line of work.  It's rewarding and a lot of fun in and of itself.  \n\nI like finding fun in the "wise" things that I'm doing in life.  Makes it both rewarding and beneficial.
3	Lots I can think of right now. Spearfishing, freediving, rock climbing, salsa and dance.
3	Probably way too much. It's summer so I've been partying a lot, hanging out with friends, camping, traveling, and going on tons of adventures which I love, but I should probably spend more time towards my goals...
2	I have fun in everything i do. 
2	My job is overwhelming right now. With all the drama I go straight to gamin when I get home from work. A nice twitchy multi-player shooter really takes the edge off. 
2	I guess not a whole ton. I work a lot right now. 6:45am-6pm M-F. Most of my evenings I do one of two routines: 1. Go to buddies house with roommate and friends to smoke/watch tv/play games/etc. or 2. Stay home, clean, cook, relax alone in front of tv. \n\n\nMy weekends can get pretty crazy. I went bar hopping last Friday and ended up in a rave. This weekend I’m working straight through on my Miata project. Just a weekend filled with beer, wrenches, and buddies. A few more of these weekends and a little more money, and then it’ll be race ready. So that activity will be added to my list probably early next year. 
1	minimal amount of work to get maximum satisfaction. cutting corners, etc
1	Going jet skiing, fishing, hiking, and walking nature trails
1	What other reason do you need?
1	Im never bored, and never sad.. so i guess a lot
1	very little

6	*reaches 2nd place of global ranking in stupid strategy game after months of playing if only temporary due to decay system* ...that was time well spent.
4	This is hilarious, my ISTP boyfriend is so competitive with catan and other games. He’s always reading strategy guides for everything he plays.
3	LOL relatable. I love how they use Syracuse, NY. I grew up near there, and it was very boring. 
3	That’s exactly me when I get captivated by a video game. Lucky for me, I’ve been clean for a while. But the newest Forza Horizon title comes out 10/2 and I absolutely will be relapsing for a good 4-6 months. It’ll be a glorious 4-6 months filled with obsession and staying on top of the ladder. Then I’ll complete 70-80% of the game (the parts I actually feel like doing) and go into sobriety until the next title release. \n\n\nHell, I’ve already been studying the new title since E3. The new features, ways to progress, records to set, game map, loop holes, Ways to XP farm, etc. Gotta make sure that the second pre-release opens, I can get some key records on the board. When you want people to download your liveries and tunes, you gotta get noticed. Best way to get noticed is to get into the top of leaderboards on as many events as possible from day 1. I still hold a handful of top 10-50 times (out of several million) from the last Horizon title two Falls ago. And people still download my tunes off those cars today. 
3	Well, I mean... How much Catan do you play?
6	I'm often lost in though and also easily distracted, am I still a "Sensing" and ISTP?	I often get lost in though, and my attention spam is very short, though I always get tested as an ISTP. I also think it fits me way more than INTP, reading their descriptions. Is this a contradiction? My thought tend to be very concrete and practical ones. Like, I'm always thinking about real situations or stuff I've experienced/gone through rather than imagining. Is this a ISTP characteristic, or am I actually more of an INTP?
15	This kind of narrow-minded thinking is the whole reason stereotypes say S types can’t see anything other than what’s literally in front of their eyes and N types have their head so far up ~~their ass~~ in the clouds they couldn’t provide their own basic needs if their life depended on it. Listen, we have _four_ (4) functions, not just the dom and the aux. Tert and inferior functions exist for a reason, and that’s because nobody can be so fucking one-dimensional as to not use the 4 types of judging and perceiving functions and still be considered a functional human being.\n\nSo to answer your question:  \nYes, it’s totally possible to have some sort of insight and to wonder stuff inside your head even if you’re an ISTP, we can connect the dots together too all right? We have tert Ni, which is linked to gathering all the facts and events to come up with the most possible outcome, to have an “Eureka” moment of some sort. If you’re constantly brainstorming and coming up with different possibilities and scenarios (Ne) instead of taking in the physical world and noticing details around your environment (Se) then yeah, you’re an INTP, but if you mean you once in a while get lost in thought trying to figure out something, it’s probably just Ti and Ni using the data Se gave them to make sense out of it.\n\nMBTI types have a _preference_ to use some functions, some come more naturally than others, but all mbti types use at least one type of every judging and perceiving function. What you do first, on automatic pilot if you will, is what determines your type, it’s not a black and white scale, but more like shades of gray. \n\nHope this was useful.
2	Have you read through previous posts on this sub about cognitive function stacks? More often than not it's a slightly easier way to ascertain your dominant/secondary functions and gauge where you might sit, than just going by type descriptions. 
1	The fact that you're asking this is almost indicative of ISTP tendency to over rationalize. I would go as far as even encouraging myself to daydream. We have to improve our lower functions. Are you 'older'? Meaning like in your 30's ? It is normal for our lower functions to attack us as we get closer to midlife. Don't fight them. We have to let them flourish. It will help us.
1	I am always distracted by my Ti. Sometimes it completely cancels Se out. If I am deep in thought while driving, I can completely go into autopilot and miss a turn off I was supposed to take.. It doesn't happen all the time. Usually when I have a lot on my plate.
-2	Oh my god, who cares?
28	WTF years vs depression	Can anyone come up with some distinctions between depression and WTF years? They seem to overlap and I feel I may be going through a little of both. 
25	To over simplify:\n\n\nDepression -> nothing in this world brings me joy\n\n\nWTF Years -> I don't know where I fit in this world
29	Well, for me, my depressive episodes are usually due to lack of direction, or the feeling that I've stagnanted in personal growth and I'm "stuck in a rut". - WTF years are defined by very similar feelings, so I believe that what you are feeling is likely just a symptom of the directionless wandering that ISTP's seem so adept at.\n\nA therapist told me something about depression that really stuck with me through the years. He said there is a tremendous difference between "I feel depressed" and "I am depressed". You feel depressed? Good. That's your mind subconsciously telling you that it's time for growth/change. \n\nSo what's growth? I'm not saying that you need to go out and become the most driven, disciplined person out there who does yoga and meditates in their free-time, but you should focus on improving small aspects of your life every day. Make your bed in the morning, start grooming better, read a book a couple hours a week, become someone who excerices a few times a week (I don't mean go to your local cross fit gym and start throwing shit around every day, I just mean start going on hikes twice a week and maybe add a sport in there to mix it up every once in a while), and start actively putting yourself outside of your comfort zone. Go to social events, try a dance class, approach people you find attractive, start learning how to say "no" to things you truly don't want to do.\n\nNone of this is going to drastically change who you are as a person, and you likely will still have no fucking idea what career you want to do, but hopefully after a few months, you've slowly started developing the habits of someone who is disciplined, healthy, and interesting. This shit is a battle, man. But it is manageable if you just take it day by day. I promise if you just stick with it for a few months, you'll become a better rounded person, and maybe you'll even learn more about yourself along the way.\n\n
3	I think the vast majority of posts here about WTF years are just straight up depression
8	istps and tertery ni..?	istps and tertery ni,i was just thinking,ni is about convergence and comming to conclusions with abstract ideas,i know you guys dont really often,but when you do think about abstract concepts ect,do you often find yourself seeing answers to things without knowing how you came to that conclusion?,do you guys often find it easy to manipulate people,like an nfj would,or how do you experience your ni?
7	Think of Ni in terms of a pile of legos and then lets say you were tasked with building a cube. With Ni, you would examine each piece and get random insights as to how certain pieces would fit together to make that cube. You can apply this technique to concepts as well. If each lego piece was actually an idea, Ni would take all of those ideas and combine them into a "super idea". \n\nSome examples include: looking at abbreviations you've never seen before and suddenly knowing what it stands for, watching a show and suddenly realizing the deeper meanings and messages behind things, when you're learning how to do something new  and after practicing for a bit you suddenly "get it", and observing another person's actions, piecing those actions together, and then suddenly knowing what their true motive is and knowing exactly how it will go down.\n\ntl;dr Ni gets insight on this, and Ni gets insight on that, and then [brain blast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jdycoEXgYA&frags=pl%2Cwn)! Super insight! You know this thing now!
3	Ni gets me in trouble. When I push boundaries, I’m usually testing something I sense is correct and want to see what happens. It’s usually spot on but the implementation is sloppy. \n\nI can manipulate but it’s normally a defensive thing rather than to get what I want. It’s more to figure out someone’s motives and protect myself. \n\nI have no interest in using that to get what I want/ends justify means is not a mentality I adopt.....my Fe really gets in the way with that. \n\n
6	Well I have weird ni moments. Such as trying to learn a song on the piano, then going to bed unable to play a measure then wake up and can play it perfectly. Me personally have an opinion on everything, although sometimes very vague. Then when asked about it I kind of form and further detail this opinion on the fly when talking to them about it, like I had it subconsciously had it figured out without really spending time thinking about it. Nothing is made up and always makes logical sense. \n\nI can manipulate people if I want to but try to refrain from it since I don't think it's ethical. But I am a little bit assertive sometimes which is somewhat similar. \n\nOverall my ni helps quite a lot with my problem solving and imo value it more than my se. 
12	Inferior Fe = Underestimating Your Intelligence?	My boyfriend is ISTP and I (along with others) have realized that he is very intelligent. However, I also realize that whenever I bring this up, he doesn't value this fact at all. I'm not expecting backflips and cartwheels (not to play into the stereotype, but he's not the most enthusiastic guy, which I don't mind at all), but he doesn't even seem to understand why I'm *saying* it. As an ENTP, if someone I respect or see as an equal calls me intelligent, I see that as encouragement that I'm probably moving in the right direction. He, however, seems almost disturbed or annoyed. I honestly don't think he even compares his own intelligence to anyone else's ever, which makes me wonder if this has some connection to an ISTP's natural inclination to move away from Fe, which in my mind requires knowing what people know/don't know, towards Ti, which is the search for pure knowledge even if it's not translatable to the masses (which again would require knowing where they already are mentally in order to translate that).\n\n**tl;dr** ISTP boyfriend is unable to measure his own intelligence because he not prone to knowing the "baseline" of intelligence, which would require extroverted feeling (Fe). Sound right?
27	We tend to handle compliments poorly even though we appreciate the ego boost. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat may be running through his mind is: \n\n\n\n"Your very intelligent" \n\n\n\nISTP: Maybe, but where has that gotten me? I still have X problem that I can't solve. \n\n\n\nHe's most likely not comparing his intelligence to others but to the size of the problems that he has. These are probably self-growth problems like he wants to be further ahead in life than where he is now and he's frustrated by his lack of progress. \n\n\n\nSometimes we need someone to remind us of all the things we've accomplished so we can see that we really have made progress in solving the longer-term problems in life. \n\n\n\n\nI think to many ISTP's things like high intelligence are just tools, and if we fail to be able to use those tools effectively to solve our problems then what good are they and worse yet, what good are we?
13	The baseline of intelligence is shockingly low, but so what if he's above the baseline? A high IQ won't get you anything or anywhere in this world.  Emotional intelligence on the other hand...
12	[deleted]
10	I don't accept compliments about my intelligence because I would know better. I will never be as intelligent as I would like and that is very frustrating for me. 
10	Not sure if it’s directly related with inferior Fe, but as an ISTP I also kinda underestimate my own intelligence. In my case, I think it stems from the fact that I know intelligence on its own won’t get me anywhere while I lack the drive to complete goals and push myself forward (which is unfortunately the case most of the time). But on the other hand, I really don’t want to  be seen as the intelligent guy of the group anyways. As for why, I’m also trying to understand.
11	Probably deep down, he knows he's smart, but he doesn't see the point in acknowledging it.\n\nI think one of the differences between NTPs and STPs is that NTPs tend to believe, "My thoughts are smart, therefore I am smart" and STPs believe "Stupid is as stupid does." Like what good is a really sharp knife if it's always kept in its case. I know I'm smart, but so are tons of other people and a lot of them are useless. Whereas many so-called dumb people are very productive. I'd rather be judged for the products of my intelligence than my intelligence itself.
2	Mmm I would have to disagree. Keep in mind what you are saying would also apply to INTPs since they are Ti doms as well with inferior Fe. But that would be a contradiction because INTPs obviously think they are intelligent. So, I often compare myself to people a lot. I am very competitive and like to be the best I can be. I have a habit of looking down on people and thinking they are dumb, though I am getting better at it. If you want to know what this is called, it's the Fe grip: http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/135002965032/how-functions-work-inferior-fe-istpintp
2	This is because NeSi (and TeFi) focus on intrinsic and permanent proprieties such as intelligence (Si cumulatively store informations and Ne forms a pattern) . Lacking both , maybe He doesn't think about himself in term of general measurement but in imediate ones (like how can you solve a problem , how to addapt to a situation). This is why SP are usually more competitive than others.
2	Idk, I see myself reacting this way, or being cocky about it in a playful way.
1	Might have something to do with Te being the 5th function down. We tend to shun group thinking because the fact that lots of other people think something doesnt really carry any weight. So what if i knew i was in the 80th percentile? It wont change my life.
1	> As an ENTP, if someone I respect or see as an equal calls me intelligent, I see that as encouragement that I'm probably moving in the right direction. He, however, seems almost disturbed or annoyed.   \n    \nENTPs are in relationship of "supervision" with ISTPs which is what is annoying him about your suggestions: [**ISTP Love Types**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/istp-articles/110040-istp-relationship.html#post3833733). He doesn't need to be taught how to intellectually one-up anyone else or realize he has superior intelligence, but to be shown the depth of feeling which is what his inferior Fe would respond to positively.
1	(Cross-post) Temperament and Humor (All over 14 Welcome)	 Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic\_temperament\_and\_humor\_all\_over\_14\_welcome/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic_temperament_and_humor_all_over_14_welcome/)
12	Religion and ISTP?	Does ISTP types have a strong religious belief? 
21	Honestly make sure you don't take this MBTI stuff too seriously. Our ISTP'ness is just a preset of how we think. There are always other factors that go into our makeup (Culture, how we were raised, etc...) that are going to fall outside of our personality. Things like religion or taste are always going to vary within a personality type.  \n\nEdit: to the answer the question, I am serious Christian who mostly aligns with the Nazarene denomination but attends a non-denom church
14	Yep, non-denominational Christian over here.
13	Yeah non denominational Christian and pretty serious about it 
9	2 pretty words. Albert Camus 
8	Idk about others, but not me. I think that much of humanity's religious perceptions are fanciful and self-centered. There may be some truth behind most religions (partly because I can't prove or disprove the existence of certain claims), but much of their foundations and beliefs are illogical or simply a remix of past religions. However, I don't mind if others believe in their preferred religion; I just don't care for it myself.
4	Absolutely.\n\nIt’s only logical.
3	Hell naw
3	Agnostic atheist, but I totally respect religion. I’d even call me a cultural Christian, but at the end of the day, the entire concept of spirituality seems superfluous.
3	Committed Pastafarian.
7	Self taught Christian here
2	Anti-theist
2	Honestly a better distribution in the comments than I expected given that this is Reddit.\n\nThough I myself am an atheist for now.
2	Somewhat agnostic, really don't think too much about it
2	I totally support whatever people feel called to and respect them for finding a devotion. It's just not for me. I don't believe, and that's ok.
2	Not at all, and my parents are religious. 
2	Ti doms who believe in a magic man in the sky. Now I have seen everything.. 
2	Secular humanist. Woowoo shit has no place in my life. 
2	I'm a christian, (though admittedly not a particularly good one) for me it came down to a form of logic.\n\nI have never been convinced that a chemical reaction as complex as a microorganism could come about by pure chance. Also, there was always the question of what came before the big bang? There had to be some reason for all that energy to be in one place. Through that, I knew that something had to have created the universe, and life. After that, I assumed that any God who would create the universe would have to be worshiped somehow, and for a very long time, and consistently through time. That more or less settled it to the God of the Abrahmic faiths. And after meeting and discussing with Christians, Jews, Muslims, Mormons, heck even satanists; I found that the Christians seemed to have the most positive lives, and the strongest faith.   
3	Big fan of some of the friends and community I've developed from church but have zero belief in religion/god(s).
2	No
2	I am indifferent to religion. 
3	I have a strong religious belief that all religion is man-made nonsense originally intended as a benevolent guide but clearly twisted into a malevolent control mechanism and used to manipulate weak-minded people who seek comfort from the harsh truths of reality.  Science killed god, but god was an essential tool that helped us survive long enough to find science.  Nothing more.\n\nedit: downvoted for my beliefs! lol how darest thou?
4	Ew, no. 
2	Nope.
2	Not anymore
1	I used to be a strong believing Christian before I started investigating Calvinism and Arminianism - basically, free will vs determinism. If free will exists then it becomes a works-based religion, but if determinism exists then all those people going to hell were always predestined to go there.  \nPersonally, I'm a physicalist, pretty sure I'm a hard determinist, though I'm open to compatibilism if someone can prove that there is a difference between predictability and choosing from a predictable set of options.  \nBut then you've also got the problem of - what if this is all a simulation? How do you know anything is real or if God is even lying to you? When it comes to questions like this you just have to admit that you don't know. Just live your life or kill yourself and find out what's on the other side.    \nPersonally, I've never seen any miracles, praying to God never did anything, etc. Though the lessons I've learnt from being a Christian have stuck with me for my life. There are some great moral lessons you can learn from the Bible.
1	I believe in the almighty V8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egSwfPKOX1c
1	I know two ISTPs one is non religious the other is a heavily devoted Christian.
1	Im agnostic, but i dont care much about religion like i used to, once i descovered my believes...
1	I don't see myself as a religious person. I've always disliked religious stuff. I don't follow any denomination or sect. My mom could rarely  force me to church and when she did, I slept through all of it. Lol even now I don't go. They do unessacary stuff, they twist the Word around for their own benefit and most of them are fake (atleast in my town).\n\nIf asked I would say a Christian or a Believer. I just accept and trust in Jesus for my salvation and read the Scriptures. 
1	I'm an ex atheist now a Heathen. I didn't even know I was a Heathen until I started looking into it and realised I agree with almost all of the ideals of Heathenry. It's a pretty broad church if you will excuse the pun with very little dogma. I'm not a member of any Kindred or Hearth (Heathen for a church or group)  I practice my faith alone in wild places which is what I found attractive about it in the first place. I think it's down to developing Ni in my late 30s early 40s. My best mate who introduced me to Myers Brigg is INFP says he finds ISTP with developed Ni a mixture of amusing and quite scary but then.. he would. 
1	No way in hell. (ha)
0	i try, but its tough, its more of a challenge. i take parts from each religion and see whether it is logical or not, form my own belief system and morals. most are catholic based, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. imo, parts of hinduism and buddism isn't bad at all (logically) though i highly doubt 'heaven' is becoming some sort of a monk prophet with some meditation superpowers, yadda yadda yadda, that's garb. \n\nin all reality, it would be great to have a wish box, and put in your wishes. though logically thinking, what kind of a life would we be living in if everything we wished for came true? the bs part is nobody knows what happens after you die, in some ways its possible you turn into bacteria, bugs, grasshoppers, etc and your conscious will somehow have to be transferred to that of an egg in a woman's womb by food chain or whatever the means, which could possibly take hundreds if not thousands of years. that aside, gl being that egg that gets fertilized. heaven or hell is more like of a metaphor, what your next life is, (i.e. get aborted for example would be hell, becoming a rich bloke living it up and dying at 100 would be heaven) that only applies to humans, however. what if you end up being a cow? slaughter houses aint pretty. now if we were all hippie communists, perhaps life would be neutral, though that's not gonna happen since every life is different. idk that's my sort of beliefs, it's rather painful to think about, but only difference aside from \n\nA. having lived your life, and ONLY your life, thus since the universe is going to repeat itself after it winds back down from its' expansion, you will repeat your life in your own shoes again in the same exact form OR \n\nB. collective consciousness, where you experience every living thing (or any living thing that's capable of consciousness), and then you have to feel everything everyone has felt before, fuck that shit, literally worst case scenario\n\nyea, i wrote an essay; highschoolers feel free to use this for your highschool project\n\nedit: it's appears as its logical enough that someone got offended by it LOL, why don't you challenge me by replying? nope, too much of a vagina
3	ISTP Lawyers?	Is there any lawyer in this sub? Can istps do it?
16	Not a lawyer, but ISTPs can do anything. That's generally our skill. We study and tinker around to see how it works. Then, we get it done.
3	Lawyer here. ISTP is a great personality for one.
2	If you don’t mind massive workloads, it can be. I was going to go to school in a degree of Philosophy and PolSci to become a lawyer but the more I learned about the career, the more offputting it became. Looking to do something with intelligence now.
2	Here I'm studying. My 2nd year. It's been quite nice quite messy. Some areas where easier for me than others. Maybe because of my own interests, maybe because some areas are quite more practical to learn than others. I like reading, but when it comes to abstract subjects it's when I lack of patience, like judicial philosophy or doctrine in general. But everything else that's more specific, that involves practical application, or about systems kinda gets easier on my head. Nonetheless, i think it's a career that demands quite a lot of discipline. Reading wasn't always my favourite activity. I kinda need to move and do things. But if you can make yourself the habit, you could make good results. Once you learn well and understand everything, you'll see the results.\n\nTL;DR = It's a cool career if you can find your jam. You'll confront both theorical and practical knowledge. Once you get a study method you could be able to master it. What could excite you is the fact that law is everywhere, and you could feel like having a Swiss knife. One that'll help you see the world in a position of advantage. But we'll. That's just my perspective
1	How’s your summer going?	What’s up, fellow ISTPs? Long time. How’s summer? What is everyone up to?
12	Not dead... so good?
5	I'm cycling right now. Also, often going to swimming pool, so far so good.
6	Same as the rest of the year. \n\nExcept fewer students to deal with. \n\nLovin’ it. 
3	When I’m not working or working out, I’m playing games in ice cold ac because it’s been humid as shit all summer here in the northeast.
3	im alive, so thats good i guess.
3	Smoke weed, fortnite, make beats, workout, pool
3	Internship. No pay but the work is fun.
3	I told myself I was going to get a job... and then I didn’t 
2	Eh. It's better than the last couple of years, but I have way too many summer assignments that I've procrastinated... school starts in like a month rip.
2	I'm incredibly peopled-out.\nMy husband and I run a local attraction during the summer, so for July and August, we are working 70 hours per week.  That's 10 hours per day WITH THE PUBLIC.\nWe have quiet periods, but we also have 5-6 staff members there with us as well, so it's always socializing.\n\n 
2	Was kinda iffy on moving out of Texas, but this Summer heat made me 100% sure I have to get out of here after graduating next year from college.
2	Working in a few tiring summer jobs... otherwise I don't do nuffin except watching some anime...
2	Lol half of it was meh and disaster, the other half coming along very well.
14	mid 30 ISTP (possible INTP) career advice	I actually just found out about MBTI and took 2 tests. One told me that I'm INTP and the other said ISTP. When I looked at the traits of sensors vs. intuitives I am right in the middle I think.\n\nAnyway, I hate my job, hate my boss (late 60s woman who has all traits of horrible boss), the job made me super depressed. I seriously need to start over as this career field is not something I want to pursue anyway.\n\nI thought it's interesting that the stereotype ISTP is engineer because I am far from the engineer type although I do like machines, very quick at learning various softwares, etc. But I was never good at math in school hence I didn't even think myself as a science type of person  who is logical.\n\nI went to school for music and got a master also. Worked in Hollywood for a while, hated it (now that I learned about MBTI, I see why I hated it), and took some time off before I got my current job. It really was supposed to be a temporary job  until I figure out what I want to do. But money is always important to me (not really a starving artist type that won't give up pursuing art) and I became very good at my job. (One thing I've known about myself is that I'm a very quick learner/adapter.)\n\nBut really, I need to leave and I've been thinking and researching for the past 3 years.\n\nI hate routine. I can't stand going to work in the morning, come home in the evening, take weekends off, just like million other people. And I definitely need to work alone if not, with one or two people.\n\nI've been told that I'm a good leader and good at making plans/organizing.\n\nSince I went to two private schools (bachelor's and master's) I don't think I can afford going back to school again. Also with mortgage payments, taking time off isn't an option.\n\nThe idea of being my own boss sounds awesome but I hate having to promote my work through networking with people.
6	I'm 46 and like you in many ways.\n\nI've worked many support roles over the years. Find something you like to do and you're good at.  At one point i used to be on some great shift work of 6 on, 8 off, night shift. I used the days off to motorcycle everywhere.\n\n
6	Dude, I think all of us under the age of like 35 need career advice
5	> Worked in Hollywood for a while, hated it  \n\nFake people, everywhere
18	What does Ni (Introverted Intuition) mean for you?	Does it have a positive effect?
19	I think it really helps put everything in perspective. It’s noted that a lot of healthy ISTPs are detachedly optimistic about life, always thinking that even if some or a lot of things go bunk, it’ll be fine in the end, or at least they’ll learn to live with it. It’s how I am and I think well-developed Ni is the reason for it. I guess it’s how I defeated the infamous “WTF Years” we all go through. \n\nLike Bruce Lee said, “be like water.”
13	My Ni is pretty unhealthy. It’s mostly just paranoid thoughts about the future, other people and how negative things will happen if I do this or that.
11	Introverted Intuition is basically awareness of your thoughts, emotions, and feelings going on within yourself. It gets a bad wrap because if you're high on the Introverted Inuition scale you're more likely to overthink prior input instead of seeking out new experiences, which can lead to depression/anxiety. However having Ni also improves your metacognition so you're able to recognize changes within your self, you're aware of your strengths and weaknesses, and it also builds a solid foundation for self-improvement because you're more intune with yourself and what makes you happy.
6	For me, it has positive and negative effects.\n\nNi manifests as gut feelings. It also allows me to strategize and see connections between things. Probably helps with problem solving though I'm not exactly sure how.\n\nBut it makes anxious about the future, especially if I’m in a bad place or in a situation that I know I need to change eventually.
2	Gut feeling bby x
1	yes, without it i would just continually spiral until i’ve hit the rock bottom of WTF years. another user described it as being “detachedly optimistic” and i agree wholeheartedly because even when i spiral into negative thoughts, though it sometimes takes a few days, i eventually realize that this is just a small bump in the world and will be inconsequential in 5 or 10 years so i shouldn’t spend any more time on this. 
4	INTJ crushing on an ISTP	Dear ISTPs, I could use your advice. INTJ (F) here that has been crushing on an ISTP for almost a year now. We go to the same gym, we have some passing friendliness and I would put $100 on the fact he likes me too. However, INTJs are famously reserved - as quiet and private as ISTPs. We are also rarely the initiator. After staring at me for the past year I think he has recently broken the Ti impasse and tried to make a move on me but I freaked out and blanked him so our most recent exchange looked like this:\n\nINTJ; ISTP, I have to apologise to you, I think I accidentally blanked you last night when you were trying to talk to me  \nISTP; No, it's okay. Why did you blank me?  \nINTJ; I don't know, I think you make me nervous   \nISTP; <Smiles winsomely>  \nINTJ; <Nervously> Um, okay, thanks then, um have a good night. <Runs off - for was at the gym>  \n\n\nBloody hell, what do I do? Useless nervous, shy INTJ ...  \n
15	>INTJs are famously reserved - as quiet and private as ISTPs. We are also rarely the initiator.\n\nIf you asked me I'd say you're leaning a little too heavily on our favorite four-letter 21st century horoscopes to at best excuse and at worst dictate your behavior.\n\n>Bloody hell, what do I do?\n\nYou... talk to him?  I'm not sure how you expect this to work without putting in a modicum of effort.  The rules of cause and effect don't just dissolve in the arena of romance.\n\nHas a year of being passive gotten you the results you wanted?  We can't jack into the ISTP collective conscience and say "hey bro, this chick at the gym likes you, go for it homes" for you.
5	Istps are generally pretty independent and like people to make moves on them generally. So Ik it's probably really hard, it is for me as well, but sometimes you just have to go against nerves and just do it. Istps like straight forward stuff so be that way and hopefully it goes well :) ama any other concerns you may have
5	Cut the mbti thing and talk to him, mbti isn’t a user manual for life, this is a common situation that has no link with mbti. You like him you talk to him, at worse he’ll say no but there’s no reason he’d do that \n\nIf I look at things like you, through mbti, I’d be tempted to say « lmao INTJ at gym. As credible as INFP doing maths. »\n\nJust invite him for a drink, 1 yr is too long, if that were me I’d be into someone else since a long time 
1	I am an ISTP, I’d say Russian roulette him. We love and get off on directness. Most of the time, I’m not even paying attention to my own feelings about someone but if they came up to me, shoot over a text (the less formal, the better) and said they were into me, I’d start going inside and thinking to myself, “Do I want to give it a go with this person?” Pretty simple.\nBut in life, you play big, lose big. Worst case is rejection but better rejection than to waste your precious time. Other options, other fishes, this guy is an idiot/know your worth (if he says no), move on. \nRegarding formality, text: good, long winded formal letter: I think: want too much commitment, what’s with this long confessional letter of emotions? Triggers flight mode, ignore you. A text is better because he will feel less “put upon”.\nMy pickup line has always, infamously been: (points to self) “You into this? Want to get something to eat?” Fairly simple, rarely struck out. Even when I do, who cares? Moving on. It’s just a person. There are billions out there. I don’t take rejection personally. I know I’m pretty great lol (sorry for being so frank but why beat around the bush? Again, wasting time sucks).
2	Any ISTP nurses out there? How do you like it?	I like working as an EMT. The critical thinking and not knowing what to expect keeps the job interesting. I am also more social than your average ISTP. Unfortunately, it doesn't pay well, so I plan on going to nursing school next year.\nI'd love to be a trauma or CCT nurse, but am open to other fields as well.\n\nAre there any downsides to being an ISTP RN? 
3	I was a nurse for many years.\n\nAs an istp I mean what I say and say what I mean. You don’t need to read between the lines when I speak. I also take things said to me at face value. I don’t read between lines very well when spoken to.\n\nTherefore I have a great deal of difficulty communicating with women.\n\nGood luck. Ignore me at your own risk. Nursing is dominated completely by women. There are a few men, but it is still a feminine profession. Stay an EMT. Use nursing as a way to progress in that profession.
3	24-female& istp. Been nursing for 1 year and 8 months. My very first day of university I knew nursing was not for me. But I stuck it out cause I hate to quit and I'm indecisive and didn't have any other option. I work on a surgical floor. I don't like it. I don't care about the ppl I serve most of the time. I just care about doing my job right and efficiently. I have an Interview for the ICU tomorrow we'll see how that goes. I don't even like the medical field! I don't know what to do. However I do get a sudden rush and surge of adenaline and excitement when a pt goes sour or codes. However it's still in the context of nursing which I'm opposed to and it's very short lived, until I'm back to menial tasks again. Not sure if all istps could relate to that. But that's me and where I am. Best of luck to you. \n \nALSO: To add, I think the down side of nursing is that it forces us to engage with our fe a lot. Not enough Se depending on where you work. I have a penchant for not liking  health care to begin with which maybe particular to myself. 
2	I'm a high school student who was looking into nursing as a possible career a couple months back. Working in the ER unit sounds amazing as I work well under pressure and I'd be able to utilize countless skills on a wide variety of patients. I was also attracted to the thought that nurses don't take their work home with them... and since I'm definitely not the most emotional/caring (deep down, I am--but not upfront like many patients and families would need me to be), an intense environment that I can put out of my head once I clock out sounds perfect. The schedules are also super flexible. Like, you can decide to work a couple of 12 hour shifts and then have multiple days off in a row. \n\nBut I eliminated nursing as a potential career for myself because I don't think I'd be able to completely serve another person. It sounds terrible, but I don't think I'd be able to go and fetch someone a Pepsi from the cafeteria or wipe the vomit off of their chin... and I don't think I'd be able to always be below the leading doctor (Ik nurses are vital and that a doctor wouldn't be able to perform without their expertise...). I also hate biology, and there are other fields that just interest me more. \n\nI'm still really interested in healthcare—but I think pharmacy (I like the science of it a lot) and dentistry are a better match for me. Engineering is my first choice right now, though. 
105	Me irl	
29	The struggle is real. 
25	Fellow classmate comes behind you while working on laptop, gives you back massage. You thinks she's flirting with you. You then realize she's trying to destress you bc you've been an independent boy for 3 hours. Now comes confusion and questioning of every interaction with every girl from then on out - istp life
15	I guess ISTP males would fit the stereotype of certain guys being smart but completely clueless about social cues, aside from standard ones ingrained from years of repetition. 
7	It's pretty funny how real this is to me
10	Girls are fucking confusing man. I swear they don’t even know what they want. How the hell are *we* supposed to figure it out? 
11	According to my GF, I'm the worst flirter she ever met. Hell, ain't even able to tell when somebody is flirting with me. That's the reason why I think nobody was flirting with me my whole life (but they were...)\n\nThere was a coca cola commercial once, where they put people's first name on label and when a person gave a bottle to another person with his/her name, they kissed. Anyway, I went to a bar buy i drink for me and my GF, I ordered also coca cola. Bartender took bottle from a fridge and said "Look, Michelle, that's me!". My analytic skill kicked in and without hesitation replied "That's great, I'm John". There was an awkward pause between us and I was wondering, if she wants to be invited to a date for a second (but she wasn't pretty enough I would marry her)...so I paid and left.\n\nGF heard this conversation and she told me, the bartender was flirting and she wanted a kiss.
5	Just assume she's flirting, then flirt back a bit and look at how she responds.
3	every damn time
2	Lmfao when I'm drinking I can get pretty intense talking to people. A friend asked me if I had a crush or was flirting with this guy at a party. I had to tell her fuck no that dude wasn't even remotely my type but thought it was hilarious. 
0	how to beat..?	how do you beat an istp?,just for fun,how would you beat an istp if you were to challenge them in a roast battle?
14	Why would an ISTP accept the challenge to participate in the roast? If I was challenged to one, I'd raise an eyebrow, smirk, say no thanks, and keep on walking to wherever I had planned
6	[deleted]
4	I don’t think you can really roast them because they don’t care enough...\nMind games are pointless.\n\nI also feel like they kind of enjoy mean banter, or being called out on their bullshit, but anytime I try to be mean to my ISTP friends they just laugh at me...although I could just be really bad at being mean.\n\nIn my experience many are confused by their feelings, if they’re having any, but I don’t think it’s very nice to make fun of someone for that.

6	Is it worth it to fight falling into wtf years.	Broke up with my SO for cheating. Don't have a permanent residence. Have no money and I owe a lot. Family won't take me back. Car just broke down.\n\nI'm trying so hard to keep my head above the water but is it worth it? Am I going to fail regardless or do I keep fighting this urge to sit back and allow myself to fall into the ever so infamous wtf years.
10	If you don’t do anything about it, you’ll end up where youre currently at. If you try to improve somehow, you’ll get somewhere. Slowly but surely itll get you somewhere better than where you are now. \n\nIts difficult and might not seem like its worth it now, but once you get there and look back, you’ll realize how far you’ve come. 
5	Yes, that's the only way to get out. Might as well start now.
4	Is it worth falling into wtf years? In a word - no.\n\nI spent more than 10 years of my life in wtf years, or as a like to call them, my long dark teatime of the soul. I wish I had known about them when I slowly slipped into them, burying emotions after a painful breakup - I would have tried my best to fight and avoid them. Looking back at them I came to the realization that I was not living my life - life just happened to me.\n\nWillingly surrendering to them means ignoring the strength that you have inside of yourself, strength to face the adversities that life throws at you and overcome them by any means at your disposal. Ignoring that strength, you resign yourself to being passive, at the mercy of the events that you may or may not have control over - things might go for the better, they might not (in my personal experience, they do not). In that state, you do not live your life - life just happens to you. \n\nThings might look bleak now, but you are at the beginning of a road towards a better life. Looking down that road, worrying that there is so much that could go wrong and cause you pain could scare and discourage you from taking it, but break that long road down into smaller, easier sections (smaller goals), take the strength that you have inside of yourself and start achieving them one by one. There will be successes and setbacks, but ever time you achieve one of them you will be in a better position than you started from, feel better and be encouraged to continue towards the end of the road.\n\nThis method and "can do" attitude that comes out of it was one of the things that enabled me to exit my long dark, go from obese to normal weight, be better at my job and more open towards others around me. When I look at myself now and how I was a few years back, the change is nothing short of amazing.\n\nDo not resign yourself to dark thoughts of failure and fight for your life. You have the strength inside of you - use it!
3	Wtf years are when you don’t engage your Se and fall into Ti-Ni loops. My wtf years were mid-HS through college. I became anxious about the future, would talk myself out of doing things, didn’t socialize much, abused drugs, stayed in bad situations. I spent a ridiculous amount of time just thinking, reading/researching random shit, and reddit. I realized I was being antisocial, but I just didn’t really want to socialize that much even though it was good for me.\n\n I still managed to get through my engineering degree during that time and have various jobs and relationships. I always made sure I had my important stuff covered - I wouldn’t reccomend that you abandon work/school.\n\nTo get out of wtf years you have to engage Se. just do stuff, don’t overthink it. After doing that for a while, I realized I had stopped worrying so much about the future and became more engaged with life. It was weird because I didn’t really realize I was in my wtf years until after I got out of them. \n\nI still fall into periods of Ti-Ni loops though.
2	i don’t think there’s a right answer to this question, because wtf years look pretty different from person to person. i willingly jumped into my wtf years (like 3 years) black hole after i got my heart broken, and i have some great memories from those loose, drug and booze filled days. that said, i always had my life shit on lock. i went to work, paid my bills, did well in school, etc etc. i was just dead inside for a while. i should also mention there were weeks i didn’t eat in order to pay the bills, it wasn’t always easy. thankfully my vices all came to me free through friends and lovers. \nanyway. if you decide to let go and fuck around for a while, just make sure it’s not to the detriment of future you. you don’t want to “come out if it” and have nothing left but a city of ruin where your somewhat promising life used to be. best of luck <3
2	wtf years are just a code word for depression. Depression is not a good path to go down.
0	Don't expect loyalty from hoes. Focus on urself. Pump & Dump xx
7	INFP car guy here	I know you ISTP car guys are out there. If you had a 1995 Trans Am with a locked up LT4 engine, what would you replace it with? The trans is still intact, so I kinda want to keep it. Anyone know what will bolt up? I have a limited budget.
8	That's easy, LSx and T56.\n\nBut if you live in a smog state like I do you're SOL. You have to keep it stock-looking to pass smog testing. \nHow is the LT4 locked up? Like the crank is frozen?
4	5.3 truck LS. Should be able to get swap harnesses no problem. You can spend later for horsepower upgrades, junkyard 5.3s with turbos are hugely popular with the drift guys because they’re cheap and reliable, and make a ton of horsepower.

1	While I applaud you for coming to seek mechanical advice from ISTP’s, an MBTI subreddit isn’t the best spot this kind of question...
1	I’d replace it with a Subaru.
155	How to not get promoted at work	
49	Gets mild correction at work... "so this is how it ends"
20	It's not necessarily an attack, you just feel like they doubt the dependability on your abilities :/
17	It’s all about the tone man. I hate when superiors talk to me with that cutesy tone you talk to children with. Bitch I’m a full grown man. Give me an assignment and leave me the fuck alone to do it. Don’t stand over my shoulder and talk at me like I’m your 12 year old delinquent child learning English for the first time. 
11	My current situation is on course to get promoted to assistant manager\n\nI might just quit first. It's a daily struggle. Good for future on a resume if I don't stay long term vs fuck em they can burn. Choices. A younger me would have left already. 
11	This is why I’m glad I went into the military after high school. \n\nPutting one’s ego away at work becomes a habit. 
9	I feel personally attacked.\n\n...\n\nAnd after saying that I think I might be a mistyped ENFP
4	LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL\n\nedit: forgot to note that today is my performance evaluation and i feel 100% attacked 
4	Eh, personally I’m fine with being told to do something 90% of the time. But good luck if you tell me HOW to do it.
2	Oof
1	That’s one of the things I really love about my job, people tell me what to do all day but instead of getting mad I learn from them because they have 15 years experience on my and I’m the apprentice, it’s my job to do what they say and learn from them
1	Killed me.\n\nAs a software engineer, I get micro managed at my new job because I'm still on the junior-mid side. With the latest project they gave me, I decided I wanted to finish it within a 3rd of the time they set for me. I think that'll do.\n\nTake it in stride; show 'em who's boss, if you think you can. 
6	23M OKC personality. I've always knew I'm more affectionate than the average ISTP.	
1	What kind of test is this?
8	What are y'alls Enneagram types, and what level of emotional development are you?	I find the concept of mixing 'base personality types' with emotional well-being & growth very interesting, and am wondering which types are the most common here.\n\nI myself am a female ISTP / Type 8w7 – currently going through a rough patch and temporarily stuck at a shitty unfulfilling job so probably around level 5.  Used to be level 2/3 \n\n*For those unfamiliar with it, [here's a link to the test](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test), although [this website](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions) offers better descriptions.*
4	9w8. \n\nJust broke off a relationship which is really difficult for 9s so I'm probably at least average. It's hard to tell bc things are so tumultuous at the moment.\n\nBefore the break up I was definitely hovering at around 6 so if things keep up hopefully I'll keep moving up.
3	Balanced 8.
3	solid 8 no wing, fluctuate between levels 1-3 usually. did a lot of hard work to not be an asshole when i was in my early 20s. haha
2	9w1 at level 2
2	Balanced 5 
2	9w8. Currently probably around level 4.\n\nI'm surprised you're an 8. That seems like it would be pretty uncommon for ISTPs - or any IxxPs really.
2	> It is not clear from these test results which Enneagram type and wing you are.\n\n\nLOL. It’s best guess was 9w1 though. I think the issue is my answers. Aside from my baseline personality, I also suffer from clinical depression, anxiety, and ADD. So these tests can be kind of hard for me. I’ll give my natural response, but then I’ll kinda think of the question applied to my life and realize my answer is different because of the way those conditions affect my mental processes. \n\n\nIt also said it was unable to determine my type, I could fit into 5 or 9. \n\n\nEdit: After reading the descriptions on the second link you provided, I am probably equal parts 5 and 9 to be honest. I’d say part 5 is my nature as I’ve been a textbook investigator since early childhood. I always needed to know how things worked and I was a huge fan of disassembly and reassembly to better understand something. Part 9 probably came from nurture. A huge part of my compassion and peacemaking comes from my mom who preferred to deconstruct problems to find a realistic solution as opposed to just straight up punishment. \n\n\nBut essentially, I apply type 5 to type 9. I approach people’s problems and issues the same way I do watches and cars. I take in as much info as possible, I deconstruct it, and then I put it back together with a better understanding of how to proceed. Me being a mixture of type 5 and 9 probably explains why I’m able to give world class advice. 
1	I got "5w6 or 9w1." But looking at \n\n>Intellectual Nines, especially males, frequently mistype as Fives, but Fives are intellectually contentious whereas Nines are conciliatory and conflict avoidant.\n\nI feel as though I fall more into the 9w1. Not that I consider myself an "intellectual," but because I typically avoid conflict.\n\nSo 9w1.
1	5w6 apparently.  \nMale ISTP, 27.  \nAlone for almost 9 years
1	5w6 or 6w5\n\nType 6 - 10.3\n\nType 5 - 10\n\nType 9 - 6.7\n\nType 7 - 6.4\n\nType 3 - 5.7\n\nI see large parts of myself in all of the types, though... even the ones I didn't score high on. I took the shorter test and got Type 5 with the 4 Wing.
1	Just took it, 5w6 here.\nType 5 - 11.4\nType 6 - 8.4\nType 9 - 8\nType 7 - 6.4\nType 4 - 6.4\n\nLooking through the thread it doesn't seem like any strong patterns are really picking up outside of 5 and/or 9 being in the top 3 for a lot of people.
1	5w6
1	Type 5 or 7. I think I was a 7 as a kid, but I think I’ve been ascending into a five. 
1	5w6
1	Female(24) 6w5\n
1	5w6 Male 22
1	8w9 \n\n\nLevel 4 sounds like the ideal to me. \n\n\nI like being in control of myself and myself alone, I feel no need to control others, because I don't need others. Lol at how ridiculous that sounds but I love it. \n\n\nI also relate to much of the 5. I want a house, acreage and workshop so I can do as I please. I think I am an 8 so I can become a 5. 
1	I am a female Istp 9 at level 2 I think. For the longest time I was stuck at level 5/6. But recently had some heartbreak which forced me to get my stuff together. I also ran back to Jesus lol. So I am extremely fullfilled right now.
1	8w7 854 tritype, I've been told. 
1	9w8
0	16F, more people should post their okcupid profiles.	
13	16, and on okc?
1	[This does](https://m.imgur.com/EDitudM) sound like me, I guess!
1	Why does your not have romantic? Is it if you're in the middle, it doesn't show?\n\nI don't even remember my OKC login.
1	15F... I did one of the tests but then realized I wouldn't come close to OG OP's 500 question dedication lol. Is this the app or desktop? Might do it again (I got weirded out and quit)
17	Normal friendship behavior going above and beyond?	As an ISFJ, I didn't thinking coming into this friendship with an ISTP would bode well. She had a reputation for being cold, indifferent, stoic... just the typical generalizations you hear about ISTPs. As we got to know each other during the first year, we took turns teasing, flirting and more or less figuring each other out. We were able to develop a strong nonverbal understanding that we trust each other and most importantly, respected each other's need for privacy. Throughout all this, she made a note to make me feel appreciated (which is important to ISFJ) whenever I did something that was unexpected.\n\nLike my ISFJ type suggests, we express ourselves to those we care about by helping them out to the fullest, or providing food to keep them happy. In turn, she would slowly mirror my actions and began to pick up on my body language and sensitivity and adapt herself around it. Despite being an ISTP, she put up with me for the most part and helped out when she could by offering to listen or giving me some food (kryptonite).\n\nIn year 2 we didn't spend too much time together, but I felt we had more quality moments where we became more physically comfortable to the point where we would hug or share more personal things with each other. I made a point to learn more about ISTP to reciprocate her efforts.\n\nMoving on to year 3, things seem to have taken quite a turn. the ISTP seems to have made a conscious effort to "speak my language" by referencing nicknames, inside jokes or recalling little details from the past. By now, it seems like we take turns to try to out-do each other to show affection. With some help of liquid courage, we exchanged " I love yous" and it seems we've reach a point that we truly appreciate each other without saying it. I recently took on a big project at work that I've been stressing out on, and she's voluntarily texted me first thing in the morning (which never happens) to see how I was doing. \n\nAt this point I feel like this ISTP has totally figured me out and I've never seen this level of affection, consideration, attentiveness, effort directed towards me. Ive even had a mutual friend tell me the ISTP adores me. I'm grateful for everything, but the lines are starting to get blurry.\n\nIs this just them being comfortable with a close friend? gradually developing a relationship with someone? testing the waters? Slow commitment phase?
15	I mean, hey, we still have pretty good Fe. It's not like it's our blindspot or anything. It's better than half of the other types. Though it all depends on the individual maturity of the ISTP. What is probably true is that we are more insecure about it because it is our weakest **conscious** function. We care a lot about other people's feelings - consider the fact that we have 8th slot Fi and rarely make decisions according to our own motivations. We have a bad habit of letting people treat us like doormats sometimes. Though that applies to most Fe users, just in different ways. It's important to know that we are Ti doms, very much like the INTP. We like to maintain our Ti ego and can be insensitive a lot of the time. But still doesn't mean we don't care for people. We just like to be right.  \nHere are some good links explaining why we repress Fe so much:  \n[Maturity](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119940701537/mbti-development-istp)  \n[Fe grip](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/135002965032/how-functions-work-inferior-fe-istpintp)  
5	The place you're in currently is a nice but fragile phase. Once she gets too comfortable, she's going to be more speaking her mind around you. Which means she might accidently say something a little offensive or controversial. \n\nYou have to be very careful that a fight that ends your relationship doesn't break out.\n\nMy best friend who I've hung out with constantly for 7 years is an isfj.\n\nI try to consider his emotional sensitivity but sometimes I get frustrated on his lack of logic in any situation.\n\nMost fights we've gone into is a direct result of him taking criticism usually in the form of friendly banter too personally. He usually escalates the conflict from there. The whole process of logical argument becomes non-existent for him and he starts acting like a baby.\n\nObviously, not all isfjs are as emotionally fragile as him but try to understand the things we istps say are never meant to attack you or belittle you. Even if it feels that way.\n\n\n
3	Sounds like you need to have the “define the relationship” talk
3	It could be a romantic thing. But I (ISTP) don't go this far out of my way for even romantic things. I think it's something else.\n\nIf this were me, and I've been known to do this for specific people, exactly as you are describing. I can only explain it like this: this person thinks you are *important*.\n\nThat's a higher level than "I wanna get you in bed", it means they see something in you that needs elevating. Needs supporting and encouragement because they think you are going to do good things.\n\nI don't really know how else to describe it, even though we're not feely people, we can still have a sense of duty to care for those who we think have a purpose.
2	[deleted]
2	This is definitely her being comfortable with you as a close friend, maybe a relationship developing, but I'm not sure if it's one or the other because the only close friend I've had I developed a relationship with.  
6	Am I a Istp	I have taken tests from keys2cognition,idrlabs and 16 personalities. I scored Istp and estp mainly.\n\nTook a ennegram test and got a 7w8 a d again a 8w7.\n\nSome of these profiles on istp dont fit me but im aware profiles arent the most accurate.\n\nI hate asking for help\n\nSome info\n\n+When im with family and friends i can be loud,silly/goofy and joke around. I do like to laugh and make people laugh. But only people close to me.\n\n+Being around family,friends,co workers etc is draining for me for long periods of time. There are very few people i can be around all the time that im good with like my wife.\n\n+I tend to get irritated easily.\n\n+I HATE being told what to do and having people breathe down my neck.\n\n+At work I usually put my headphones in and work. I'll conversate here and there. My co workers say I dont talk much. Im just there to make money.\n\n+Unlike my co workers My wife would say im loud and extraverted.\n\n+For my job I do use machinery and fix things. I enjoy my job. I like to build and figure things out.\n\n+For fun i make halloween masks and props.\n\n+I am a huge horror and scifi fan.\n\n+I made a movie room as I love movies and collect Star Wars and horror.\n\n+I fish,camp,hike and sometimes play football\n\n+I work out all the time\n\n+I prefer to relax whenever I can. \n\n+I game frequently\n\n+logical and base most of my desicions if its logical. There are times My feelings get in the way\n\n+I hate talking about my feelings \n\n+Always learning new info on things that intetest me.\n\n+Act first mostly\n\n+energetic and can come off chaotic and sporadic. I prefer the word spontaneous.\n\n+Blunt.\n\n+When I need something done I get it done usually asap or wben I feel like it.\n\n+I do not let others walk all over me\n\n+stubborn
3	Possibly. Don't dwell too much on it, as all humans are unique, and even if 16personalities gives you an ISTP result, you may vary heavily from other ISTPs. For example, if judging by 16personalities' personality descriptions, some parts of me suit ISTJ and INTJ/ISTP better than ISTP. However, overall, I am still ISTP dominant, so I am an ISTP. Other traits, like Intuitive or Judging, may also be active, but less so than my primary ISTP traits. There is no way to measure all aspects of a person's personality, so I take MBTI as just a general guideline for how a person might behave in certain situations based on their personality type. \n\nThat's the long answer. Short answer? It seems likely. 
2	Probably, sounds pretty ISTP
2	On average, ISTPs are enneagram 5. ENTP are 7s, usually 7w8, and ESTP are 8, usually 8w7.\n\nFor example, see this survey:\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/01/mbti-and-the-enneagram-2/9/\n\n7s are generally considered to be unquestionably extroverted, and I believe 8s are up there as well, so I would at least consider the possibility of being an E.
2	You sound like an ISTP whose I is pretty darn close to the E on the scale. It's a spectrum, you can be 100% I, 100% E, or somewhere in the middle.\n\nI'm ISTP but my T is reallllly close to the F, I can go pretty much either way.\n\nBut all in all, you sound like a solid ISTP to me.
0	Hey ISTPs, can you help a fellow logician out and fill out a MBTI Relationship survey?	 [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)\n\nIt's super basic. Please take as many times as you can for current or past relationships that you know MBTI. I'm going to use in my statistical analysis class.\n\nI'll post results when complete.\n\nFeedback is welcome.

7	What?
2	You shouldn't try to type other people. You don't know him or how he processes information. 
20	33/m ISTP OkCupid personality based on 500+ questions	
10	Yeah I really don't like mine. (35F probably ISTP). I'm more mathematical, scientific and literary but less everything else. Quite a lot less polite and friendly than the average woman. That's an ISTP female for ya 😐
7	I'm suspicious as to why you are so trusting  (°-°)  
3	oh yes, i’d love my boyfriend to be more romantic sometimes, however he’s the one to keep me safe and take care of my problems
12	Help with relationship insecurities	Some background: I'm a 17 year old ISTP in a relationship with a 17 year old ESFP and we've been together for over 6 months.\n\nI keep having these insecurities creep up into my mind. I don't know if it's insecurities or whatever, it's like assuming that she isn't happy with me or she's mad at me or she didn't like what I did or stuff like that. This stuff usually comes and goes but I hate that it comes after every few weeks. This stuff makes me act differently towards her than I act towards other people. It makes me act out of fear and not out of love (found out that ESFPs lose respect when their SO do this from an ESFP). I was to feel normal. I want to be strong and unassuming. And I've heard about 'just ask if u have a doubt' when you're feeling insecure, but that sort of shows the other person that you're insecure and I don't want her to lose that respect for me in that way.\n\nI just want to be normal, loving, strong with her and not fake, fearful and weak. This has been going for months and I don't know how I can fix it. I think it's just my TiNi loops overthinking and overanalyzing each situation but it could just be insecurities.\n\nI am not insecure about our relationship. I know she loves me too much. And I know that I do too. But this feeling that I don't understand just creeps up in between our love. \n\nAny ISTPs out there with a similar situation?\n\nEdit: I know that this relationship isn't going hold my hand in life forever. And that relationships in general won't help me fill my belly. Relationships shouldn't be a priority is one's life. I got studies to attend to. I know all that. 
9	That feeling is a beautiful combination of paranoia and desiring to be a perfectionist. You want to be the perfect mate and every single thing that is out of place brings on a creeping dread that everything is falling apart. \n\nJust know if they love you and want the relationship to work they won't sweat the small stuff. 
7	In my experience, this has more to do with your age than your personality type. I wish I could give you answers, but I think it’s just one of those things you have to grow out of. I’ll try to toss some advice at the end of this. \n\n\nBut also, I took a lot of care to correct any insecurities I could. For example, I grew up fat, socially retarded, emotionally retarded, bad hair, horrible clothes, neckbeard, etc. \n\n\nBut as I got older, I realized that my image was causing my insecurities and I could fix it. So I lost 100lb it fat and now I’m up 12lb in muscle. I grew out my buzz cut and started training it for a stylish haircut and now I’ve got pretty damn good looking hair. I trimmed my beard way back to accommodate lack of coverage until it filled in and now I have a nice full beard. I learned how to dress myself. I got in a circle with some super extroverted social butterflies who taught me the way of socializing. \n\n\nHonestly, being an ISTP, I think you’re set up better to get over these kinds of insecurities. Our logical methodical brains are quite good at solving problems. \n\n\nSo the advice I’d give you is this: write it allllll down. Every. Single. Insecurity. Then separate them into two groups: fixable and unfixable. The ones that are fixable, start brain storming and implementing solutions. For the ones that aren’t fixable, start trying to change your perspective. This is a healthy mixture of epicurean and Epictetan philosophy. Change what you can, learn to accept and live with what you can’t. \n\n\nAnd last but not least, patience. Patience is probably the number one virtue in life. Life takes time. Change takes time. 
5	This was somewhat my experience as well (31 M) when I began dating in high school and college. The only thing I wanted to chime in with was that I largely outgrew it as I gained more experience with relationships and confidence within myself. 
3	Sounds like you're dealing with a lot of internal insecurities.\n\nWatch this playlist.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KugjDAH0QyY&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDd-iKFSrhSkrYtRJMlpVUcZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KugjDAH0QyY&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDd-iKFSrhSkrYtRJMlpVUcZ)\n\nRead: No more mr niceguy by Robert Glover
2	Repeat with me young istp: It does not matter in the least what other people think of me. All that matters is what I think of them.\n\nAll the downvotes that comment gets.... are not from istps. And you know what? I don’t care what they think.
1	Your experience is probably vastly different from mine (I have GAD and ADHD) , but I wouldn't rule out a therapist, OP. Not because I think you have a disorder, but having a proper professional to talk to can help decipher and unravel what you are dealing with. They can also give you help and tips for anxiety and relationships that others can't. You're at an age where all of those things are normal, just give yourself the opportunity to not be perfect. No one are. In fact, we all suck at doing life some way or the other.\n\n
2	2 questions! Are you fellow ISTP's ever accused of being 'stuck up'? And when someone can't find a word, how often are you the only one that knows it?	First question - asking for a friend.\n\nSecond question, I've noticed I'm almost always the one doing this.
7	To your first question, kind of. I’m a bit of a jack of all trades. I do a lot of things pretty good, but not many things really well. That extends to my knowledge as well and not just skills. So quite frequently, I know lots of answers to questions posed around me. I typically get called a know it all more than stuck up. But to be honest, I’m not trying to be smart or superior. I just have answer and want to help out 🤷🏼‍♂️. \n\n\nTo your second question, yes. Me and language have always been buddies. I know tons of obscure words and definitions. And I’m really good with spelling and phonetically sounding out words I don’t know. So there’s quite often that there’s a word on the tip of someone’s tongue, and in the only one who can pull it out. And then quite often I correct my roommate on his word choice. He’s horrible at spelling, vocabulary, grammar, the whole shabang. A lot of times he’ll use a similarly sounding word that is incorrect, and I’ll correct him politely. 
3	I've gotten "cold" and "callous" a lot but I can't say I've ever been called "stuck up." But the second one is definitely true for me.
2	people have called me stand offish, but i've never been called stuck up. 
2	I've never been a outright accused of it, but I'm often told to watch my tone or something similar because it sounds stuck up. As for the second one, that's very much me. 
2	My girlfriend thought I was stuck up before she got to know me, like those were her exact words 
2	I have been accused of being stuck up or a bitch, or both. I attribute it to having a different interaction style than most women. I quietly observe and people take that as being stuck up or stand offish.
2	I’m stuck up, so yeah....
1	I haven’t really been called stuck up. I think the phrase millennial use nowadays is too cool 😎 and I’ve been called that on numerous occasions. I’ve been told I look like a model and I often dress in either a suit, business casual, or casual. \n\nPeople often make this assumption about me before they even speak to me based on my appearance and the fact that I’m usually quiet around people I don’t know well. \n\nI also don’t have the habit of speaking to strangers so if I’m on the train I don’t usually strike up random conversations with people, but if I’m approached by someone I won’t flat out ignore them even if they’re asking for spare change.
7	Do people consider you humble	Most people, when i ask them to descripe me say that i'm humble. Do others get this?
31	yes, it's because I'm hesitant to brag because I don't feel there's anything special about what I do, and sometimes take my abilities for granted. But when I holistically sit down and look at my achievements, it is impressive.\n\nPart of it is that I tend to break my obstacles and problems in life into little segments. I hack away at each little thing and get far, but it doesn't feel like I got past any huge goal.
13	depends on how much substance is in my veins at the given time
8	Yes: I never show off, never brag, I fuckin suck at selling myself, but I'm competent, learn fast, and have aptitudes that other's recognize before I even do.\n\nNo: I tend to 1up people in intellect whenever I get the chance. If someone says something that isn't true, I have trouble holding back from saying "[You're wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPD5q6DC43M), because of these reasons."
7	Only people that know me intimately know I'm humble.\n\n To most people I often come out as quite shown-off. \n\nTo people that I care about, I take pride in sharing to them my knowledge or skill and they usually understand that I'm not trying to show-off.
5	My husband does this thing where he downplays his abilities but simultaneously putting himself above people who don't have them. He'll say things like "these are simple things anyone should be able to do. I don't know why more people can't do them."
4	Well when I was a kid I used to brag. But nowadays I cringe when in the spotlight. I just want to live an unassuming life.
4	Yes and no. People consider me humble because I really don't feel like I do anything well, and even when they say what I do is good I just reffuse to accept it. At the same time though, sometimes people tend to assume I'm a bit arrogant or something like that.
4	Bar none, I am the most humble-est\n\nNumber one at the top of the humble list\n\nMy apple crumble is by far the most crumble-est\n\nBut I act like it tastes bad outta humbleness
5	No. I think I'm great, i make sure people know.
2	i was hired for my “candor.” Unqualified but honest AF. I’ve maintained this in every situation despite ones I normally wouldnt be so honestin because it was the reason I was given to had gotten the job, mine as well maintain....?
2	They usually don't know enough about me to make that determination.\n\nI avoid praise for things that I do, because it feels normal to me, but people have said things like "Are you just good at everything you do?" Maybe, I don't pay attention to it much.
1	Not at all. I'm the most dishonorable person when it comes to competition. I don't brag though, so I can see why someone would possibly think that.
3	What do you prefer?	Out of these movie series which do you prefer?\n\nStar wars\nHarry potter\nStar trek\nLord of the rings
19	Shrek.
10	Lord of the rings
5	Lord of da rings brahh
5	Lord of the Rings
5	I never got into any of those as a little kid. If I were to watch them now, though, I think I could enjoy all of them equally. 
5	For Star Wars, I don't really like the prequels and the new trilogy, but I enjoyed the original trilogy. Han Solo was definitely my favorite character. Harry Potter is pretty good for when I want to be reminded of my childhood and don't want anything intense. The latest Star Trek films with Chris Pine were awesome. Not too much drama and plenty of action with fast paced, well developed plots. I didn't really watch the LotR films, but I enjoyed the books and their prequel.
4	LOTR
4	Conjuring 
3	Lotr all the way harry potter second.\n\n star wars and star trek never got me and i don't know why they are so popular. star wars for example it just feels like soap opera in space, huge plot holes, cheesy acting. technology could be interesting, if it was sculpted better so that ripping some random wires won't bypass anything. The jedi training is cluster fuck everyone says it takes years to use the force, but here comes the main character and does it in a day.  the force is said to be some cosmic power in one movie and in the next it's some particles in your blood, pick one and stay with it. Haven't read much of the star wars comics but what i have, i can tell those are better than the movies.\n\nHigh fantasy and dark fantasy in general is my favorite genres. The worlds are usually well sculpted, even tho lotr left some things pretty vague.  lets leave hobbit in it's own corner of shame with that added bullshit and stretching it to a 3 movies. Books are way better\n\nHarry potter, i like the magic and they could have focused more on that aspect. first movies had all the wave your wand certain way and chant the spell. Later movies just point your wand and spit some lazors. Also books better.\n\n
3	Commas, and capitalization..
3	Star Trek TNG
3	Star Trek TNG is my most watched show ever. I've probably watched it all start to finish at least 6 times, plus random reruns on TV. 
2	I love the idea of Star Wars. I really like the technology/ship design, general plot, and stuff like that. But I hate the execution. The only one I didn't groan or laugh out loud at at was Rogue One. The rest are corny, cliche garbage. I have a slight soft spot for 4,5,6 since I kinda grew up with them. \n\nThe latest Star Trek movies are OK, but the premise is kinda ridiculous. A scout ship constantly in enemy territory, with the lamest, weakest weapons available? That makes sense. The series and such were all too TV-friendly for me to care much about it.\n\nI have absolutely zero interest in Harry Potter.\n\nLotR would be the top pick, I guess. Them+the Hobbit movies are done well enough to watch.
2	I was always more a Star Trek person out of any of those. \n\nThough I did enjoy reading the lord of the rings. 
2	In order: LotR, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Star Trek
2	I'm not huge into any of them, but LotR >> Star Trek > Star Wars >>> Harry Potter. I like a couple of the HP movies but can't stand the rest, and really can't stand the fans.
2	Into the wild.
3	Star Wars.  Lord of the Rings books are good, movies aren't.  
1	Star Wars > Star Trek (tv series, have only seen a few movies they were ok) > Lord of the rings > Harry Potter\n\nBut all of them are pretty good. 
1	I haven't seen any full series of any. So I guess none.
1	Empire Strikes Back, Philosopher’s Stone, and The Return of the King
1	As much as I enjoy the other three, Harry Potter.
1	Only one that does nothing for me is Star Trek. Love the other three. 
32	Just some ISTP appreciation	Nothing particularly remarkable to say, but I just helped (read: stood there and passed tools) one of my ISTP friends fix a bike, and I just wanted to say I really admire your approach to tackling a problem. You just explore it head on, and that's a lot of fun- just jumping in and figuring out what the problem is by pulling something apart. I appreciate your practical skills and am working on developing my own, so it's good to learn by doing alongside people like you. Thanks for doing your thing! 
16	I can’t imagine sitting back and staring at a problem and just thinking about it. \n\nSeems like watching a cooking show and then being surprised when food doesn’t appear at the end. \n\nBut I’m glad people wholly unlike me are out there! 
7	Well what problem solving we have logically we lack emotionally so I mean... :)
5	I've always been fascinated by mechanical systems and how they work.  I've found the best way to understand these types of things is to take them apart.  Now I do it for a living.  :)
2	Sounds like you really got the front row seat into our brains, a rare and cool experience. I'm glad you liked it. It's nice to see another person sort of "see it". One struggle for me (because i can only speak for myself, but maybe other istp's have gone through this too) is sort of... seeing and knowing a lot by experiencing and touching something, picking up on all those tiny fine details from even the most nuanced of experiences. Or even being able to tell from a distance from experience with another thing; like say, being an athlete and being able to tell when something is about to fall, from the experience with personal balance and weight. We can do this with a lot of different things, and it can be frustrating when we can't talk about it, or sometimes we can, and others don't believe us? Theres this tendency to be underestimated sometimes that always makes things frustrating. We want to bring it out and show people, or sometimes we feel like it should be more obvious. Idk, this is turning into a ramble. All in all, it's nice to have the talents recognized. I'm very proud of it, but it's rare when i can show someone, or when someone else will pick up on it. Especially if its not like, something artistic. 
1	I don't have any practical skills.
11	Social/Team Sports	Curious about ISTP experiences with social or team sports. How did you find it? Do you prefer individual activities more?\n\nI'm looking to take up new sports, and soccer or basketball seems fun, but I'm not sure if I will enjoy it as I've always naturally gravitated towards sports I can do alone (mountain biking and climbing). Not to mention I'm worried about being a newcomer in an established social sport groups in my area. 
6	I played hockey for quite a few years, even co-captaining and later captaining my team, and while it wasn't my favourite sport it was certainly enjoyable. I also played rugby, and because I joined later into the season I was on the outside at first, but nobody objected and everyone was helpful. If you find a decent team, joining won't be an issue. If they're not decent, then playing with them probably won't be enjoyable anyway. 
4	I could never get into any team sports. The closest I ever enjoyed was playing badminton with teams of two. Playing soccer of hockey I always felt kinda lost and useless due to how much crap was going on that didn’t involve me at any moment. \n\nAlways was into fencing and martial arts. Also track and field somewhat, but that’s kinda boring. 
3	I had a lot of fun playing basketball, and baseball in high school.  Football for me was more work than it was fun.  I almost didn't play my senior year.\n\nBaseball was my favorite, but I enjoy playing basketball more with the right group of people.  The group I was forced to play with had a lot of ego problems and it resulted in bad team play.  \n\nMaybe something like bowling would be better for us.  Small teams, repetitive skill set, etc.  
3	[deleted]
2	I played baseball/basketball/soccer for years and years, and I find that as long as the team is playing to your level, and not holding you back, competitive team sports are extremely fun and rewarding.  However, there is something to be said about going off by yourself and trying to work through getting good at solo sports.  There is something really satisfying about knowing that the work you did paid off and you can see the results.  This is exampled through golf and bowling, at least for me, which are the two sports I still actually play.
2	I don't do sports, but I'm also looking to also get into some. \n\nLike the other commenter, badminton has always been fun for me. I'm planning on joining the intramural team for it once school starts back up (currently in high school). But also like the other commenter, teams of two are really my max... I prefer playing solo when I can. \n\nI'm looking to get into fencing within the next month or two. I love the individual aspect of it, and it looks like a fun sport on its own. \n\nAlso worried about being the newcomer. At least with intramural badminton, I'm hoping that it won't really matter ( I doubt it will). And with fencing -- it's an individual sport where you progress at your own pace. I'm more worried about when I join my school's "team" where my individual wins/losses will affect everyone else. \n\nThe only other sport I've really been interested in is ice hockey. It's always been to expensive and out of reach, though, so I don't have much to say about it. \n
2	In terms of actual sports I mountain bike a lot, usually alone with my dog. Video games I almost exclusive play with my friends, PUBG, Dota 2, MW2 back in the day.
2	Social dynamics of "team" sports always annoyed me. Baseball is my favorite of the bunch, probably because it's a pretty solo team sport. \n\nI've always gravitated to mountain biking, snowboarding, surfing etc. Rather than ball sports.
3	The ladies luv playin with my ballz
1	I played in a softball league when I was a kid (though I quit around the 6th grade because I was sick of getting injured by rogue balls... I once had a bruise on my thigh the size of a grapefruit, looked like George W. Bush, and stuck around for a month after getting whacked with a ball at a batting cage).  I was pretty average at it.\n\nI didn't really get into sports until I was in college.  As a kid, I despised PE and couldn't stand team sports that weren't softball.  That is until I discovered that there were other sports besides soccer and football (though watching an English football match in a crowded pub during the World Cup helped sway my opinion).\n\nHowever, nowadays, I prefer solo activities: running, biking, archery, and target shooting.  Then again, it's hard to find a sports league for young adults (not kids or teens) in my area.
15	ISTP husband obsessed with “being controlled” is the most controlling person I know...	[deleted]
21	Breaking property and shit? He's abusing you and your family.\n\nNot try to rationalize it. I mean, try to get him help, yes. but he's abusive.\n\nAlso, the fact that you don't realize that shows how strongly he's manipulating you. get him help, but help yourself first!
43	... sounds like a narcissist or sociopath or both. Get out. 
18	>Ever since we’ve been together he’s maintained control in a sketchy way (lying about his whereabouts, what he’s doing, who is with etc., withholding sex and using it as a bargaining tool, being verbally abusive and violent by trashing our property etc.)\n\n>It’s key we handle this soon as we have children together.\n\nGet the fuck out. Take your kids and leave. This is abuse.
7	This sounds more like Fe-grip than Ti-Ni loop. He needs to find a way to be productive in a healthy Ti-Se manner which is something he has to do on his own. It's very difficult to coerce an ISTP into self-betterment and doing so will likely lead to more backlash. ISTPs are most comfortable on the **giving** side of helping, not the receiving side. \n\nSo my advice to you is to put some space between you two. Let him come to realize his faults on his own. Idk how difficult this would be as you both have kids together but you came to an internet forum looking for advice so here it is lmao.\n\nIf all else fails, maybe it's time to have a hard rethink the compatibility between the both of you. Good luck though, I hope this all works out for the best for you.
6	[deleted]
4	[deleted]
3	Please don't have children, this sounds like a nightmare relationship
3	>How can I make him be more logical? \n\n\nGood luck with that... it’s hard enough for us to change ourselves let alone someone else try to change us. \n\n\nIf I were you, I’d suggest marriage counseling. Basically tell him that you love him and you want to fix your relationship, but y’all need help. If he refuses, you honestly may just need to leave him. Don’t leave yourself tied to someone who isn’t willing to put in the work to make it work. 
3	[deleted]
0	Are you sure he is an ISTP ? He sounds more like an ISTJ.
-2	Anyone can get on the internet and make themselves look good and another person bad. They then ask for advice on how to change the other, evil person. That is a dead give away that the person asking the question is the problem.\n\nYou are clearly a control freak. Your SO may have control issues, but that does not change the fact that it is you publicly asking for ideas to control him. Healthy people don’t do that.
8	How to Keep Up a Long Distance Friendship with an ISTP?	Hey.\n\nI am an INFP with an ISTP best friend. We both graduated uni two months ago. Unfortunately, our jobs took us across the country from each other. We now live a seventeen hour drive apart from each other. Our jobs both have contracts for 18 months, so it will be a long time until we see each other again. \n\nDo you have any tips on keeping in touch with her? I am already planning on flying out to visit her, but a dearth of vacation days and expensive plane tickets ensure that this will be a rarity. Based on past experience, we both do not do well with phone calls, texts, emails. From what I've seen on this subreddit, this pattern of communication seems to be typical for istps (and infps). \n\nWe became best friend by doing things together. We road tripped, went to a bunch of activities, took up running, built things together, etc, etc. Obviously, we cannot communicate by regularly hanging out any longer. Therefore, I am anxious that we will drift apart from each other over the next few years. Life happens, and people move in different directions. I get it. But she is the best friend I have had in my life, to the point where I consider her more of a sister than a friend. Besides my parents, she is the one person I can tell anything too. She is fun and funny, the most honest person I know. She is bluntly kind, tells me where I am being self-centered, generally challenges me to be a better person. \n\nYou get the picture. I hate the thought of drifting apart. \n\nAll advice welcome. 
26	The friendship will die a sad slow death. 
9	You could try playing online or video games together. It may not be your thing, but if it's a way of maintaining the friendship, it could work. Or maybe try to build something that doesn't need both of you to be in the same place, like a website or a story. 
7	I meet my best friend only once or twice a year, but I call him every week. That does it for me. We both are ISTPs.\nMaybe you could try video calls? 
6	ISTPs make friends by doing stuff together. A lack of that is going to slowly kill the friendship. 
3	Depends how close your friendship is. My best friend of 20 years is an ENFP. We met when we were 3 and I moved away when I was 17.\n\nWe see each other 2-4 times a year and it’s always like no time has passed. Other than that, we maybe talk once a month. But with really close friends, it doesn’t seem to affect our relationship when we do see each other.  
2	I generally speak to my very best friend about once every 4-5months over phone call.  \nI can go years without talking to a close friend but when I see them again it's as if no time has passed at all, we just pick up where we left off.\n\nAll of my close friends live not only in cities all over the country but in OTHER countries. I almost NEVER get to see or hang out with them but I love them just the same.  \n
1	I had a similar situation. We became best friends in high school by having the same classes and doing the same extracurriculars. We went to different universities, but we’re still very close today. For us, we manage to chat everyday. Life happens and one of us will be busy, so there are some days with limited talking. Most times we just complain about school or send each other memes. But even if you don’t hang out or talk everyday, that level of friendship is so close that you can easily pick it back up whenever you meet up or find time to chat again. (I believe shes INFJ, if that matters)
1	Schedule things to do & look forward to. Trips... etc. You may not be in contact as often, but make the time you spend together memorable/useful.\n\nIt doesn't work well when I feel obligated to maintain contact; but my great friends will remain so even if we only have fulfilling follow-up's ~ 4 times a year.
1	I don't think they'd take it badly if you guys lost touch for a while and reconnected once you're in proximity to each other again! My best friend a and I didn't see each other for 9 or so months at a time while we were in school and just took whatever chances we had to hang out when we were around. 
1	I disagree with the idea that this friendship will just die, but you will have to do a good bit of the work and realize you can still be important to them without being present in their life. With friends from my past, if I don't see or talk to them often (sometimes for years...many years) I don't necessarily think about them but I do still consider them my friends and am happy to see them if are in my city, or I'm in theirs. It's nice when one makes the effort to stay in touch because it's not something I'm good at.
1	If your friendship is actually really good now then you'll be fine without contact for over a year. \nI've got a couple of friends I barely talk to but we all know we'll meet up sooner or later and have a great time. \n\nI should add that as soon as you start making demands on their time it starts being alot less fun to be around you. 
1	Snapchat! Make your friend Snapchat with you daily. Snapchat is nice because you don’t need to say anything in particular, but you can still be in touch just by sharing a photo about your day.
1	Anything can work if both of you put in the work to see each other and make time for the other in whatever ways you can. Whether its planning a trip every 6 months or choosing a special time and day for a weekly/monthly call. Talk to her about it. Brainstorm. Find out what she's comfortable with and what she wants to do with you. Unless both partys put in the work, the relationship will die; And thats something you have to make sure of first, before brainstorming what you're gonna do together. Otherwise, if she doesn't put in her share (for any reason; busyness, tiredness, ect.) then it really will die.\n\nLong relationships are fine for me though, I'm not sure why other ISTP's here are saying it will necessarily die and no ISTP can long distance friendship. My best friend lives states away and we have nothing in common anymore after growing out of our common interests, but we send each other packages bi-yearly and it's still the best thing. 
0	Any other ISTP aware of New World Order “Illuminati”?	Are you guys aware of all the agendas (Feminism, LGBT, ect)  being pushed, what’s really going on? What everything is leading up to? That politics is all a stage play? Rothschilds? Chemtrails? Man never went to the moon! When I talk to people about this stuff people look at me like I’m the crazy person.. when in reality they’ve been conditioned they’re entire lives into believing lies..Earth is flat!!
21	I hope ur using a VPN. Skynet is listening. Enjoy the decline ;) 
17	Who the fuck even has time to think about all that useless shit, much less believe it?
15	If you wanna troll/shitpost at least put some effort into it 
8	I'm aware of the stuff, but its waste of time and i don't believe any of that stuff. Tbh i hate people that try to push any belief to me, be it religion, conspiracy or what my gender really should be. What i want is facts try to prove something for once instead of some crazy theory. Just a song with important message about  [gay frogs](https://youtu.be/9JRLCBb7qK8) 
4	I refuse to go anywhere without wearing my tinfoil hat. 
8	Yeah, they're turning the frogs gay too (you trolling?)
4	Love how you choose "we never went to the moon" over the "we haven't gone back to the moon because of aliens" 
6	Yes I am aware of the new world order stuff. Not so sure about the earth being flat or not going to the moon though lol. \n\nGlobalism is freaky when you start digging deeper.\n\nIdk why everyone is being sarcastic. It’s not that hard to find reliable info on this topic.
3	Yes it's very evident that all those agendas as pushed ahead of the previous existing beliefs people had, where are you getting with all this ? Are you hinting that a  cultural renaissance of sorts is possible  in then near  future  ? 
3	I think the Earth is round because I haven't seen a picture of the edge.\n\nIf the moon landing is fake, than why hasn't Russia ever called us out on that?\n\nChemtrails?  Planes wouldn't be nearly efficient enough.  You'd have a better chance using the catalytic converters on all of the vehicles.\n\nWhoever has the money has the power.  Nothing in the world is free.
3	You're apart of the Illuminati! 
1	Ur leaving into the age of deception. Its much easy to spread rumors now then before. People can make living out of it. Its doesn't make any different of you wether you believe it or not. Stop wasting time on such a thing. 
1	It is literally the kikes
5	What are your short-term/mid-term/long-term goals?	I know it's a pain in the ass for a perceiver to plan, but I am having a rare sweet season of life this year (finally). I am doing well with my job as a marketing data analyst (good income), and I want to do something with it.\n\nThe only short-term plan I have is to save as much as I can, and then find a much quieter/comfy apartment. And I don't really know what else to think for and decide.\n\nAnything you are doing great at right now and can share?\n\nI'm turning 30 this year. Female ISTP here.
5	Recently got my prescription for adderall back. So I’m bored at work and tweaking just a little so... wall of text incoming lol. \n\n\nShort term goals are mostly to survive, but improve. As long as my life is gradually moving forward and not plateauing, I feel like my short term is succeeding (this is a short term goal that continues long term). And based on my recent promotion that bumped me from barely surviving with roommates to an actual adult live-able salary, I’d say the short term is going well. \n\n\nMy mid-term is a couple different things. I’d say three big ones. First is to get back into school and finish my finance degree. Hopefully that can happen next fall. Second would be my Miata project Car. I want to have it race ready for AutoX next spring where I hope to pick up a tire sponsor so that I can move to a racing league 2020. And the third would be this one girl. She’s been my best friend for two years, and I’m in love with her. I know she has feelings for me too as we’ve discussed it, but due to unfortunate circumstances (way too much to explain here), dating has never really been an option. But those circumstances are almost all faded, which means I can start pushing our sensual tension into an actual development. (I say sensual tension because the sex isn’t what I’m after. Her personality and our unique relationship is. The desire is to be mentally intimate more than anything else). \n\n\nAs for long term goals, I guess I’ve got my eggs in a few different baskets. I have my current job, which still has plenty of room to move up. Even without my degree, I qualify for several of the 6 figure positions. I just have to put in the time and prove myself. Then I also have the Miata. That would be the ultimate dream! I used to be really good at AutoX. And if I can keep that up with a properly built car, I can get sponsors. Sponsors lead to racing circuits, and racing circuits lead to pro-racing. Pro-racing has been the dream of all dreams for my entire teenage/adult life. The third basket would be the finance degree I want to finish. Would probably take a couple years as I can’t take full course loads with Work. But who knows where that could take me. Numbers, stats, and analysis are my best friends so I feel like I’d succeed very well in the financial world. \n\n\nBut, my ultimate goal for my entire life is to marry this aforementioned girl, have kids with her, and be a family. As an ISTP, I don’t really do the lovey dovey shit. And there’s a lot of quirks people have that bug me. For friends, it’s cool. But for an SO, nah. So needless to say, I haven’t dated much. I have a whole bunch of 2-4 month relationships which is about as far in as I get before I can’t stand them anymore. But I’ve “imprinted”, so to speak, with this girl. Ever since I met her, I’ve been unable to have any kind of successful relationship. Simply because she is the entire package in my book. It’s literally like god created her to specifically cater to me. Knowing that and experiencing it makes it damn near impossible for me to be with anyone else. I always end up subconsciously comparing them to her. \n\n\nBut basically, if we can get over the hump of going from Best fiends to dating, that’ll pretty much be the end of dating. Her parents love me, my parents love her, we have never fought once, all of our disagreements are handled very quickly and civilly, we have almost identical ethics and morals, we have the same desires in life, and we’re both attractive enough to be physically appealing to each other. So I truly believe if we start dating, it’ll end in neighboring graveyard plots some number of decades down the road. \n\n\nAnd I really fucking hope it all pans out. Because I don’t think I’ll ever be able to achieve the same thing with anyone else. I’m cut from a very very obscure stone and she’s the only person that I have ever met that’s cut from the same stone. People like us don’t find matches like this every day. And I’m sure some of us, even some married ones, still never found a perfect match, just a “good enough” one. Because of that, I pray my “one” actually ends up being my one. 
5	I'm 30, male.Setting goals and figuring out what I want in life has put me in a never ending existential crisis since I was 12. I live in the moment and I'm happy in the moment but my life isn't going anywhere and I'm stagnant. I'm bored most of the time, but I have no future goals that I actually feel speak to me in any higher sense than "Yeah I guess that'd be nice.." \*shrug\*. I'm only ever happy when I can disregard the future and the past and just express myself in the moment to the fullest. But that isn't very applicable to our society today. It's more like you gotta work and do shit you don't like so that every once in a while you can be yourself...\n\nShort-term: Earn more money without killing myself. Figuratively and Literally.\n\nMid-term: Find a hobby or a passion that I actually care about enough to invest my time into and build something out of.\n\nLong-Term: Use said passion to become financially independent so that I can live every day in the moment and not worry about having wasted my entire life doing shit I don't believe in or care about just so I can keep repeating the same cycle. I seriously regret almost my entire life because I keep trying to break out of the cycle but failing and I can't find anything I care about.
6	High schooler. \n\nShort-term: Get my grades up as high as possible, get a part-time job, do some other extracurriculars. \n\nMid-term: Get into a decent college. Do all the college things and be a competitive applicant for post-grad (basically same goals at short-term, but for college). \n\nLong-term: Get a decent job - $75-95k/yr (peaked). Get to a place financially where I can afford 2+ dogs and feed them that Blue Buffalo stuff. 
3	I'm in the same boat.  Making decent money and have some savings goals.  Beyond that I have no idea, despite thinking about it *a lot*.  Actually gives me a good deal of anxiety.\n\n(Same age, too)\n\nI'm thinking about taking up lane swimming, if nothing else.
3	Older ISTP here (not retirement age old, but older than most of you).\n\nI've realized my problem isn't having no goals, it's that I have way too many things that I want to do and too many goals. The good part about this is that I'm NEVER bored. The bad thing is that this causes me to not finish stuff, procrastinate, not prioritize, etc... I was especially unfocused in my teens (maybe this is true of most teenagers..?)\n\nBut I really like finishing stuff/achieving goals. So I've been using a system for about a year, where I write down my top goals for the month and top goals for the week... then I write down 2-3 things I want to work on every day for the upcoming week (usually in 1 hour-ish chunks). I'd say most of these are short-term/mid-term goals - I'm not sure I have any specific long term goals (have house, decent job, have spent less than I make for a LONG time so finances are in good shape).\n\nSo what's actually on my list? Without getting into too much detail:\n\n\- (today) - go to the gym after work (Done!). Have to do something for work later tonight for about an hour.\n\n\- (tomorrow) Go to a meetup at local library ("go" programming intro)\n\n\- (Sunday) Explore a nearby bike rail-trail that I've never been on (can't wait!). Part of a mid-term goal to bike/hike/explore some new places this summer.\n\n\- (short-term) Call one of my friends that I haven't talked to in a while (been procrastinating on this, actually).\n\n\- (mid-term) Finish an online class that I'm taking (about half finished, planning on doing an hour this weekend)\n\n\- (mid-term) Finish a home improvement project (new blinds for living room)\n\nThen there are ongoing "maintenance tasks", like taking a walk or going to the gym at least 4 days a week (been doing this for years), doing housework/chores, etc.\n\nI still bounce around and do different stuff when I'm in the mood, but the extra structure/prioritization has definitely helped.
2	In high, gonna graduate in 2019. \nShort term: not die of complete bordum this year. \n    Gonna buy myself a gun for Christmas this year.\n    Have some chickens that keep escaping, gonna work on preventing that later today.\nMid-term: graduate from the JC with a AAS in welding.\nLong term: buy land, have farm. Be a crazy gun nut up on some mountain. Done. 
2	Invest Invest Invest 
2	Short-term: Finish college\n\nMid-term: Get started in my dream career in law enforcement\n\nLong-term: gain financial stability and have a loyal dog that's at least kinda intelligent
2	I hate to say this, but I am nearing my late twenties and I feel like I haven't accomplished mush.\n\nShort term: Save money, obtain motorcycle license, improve on hobbies that I enjoy doing.\n\nMid-term: Get work in the industry I want to work in (airline).  Get a good place to live.  \n\nLong-term: Get the dream job I want in said industry I want to work in.  And maybe date someone I know will not harass me on any and all social media sites if things go south (long story... but fuck OK Cupid's personality test).  
1	What are goals?
1	What is this word... "goals"?
1	Short term: make it to work everyday and work hard, always learn something new each day. Get enough sleep and eat healthier/workout at least three times a week.\n\nMid term: finish my apprenticeship (5 years 01 commercial electrician) pay off my truck (1.5 years) buy a trailer so I can travel and work/ go camping on a whim. \n\nLong term: buy my grandmas house giving her live-in rights ensuring she will never end up in a retirement home, own a dog or two. Be well enough financially I can find myself to do a trip or two a year to papua new gunea to help out villagers there. (You’d be amazed a what impact a little bit of solar/electrical work can have on peoples lives who don’t have access to electricity) Have a family and kids someday maybe. 
1	Female ISTP here. Move out of my own apartment that I’ve been leasing for my ex-boyfriend and I. I’ve been with him for close to three years and all I’ve done was pay for him. I just got sick of it and broke things off. Hopefully, I can move out this Thursday into a nicer, playful environment on my own. I’m basically taking everything but the bed. That’s just the short term goal. \n\nI haven’t really thought about long term but all I know is that I enjoy being alone or talking with others who have the same interests of me. My ex and I are very different and being in this situation is making me unable to clear my head so I guess for now it’s the short term goal of moving into my new place. 
0	Do you think Katie Taylor is ISTP?	Hope you'll take the time to watch. Here are some of her interviews: \n\nKatie at 15 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk8YHu6rz58\n\nKatie and Childhood Boxing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tq5iPO_7S0&t=409s\n\nLonger interview : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tq5iPO_7S0&t=409s\n\nShe's generally soft spoken and relaxed but so competitive and driven with goals in boxing. She doesn't do word fighting with her rivals. 
7	WHO DAT?
5	Probably, you can tell she is more comfortable in her own head than trying to get into another's. 
7	Are there any jewelers/Fine metalworkers here?	I've developed an interest in fine metalworking. Not so much the jewelry aspect or wire work, but using the tiny saws and what not to make unique projects. I don't have a hobby where I can use my hands and I desperately need one. Has anyone here dabbled and maybe made some money from it?
11	I’ve done some fine metalwork as a hobby. As silly as it may sounds, I used to be one of the best coil builders in my state. And by coils, I mean coils for rebuildable mechanical mods (tube vapes). \n\n\nA lot of the stuff I used to do was very very intricate. Sometimes I would use hundreds of feet of wire for a single coil that fits inside an 18mm diameter cap. Some of the wire I use is 50ga wire, which is thinner than human hair. \n\n\nGive me a minute and I’ll track down some examples. It’s kinda hard to grasp why I call it art without seeing it. \n\n\nEdit: here they are! \n\n\n[This is a simple Zipper coil.](https://i.imgur.com/OLeFtiD.jpg) it’s made with 6 different wires to emulate a zipper. \n\n\n[This is a staged heating fused clapton.](https://i.imgur.com/l8FrQBE.jpg) still a simple coil. Zoom in to see its slightly more intricate than the zipper. \n\n\n[This was my original contribution to the community: The Wicker Weave.](https://i.imgur.com/vDywhav.jpg) This took about 6 hours to make. \n\n\n[this is an example of the heat treatment I do with certain types of metal.](https://i.imgur.com/q7jO7sN.jpg) The color of the coils has been isolated, but not altered. The removed background color makes it pop, but that is the natural color of the coils after treatment. \n\n\n[Heres a monster build I did. Looks like a lot, but it was a quick and easy build.](https://i.imgur.com/7M2ThuH.jpg) This is a very hot, but very flavorful coil. \n\n\n[This is what we call an alien.](https://i.imgur.com/RPbZxoI.jpg) It actually has vertically wrapped flat wire stacked together on the inside with a 36ga wire wrapped around it.  \n\n\n[Heres what we call a Tsuka.](https://i.imgur.com/LyHq8xP.jpg) This look is achieved by twisting the flat wire, stretching it out, and methodically wrapping it back around vertically stacked flat wire that’s framed in some round wire. \n\n\n[This bad boy is my fucking pride and joy.](https://i.imgur.com/98MtAM8.jpg) there’s close to 1000ft of wire inside this coil. In the very center, there is 42ga wire wrapped with 50ga. Wrapping wires thinner than hair makes you want to pull out your hair. This was about a 12 hour build and it did win me some prizes and a ton of recognition. 
3	Don't want to brag about my extensive jeweler skills, but I once made a simple chain-link bracelet out of paperclips, and what not, does that count? (/s)
2	I can't say much about metalworking or the like, but if you need a hobby that uses your hands then I strongly recommend lockpicking. Try going over to r/lockpicking
26	Anyone else get told they're "defensive"?	Always been told this from many folks in my life, but never quite understood it, why it's bad or how to stop? thinking on it it might have happened in reaction to my mother, who would always doubt, provoke, or insult me, imply negative things, prompting an attack or for me to prove myself, ect. \n\nAnyone else like this? Or know how to help with this? 
21	I wouldn't say I'm defensive but I definitely am "protective" of myself and my privacy.\n\nThere's this new girl at work and she's friendly and I'm okay with working for her but she can run her mouth and ask very intrusive questions. I've gotten to the point where I either directly tell her "I'm not comfortable taking about this" or do my best to steer the conversation elsewhere. Sometimes I just up and remove myself from the conversation if I know there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nShe has told me I can be defensive though. If someone I know well answers her questions that I don't want her knowing I can get visibly upset or angry. Of course I leave but not in the same calm manner I would before.\n\nSo yeah I think ISTPs can be defensive or even sensitive if the right buttons are pushed. It's not a bad thing to want to defend yourself but the difficult part is understanding why and how it can come of as rude to many people
12	can relate, but from a slightly different angle:\n\n\nI am constantly being told, that i always look for excuses for one's actions and try to defend everyone, which i do.\n\nI simply believe, that majority of people are unable to empathize and if everyone would put themselves in someone else's shoes, be it a victim, a bully, a burglar or even a killer, there would be much less violence in the world.\n
7	Yes, but I called it "sensitive". I would feel hurt or insulted by the smallest things. It was based in insecurity and also learnt from my Dad (INFJ). I realised a year into working as an apprentice at an machine shop that I had to toughen the fuck up or I wouldn't make it. Now I'm in the hospitality industry and that "toughening up" has given me an edge. Its been four years of self development and improvement and there's still a helluva lot to work on.  \n\n\nIf you want to change, one of the most important things is to just give less of a fuck. Become confident in yourself and your capabilities. If someone tries to say something insulting or hurtful towards you, examine what you know about yourself (this is your "truth") and what the person is saying to see if they align. If they don't align, believe in your truth, tell them to sod off and carry on with your day. Eventually it gets to a point where you're so rock solid in your self and the knowlege of who you are that another person's negativity holds no influence over your mood or emotions. That point is where power lies.
6	Yes I get defensive sometimes. It's really bad, especially in relationships. Try to not taking everything so personal and listen to criticism without making a come back or defending yourself. Listen, reflect, and take responsibility. For example say "ouch that hurts but yes I do do that, what can I do to make it better" This is especially for the case when someone tells you they feel a certain negative feeling they got from something you did. \n\nI really recommended listening to "where shall we begin" by Esther perel

1	So from experience people don't generally say what they mean, the words they use don't express what they feel effectively. I listen to the words people use and assume they use the words that are correct. But more often than not I get in conflict when I don't read "Between the lines" or I interpret something as a jab at me that the other person claims wasn't a jab at all. And when I explain my view and how it came across as a jab they often change their initial sentence to something completely different that I was supposed to understand through the WAY it was said and not by the words used.   \n\n\nNow, obviously I find this fucking absurd. Words and speech are there for a reason, use them appropriately. But to many other MBTI types, they truly believe they are using the words properly and we're misinterpreting THEM.
1	i just like to explain myself when i’m accused of something and i understand that it comes off as defensive but i just feel the need to make sure there’s no misunderstanding. 
1	Wife suggests a large majority of musicians I listen to are INFJ’s	ISTP here...\nI don’t know if this is true or not but thought it to be an interesting concept. Anybody else experience something similar?\nThe main part of her mentioning this I believe was the suggestion that I am highly attracted to the INFJ personality type.
2	Who do you listen to?
1	As of late it’s been Joanna Newsom and Bon Iver(Justin Vernon).
36	I’m so glad I found you people.	My girlfriend discovered this personality test and found my type for me, which I’m forever grateful for. I always thought I was some weird mf and never knew anyone that was like me until I found you guys! It’s crazy how much I can relate to all of your guys’ posts. Thank you, ily, you timid, smart, non-sociable people!
25	I mean we are weird by societies standards.. but I don’t want to be like the sheeple anyways.. we’re more like cats. 
13	Welcome. Now go back to lurking 😁😁
10	Um... I'm neither timid or non sociable. \n\nDon't pigeonhole yourself.  
5	Honeslty, I feel the same way. these forums helped me so much, myerss briggs and all of this helped me figure out im not a freak, and theres a reason everyone says theyve never met anyone like me before, and im not a lone weirdo, there are others like me, ect. 
7	What do you mean "you people"
3	Shhhhh....
7	Got a degree that doesn't fit me	I got a degree in Nutrition, worked a job I absolutely hated, left, felt super lost about what I should do with life, and then discovered I'm an ISTP. When I look at the careers that ISTPs usually like and what my degree is, I just feel like I made a huge mistake.\n\nHas anyone else here found themselves in a similar situation? What did you do?
7	Just because some career MBTI thing said one thing which doesn’t match up to your history doesn’t mean you fucked up. Could just be in a rough patch. You slogged at least four years for the degree, certainly there must be some attraction to nutrition and you.\n\nI’m getting degrees in PolSci and GIS and the former really isn’t seen as an “ISTP” thing. What exactly did you hate about your job and how do you feel about “ISTP” careers?
6	You have a degree in nutrition. Do you like nutrition?  what made you think it was interesting?\n\nYou need to do what you like and what you are good at.  \n\nI've been working for close to 34 years in various capacities. \n\nMy advice, do what you are good at, do what you like and have fun doing it.  No one can really advise you as to what you should do, but the end game is supporting yourself financially while still able to enjoy life.
4	I'm about to graduate with a bachelors in Anthropology after attending college for a decade. Without going on to grad school, which I really don't want to do, there's a total of like 3 jobs available to me and I'm only slightly interested in two of them. /: Really wish I would have just learned a trade instead.
3	Im about to graduate with a degree in genetics. I dont think i hate it, but i wouldnt say i love it either. I actually dont know what i like. I think i like the feeling of achievement more than anything else, so im pursuing something that I find tolerable/interesting enough and that I have enough skills in i guess
3	Perhaps you can translate that degree into something more suited to your taste. Have you considered jobs such as a personal trainer?
2	How old are you?
1	Got an engineering degree. Hated the job. Became a paramedic instead. Weird because I always felt that throughout my degree, I didn't have a passion for engineering, and I liked the idea of being a paramedic. Overall I was very uncertain about what I want to do in the future. Some of my friends also did not follow through with a career that they majored in but they seemed to know to change degrees/careers much earlier than I did. 
1	I'm a female registered nurse istp and I knew from the get go i.e the first day of university that that shit wasn't for me.  Currently have been working for 1.5 years and I'm bored and sad. Although I've excelled quite quickly and have become competent in a short period of time. I hate the medical field. Just don't connect with the idea of patient care and the seemingly self sacrificing values of nursing. Don't wanna get my masters. I just don't wanna  be in health care AT ALL, in any type of way. But Im also scared to start new seeing as I don't know what the hell I want. I've never known what I wanted in terms of a career. I chose wrong, that's for goddamn sure.

8	Yea im not reading all of that. Do a mbti test 
2	No.\n\nReason: I have no time in the world to watch movies and talk about how they're made or the meaningful things behind one's creation. I don't mind someone telling me that, though. It's just exhausting for me to explore those things. \n\nYou're probably an INTP or an ISFJ. Ne and Ti are apparent. The way you format your post lacks Ni & Se. 
1	I dunno, you sound pretty ISTP to me...
10	Do you calm people when they are under high emotional hold ?	One day at a party a drunk guy went mad and took his car for a drive, almost everyone became hysterical at the idea that he could have an accident (he does, no injuries). I went to the hosts who were hystericals too to see what we could do. And I noticed that they were calming down while is was speaking to them of concretes things, even if that wasn't my intention.\n\nI realise now that I often calm down the ones who lost their minds in hard situations even if I'm not doing it on purpose. Is that a common ISTP thing ?
10	I usually do it knowingly, by talking firmly but calmly and with concrete information like you said. 
5	yep
4	My vibe and personality naturally makes others around me more calm. If they are super mad about something I tell them “Sh*t happens” *shrugs*
3	I think so. We’re usually calm and collected. Do to our powers of observation along with our methodical logical brains, I think we understand the big picture faster and better. We also understand that freaking out has never solved anything in the history of ever. \n\n\nRemaining calm at all times is a skill that I think we develop a loooot easier than most. I think the biggest reason is because we aren’t driven by emotions. We’re driven by logic. We have emotions, but we’re not typically ones to make rash decisions based on them. We usually just stuff it down til it’s appropriate to let back out. 
3	Yes. My girl calls me "her calm center" my biggest mantra in life is "it's not necessary to react". Meaning, taking action based on rational thought is different than reacting to a situation based on emotions.\n\nFunny story though, we were recently on a long weekend in Palm Springs, and I was laying by the pool eyes closed. I hear the waiter saying loudly "sir? SIR??? Can somebody help him???" I looked up to see he was talking to an older man drowning in the pool. I flipped off my hat saying "gotta go". I dove in, pulled the dude (who was blue) to the side, got him out of the pool, did a few quick heimlich's on the ground, he started coughing and I rolled him to his side in case he vomited.  By that time all the people gathered around started doting on him and I heard the paramedics so I went and layed back down. The gal he was with was tweaking and demanding everyone help her find her stuff. Bitch, I already saved his life, get the fuck out of here. \n\nAt the beginning of that story I thought it was somewhat relevant to this thread. Maybe not.
3	Depends entirely on who's listening.\n\nMy calm, factual demeanor has definitely helped some people calm down and see the light, so to speak.   \nBut with others, my lack of emotional outrage makes them more outraged and will direct their hysteria towards me instead, calling me heartless. Because positively highlighting facts or logic or reason to some people is the same as invalidating their feelings. Their feelings are law and unless they can bitch and whine with someone equally outraged and hysterical they can't calm down. I find these negative circle jerks absurd. Unfortunately I have many more encounters with the latter.  \n
2	Same. I'm always just pretty calm and concise, using concrete and logical reasoning.\n\nI'm not sure that it's an ISTP thing, though. While I generally can calm people down and really help someone (even sometimes when they choose me over a more emotional person), I also almost always try to give the task to someone else who I know can help more. 
2	I think we like to keep the peace and to keep our surrounding emotional atmosphere neutral. So when everyone freaks out, we do what we can to "solve the problem" by trying to return everyone to a calm neutral state. 
1	nope. I walk away. they can sort their shit out themselves. 
0	Who else got my result (in comments)?

1	Saw eel. 
1	Elephant and then bear.
0	Duck. Tell me this was just a coincidence. Otherwise i am mindblown.
6	As ISTPs' How would you define success?	Everyone defines success differently but I just started thinking about it and I don't have much to go on to be honest.\n\nI think:  \nHigh recognition in a VERY difficult field of expertise that also pays enough for money to never be a limitation ever again.  \n
41	Enough money to do all my hobbies, and enough yard to keep neighbors away.
22	[deleted]
17	Are you happy in your life doing what you're doing? That's pretty successful in my book.
6	Success is a moving target, I just try to make sure I’m living well today. 
7	Comfort. All I want in life is comfort with a little room for excitement. 
3	I just want to make enough and do enough to be comfortable. Not settling... but just enough to get by and then some (hobbies, etc.)\n\nI mostly want financial independence. 
2	For me success is being an expert within my field. My other goals like starting a family or making a lot of money, I believe will come as a result of me being the best at what I do.
2	Not to point out the blindingly obvious, but success is totally relative.. Considering my background, upbringing and the adversity I've faced I think of myself as somewhat successful, but other people in my position wouldn't consider themselves successful. \n\nI kinda agree with you on success being related to money, too. If I'm still having to worry about money or my lack of it is limiting what I want to do or how I want to live (within reason, we can't all drive Bentley's) then how can I really say I'm successful? I haven't been able to provide myself with the means to break down financial barriers. \n\nFor me it's also about impact: if what you do has wide, far-reaching impact then that's a sign of success. This isn't neccessarily just about breadth either, depth is just as important.
2	Not having fucked my life with drugs and bad decisions, a job that keeps a roof over my head and bills paid without debt, a job I don't hate, and enough self reflection and values that other people trust me and respect my opinions. \n\nIt has very little to do with money or material things.
1	I don’t have a definition at the moment, but a lot of money is sure as hell not going to be in the final definition. Are you sure you are an istp?
1	As same as the dictionary.
1	being happy! whenever anyone asks me what i want to be i always respond with “be happy for the rest of my life” before promptly following with “but forensic accountant if you’re actually asking”
4	Do many ISTPs talk slowly?	I only know a few and a large part of their personality is drawing out things they say when they explain things or debate like they're trying to create a dramatic air to the conversation or something.Is this a commonality or just them?\n\n\n**EDIT: Talk slowly might be better understood as taking a while to make a point **
22	Personally, I just speak quickly with as little words as possible. Get it done and over with, unless the main goal is to tell an enticing story, then I'll make use of dramatic pauses and different Voices to get the point across
9	I cannot talk slowly. My mind operates much faster than my mouth. I have to get it all out, as succinctly (tersely) as possible, or I'll forget what I was saying because I've already moved on internally.\n\nIt's a slight problem when I'm trying to convey information to people outside my field. I have to seriously concentrate to talk to laymen. It affects storytelling as well, because I strive to get to the point as quickly as I can to provide the most information in as little time as possible. Because of this, I vastly prefer email and IM/texting to verbal conversations, because I can edit my thoughts several times over prior to sending them. Even on Reddit, I rarely, very rarely, have a post that doesn't show an edit asterisk, because I constantly revise and expand my initial submission. Even my stupid one-liners have an edit 17 minutes later. But on the bright side, any code I write is guaranteed to be the fastest, most efficient execution you can get outside of assembler.
5	I'm pretty sure speech mannerisms isn't related to mbti.
7	I over explain. But I do it quickly.\n\nAs for drama.... I must admit I have a knack for making mundane situations funny in hindsight. I am probably guilty.\n\n
4	Talk slowly, or take a while to get to the point?\n\nThe latter seems like possibly an ISTP thing, because we analyze everything down to the nuts and bolts and it often takes a lengthy explanation of the why of something. \n\nLike if something isn't working at work, it isn't just "it doesn't work". It's "we've analyzed all of the root causes and all of the solutions and the pros and cons of all". That usually takes a while to explain (instead of just "it doesn't work"). So I often find myself not getting the "space" to explain something (much like this post) because people only want the quick answer and the nuances are often important to us.
5	I'd say my overall cadence isn't any slower than most people around me, but people do notice that I take a little longer than most to respond to a question.  It's just a second or so, but this is 100% intentional.  The reason is I like to choose my words carefully and be accurate in my use of language to convey what I mean as precisely as possible.  I don't just blurt out nonsense without considering what I'm saying first.  I'm certainly not trying to create a dramatic air about anything, that doesn't sound very ISTP haha.
2	The only time I talk slow is when I don't have time to communicate exactly what I want to say and I have to come up with it as I go along
1	not sure if I'd say they "talk slowly," but they may scrutinize (even stare) silently for a bit longer and more intently before speaking\n\nI think they speak at a normal rate 
1	Personally, no. My usual manner of speaking is to give a fairly long-winded and thorough explanation while speaking extremely fast. This tendency to speak way too fast may partially be due to my braces, but plenty of it is also my tendency to try to get things done as quickly, efficiently, and thoroughly as possible. 
1	Here's an "INTJ" explaining what's called the Ni hunch: https://youtu.be/1Ms65ihKPeI  \nAnd of course, the ISTP has Ni. I honestly think Ti + Ni makes you speak incredibly slowly because you have abstract thoughts that you have to look deep into your logical framework to articulate.
1	I usually don’t but when I do it’s very mellow and soft. I get asked if I’m high off weed daily. 
1	When I first started working at this restaurant a couple years ago, this ESFJ said, “I think it’s funny how you pause in the middle of a sentence.” I don’t think she meant anything by it. I just want to use the correct words when I speak. Also we have Ti not Te so thinking and talking simultaneously can be a challenge.\n\nI believe I keep an average cadence in conversation. Maybe it’s my calm demeanor coupled with my monotone delivery that makes it appear as though I’m speaking slowly.
1	I do indeed talk slowly (more like speak in broken bits and pieces) when I haven’t fully formed an accurate idea of what I would like to represent. If those thoughts and opinions are fully developed it is out in a very quick and succinct fashion.
1	I generally talk faster than most of the people i know. A blessing and a curse i guess.
1	I speak fairly quickly. Although my voice is a bit quiet, and monotonous, so I often end up repeating myself, if that's the case, I try to speak very laconically.    
1	i dont talk slow i just dont talk that much to begin with
1	I only speak slowly when I'm extremely angry, and/or don't want my message to get confused. Otherwise it's a free flow of conscious thought
1	yes, because most people are morons(just a fact) and talking slowly lets me tell them what is going on..step..by step..by step so they "get" it. 
25	Which type is an ISTP's nemesis?	I'm going with ESTJ. These are the people that get under my skin and infuriate me. They want to control everyone, they're obsessed with it. And if you don't let them control you, they resent it. They also make snap judgements about things and if you pause and think they assume you're incompetent. Too much energy, always moving, extremely judgemental. Doesn't shut up. Oh, they're always right by the way. 
83	ISTP
15	The other 2 senior devs on my team are an estj girl and an istp guy. They get along pretty politely for work stuff and each respect their competence and abilities. But I wouldn't want to put them in charge of each other.
11	I understand where most of you are coming from that can't stand ESTJs, especially if they're on a different level like a parent or a manager at work. Fortunately I haven't been in that situation but my ex was an ESTJ.. That relationship sure took some work to build a foundation. The reason I think we find them difficult to deal with is their Te and their snap judgements like you said, where we can take our sweet time to make decisions because of our Ti. What I found is that they're definitely not always right (although they're always convinced they are) and you have to patient to spot it. Once I spotted her making a pretty important logical error I did what any loving ISTP partner would do, I absolutely obliterated her with my logic with complete disregard for her feelings. Probably some built up frustration from her always being 'right' and some inferior Fe to fuel it all. Anyway, the point is that once she was cooled down she started to see the value of such attention to detail (which they usually lack), why we take longer to process things and what an advantage it is to have someone on your team who can do this.\n\nLong story short, if you want to get them to chill, knock 'm down a peg and in a weird way they might value you more since they like to get shit done and they might see you as an asset in getting it done right. In return they can do a lot of dirty work for you. Try this at your own risk as your mileage may vary but Ti dom and Te dom can team up very nicely once a balance is found. \n\nIf there's ever a time in life when you most need your ISTP chill, it's when dealing with ESTJs. Don't let 'm crawl under your skin, and by not letting them you'll crawl under theirs.\n\nBut to answer your question, i think ENFPs annoy me the most. Not sure if they're nemesis material but it's like being around a non stop brain fart.
10	I’ve had the most issues with ESTJs, when it comes to interpersonal interactions. \n\nOther ISTPs frighten me. 
6	My ISTP husband's best friend is an ESTJ. He's always at least mildly annoyed by him. I think said ESTJ randomly latched on to someone who looked chill and my husband just said "this is my life now." 
7	ESTJ hate the way we do things, but they're certainly impressed by what we do. Where they're hard working and meticulous, we are ingenious and practical. They don't understand that our way works too. It all depends on how you look at it. I would argue that they could potentially give us things we dreadfully lack, like a semblance of order for when we're on one of our lonely benders, or the foresight to make the plans that absolutely need to be made and not procrastinated on. They could potentially keep us honest, and in return we can bring them a measure of excitement and spontaneity that they do secretly want.
7	[deleted]
5	I think ESTP is our nemesis. We are almost alike but they seem to go about it in just the wrong way. They always strike me as unnecessarily talkative and at times pretentious.
4	ESTJ. My mother is one and we had a rocky relationship when living together because she wanted to control they air I breathed!!! Since I’ve moved out we are much closer because we have space. My manager is estj too and she’s just like my mom. ESTJ’s think “I’m rude, lazy, arrogant and rebellious”
3	my mom is an estj too, is this some kind of theme? we get along pretty well mostly because I can set my boundaries and she'll respect them for the most part, but it is hard to deal with sometimes. NF types tend not to like me, but for the most part I'm fine with them. 
3	I was friends with an ENFP recently and then found myself withdrawing significantly. Very unpredictable and hard to tell if they like you or just want everyone to like them... 
5	I agree with ESTJ. I never understood why people hated ESTJs until I started interacting with a few regularly. I hate how they always have to give you their opinion, plus they think their way of doing things is the correct and best way, also very judgemental. \n\nThey want to control. I just can't understand why they care so much about influencing other people because it is SO different than my own perspective on life.
3	Immature ENFJs and ESFJs. Basically anyone who has strong Fe clashes with your dominant Ti style.
3	STJs
2	I agree, ISTP and ESTJ... of the same gender.
2	For me, ENTJ. The ones in my life a super judge-mental, pushy and imposing. Also, ENFJs in small doses are alright, but their neurotic views on life and other people stress me out —- especially when they’re angry. No amount of ISTP chill can combat an angry ENFJ haha —- and I can say this as one of my best friends as well as a former boss is one. 
1	Did you just make a snap judgement about an eighth of humanity based on facebook test?
1	there is no worst enemy than yourself, especially when you’re an ISTP
26	ISTP most silent type?	Aside from myself I think I’ve only met one other istp and he was just as quiet as me. It doesn’t matter If I’m at work, school, a bar, home. I’m always the most silent person in the room. I can talk if it’s about something I’m interested in but I usually don’t meet people with those interests. I know people respect that I don’t run my mouth EVER! I keep it real.. all day.. I don’t put on a front or anything. Some people think I’m shy and I know it’s not that because I’m confident. I just don’t want to meet you! People think I’m the definition of COOL! People also think I’m mean, or that I think I’m better than them.. just because I don’t really say anything.. I don’t get it. Extroverts talk they’re lives away about blah blah blah.. *rolls eye*.. I talk to my few friends/associates and family of course but even to them I’m still quiet. Any other istp like this? 
36	People get unsettled by the fact that they “don’t know what I’m thinking” because of my quietness. I don’t get why they would want to know anyway. I’m usually thinking of unimportant things or just nothing at all.
25	I’ve gotten that I seem aggressive almost from my resting “quiet” face
16	I rarely speak unless I have a reason to talk. However, I learned that it can be socially beneficial to briefly present a small, amicable smile when someone makes eye contact.
10	This is so relatable. I honestly wish I was sociable, I feel l one I could get farther in life faster. But then again my strengths are pretty cool as well.
7	Small talk is an Fe thing, which we are aware of but can't be bothered to do (unless you're a happy go-lucky fella). Going on tangents is an Ne thing. Ne users talk so much.  And then on top of that our Ti means we are constantly trying to figure something out. I'd say we are one of the quietest types.
3	Fight me
5	No. I am usually relatively talkative - sometimes I’m one of the more talkative ones in a group. I’m usually only the most quiet person if I feel uncomfortable around people who aren’t strangers. \n\nI think you just have to find groups of friends and coworkers who you enjoy talking to instead of those who prefer shallow interactions. It makes all the difference.\n\nEdit: I hate talking about my personal life though.
5	I don't talk unless I feel very comfortable with my surroundings. And in such a setting, the only thing(s) I talk about are related to the topic at hand in some way. I never talk about myself. 
6	True in my case. Years of "You're so quiet." I'm just observing. Especially in a group setting, no one can hear me anyway. I just don't bother.\n\nI do occasionally get a bout of can't-shut-up-itis, but it's very particular to who is around me.
3	Yes, I can relate. Also, I was told that i have psycopathy traits...
3	I've gotten past this by being sarcastic constantly.
2	My best friend's an INTJ, and she's quieter than I am.
2	I was like you until I meet a ENFP friend. She is awsome, talkative and energic. I was high percentage introvert but since we are bestie I’m 51% introvert! And now I’m intermediating between introvert and extrovert and that is extremely awsome because I can get energy from both inside and outside. I have A LOT OF things to say to my bestie and others even if The subject is not my favorite! I recommend you to find a ENFP friend. 
1	I think it's us and the INxPs.
13	What Behavior/Habit you have you are not proud of and want to change?	I believe in improving myself. In the last two years, I'm consciously working on going out more and socialising with friends. It has helped tremendously. I'd like to travel overseas and meet random people on the road. That would be awesome.
24	I wish I was more capable of asking for help
21	Don’t put it down.  Put it away.
17	I know what's wrong with me but I'm too lazy to do it.
5	Getting stuck in ruts, indecision and feelings of meaningless.
4	Better socialization. I feel I keep everyone at an arms length, even my best friend and family members.
1	blatant disregard for other people in my life
1	I wish I didn't have such a blatant disregard for most rules. It would keep me out of a lot of trouble.
-4	Nothing. I am what I am. If there was a habit I was ashamed of, I wouldn’t have that habit in the first place.\n\nGoing out and socializing isn’t an ‘improvement’ of any kind. And not socializing isn’t failure. It’s something you either want to do or you don’t. You either enjoy it or you don’t. Both choices are fine. \n\nUnless it’s a person who wants to socialize but has social anxiety.
0	Reading other people’s problems on reddit.
7	I'm an istp who imitates an intp	My older INTP brother was my role model, since my whole family is dumb. \n\nBut yeah, my life sucks ass. ISTPs are not happy acting like INTPs...\n\nI had low confidence when I was young and my brother, being a conceited pseudo-intellectual, made me feel real dumb. So I tried to outdo him and become even more intellectual, since I'm very competitive. I won this contest over the long run, in my opinion. At the cost of my sanity, happiness, ability to relate to others. Now I act like an out of touch INTP. People find me baffling. Yes, I didn't do sports or explore or do anything growing up because my brother didn't like doing those things and I wanted to be like him. Really screwed myself. Now I sit in the house and read and play video games and I have missed out on most things. I could never drag my brother ANYWHERE, no matter how hard I tried to coax him into going on adventures.\n\nCan anyone relate to this? I'm like, stuck in the ti-ni loop hell. Wish I knew how to break loose from this miserable life I'm in right now.
9	How old are you? Now that you’re aware of your individualism, you should go out and achieve it. You aren’t your brother and would be happier being yourself.
6	Yeah, I actually thought I was INTP until pretty recently. I didn't have an INTP role model, but my family values skew more toward intuition. I guess I ended up over-relying on Ti and Ni and neglected Se. \n\nBetter late than never. It's time to explore the aspects of yourself you've overlooked. Just try random things for the heck of it. I've never watched the movie "Yes Man" with Jim Carrey, but I feel like I should recommend that one because it's about a guy who decides to change his life by saying "yes" to everything, including completely ridiculous things. Because it's a Jim Carrey movie.\n\nBut first, go outside. Take a friggin walk, go to the park, get a hamburger, or whatever.
5	[deleted]
3	Want to know something funny? I had the exact same problem with opposite types. Looked up to my ISTP brother who hated sport, anything pop culture and he was also somewhat of an intellectual as well loved to read and debate and such. Now I'm older and feel out of touch with all those things I would have been interested in if I hadn't felt guilty liking them because of familial bonds. Basically it's not a personality thing imo. It's lacking the confidence to reclaim those interests and ways of acting we rejected as children.
3	Shitty family, shitty school, shitty kids all trying to make me conform to whatever they were doing and telling me to stop talking or be more positive or that I had an attitude problem because I was constantly making suggestions on how to make shit better, divorced parents. Eventually I adopted INTP as well. I figured I should just make myself as small and insignificant as possible so people would leave me the fuck alone. Eventually after lots of depression and self harm I snapped, had a panic attack and blew what little money I had on a trip abroad with no plans. Made tons of mistakes, fucked up over and over, slept on benches, met horrible people, was taken advantaged of, just all the shit you'd expect from an idiot traveling abroad. Once I got back I was so defeated and so messed up mentally that I realized my entire life is my own fault. Sure you can't expect a 7 year old to stand up for himself but technically it was my lack of confidence through-out my life that led me down these paths.   \n\n\nLiterally the best thing I've found is to replace bad habits with good ones. I'm still working on it. I'm almost 30 but I'm still good enough to compete in FPS games, but ofc whats the fucking point. Why keep honing this useless skill? I love the feeling of being in the moment and the adrenaline but I have to find some other way to get it.   \n\n\nIf you can afford it, replace gaming with going to the gym. If you can't, remove all your games from your harddrive, uninstall steam etc. If you're a console gamer, pack that shit away.   \nIt's like an addiction, you can't trust your willpower, you HAVE to get rid of whatever it is you abuse or dislike. I managed to snap out of the wtf-cycle once only to fall back into it later on in life and I'm coming to realize what I have to do and I just hope that I've learned from my garbage past. I also replaced sodas with coffee/tea, candy with fruit etc. It's much easier to break habits if you can replace those habits with other similar things that are better for you.  \n

1	Definitely.   My Se/iN is pretty borderline.  ISTP is my resting state, let me tinker and do stuff.  
85	ISTP stereotypes debunked!	Today I was thinking there was so many ISTP stereotypes out there and how it causes mistypes and the wrong information to be spread about ISTP’s. I bet there are many ISTP’s out there who think they’re INFJ, ISFP, INTP, or maybe even ISTJ. Here is a list of the common ISTP stereotypes, why they’re wrong, and what the truth actually is.\n\n**All ISTP types are mechanics**\n\nThe ISTP nickname is often “The mechanic” or “The craftsman’s” So people may look at this and think in order to be an ISTP you must be amazing at fixing cars, making things out of wood, and workshop. Then dismiss the type completely because you’re not mechanically inclined. But not all ISTP’s are mechanical. \n\nISTP’s have dominant Ti. This enables us to want to learn about everything we’re interested in. Which typically are practical skills that we can use in our concrete world and environment around us. These skills tend to be things like fixing cars, repairing, construction etc. Because they’re practical skills to have. But many other MBTI types acknowledge that knowing how to change a tire is an important skill to know. Therefore, being a “mechanic” is not only limited to the ISTP. You could also have an ISTP who loves marine biology and works with sea mammals. He or she knows everything there is to know about marine life, that they excel at it. Anything the ISTP wants to learn can be excelled at due to their Ti/Se. I’m an ISTP and for me it’s gardening and repairing/restoring furniture. A couple other things as well. \n\nSo ISTP’s get their name “The mechanic” from the fact that we all need to learn everything there is to know about what we like to do. But we’re not all mechanics. We can be anything. Interests and abilities aren’t always limited to your MBTI type.\n\n**ISTP’s are not emotional people**\n\nGet this into your head: All types are emotional. If you do not experience empathy, feeling guilty when you harm someone or something, you don’t feel anything at all....you may actually have a mental illness. \n\nISTP’s do have feelings just like everyone else. We have inferior Fe. We WANT to belong, we WANT to help, and we WANT to make some friends but we don’t really know how because of our low Fe. We’re awkward at times. If someone we love comes to us crying and having a meltdown, we will want to help them but we just don’t know the right thing to say. We do love people, things, and animals just like the next person does. We just don’t always know how to deal with our feelings and especially other people’s feelings. \n\n**ISTP’s are very cold and abrupt**\n\nISTP’s, once again, have inferior Fe. This means we’re not cold. ISTP’s are pleasant people who are often easygoing and “chill” to be around. Dominant Ti can come across as cranky at times but for the most part we’re easygoing. Our facial expressions and body language will show this easy going nature. We won’t look pissed off or like we fucking hate you (unless we actually don’t like you) \n\n**ISTP’s don’t like serious relationships or commitment**\n\nWe do, but we want it to be with someone who understands us and has the same mindset as us. However, we’re not big future thinkers so don’t expect us to talk about marriage and kids unless we actually want that. We live in the moment and just want to spend quality time with our partners and show love through touch. \n\nSome ISTP’s may want a serious relationship, some may not. But overall, we only think about relationships if the opportunity crosses us with a person who is really great! It’s not something we tend to dwell on. You probably won’t hear an ISTP saying “Wow I get so lonely I just want someone to love and snuggle with.” Healthy ISTPs are independent people who do not NEED romantic relationships in order to feel fulfilled or validated.
17	I think the mechanic stereotype comes from a general misunderstanding of how Ti-Se works. Every time i see it compared to Ti-Ne it's always about how we can be limited in our intellectual pursuits if it doesn't serve some practical purpose. Since we are introverted dominants, our primary focus is on ourselves and what we **want** to learn about and specialize in. Our secondary focus is how to make that interest useful or practical to ourself or others. \n\nYes, we're likely not going to have the same insane scope of Ti-Ne intellectualism, but since Ti is more of a driving force in our pursuits, we are more inclined to focus in on one aspect of our interest and learn as much as we can so we can master it.\n\nA more personal side to this is how in my life, becoming a mechanic would actually be quite **im**practical because there are so many others around me that have taken up that field. I don't have an issue with not understanding what's wrong with my engine because I know I have at least 3 or 4 people who could fix it for me for cheap.
9	> ISTP’s don’t like serious relationships or commitment\n\nwhen the going gets tough, the tough get goin\n\nwell that, and if she borin
6	I wouldn’t call myself a mechanic either.. I actually live in Chicago so I prefer public transit. I’ve never worked on a car.. my Se is more for boxing, rock climbing and other physical activities, street smarts, And being fully aware of my environment and scanning all the changes that happen to it through the day. 
4	I agree with your perspective; it's very insightful. Btw, are you a francophone by any chance? I noticed that your username means blue Sunday.
4	Great post here.
3	Good stuff!
3	I certainly agree with your first point. I like how things work but I'm crap with working with my hands. However I love gardening also. 
3	Good lord that just answered a lot of questions. Thank you, kind sir. You just helped me understand myself a little better. 
3	I agree with everything you said, good summary of mistyping in the ISTP community.
3	Simple and to the point :)
2	Female ISTP here. One of my strongest traits is being mechanically inclined. That does not mean being a literal mechanic, though it could.  I innately take things apart, put them together, fix them and redesign them either literally or in my mind. If the knob falls off my toaster I have to look into the situation further troubleshooting fixing, redesigning. Another good example of how my mind works is when you get a happy meal toy and you put it together, I have to make sure that every tab and flap and knob are put together the way they were designed to work. Then I determine the design flaws which are usually vast in the happy meal toy genre. As they usually barely work to do the thing kids are trying to do with it. Anyway that is what they mean by “the mechanic”. And boy howdy do I have it. So maybe this isn’t your dominant trait but it doesn’t just mean obsessing on whatever you’re interested in, it is literally analyzing the logic and the mechanics of how things come together to work. 
1	wow. none of this is correct, dude. 
8	Truth in stereotypes	Which stereotypes are true for you?\n\nI'm a mechanic in the military, my hobbies are drinking and getting lost in foreign countries/ nature. 
13	I am an low-key adrenaline junkie.
5	I daydream all the time and seek for a soulmate in a relationship.
4	I don’t want to have kids and I don’t do well in school 
3	I’m an adrenaline junkie, very athletic and naturally good at sports, work as a chemical engineer, serious procrastinator, hate inane rules, like fast cars.\n\nThat’s probably where the truth in stereotypes ends for me though lol. 
3	I'm a computer engineer. I've run away from my previous romantic relationships when faced with true commitment. Most folks think I have the emotional capacity of a potato. I spend nearly all my time alone. I love nature and being outdoors - but where is quiet. I don't ever come into on time because I don't deem it necessary. I also don't follow any rules that I disagree with. 
3	I need nature in my blood, and if could I joined the military but I'm a pretty good shooter. I love to creating and diys. friendly but very private. Etc  Almost all the stereotypes! 
3	What were your results on the 16 Personalities quiz?	Even though it's obvious we are all ISTP's I'm more interested in the &#37; in the numbers you guys got.\n\nHere's mine: [https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/3b587f8e82df0](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/3b587f8e82df0)
11	I almost always got INTP. 
8	On that quiz, I've gotten INFP-T and INTP-T at different times in my life. \n\nStill not 100% confident in being an ISTP - after doing more than reading test result descriptions. I'm almost certain I've got the functions of an ISTP, just not exact on the order. \n\nDunno, but the test seems to only look at macro behaviors. With almost every question, my head goes, "It depends!!!"
4	\nINTP-A\n\nIntrovert =81\niNtuitive =55\nThinking =61\nPerceiving =89\n\nThis is the first test where my T was so low. I think it’s because I respect other people’s emotions, but I definitely don’t think emotionally and I rarely emote.
4	Here's [mine.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/363410007708139524/467398720259096597/unknown.png?width=616&height=411)\n\nI usually answer things as yes or no, the other options in between don't matter, so that's probably why my numbers are so skewed. 
3	Got ISTP-A and 93% introverted lol
2	Either istp or intp
2	[heres mine](https://i.imgur.com/cewW8QV.png)
2	Isfp
2	That test gives me results all over the place.\nUsually I get INTP, ISTP, and ISFP. \nBut there are times when it also told me I was an ISTJ and INTJ.
1	ISTP-A, 74% Introverted, 69% Observant, 88% Thinking, 82% Prospecting, 63% Assertive
1	ISTP-A\n\n73% Introverted\n55% Sensing\n82% Thinking\n74% Perceiving\n63% Assertive
1	ESTP - A
1	[deleted]
1	ISTP \n\n58% thinking   \n58% introverted   \n86% observant    \n90% prospecting lol.\n\n
1	Infp, with 50 50 on st/nf
1	INTP-A on phone yesterday, ISTP-A on comuter today. Judging was around 55% yesterday, 7% today. Higher introversion compared to yesterday. Weird, but today's test is more how I feel and act. Maybe INTP - ISTP mix is what I am. I have both the positives and negatives from both sides and some of them are overlapping.
1	ISTJ-A, but a few of these are nearly 50/50 https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality
1	ISTP-A\n93% introvert\n69% observing\n53% thinking\n67% prostpecting
13	What is Your Favourite MBTI type (aside from ISTP)?	
69	ESPN. So entertaining
13	ENFP, from my experience, they are a hell of a lot of fun to be around, and they bring me out of my shell
8	INTP and INFJ.
8	ENFP was my favorite relationship. I'm pretty bad at typing though, so it's possible that there are other types that I prefer (but just don't know). 
6	I’d have to say the cookie cutter ENFJ and INFJ. \n
3	INTP INFP
5	ENFP's. one of my closest friends is an ENFP and she's the funnest person to be around.
4	INFP's 💜
3	ENTP and ESTP- always down for some crazy shenanigans 
4	ENTP... i can’t keep up sometimes but it’s just nice not thinking about what topic to start a convo LOL\nand the INTP around me... their what-if jokes are hilarious
4	ENTP - Having someone with high Ti is always a plus for me, and their chaotic Ne is guaranteed fun most of the time. Also at least the one I know has a certain charm to her, there are not many dull moments around ENTPs imo.
4	ISFJ and ENFJ. 
2	INTP, though I end up with a lot of INFP and I/ENTJ friends too
1	ESTP! My manager is one and we have good talks about Se stuff.. and we can be real with each other and not Get offended. My issue with this ESTP is that he talks a little too much sometimes to where he needs a good punch in the face.. but I understand he’s extroverted so I’ll give him a pass. I also like INTJ. 
1	ENFJ. \nMost ISTP I've heard say they don't like them but healthy ENFJs are majestic. :)\nI wish I knew more of them in real life but oh well.
1	ESTJ for relationship , ENFP for friendship 
9	What's the pettiest thing you've done to get back at someone?	
30	avoid and disappear on people i particularly didnt want to be friends with in the first place
32	So I used to be friends with a diagnosed sociopath (anti social personality disorder) and she was completely wrecking havoc on our friend group. She lied about being a poor girl from Vietnam. Her parents are Vietnamese but they live in America and are super rich. I won’t even get into the things she did because this response would be a novel. Just know she’s crazy and extremely dangerous.\n\nSo she purposely spilled her pasta sauce on these blankets I had from Syria. She said she did this because I was one of the 15 people who reported her to the head of residence for causing problems. Then she told me she was supposed to paint this Syrian flag for the Syrian refugee club at our university. She wanted to do it in my room. I said yes. She painted it completely wrong! She did the wrong colours (used colours like blue and pink. She was an idiot for not looking at a pic of it first) \n\nBut then I noticed she drew the Star of David instead of the regular 5 point stars on the flag. Not only were they the wrong star, but they were blue. Much like the flag of Israel. So I took this opportunity to screw her over.\n\nI went “Wow Serena, that’s a beautiful Syrian flag!! Why don’t we put your name on the back of it so everyone knows you did it?? Someone’s gonna take credit!” She, being the narcissist she was, jumped on the idea and wanted to post her Syrian flag to Instagram and snap chat. Then she said “But I really want to impress arabs, so I need you to help me translate “I love Syrians” into Arabic ok?” So I went okay. I wrote it out for her. She thinks it says “I love Syrians” on it but it actually said “I EAT DOG ASS” in Arabic. She took a pic of herself with the flag and the sign and posted it to social media, and brought them both with her to the event that the club was holding. \n\nShe ended up getting kicked out of residence for unrelated reasons. Basically she beat up some girls boyfriend and stalked and harassed residents. So I’d say she deserves this. \n\nIt was the pettiest thing I’ve done. 
9	Hung a freshly used condom on my neighbours door handle for being a cunt. Haha 😂
10	Idk I definitely get petty and passive aggressive thoughts sometimes, but I don't really ever act out on them. But instead, I'll detach from whomever... which I guess is semi-passive aggressive, but I just don't want to deal with them and I'd rather just drop them than confront them (if it's something to be "petty" over, then it's probably a small or stupid argument anyway). 
7	[deleted]
3	Removed one button on each of my stepsisters uniform cause she's an absolute cunt
4	People always told me I couldn't do what I wanted to do. It lead to a lot of self-doubt, disbelief, lack of confidence and depression to be told your whole life to give up on your life, conform and work in a factory.  One day a person I looked up to told me I should quit. It drove me to burn every bridge I had and pursue what I wanted, get successful and reach a decent quality of life... I don't really do petty things. If someone is a dick, I just dismiss them. It's a waste of my time and energy to even consider retaliating when I could just walk the other way and focus on something else. If I'm stuck in a situation where I can't just walk away, I guess the pettiest thing i'll do is use someones argument against them, sets anyone off. 
3	I let my friend borrow my car because his girl was in town and everyone wanted to go out also so he played DD and I told him he might have to drive us all back to the dorms tomorrow morning and then after a great night we’re all at a mutual friends house and  I call him the day after and he said no he’s busy when I foretold him this so we all took an Uber back \nThat Monday we all car pool to work and I drive so I decided to sleep for an extra half hour all of us don’t have to be at work until 8 he has to be there at 730 and we leave 730 on the dot \nHis supervisor called me unreliable and he had to find another way to work so now he walks. 
3	Rubbed my bare ass on my roommate’s pillow for being a douche.
2	Emptying a tube of fast-acting glue in my former neigbors doorbell at 6 am in the morning during winter. Did it a second time a few weeks later.\n\nThat'll teach the fucker.
1	Me and my ENFP room left a bunch of passive aggressive notes around our kitchen one year in college but it was only because our roommates were slobs that almost caused a grease fire and also didn't believe in refrigerating raw meat for some reason. 
16	ISTP Cognitive Orientation Guidebook	
11	Tldr
5	Wow that was long. I did it, but sheesh
2	Sorry, but this one takes even longer to get to the point. :P
1	what
8	Would engineering or medicine be a better career direction for ISTPs?	
16	If medical then research.  I'd stay away from any direct patient care.
7	Engineering, by far. We love to build and fix shit, it helps establish our understanding of the world. Ideally you would work on practical things or even with your hands, not just engineering abstract and theoretical things.\n\nWorking with people is super exhausting and having to care for someone on their death bed and fake a smile doesn't sound very fun to me. I'm thinking primarily of healthcare, but a job where you're a medical technician or work with the chemistry of medicine sounds interesting.
5	Depends which ISTP we are talking about.  
4	Medicine/health. Anything to do with learning about how your body works will benefit you as a person and give you skills to excel at and enjoy your physical hobbies more.
3	Engineering can work well, though there are many different disciplines of Engineering. Electrical, civil, mechanical, and in more recent years compared to those, software. They have the potential for radical ideas and broad thinking, though often require being specific and doing rudimentary, repetitive and mundane tasks. The best job in this field can have a mixture of both though usually it's a matter of methodically working through something, especially with mathematics and that can be taxing for some ISTP, and also exactly what some ISTPs want.\n\n\nA balance can sometimes be to be educated in an engineering field and then find a job which relies on applying that knowledge, so for example you might want to learn how electronic hardware components work and go together, and then go into marketing those so you're applying the knowledge and presenting it in different and wonderfully creative ways.
3	My personal experience: my two best subjects were computer science and biology. My reasons for choosing computer science:\n\n1. Dislike academia and wanted the least amount of schooling possible while earning a good living. I've also lucked out and am in a position where I get different projects using different technologies (usually ones I'm unfamiliar with), and can never be bored or complacent.\n\n2. Regular patient care is not something I'd want to deal with. Also, my favorite doctors have been the ones who listen and are empathetic, and give holistic suggestions in addition to the purely medical advice. I don't have the mental energy to be that kind of person. 
2	If you can make it through 8 years of studies, I suppose. Emergency room care and triage would be plenty exciting for an ISTP. 
2	Eh, academics isn't something I am a fan of. Anything that is hands on would be good for an ISTP. 
1	My brother is ISTP and he work in medecine, patient contact, etc. It seem he's okay with it. \nOther brother and myself are more on the engineering side, my brother can take it but myself have a hard time, monotony, etc. There is someone who is right about integrating a little human stuff into work make it less boring.\n\nI know many ISTP/ENFP in physical things thought
2	Who do you sit with at lunchtime?	
21	Mostly no one. Occasionally friends or SO, but even with a close circle of friends, I prefer(??) doing these things on my own generally.\nMaybe not prefer, but I subconsciously make choices that end in these results. \n
6	Usually no one. When I was in high school, I absolutely hated how I had to find people to sit with and I really enjoyed being able to eat by myself in college without looking weird.
5	The same people I sit with all day at work...
5	Normally alone. I really need it since I my job requires a lot of social interaction
3	Still in high school, so whichever acquaintance is in the art room as well at the time.  I either do that or work on a project, but if i work on a project during a meal I have to remind myself to eat, otherwise I don't. 
3	When I had to be at the office, in my car or at a park.\nNow, with my dogs 
3	I stay away from the lounge, it’s too noisy! I go and eat alone in a conference room. 
2	I hate taking lunch breaks. It’s so hard to get going again after taking a break. I’ve had a lot of jobs in my life and my favorites were the ones I could eat on the fly, or take a minimal break and get back to work. But to answer the question, I can sit by myself or with others as the situation requires, I really don’t care.
1	I work alone, and I eat alone. \n\nIn my break room. 
1	depends where I am and who I'm with
1	If I get asked to eat with someone, then I do so. Otherwise, I just go have lunch by myself. It's what I did in middle school when I used to have no friends, and it's never something that bothered me. Now that I'm much older, I've noticed a couple of people who seem to have this phobia of having lunch by themselves. I don't get it. :I
1	Usually alone. I liked to still be at work during lunch time and watch some show to feel like I'm not really at work. Makes for being at work a little more bearable. 
1	Myself, and a book.
1	When I was in school I sat with friends. In the Army I sat with my squad/platoon. For the past 20+ years in the real world I eat lunch alone 99&#37; of the time. I have an office with a door so usually close the door and read or watch something on Netflix while I eat my lunch.
1	I sleep in too late to eat lunch
1	i either skip lunch or buy snacks i can eat fast\n\nand oh, i never eat with anyone unless i'm forced and get dragged by someone
1	People I like, e.g. friends, or nobody. 
1	In college I managed to make a few friends so I would eat with them. Either that or ask a classmate if they were hungry and grab a bite or coffee with them.\n\nAt work I usually eat in the office with the coworkers in my department. When I eat in the cafeteria usually either by myself or with the few people I can tolerate.
1	The superficial bonding conversations bore me to tears. I don't really give a fuck what you and your husband did this weekend or how your kid had a birthday party. \n\nUsually I leave and eat alone but sometimes end up eating with more popular people. Somehow the fact I'm aloof is attractive to them.
1	I skipped lunch to avoid looking like a loner. The one time I sat with my peers, they were surprised like a miracle from God happened lol
1	Usually/preferably no one. One of the best hours of my day. 
1	Has anyone here been a quality documentation specialist before?	What is it like? Is it very routine or is there more variation in it? I have a job interview for that position and I kind of want to know what I'm getting myself into.
3	Interviews go both ways.\n\nInterview them to decide if you want the job. I’ve also found that if you go in with that attitude, that it is you doing the interview to decide if the company is good enough for you, that interviews are far less intimidating.
1	so i do compliance for clinical trials and we review a lot of documentation (pharmacy manuals, consent forms, protocols, literally everything). \n\nmaybe its just me. but i fucking hate it. 
1	Ew that sounds like a soul draining job
1	it's probably really boring tbh. most ISO documentation stuff is.
11	ISTP - The Weapons Specialist	
5	Maybe I'm just being an ISTP but this article sucked. Get to the point already.
3	idk if it's just me but I feel like ISTP's are being criticized in this article.
2	what a dumbly written article that doesn’t cater to its audience. 
1	Okay so besides what I said in another comment about the tone being condescending, I do think it is a good article overall and agree with it, especially the part about childhood which I find very accurate. 
13	Dependence	I usually need a woman in my life to make me feel happy, I get really scared about being alone. This will lead me to stay in bad relationships for fear I won't find anyone again, even though I know that's not true. Does anyone else have this feeling?
24	Seems like depression or anxiety more than anything ISTP related
15	I did that all through my 20’s. \n\nGets old eventually. I’ve been ok being single for the last two years now. \n\nTrying to find completion in another person is a dead end. You don’t find anything you didn’t bring yourself. 
11	There's someone in you who knows this is unhealthy. (obviously, or you wouldn't be posting this)\n\nI have been there before. Only recently, after the beginning of this year, have I been happy alone. \n\nI used to think I was worthless unless someone was with me, like my existence was only valuable through another's eyes. \n\nIt took a nasty breakup and significant life stress in failing to launch a business to realize that I don't need anyone - or anything for that matter. I stopped lusting, wanting, needing. I started loving myself instead. \n\nThese days, I'm looking forward to a strong relationship - one I know I would never be able to build without myself being a stable foundation. Yet, I'm not needing it. \n\nI'm not desperate for someone to love me, or to love someone, anymore. I eventually got disgusted with how dependent I was for my self worth and started creating my own. \n\nI *actually* feel happy, in a non-fleeting way. I feel full, and not of myself. I find joy in seeing the leaves move on trees and having a good hot tea. I've found its much easier to stay content these days. \n\nThough I've only recounted my experience, I hope it helps in some way. 
9	These hoes ain't loyal
4	I think we all wrestle with balancing the masculine/feminine yin/yang all our lives.  I've been bouncing around relationships and sex a lot in my thirties.  It's the *fear* of being alone that you have to confront.  And confront it, you will.  Because we all die, alone.  Being alone, if not used for learning and growth, or peace, can be a good thing and should not be feared.  Let the loneliness flow through you, and release it.  Once you get past that fear, you can live in the *now*.
1	Yes I was like that. Then I realized what a huge time suck bad relationships are and how unproductive it was. So now I’ve been single for a couple months and I like just being responsible to nobody but myself. I’ll probably want a relationship again in a few months but right now I’m glad to not have to deal with accommodating a boyfriend all the time. 
1	nope
32	Do you often think you’re the loneliest person on the planet?	Don’t get me wrong. I love my independence. I love my work. And I have tons of hobbies to never get bored in life. I also have a few friends who never get tired of reaching out to me. \n\nHowever there are moments when loneliness strikes me and it’s something I cannot bear. \n\nIt’s the same feeling I have when I want to share what I know / have discovered and yet there’s no one who has same interests that I can talk to. \n\nThis feeling sucks like an eternal grip in my life. \n\n
11	Are you sure that it's *Loneliness* and not another emotion?  \n\nBecause, one of the things we are weak at is identifying feelings, sometimes our own.  Often, our own.  Quite often, actually.  \n\nWhat does it feel like?
21	No.  Never would I think that out of billions of people I have somehow managed to claim any such title.
4	Everyone has moments like that. What happens when you attempt to talk/share with your friends? Do they reject you?\n\n
5	I am happily married to a gorgeous Asian wife with three children. I am the most smothered and overwhelmed individual on the planet and it's all I can to to reclaim my independence for 20 minutes. 
6	it's hard to feel lonely when you have 5 kids. Also I'm a metalhead, and as long as there is another metalhead around I have a friend. 
3	[deleted]
3	I get this feeling when I don’t feel free. We ISTP just need freedom in work, relationship, family and responsibilities. 
4	Story of my current life. Doesn't help my hobbies are generally solitary too :s
2	I know how you feel. The people I talk to at school don't talk to me outside of school because who needs help with homework during the summer? So I haven't really talked to anyone my age since May. \nMy family isn't into the same stuff I am, so can't really discuss anything I discover with them. 
2	No, just another lonely person. 
2	Nope. I am my best company.  
3	Stories and opinions of those with superior/inferior complex	Anyone here know someone with a superior/inferior complex? I've always found those attitudes perplexing. Like why do you have to please everyone, or why do you have to put people down, nobody gives a shit. 
6	I have simultaneous both. u/__celli is correct. In childhood my worth was usually derived from that of others. Either I was better than others or worse than others / abnormal. I can only remember once where my mother spoke about my good qualities and that was during my confirmation with an audience. It absolutely wreaks your self-perception and gives you no sense of inherent goodness or any sense of self for that matter. Although it's deeply seated it has gotten better though because I realize where it's coming from and that makes it easier to disidentify from it and not blindly act it out.
3	People with superiority complexes probably grew up being told they were better than everyone else. Parents do this all the time. And people with inferiority complexes probably grew up being told they were shit. Parents also do this all the time. \n\n\nThese complexes are more about nurture than nature. 
1	My worst ex has a superiority complex but i wouldnt be surprised if it doubled as an inferiority complex too. She was an INTJ, and absolutely horrid. Thought herself better than everyone else, her ways best, and those who encountered her were gifted with her time; like you should be thankful she was spending time to do things the right way for you because she knows everything, whats best, ect. she hid it well from my oblivious ass so i didnt pick up on it until way late, but it made her a terrible person, and there was no sympathy to be offered in the end. she was a jerk, and an asshole. \n\nnow that im learning more about intj and infj, im discovering a lot of these ni doms seem to be very insecure in their own capability, especially when it comes to learning. it can be difficult for them. it helped explain why so many of them were weirdly attracted to me, thought i was so cool and amazing, yet equally eager to steamroll over me with their "clearly superior insights". they were jealous. ive always had a natural confidence in me that i can do anything and should be able to, can learn anything, can be anything, ect. and to add onto it, im great at learning things all on my own, wheras it seems a lot of ni-doms need very specific instructions and directions in order to learn. and if they dont have that, they struggle very badly. control often becomes an issue, and something they need as a result. \n\nits so weird. i still get so many NT's and INTJ/ni-people like that, where it seems theyll get this crazy first-sight attraction, and then almost immediately into interaction, bully me around and start trying to dictate/control. which, of course, any ISTP isn't going to tolerate; and neither do i. So I'll end it pretty much immediately, but especially if its aggressive or insulting. \n\nI recently met one that was so infatuated he offered me residency with him, but then turned around and tried to tell me that the way i learned (self-teaching) was impossible, stubborn, idiotic, primitive, ect. And tried to make himself look like some messiah of greater learning. The whole thing felt like he was really insecure with himself, and like it was such a personal sore spot. 
1	INTJ I work with has a superiority complex when it comes to his job and knowledge, but an inferiority complex when it comes to members of the opposite sex. I tell him he thinks too much and needs to just do it. There’s even a coworker who fancies him. I told him he just ask her out. I even told him what to say but for some reason he doesn’t feel like he’s good enough.\n\nI don’t understand it much myself. I’m like just clear your mind, take a breath and go for it.
9	How do you create the desire to do something with passion?	
20	You can't. It comes naturally 
10	Personally, I can't create desire. The closest thing I do is keep doing something until I find a method that clicks with me.\n\nI'm kind of On/Off like that
8	I have no problem with initial desire of things that give me passion. I have more of an issue with sticking with them when the initial excitement has worn off. That comes with age.
4	Motivating is short, intensive, and fleeting for me. The rest is just strict self-discipline 
3	What do you mean by something? Are you talking about how to create the desire to work?
3	For myself, I just have to walk into something that I'm passionate about. I can't make myself like something if I didn't like it the first time. Take for example Fortnite, plenty of people love it and play it, but I played 1 round and concluded it wasn't for me. I either want to play a shooter, or a building game, not both. \n\nWhat I did find passion in was growing weed, I liked smoking it, and my state made it legal, so I started growing. It involves a lot of time and effort, with some failure and success, but at the end you get your own little reward.\n\nYou just have to find something you like doing, try something once, don't force yourself to like it just because others do. When you stumble upon something, make the best of it. Forcing yourself to like something isn't the ISTP way of life.
2	Adderall
2	You stumble upon something you enjoy doing. Be mindful of what you do and if it makes you feel like you don't want to stop.\n\nOnce you find that something, set a goal to become a professional in whatever it is. Have that goal written and visible somewhere you frequently look. PC background, inspiration board, framed on  your desk etc. Motivation and passion is extremely fleeting. I don't know if that's an ISTP thing or not but I do not feel passion for more than a week at best, can't work with that. But if I can define a goal when I'm at my highest and I write that down and remind myself of it daily, I can usually visualize and work up enough will-power to keep moving.  \n\n\nISTP's like things that they can be highly mechanically skilled at, Involves problem solving and isn't too slow paced.\n\nBest job for me would be something that got my adrenaline pumping, involved in-the-moment problem solving and fairly high paced but doesn't require several years of sitting at a desk studying books. I've often considered becoming a forest ranger or some such. I don't quite enjoy rescue work or law enforcement. I have too many problems with current laws and regulations to be able to enforce them. Another ISTP trait.  \n
1	Isn’t passion more for feeling types? 
1	Chang in personality	Ive been an ISTP fo years!!! Recently I took the test again and got INTJ twice. Has this happened to anyone here and if so what was the time span on the difference? Do you like the new profile more and agree with it? \n\nFor me Im conflicted I still feel its just a guideline but the other profile made me feel more human if that makes sence. 
3	MBTI types are more akin to mental illnesses than to any standard that a human should embrace as an identity.  Just sayin, lol.\n\nA change in type should mean that you have developed certain functions to a point that they have become dominant, or that those functions are currently dominant in your life for whatever reason.  Whichever type you get is a good indicator for which functions you use most, and can also be a good indicator for which functions you use least.  This gives a framework for personal improvement, imo, more so than an identity.
2	I mean, I don't know how old you were when you first too the test but you can change the way you look at life over time which can change your test results. I don't think people's core personality changes though. \n\nI don't know what you mean by more human though. Are you saying that the description of an INTJ make sense of your actions better?
2	Here's [Chang](https://i.imgur.com/hHsAQ9g.jpg)
1	In middle school, I took the test and got INTJ in 6/7th grade, INTP in 8th, and ISTP throughout high school. I take the test every few months, still an ISTP. 
1	Did you develop multiple personality disorder, and your other personality spoke chinese ?\n
1	Same thing happened to me. When I first took the test I was an ISTP, an year later I tested as an ISTJ.\nI'm kind of confused because I have some habits of both the types equally so I can't really confirm which type I am. A mix of both would kinda describe me well. 
24	Doing a study on sexuality comparisons among MB types. The survey's on sex, so it ranges from your views on sex to your preferences/kinks. Totally anonymous, all questions are optional. No essays. Only takes about 15 mins. I'll share the results :)	
20	Wow, a survey with no typos, adequate options, moderate length, and good questions? Are you on the wrong subreddit?
8	Sure, why not.\n\nGood questions. Quick question of my own, why the political belief question at the end?
4	That was actually kinda fun. \n\nI look forward to seeing the results. 
11	Question 2 is a trick question. There are only two genders. 
4	Quality survey. And it actually took less time than expected. Last survey I took here that said 15 minutes I quit 25 minutes into. \n\n\nAlso nice that you had a completion bar. So I could tell I was nearing the end. 
3	Click the post title to go to the survey :)
3	I took it. Now waiting for results
2	OP when can we expect results? 
1	Have you got the results from this posted yet?
14	Is this accurate to you ?	
16	Is he just... thinking about war and feeling stuff?\n\nSometimes. 
11	Accurate in the sense I didn't read any text that had more than one sentence to it. Skipped ahead. Got gist. Meh. \n\nTo answer the question: No it's not accurate. 
8	This comic is sneakily bullying S types.\n\n
6	IF were just going off of the pretty thinking pictures and the "what is he even doing here?" then yes
6	Maybe I would answer if there were more context?
6	wut
4	wot
5	If I’m just fantasizing about whatever strikes my fancy at the time when everything else is boring, yeah, I could see that being me. I *do love* that winter log cabin!\n\nI’d probably be looking around at the whole group situation and only actively interact when I’m directly communicated with. So basically this picture if ISTP was more present in his surroundings.\n\nps enfj is lol
3	Negative.\n\nHonestly, I'm of the belief that the *only* reason so many anonymous posters on the internet proclaim to identify the INTJ is because some polls cite it as being the least frequent type; and people feel empowered being special. Literally every meme, as this one, establishes some kind of INTJ vs everyone narrative.\n\nMBTI is junk science first and foremost - it's only real useful application is gaining an understanding for how other people see themselves and learning better methods of communication.
1	You have no idea how accurate it is 
50	Is anyone else occasionally a complete dickhead?	This happens to me every now and again at work, and by 'happens to me', I mean... Every now and again I do or say something that 5-10 minutes later I think "Wow, that was a dickhead thing to do/say, I owe \*insert name here\* an apology."\n\nUsually it's to a guy that I think is a total wanker, but today it wasn't. And I'm also annoyed because now the guy that I think is a wanker will be justified in all of the bad things he tells his wife about me because now I've done it to someone else.\n\nFollowing these occasions is a shame spiral and painful self-reflection / about an hour of being teary. \n\nI really dislike my job, and I think that adds to this and is why it reoccurs. \n\nAnyone else do this? Is it an ISTP thing? Or is it a thing that's caused by me being a complete dickhead?
29	Yeah, I do this all the time. My level of intensity when communicating can be off and I don't realize it until I see the other person react or I've had time to replay it in my head. \n\n\nI don't know if there's a solution to this. It's easier said than done, but try not to worry about it. People are inherently selfish and in social situations are thinking more about themselves, like how they appear or what they are going to say. So it is very likely that even if you made the interaction weird, they will be thinking about what they did and not you.\n\n\nAlso, why are you worried about what that wanker tells his wife? She clearly has bad judgement if she's gone and married a wanker. 
11	You're not a dickhead, I think that's just part of being a normal person. Nobody rolls out of bed in the morning and says, "I'm gonna be a dick to everyone." Sometimes people are just tired of dealing with stuff in their lives that may or may not have anything to do with the person they just snapped at. It's all good.
8	Yes it is an ISTP thing. And it's one of our largest character flaws. Get more "I" time and try to pause more before saying something you might regret.\n\nSuffer fools or be dickhead.  Major suck.
8	Yea it happens, and most of the times  I'm  unapologetic about it, because I know that what I'm saying is objective and the truth. Well, sometimes I might be a dickhead joking with my close friends, and usually they are cool with it, but there's always that one that takes things too seriously.
5	Rarely. What’s the purpose? I’ve got a very purpose driven methodical brain. Being a dickhead to someone does nothing but make things worse. So it’s a complete waste of my time and energy. Why would I blow up and throw a fit when I can stay calm and try to rectify the situation? \n\n\nTo me, losing your cool is a sign of immaturity and lack of ability to keep yourself composed. If you’re perfectly capable of handling a situation properly, then being a dickhead isn’t even an aforethought. 
3	Me all the time. Unintentionally though. It makes me feel really bad and I usually apologise. 
2	I think everyone else can occasionally be dickheads. I can for sure, seems like you can too. It doesn't look good though, so I try to keep most things to myself. Jokes fuck it up for me the most, a lot of people read "truth" from jokes. Other people are the worst :)
2	Everyone is occasionally a dickhead. The fact that you have the empathy to realise you were a dickhead makes you a better than average human.
2	I usually try not to care what others think as I'm usually not bluntly rude to others.\n\nOften, people can mistake me for being an asshole simply because I'm very negative. I had someone say to me once "Do you ever say anything uplifting or encouraging?", which I found to be quite annoying  \n
2	anger, and irritation happens to me at least a few times a day, used to bottle it in, now i just say it how it is, no matter who i'm talking to. then if it's a close friend or someone from fam i do get the "i was a dick" feel to it, usually when i'm over that tho. i don't apologize though because i've already said enough apologies to people when i didn't even do anything that bad when i was a kid, it's an empty word even if i do say it. hell, i told some store manager to go fuck himself when he wouldn't let me return an item because i was 30 seconds late. still waiting to "feel like a dick" about it.

1	My mom used to tell me that I couldnt just say the things I said sometimes because I felt them because they aren’t exactly nice even if they were true. 🙄

1	no, do you always ask stupid questions?
8	Best video games for ISTP?	Considering we get bored often and quite easily, what types of video games do you personally believe to be the staple of the ISTP.\n\nPersonally I enjoy rogue likes, horror, strategy, and certain fps. Also good ol Chess.\n\nTo name a few I really enjoy\n\n-Enter the Gungeon\n\n-Teleglitch\n\n-Civilization 5\n\n-Wolfenstein New Order\n\n-Doom\n\n-Amnesia Dark Descent\n\n-Total War Warhammer\n\n-Dark Souls\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention Freespace 1 and 2 the best spacesims ever created. 
30	I feel like an anomaly when it comes to being an ISTP and my gaming preferences.\nI LOVE simulation games. Give me anything with a lot of customization and the ability to build stuff and I can spend hours playing. I love the Sims, Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing and similar. I find them to be really calming.\n\nOtherwise I also really like adventure games like Zelda and Dragon Age, I like when you can explore and do sidequests before doing the main story.
7	I've been playing action RPGs recently, but I enjoy anything with an interesting story and decent PC controls. 
5	goat simulator 
5	I'm into overwatch 
4	I agree with you on Wolfenstein and Doom. I also have really enjoyed these two: \n\n* Nioh\n* Horizon: Zero Dawn\n\n
3	Arma
3	Just finished XCOM 2 last week, and I'm in between Overload (new 6DOF "Descent" reboot), Trials Fusion (Physics and dirtbike ridiculousness) and The Last Of Us (which I'm not enjoying as much as I thought I would.)  Planetside2 is my go-to Multiplayer FPS.  \n\nIf you like Roguelikes, like me, here are some of my favorites:\n\nDungeons of Dredmor (Hilarious writing, good, challenging chesslike dungeon crawler with a great soundtrack)\n\nDungeon of the Endless is terrific as a hybrid roguelike tower-defense resource-management adventure.\n\nDead Cells is great, but I liked it better last year before the updates kinda rounded the edges.\n\nCryptark is a bit like Gungeon in control, but different in mission design.  You might like it.  \n\nSlay the Spire is a great roguelike deckbuilding card game vs monsters.  
3	World of tanks, civ 4, cities skylines, minecraft, ksp\n
3	The Binding of Isaac if you're in to rougelikes
4	CSGO
2	I’ve been enjoying an early access game on steam called Empyrion: Galactic Survival. \n\nIt’s kinda like Minecraft in space. I enjoy building bases and spaceships block by block, only to have some other players come bomb my ass and take my shit. Keeps things fresh. 
2	AION due to lore.
2	My list is like this for 100+ hours spent:\n\n- Warframe (basically sci-fi ninjas in space commiting genocide to keep the balance)\n\n- War Thunder (simcade WW2 tank and plane fighter, naval froces are coming soon)\n\n- osu! (ryhtym game that is fed with content by weebs for weebs)\n\n- Devil May Cry 4 (just search donguri990 to see how deep and craziness of the game mechanics can go)\n\nUnder 100 hours category:\n\n- Bayonetta (like DMC, another great hack'n slash)\n\n- Borderlands 2 (loot'n shoot FPS, grind heavy, enemy level scaling is harsh near the end aka bullet sponge without broken combinations of skills and guns)\n\n- Shadow Warrior (great and cheesy 90's vibe FPS, suprising movement mechanics for FPS)\n\n- Nioh (Dark Souls with samurai in fantasy 1600's and much better and agressive fighting)\n\n
2	I love dark souls ;-; \n\nI honestly like a lot of video games but I've probably embarrassingly enough put the most hours into league of legends. I enjoy pvp, the rush of beating another person (or team) at the game lol I also enjoyed dota 2 just didn't stick with it \n \nI also like some older ps2 games (SHINOBI) tekken tag with the bowling minigame \nBioshock games\n\n\nMy bf loves the gungeon game I need to try it \n\nOverall I need challenge and some nice aesthetics  
1	I've been really into the new Battletech game for PC, turn based robot action, high learning curve, but its really fun.
1	The Metal Gear Solid franchise. MGS 3 was my favorite because I found the injury system fascinating. You get shot, you have to get the bullet out and stabilize the wound, like in real life. 
1	Dishonored 2 
1	I hate to take up all you guys' free time, but factorio is okay I guess.  (Proceeds to play another 6 hours straight)
1	FPS all the way for me. First or third, but anything with a shooter aspect. The holy grail of this is Descent 1, 2 and 3. Full 360^o orientation. It's a brutally difficult game; most people that played it quit because they don't have the spatial awareness that this game requires, nor the ability to aim in full 3D space. But if you got good at it, it was the most exhilarating game ever made. This was also before the general mass of morons got a computer, so MP was an absolute blast.\n\nUnreal Tournament (1999) is second place. The bots are great in closed in, complicated levels, and better than most upper tier players (They tended to group up and line up in big open levels like the twin towers).\n\nI'm a fan of the CoD series in general. Some problems with them that keep them on the lower-end of my preferences. I only do SP, because people suck. Same with the other shooters. I mostly play them SP.\n\nChanging gears, I really like racing games. I was born to be behind  a wheel, so I take right to them. I don't have much experience with the new games though. I broke my wheel several years back. But I set up DiRT3 with a KB, and running with only 1 or 2 "assists" to compensate for the KB, it's a load of fun. I can't wait to get a new wheel and a few more games in that style.\n\nLastly, the GTA series, and STALKER (CoP). Huge sandboxes like these are great also. One of the big complaints with CoD is how locked in you are to *the* path and only *the* path. Being able to design my own strategy to complete a mission is important to my creative side.
1	If i had to guess, i'm going to say that there won't be many fully linear games like the last of us or uncharted. I, personally love games where there is a goal, and i can do whatever to get to it. Like hitman, i can meticulously plan my strategy for murdering my target, or i can just take an assault rifle with me and make it quick work. Dishonored is another one of these.
1	My favourites are games that have puzzle elements to them that aren't just put the hidden thing into the receptacle, Portal would be my best example there. Also games where the movement flows and controls really well are great too like Mirrors Edge, and then finally I like watching damage numbers go up while destroying an obscene amount of enemies, all of those elements combine to create Warframe which I used to love when it was simpler, but don't have time to keep up with now.
1	Elite: Dangerous in VR is amazing.  Although, it's work- it's a job, it becomes boring.  It's a great spaceship-flight star-age society simulator MMO but it's a grind.  Tough love.
1	I've always preferred shooters.\n\nBut lately, it has been games that are easy to jump in and out of:\n\n* Rocket League\n* CS: Source\n* Diablo 3\n* Overwatch
1	A few games/series I do and have loved:\n\n-Red Orchestra\n\n-Insurgency\n\n-Zelda\n\n-Dark Souls (1+2 mostly)\n\n-Crash trilogy on ps\n\n-Metal Gear\n\n-S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\n\n-Elder Scrolls: Oblivion\n\n-Dave Mirra\n\n-Tomb Raider\n\n-SSX 3 (tricky is garbage fite me)\n\n-MX racing games\n\nNot even the tip of the iceberg so I'll just name some things I can't stand. JRPGs, Turn based Strategy, RTSes, Free for all FPSes (Call of Battlefields), Horror games, Survival games, games that play themselves...\n
1	Dune 2000 
1	i play sports games (2k, madden, fifa, etc) and GTA
1	I like racing games
1	fighting games, racing games, hack 'n slash, beat 'em up/brawler, sometimes board and sim games
1	The Just Cause series. You blow shit up. Its great.
1	I dont use to play games as I used to when I was younger. But there are some  games that I enjoy playing once in a while. \n\n\- Dirt 3\n\n\- Deus Ex\n\n\- Burnout  Series\n\n\- NFS Series\n\n\- MOH / COD Series\n\n\- Tomb Raider Series\n\n\- RE Series
1	I'm in to most games that have competitive multiplayer. Coop is alright, depending on the game. Not really into single player games, unless they're something I'm really interested in like Batman. Even then, outside of the first week, I usually have to force myself to play them. There's nothing like going head to head with other players, though. Once I discovered online multiplayer, there was no going back.\n\nRight now, my main games are R6 Siege and GT Sport. I'll also occasionally play some Rocket League, Ghost Recon, Uncharted 4 or Americas Army.
21	Are there any other ISTP artists out there? Also, existential crisis much?	I find it odd that I am so very much an ISTP yet I've been a professional artist in games for 10 years considering it's not exactly a recommended occupation for us. Just wondering if others here also have a pull towards creative expression through music or painting or anything like that.\n\nAlso. Is everyone else in a never ending existential crisis? I think mine started when I was 14 and I'm equally confused and displeased with life as before. The answer to almost everything is "I don't know" and it's crippling. Reaching goals almost always feel empty and meaningless. And I've met a ton of them.
16	If at any point I find myself at a loss of choice, I flip a coin and roll with the result.\nIf I want to flip again I want the other result to happen more.
9	I guess when it comes to an existential crisis, it's not as bad as you think... You have to realise that it's impossible to fight against your programming. And what I mean by that is that we are creatures of pleasure. Even though understanding this still doesn't explain why you are alive, it doesn't mean you can't have a good time. Our purpose has already been laid out and we pursue it automatically.  \nThis question is impossible to answer, so dwelling on it will only destroy you.
7	I'm an ISTP artist! I've been drawing, painting, photographing for my entire life. I took AP art classes in high school and scored high on the exams. I wanted to go to art school bad, and I really regret that I didn't. But I've been drawing a lot more recently. I think that art can fit in well with ISTP personalities especially if it's something technical. Like- my favorite things to draw are faces and bodies because I like trying to get the anatomy perfect and proportional. My art style can also be very geometric and detail-oriented. I think we're pretty creative. Good to know there are other ISTP artists out there :)
4	\>  Just wondering if others here also have a pull towards creative expression through music or painting or anything like that. \n\ni've taken photos for about 3 years and as of late have also started to produce music so ya
5	for years i wanted to be a professional ballroom dancer. if i went that way in life, i might honestly be a lot happier. i work a 9-5 and constantly am reconsidering all of my options. always in existential crisis mode. \n\nthe only thing i've learned so far with how to change your life, just do it. and your whole life won't change overnight. but the small steps you take towards it will make a big difference.  
3	I paint, draw, sculpt,and I really like photography.  \nAs for the existence thing, pretty much feel the same as you. It's great going through life with no ideas about the future, especially when you're about to be a senior in highschool and everyone is asking
3	I draw and paint, I always have but not as a job for that long. Would love to be able to live off of my art. Also I still can't choose a career it's hard for me to not get bored with every job I get. \n\nMy crisis has always been choosing between the creative side and the more logical side of things and what's more important. 
3	Drawing was my passion in my younger years and I was convinced I'd be an art major. I discovered programming and fell in love, and decided it was a more practical and reliable career path. \n\nUnfortunately because of the time sink involved in developing these skills, my art skills are now at the level they were when I was a preteen. \n\nI want to eventually get back to drawing, but now in my goal of getting a stronger body (brought on by knee tendonitis caused by hella weak muscles), I actually want to pick up dancing and am working my way to that instead.
3	I've been a glass artist for the past 13 years. Once a project gets past the design stage, it feels more like construction than art. I get to play with molten metal and shards of glass. If I'm lucky, we'll have to maneuver a fragile 200lb window 50ft up some scaffolding. Fun times.\n\nA common problem I have with the design side is that it is very subjective. There is no universal "right answer", and "I don't know" comes up often. My strategy is to procrastinate as long as possible, hoping to come across some new insight until my time runs out and I'm forced to just do something.\n\n"I don't know" can be great sometimes, though. It could mean there's some learning about to happen.
3	I actually like art. I think I told myself that STEM was the only pursuable field (and I do like it, often more than art/humanities), but I definitely have/had a few artistic interests: writing, drawing (not so much anymore), and I want to get into modeling and woodworking.
3	I've done some art stuff. When I was younger, I wanted to work for Pixar with all the 3D animation stuff, Maya and Z-brush etc. That dream died out; long story. I did take up photography, photoshop, and some drawing during that time. Nowadays, I do a little video editing and music editing as one of my hobbies.\n\nExistential crisis, yes. Started mid college life. Like others are saying, the fact is everyone is nobody. I just figured to do something I like as a career, have hobbies I like on the side... I really don't know for sure. Basically, life sucks, I do what I want, suck it up, deal with all the bullshit.
2	I've dabbled in some art form or another since a teenager but nothing ever stuck with me until about 10 years. For my 40th b-day my wife and parents bought me a nice DSLR camera and I've been a photographer since. Granted I'm taken far fewer photos now than I did early on mostly due to apathy. The apathy is due to people constantly asking if I was selling my work and I finally got around to putting up a website to sell my photos and no one bought anything. I, like most ISTP's, are not good at selling ourselves. \n\nI also have a Cinematic Arts (fancy name for film school) degree and created an experimental film for my final project and did several sound designs for other student projects. I continue to create experimental films in my spare time but have no plans on trying to make a career out of it.
2	Did ballet, ballroom dancing, photography, watercolor/gouache/digital painting, tried 3D for a while, did movie editing back in highschool, plays the piano. Maybe I could pull off doing digital art for games, edit videos for a living but thats about it, other than that all of the above better off be hobbies for me.\n
1	Yeah I really like drawing and embroidery, I'm not the best at either but I also just do it for fun.\n\nI get what you mean about the existential crisis. I've been having one for a solid year now. I just can't bring myself to see the point of anything since we as humans live such short lifes. I think it's because I took an office job and everyday I feel myself caring less about money and long term goals and more about being able to run free and enjoy the amount of life I have left. It doesn't help that everyone I talk to just says that's what being an adult is like. But I don't think you should have live the majority of your life doing something just because society tells you. But I am also very short sighted, I know this job is temporary until I graduate from gradschool, but I can't help but thinking I'm wasting my life.
1	Existence inherently provides an existential crisis, provided you listen to the right things. \n\nLearn to focus your thoughts on things with an end. Learn the wonder of delayed gratification. Do something that challenges you, become obsessed with a new craft. Exercise, hike, anything. Train yourself to find peace when it seems you can't. Do something you haven't done.\n\n"Show you care about something for once in your life" is what I tell myself. 
0	academic survey	Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T2DWFXG
9	I have to agree with u/__celli. This is a terribly written survey. Whoever your thesis chair is should be ashamed of themselves for allowing you to use this as is.\n\n>14. If you marked yes on question 11, can you please list the number of previous diagnosis\n\nQuestion 11 is asking me about what year I am in for school. Also the plural of diagnosis is diagnoses. \n\n\n>Students shouldn’t answer the teacher back\n\nWhat is this supposed to be mean? What is the actual question? It sounds like you don't want students to answer questions the teacher asks in class.\n\nYour sliding scales are not made properly. You can choose "0" and the lowest increment should be "1" for the metric scale you are trying to use. Your middle value is 4. **This means every response from this section is *not valid*. You *can not* use it as part of your data.**\n\nThis survey is also FAR too long. You simply aren't going to get enough people to finish it anyway. It's not your fault. Whatever professor let you do this is an embarrassment to academia.  \n
4	I’m gonna be honest, I got 250 questions in and then stopped. There’s a ton of issues with this questionnaire and illnpoint some out. For starters, there is a lot of grammatical and spelling errors. I’m not the type of person to care normally, but for academic purposes it’s very important. \n\n\n7.No option for just plain old Christian and “other” box doesn’t allow me to type an answer. \n\n\n60.I have no idea what “cut people down to size” even means. Slang in an academic questionnaire alienated people who don’t use your slang. \n\n\n63.That’s entirely about other people’s personality and my my own. \n\n\n66.i have no idea what it means to feel “unreal”. \n\n\n\n80.Literally nobody can do anything and nobody is absolutely fair or just. \n\n\n89.How can I know? People get away with being dishonest all day long. Unless I catch someone in a lie, I have no way of knowing. \n\n\n97.I don’t even complain almost ever. But that’s not an option. \n\n\n208.Again with the slang. I have no idea what it means for two people to “merge”. All that comes to mind is Marvels Firestorm character. \n\n\n231.Why are these mutually exclusive? Why can I not choose both? Because I do enjoy both. \n\n\n232.Again, why are you treating these as mutually exclusive? Because they are not. \n\n\n241.Yet again, limited options. I don’t like to run around looking for peoples mistakes *or* please people. \n\n\nThere were quite a few other questions that just either didn’t make sense or didn’t have enough answer choices to accurately answer the question. But I wasn’t in the mood to write down every single one. So I chose a few from each page. \n\n\nI’m not gonna sit here and say this is a bad survey, but I highly highly *highly* suggest you consider this a rough draft and revise it. \n\n\n(PS: sorry for the odd formatting. When the numbers/words are spaced properly, it re-does my numbers to 1-11. But I wanted to make sure you knew which specific question I was addressing.)

1	Thought this was a troll for the other survey spams on every mbti thread. Still think it is! LOL
31	I think I found a job I love	Hey guys,\n\nI'm a 24 y/o ISTP who has always had an issue with commitment (in my career and relationships unfortunately) but I believe I've found something I love. I've always worked in technical support roles which I would summarise as a 'reactive' job. Our type description is often of one who thrives in crisis situations and that has translated perfectly into my current role.\n\nMost importantly, the company I work for is great. It's a youngish, small-to-mid sized tech company with a modern office space, amazing benefits with all the resources, food, facilities and social functions I need to just focus on my work. I sit on a comfy armchair or lay on the couch with my headphones in while working on my laptop, similarly to many others here, and some days I walk around in my socks and put a big hoodie on while using some makeshift shelving as a standing desk.\n\nApart from meetings I'm pretty much given free reign of my time and am trusted to get my work done within a respectable timeframe, being considerate of my colleagues and their obligations. My role specifically requires me to absorb as much knowledge as possible, as quickly as possible, and be adaptive for when bad situations arise so I can solve them effectively, as well as mentor others in my team to be able to do the same.\n\nI wanted to share this for anyone who is a bit lost about what they want to do in their careers, or for those who don't quite know which environment they'd thrive most in. It's taken me a long time in the 5 years I've been a professional to say that I really enjoy what I do, but I think this is the closest I've ever been. Hope this helps and all the best.
9	I would probably suggest programmer/engineer/developer/IT/system admin or technical support roles at modern or forward thinking companies for anyone who is attracted to this kind of environment, especially with this amount of autonomy and freedom. If you've got any suggestions drop them below!

3	This was fun to read :) My boyfriend is an INTP programmer and your day to day sounds just like his. He loves it. I’m more and more convinced I should career switch. lol. Cheers to you!! 
2	Our type description is often of one who thrives in crisis situations and that has translated perfectly into my current role.\n\nCongrats!
2	I’m so happy for you!!! 
3	Became ISTP	For a long time I thought I was an ENTP and now after a while I did the test again and I got an ISTP which seems pretty accurate.
8	What do you mean "fucked for life"??\nLive your life how you want it... It's just a test, not something that says you have to live your life like this.\n\nI use it as a guideline, just to know that I'm not the only person in this world who thinks the way I do and acts the way I do... Because of the way we 'work', we (IMO) can feel lonely pretty fast and feel like an outsider. That's why this is nice, just to feel comfortable, give you a heads-up: "Hey you're not different, you're normal. You just think/act differently, but it's awesome if you look at it how you should"\n\n\nWow this ^ sounds like we're handicapped or something, we're not everyone has their own qualities, every type has it's positive and negative sides... And I'm happy to be an ISTP
2	Originally I found it out from this test http://similarminds.com/p_jung.html I got Real ISTP and Ideal ENTP
2	Did you look into cognitive functions?\n\nIf you only take tests that compare the two letters you're going to get a lot of different results.
1	You are definitely an ISTP. Ive identified firstly as INFJ (FiNeSiTe, socionic INFJ), I was thinking I was consequently fucked for life. The I found I was an ISTP, and had the same conclusion.\nSrlsy, ask yourself why you think you are fucked by being ISTP. And you will probably have the response about what to do for not being fucked.
1	Tests are a joke. You sound like a feeler from your post. 
18	What’s your worst memory of Fe-grip?	I remember one summer break in college when I visited my parents. On the day I arrived, my mother started to pressure me on having life goals such as getting a high-paying corporate job, finding someone to marry with and building a family. I couldn’t take it. I visited them because I only got to be with them once a year. It was supposedly a two-week stay. I left them the day after. I told them to forget me as their child. I slammed the door and cursed my way to the bus terminal. I didn’t speak to them for 1 year. My mother sent me a letter 6 months later. I didn’t read the letter. This was 10 years ago. 
19	"let's use all the knowledge I have and say the most destructive thing I can at this moment because fuck all that pressure and expectations on me"\n\n\nYeah, I know exactly how that shit goes. I had my own fair share of these moments but nothing that I couldn't solve yet. \n\nI'm getting older and it seems like I'm mellowing out in that aspect. 
16	I’m not exactly sure what Fe grip is, but I have several cringe-inducing memories of being aware that something is amiss or there’s building tension in a group setting and I do/say awkward things to try and break the tension. It usually doesn’t help and I feel horrible with the extra attention on me. Does that count?
3	wow that is a long while ago
3	Well... Worse than that, chin up! :-) 
1	Can relate
1	-sigh- *Yeah...*
4	ISTP commitment problem	Hi everyone !\n\nI am an ISTP and I’m currently dating someone. It’s been almost two years now but the problem is, I’ll be staying for 2 years abroad. So I don’t know about other ISTP but I don’t think I am good at long distance relationship. Last year, we were away for 5 months and it was hard for me to transition from being away from him to always being with him (the other way round was way easier). He seemed too needy for me and it kind of creeped me out. All in all, we handled the situation and it was great after that but I don’t know how the next time will be. \nThen, this commitment problem. My bf is planning to search for an internship in Japan next year and like, planning his next two years around me and I hate it. I just want him to live his life as if nothing was happening. \n\nSo the point is, how would you handle the situation ? I’m thinking of breaking up with him because I don’t want him to « waste » his life when I don’t know how our relationship will evolve but I know it will break him ... 
4	I would talk to him about it first and explain why you're uncomfortable with him making his life plans around you.But ultimately you gotta do what's best for you and I think it's best for him too in the long run. It's not healthy to life your life around someone else, especially if he didn't discuss it with you before deciding. Also if you are feeling creeped out at all it may be a good red flag that you need to take a break. You shouldn't stay in a relationship you don't want just because the other person to be upset.
45	Emotional Inertia?	I know we ISTPs are famous for being resistant to extreem emotions, but could it just be that we have high emotional inertia?\n\nIn other words it's not so much we gravitate toward not emoting, but that our emotions are hard to change and we just tend to spend most of our lives 'at rest'.\n\nFor most of my life I'm emotionally resistant but If an emotion does somehow get to me (rare, but it hppens), It's about as difficult to stop feeling as it was to start feeling.\n\nSo I'm wondering if any of you have this experiance or any insights on it.
22	100&#37;
9	Because of depression the meds I took for awhile, and just generally how much life has been, this was true pretty much my whole life until around the start of this year when I started getting super introspective. I've gone from ignorant bliss to emotional and full of anxiety. My mind is always racing and I struggle to even pay attention to what people I'm having conversations with are saying without getting distracted by random thoughts. How do I turn off the hard mode?
6	It's also an enneagram 9 thing, extending past emotions and into everything else. It's hard to start anything but when you do it's just as hard to stop.
5	Nope, I feel changing emotions all the time. I just don't like to show them. I spend to much time internally trying to figure out why I'm feeling a certain way.
3	YES!!!! You just described my current predicament. I'm so used to just ignoring my emotions that when they do get enough inertia to make an impact, I don't know what to do with them.\n\nI also really don't like feeling like I'm burdening other people so I still keep them to myself. I think it's a problem.
2	And alcohol is the catylistic enzyme ;)
2	I think I've been emotionally suppressed my entire life by family, friends, school and society.   \nThere's not a time I remember where people didn't tell me to shut up and suck it up, no matter the issue. Sometimes I even agree, I just needed to shut up and man up but a lot of my issues were about actual abuse. I still believe to this day that I have no meaning or purpose and my words and experiences are worthless, I try not to think this way but it's a deeply rooted belief. I've let go of any trauma from the past many years ago but changing your state of mind and learning how to feel anything at all has been a long and difficult process.  \n\n\nSo yeah. I usually don't feel anything at all. But sometimes a song or a movie can punch me in the face so hard I cry a single man tear.  \n
1	same 😔
1	Well damn that’s pretty spot on. Tbh though, it is new for me. I haven’t always had high emotional inertia. Right in the middle of my emotional development, I lost my emotional caretaker. So I didn’t fucking know *how* to handle em. \n\n\nBut these days, “at rest” or “chill” is perfect wording. It takes a lot for my emotions to budge. Thankfully it takes less to budge them in a good way than it does a bad way. It’s easier to make me happy than angry, that is. 
1	Once my emotions are in motion, they stay in motion. Pretty hard to control them due to their high inertial properties. But they're hard to budge if they aren't in motion.
1	Finally my people are learning.....
1	Yep. I rarely get angry or upset, so if I'm visibly upset or angry my family knows it's really really bad. I rarely complain or ask for help (though I should do this more), so when I do people know I've been struggling
5	An ISTP and costumed characters.	For the better part of my life, I’ve despised interacting with people in costume. The Easter bunny, Santa, clowns, I just could never get behind the concept, and always just saw it as sitting in some dudes lap, or in the case of clowns just generally uninterested and slightly creeped out by them. Anybody else out there see right through the facade of costumes?
9	Yes! I always found them scary. \n\nedit: with the exception of those pikachu costume videos, those are kind of funny.
5	I kind of used to have this, and i think I see what you're getting at. It just... there's almost a disgust we have for it, for some aspect of t=it that's hard to put your finger on. Maybe it comes off dishonest, or ingenuine? Maybe like it's a lie, or a sham? Maybe it's the idea that you should be willingly enjoying this act, act fake for it, be all tickled stupid at all the silly antics that, quite frankly, we struggle to find much humor in in the first place. The more I think about it the more I feel like it's disgust for the idea of acting fake or ingenuine, or disgust for the act because it seems humiliating.\n\nMy perception of this changed a lot when I tarted taking acting and drama classes, and participated in my first play. It was nothing as extreme as dressing up like a clown and being obnoxious, but it did teach a lot of teamwork, and how to be vulnerable. Acting and drama really cleared that perception for me because it made me realize that it's not ingenuine or fake or humiliating at all. It's an act of service to others. Now plays and clowns and costumed characters don't bother me or make me want to turn away, because I'm aware of how much happiness they're bringing to others.\n\nI never used to "get" musicals, especially the songs and dance, for the same reason. When I got to sit backstage and watch all my peers rehearse the same hokey Bye Bye Birdie telephone time song until they were making fun of themselves and making everyone laugh, dorking off behind the curtains and having so much fun with it all-- Then it made me stop cringing and start really appreciating it.\n\nNow when I encounter shows or comedys or things that give me second hand embarrassment, I always think about how much fun the people running it are having. I think about how much laughs they're having backstage, and how much they're enjoying this.\n\nEdit: Ironically, I'm a cosplayer now. :D Performing is an incredible joy, and I'm so very glad I made the decision to learn.
3	I have never cared one way or another. I don't think there is a "facade" when to comes to people in costume. I'm not going to point a finger at an Elvis impersonator and claim they aren't the real Elvis. 
2	I hated clowns growing up. I had old pictures of me crying and/or trying to fight them. 
3	I don't think I ever despised them, but I was never interested in them at all. Clowns never scared or creeped me out -- I remember always looking at them and wondering why people were terrified of them (talking about normal, kid's clowns... not in horror movies or anything lol). \n\nI never wanted to do the sitting on Santa's lap thing because I knew it was a random stranger and that was weird as fuck (probably from movies). \n\nI think I could look right through them: every time I'd see someone in a costume and acting in character (Santa comes to mind most), I would always just imagine some middle-aged man acting like an idiot with a fake beard on. \n\nMovie and TV were definitely different, though. I never believed in the grand majority of those characters, but I still accepted them in holiday movies and stuff. \n\nI remember going to see a circus showing with my family when I was like 4 or 5. My dad filmed the majority of it, and at one point my brothers are oo-ing at the actor's performance (all in costume -- don't remember what he was actually doing) and I look at my mom like "wtf is this."
4	Yes, but I like being in them now, and role-playing.
1	Every time I see a mascot I just want to punch them in the face. Disney princesses are okay though 😉
1	I love costumed characters actually!! I follow this twitter where they post tons of pictures of different Japanese mascots. I also used to want to work at Disneyworld when I was younger, to dress up.
1	Party pooper 
22	I'm an ISTP and I enjoy nothing and can't feel emotions or respect art.	I am an ISTP and I have found that it is not possible for me to enjoy art. When I see a picture, all I see is paint. When I read a book, I pride myself for having finished it but do not enjoy any part of it. I recall a sport that I was once in - marching band. A female asked me "are you excited for the concert today?" I answered "no." She asked why and I just explained that I don't feel excited. I don't know what to feel about anything. Whenever an activity is passed, I just acknowledge that it is over and feel nothing. When I play video games, I do it to get the time over with. I don't legitimately enjoy it. I don't enjoy eating sweets either. I just consume them mindlessly. When people tell me to enjoy music, I find that there is none that I truly enjoy. I abhor all music that is "out there," such as rap and rock. I listen solely to classical music yet I don't appreciate it. I showed Chopin's "minute waltz" to my mother and she said, "it's nice." I did not even think of the song. I just used it as background music.\n\nThe reason for this cannot be depression because what I have described above generally has been constant throughout the past couple of years.\n\n Are there any more ISTPs like this? Is this common?
92	" The reason for this cannot be depression because what I have described above generally has been constant throughout the past couple of years. "  \nThat's not an argument, you sound depressed as fuck. And a depression doesn't last 2 weeks
26	No, I don't think this is absolutely an ISTP thing. Yes, sometimes my emotions are just absent and I'm not very outward with my emotions at all. Yes, I can be boring and have few interests at times. Yes, I sometimes just don't feel excitement for things. But I still enjoy my own little things, and I enjoy them wholeheartedly with every ounce of the emotions that do care to show themselves. \n\nI can understand a lacking appreciation for art and modern music—that's pretty common. But it also looks like you're doing things that you know you don't like, yet you continue to do them even when you're obviously miserable. Why? Why did you join band and participate in big concerts when you didn't care for the sport? Why do you play video games when you're only doing so to pass the time? Either you're seriously depressed or, frankly, lazy/unmotivated/negligent to the point where you won't advocate for your happiness and sanity. That's a problem. \n\nInstead of playing video games when you're bored, explore new things. Maybe music and art isn't your thing, but what about surfing, walking through nature, cooking, studying, exercising, chess, archery, rock climbing, card games, volleyball, traveling, etc., etc., etc.? You either don't know what makes you happy yet or you're in too bad of a state to know. Both can be fixed. \n
20	>The reason for this cannot be depression because what I have described above generally has been constant throughout the past couple of years.\n\nThat is exactly *why* it is depression. Clinical depression is a chronic condition. I agree with the other posts. You seem to have a mental illness. That isn't normal, for anyone. Ever
18	I love art and music. You're broken my fellow istp.
7	you may be depressed
7	A literal indicator of depression is anhedonia. The loss/ lack of feeling pleasure in normally pleasurable activities. \n\nPlaying video games not for any kind of enjoyment, sure sounds like that to me. 
5	Please think about going to your doctor and asking about depression. Clinical depression can last for decades. And it isn't just sadness--depression really doesn't *have* to be sadness at all. Apathy (or anhedonia) was by far the most severe symptom I struggled with when I was at my worst. Whether this is indeed depression or something else, please understand that this comes from a place of compassion when I say you are not functioning properly.
5	That sounds like normal anhedonia, not a type issue. 
7	What you're describing is apathy, and I believe to some degree depression. Sounds to me like you need to live your life a little bit, since you don't know what you enjoy, maybe leave your comfort zone for a while, and stop doing stuff for a long time and start again, maybe you'll gain more pleasure from those interactions.\n\nSome people are just more in touch with what gives them pleasure, since it's closer to the surface.\n\nRegarding music, I get absolutely no satisfaction from like +90% of rock or RAP, to me rap is more for listing to the story. Have you looked into Progressive House or Deep House or Trance maybe, or Lo-fi HipHop, or Chillout  / ibiza chillout / DownTempo? I think for people where the music itself is more interesting than maybe vocals, this is where I found my musical world. Everything else pale in comparison.\n
5	ISTP artist/poet here. Listen to heartwarming songs or poignant movies. If you can’t feel, maybe you’ve tricked yourself not to. Or drepressed, yes. 
3	you are depressed.  definitely not a normal ISTP thing.  i love music and art and being good with my hands, i'm good at both.  
3	No. 
2	Like others have said, this is how clinical depression manifests itself. I felt that way for a long time before figuring it out. I even started on Zoloft and had awful side effects, so I decided against medication. That was stupid of me, because mental health issues vary from person to person and you really need to figure out what works for you. I am now taking meds that have slowly started making a difference in the way I feel. Definitely see a doctor. Luckily my dad is in the medical field, and since I'm 30 now and still as apathetic as I was in high school, he was adamant that I may have some kind of imbalance and to look at medicinal options.\n\nScreenshot what you wrote here and take it to a psychiatrist. You don't have anything to lose. Don't wait until you're 30 like me, and don't assume it's a phase or that it's because you're an ISTP. If it is medical, you'll change your life. 
2	A: Same\n\nB: Yeah that's depression my dude
2	Idk if it's part of being an ISTP, but I will get like this for a period of time. Usually just a week or two at the most. I finally pull myself out of it by forcing myself to be social, go to the gym, eat clean, play video games, grab a drink with a friend, clean my apartment, take my dog to  the park, etc.\n\nAs far as enjoying art, I mean I can appreciate the skill and effort of art. Nothing I can recall really "moves" me at an emotional level. 
4	Elliott Roger in the making here folks!
1	You're depressed and I see some contradiction here. If you did not think of the song why id you use it as background music ?
1	You take any drugs? 
1	Nope not at all.\n\nI love a lot of things especially music and some art and games... I mean emotions are difficult and I often don't know how I feel but I feel stuff and I'm sad because of reasons sometimes (most of the time just neutral tho)\n\nI know you don't like to hear this but you should go talk to someone.
1	I actually can't function without music. It is the only thing that makes me feel anything at all though I really dislike modern mainstream music, can't stand radio. I can relate to how you feel about everything else though. Most of my days are just apathy unless I get high. I've found weed to be an amazing help in feeling and dealing with depression. Just gotta find the right kind, most of it makes me feel terrible.
1	Music is Life 
34	"People of high ability incorrectly assume that tasks that are easy for them are also easy for other people."	Note: Regarding "high ability" I'm thinking about our ability to figure out how stuff works or needs repair.  Was reading about the [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) and ended up running across the source of much strife and bad relationships in my world.  I think we tend to be pretty quick at picking up how stuff works and assume others should have the same ability.  I often get frustrated at co-workers and significant others for not grasping things quickly and having to explain things or my actions.  This gets seen as arrogant.  It's going to help to have this in the back of my mind now.  
20	Yeah, I always make an effort to break it down step by step if I see that someone is confused. I don't mind doing it, especially when I'm rewarded with seeing his/her face lighting up from comprehension
12	I think our ability is part of why most of us ISTPs don't have many friends. \nYes, we help people figure out how to do things(or just do it for them, easier that way in high school), but I think that drives most people away. They don't want to be around people who are better than them at things the way we are
8	Oh everyone in my life (except my mom cause she never learns) knows how I hate having to repeat stuff. And if they ask me to teach them something they know they should be paying attention and taking notes at that moment because if I have to repeat it again I will either get really angry or cry because of frustration. ((My Mom is overbearing so being pestered really makes me emotional))\n\nThe thing is, It’s really not hard to google shit nowadays and most of the shit people ask can be easily answered with a simple search or with a few trial and errors.\n\nI’m not frustrated that people don’t get things as fast/easy as I do. I’m frustrated because they rarely take the initiative to figure things out for themselves first. I notice I’m more open to helping people who have been trying. And of course I’ll always be willing to help newbies cause I’m not a dick.\n\nI’m particular with the people I spend time with so if they don’t get why I have that certain character defect then they’re not the type of people I would want to get close with anyway. I’ve never been called arrogant but Ive been called hotheaded.
7	Tell me about it
3	I hate it when people can’t figure things out. 
2	Thanks.
2	I order to be successful you must embrace these abilities and integrate them into your work and life. Most people are terrible at most things and we are necessary to fill that void with all of the small random things. If somebody comes to you for help just say it’s fine I will take care of it and move on with your day.  If they ask for help with the same things over and over I have them show me step by step until they get to the part they don’t understand. This saves you the frustrating part of showing someone the same damn thing over and over. \n\n
7	Anyone currently trying to date?	I’m 29F and I’ve been single for around 10 years, and trying to date (using online whatever) for probably around 4 years. 2 and a half years of which I had no idea what was going on and it all went nowhere. The last year and a half I feel like I kinda understand dating a bit more and it’s gone slightly (only slightly) better.\n\nI do however always seem to have the same problem. I think guys can lose interest pretty quickly because I guess it can look as though I’m only interested in one thing and it’s quite difficult to get to know me. I’m also pretty bad at “getting to know” other people.\n\nI can also be quite critical of guys I’m dating, too. I won’t tell them about what I’m thinking about them because I’m not a complete idiot, but if I notice patterns of behaviour that point towards a trait then I’ll clock it and keep awareness of it, whether it’s favourable or not. I don’t change the way I behave in light of it, consciously at least, but always keep aware of it.\n\nI don’t really understand what people who talk about their feelings are actually talking about either. Yes you have feelings, so do I, marvellous! What’s next?\n\nIs this an ISTP thing? From what I’ve read it could be... There is a part of me though that thinks it’s all a load of hassle that goes nowhere and what’s the point? Except I am pretty interested in one thing. And eventually having a family. \n\nAm I alone here? Is anyone else dating and how is it going?
14	Nah, that seems pretty normal as far istp's go. I'm currently kinda in a "do I even really want to date?" phase that I've heard wuite a few of us go through.
6	I just turned 20 and have realized I don’t really want to date. I’ve thought about why I’d want to date. I was like “Well, it’s nice to have someone to talk to.” Then I remembered I have my friends. Then I was thinking “what about love?” Then I realized I have family and friends who love me. Also dogs. Then I thought it’d be nice to have someone to go out with and do stuff with. But again...friends. I also enjoy my alone time. So I don’t think I want to date. 
5	just turned 21. i tried online dating for a month, and i think im over it now, lol. im in the same boat as you - i want the end goal of being close to someone, but at the same time, the closer i get to potentially dating, the more i want to run. so i dont let others in as easily. i kno that im also very critical of them, although i just take note of it and consider if thats a dealbreaker while continuing to act the same. i also find myself taking much more time to reply to them when i reply almost immediately to my friends. maybe im just not ready to date.. sometimes i think theres something wrong with me. literally all my friends have someone theyre interested in or are dating. i dont understand this feeling. but yea, trying to date or even the topic of dating in itself has been a whirlwind. 
4	I always had better luck hooking up than dating until I started BSing my way through. The first few dates are basically a lie. Don’t hate the player hate the game. 
3	27 yo F. I felt just like this in my early 20s. I paid my dues and dated enough to figure out what I did and didn’t want (between bouts of “i don’t care enough to put in the effort to date), and then I specifically looked for an INTP based on my experiences. Found him, and life is literally a dream. :) I think you just have to suffer through learning about people for a while so you can figure out what you want. Now that I’m in one, I know a successful relationship for most ISTPs looks a little different than most peoples ideal setup. It’s a little more calculated and a little less feely, and God does it feel great to share life with someone you trust and respect. You sound even more extreme in the T region than I am, which is hard to do, lol. So I definitely recommend avoiding FJ types.. they’ll be the first ones to get after you because you’re an enigma and then because you need “saving” from your own heartlessness (eye roll). But it’s almost sure not to work for you long term, save yourself some time <3 they will end up stage 5 clinging and you will end up impatient with all their feelings and super uninterested. I went through like 5 identical situations with feelers before i realized what i was doing. lol. slower learner over here. 
2	I didn't have any interest in dating until I met the right person. Before it was all a huge hassle and really distressing to date because I was always used/ignored by the guys I liked and it was hard to connect with people emotionally. But recently I started dating a friend I'd known for a while and it's been really amazing. You just have to meet new people, and be open to trying new things. It may suck for a while but you perhaps just haven't found the right person.
1	I've also had quite a 'do I even want to date?' phase. Kept going out of interest in one thing and just to have some fun I guess. I enjoy how different each person can be to date so that keeps it interesting. I think I'm mostly trying to figure out what I really want in a partner and I have to see it to know it.\n\nWhen it comes to talking about feelings I mostly let other people talk about theirs, ask simple questions, dig in a little bit, analyze it and bring some perspective, maybe have some fun by throwing hypothetical situations at them to see how they feel about those, watch and learn about them and how they talk about it. \nSince we're usually laid back, people can get comfortable with us and start opening up, from there so many sidetracks can emerge about beliefs, experiences, outlook on life etc. Basically a proper look into their inner workings, just to describe it in an ISTP fashion.
5	Anyone else ride a motorcycle?	All the sites list motorcycles as a common hobby. Who else here rides? 
5	I used to.  It was a lot of fun, but hitting a deer at highway speed and breaking a bunch of bones kinda sucked the fun out of it.
3	I keep telling myself that I want to get a motorcycle, but I've crashed on a motor scooter going like 40 clicks and that shit hurt 
3	Not currently, though it's definitely on the list.
3	Guilty, been riding 14 years.  It weirded me out a bit when I was first MBTI typed at work and descriptions included thrill seeking such as motorcycles.\n\nI started riding motorbikes after years of cycling up hills/mountains just so I could ride back down as fast as I could.  It eventually dawned on me that I could get that downhill thrill everywhere if I had an engine onboard.
3	I grew up riding ATVs and dirtbikes and always loved it. Definitely had my share of "close calls" lol. \n\nI'd love to get a motorcycle but my wife is adamantly opposed to it and always has been (been together about 10 years). Part of me resents the fact that her parents raised her to be so extremely risk adverse but the other part of me knows that I have always pushed my limits when it comes to taking physical risks. Plus I've seen too many horror stories where the rider isn't at fault and I couldn't live with the  "I told you so"s if something were to happen. \n\n
2	I have my license, but have never owned one.\n\nMy wife says I can't get one unless I have a fat life insurance policy. Can't say I blame her. 
2	I wouldn't go through all of the hassle myself of getting licensed and purchasing/maintaining a motorcycle because it just isn't practical here.  (Suburbs, I don't trust other drivers to not kill me.)\n\nMy SO has one though and I used to enjoy riding through the woods near our house together before we moved away from there.
2	Nah I know myself too well and it would be hard for me to not test the limits of the machine. 
2	Yup. Crashed on a 150cc scooter and i still wanna get back on,though now ive had the fear of god put in me, for the better. I'm more into it for the off-traffic riding than anything, not gonna lie. Motorcycles are amazing, but more so on less populated/public roads. 
2	I started about three years ago. It was always something I wanted since I was little.\n\nI think it's mainly the freedom and the raw power at your hands that thrills me. \n\nBeing outside of a shell and going 75+ mph is a totally different experience, that I recommend that everyone tries at least once.
2	I do! Got my first bike, (Old POS broken 83 virago 920) 2 years ago, fixed it up, cleaned it, and have had a great time with it. Now that I've gotten a newer bike, I'm working on converting the virago to electric.
1	I ride. But not extremely. And always one. However, dont like motorcyclists society.
1	I grew up riding dirt bikes, does that count? I still have a couple of them but haven't gone riding in years.
1	I had one for a number of years. I’ve had a few actually. Was a lot of fun and would like to get another one, but not where I currently live as they are easy to steal. I had a 636 ninja and I’m looking at either getting a dirt bike and converting it to supermoto or straight up buying a supermoto. Don’t know yet
1	im buying myself one for my 30th bday in August! :)
30	Does anyone else have repeated ups and downs in life?	Like, for me, I'll have a day when I'm super social, happy, healthy and excited and out of the loop and then a few days later, I'll be back into the loop, bored with no goals. And this would keep repeating and repeating. Is this WTF years? How do I stay in those good days?
24	... Who doesn't though?\n\n*Edit:* What [u/syberphunk](https://www.reddit.com/user/syberphunk) said. If it's distressing you, get help.
8	Long term goals are as much a senseless distraction as short term pleasures.  \n\nLife is meaningless and some days we hide it better than others. /shrug\n
4	As Frank Sinatra once said. 🎶 That's life!
3	> I'll have a day when I'm super social, happy, healthy and excited and out of the loop and then a few days later, I'll be back into the loop, bored with no goals.\n\nFor all some people can say this is normal, and another person decided to blame your age, I'll go out on a limb and suggest that it depends on how excessive these ups and downs are for you that it may be a symptom of something to look into and talk with someone about. It's an extreme example, however what you say is similar to manic/mania episodes associated with mental health conditions - periods of highs and lows of feeling really productive and awesome and everything can be done, and then lows where nothing's quite working out.\n\nIt may not be that at all and you're experiencing typical day to day of life, though it can be good to be aware of these patterns and seek help if needed.
6	That’s just life, I’m afraid. Ride those waves, appreciate the troughs because they make the good parts really stand out. 
2	My brain kept stopping mid title wondering what a repeated uninterruptible power supply was. It took me about 5 times to finish reading the title.  \n\nThat was a definite down in my life.  
2	[Made your bed every day.](https://www.google.com/search?q=make+your+bed+everyday+speech&oq=make+your+bed+everyday+sp&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l3.5322j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#kpvalbx=1)
1	Well I know I just told my therapist my moods have been exactly like you described and she said that its not ideal and then brought up the possibility of going on meds if I decide too..its frustrating you WANT to get over the hump and you do for awhile but then you wake up one day and you shrink back into your miserable life and it's like that..I dont think its ideal but you're not alone. I told her I am going to give it some time..i think i need to do better with some areas like food and exercise so maybe if I clean those up I can avoid medication...good luck op
1	That is life.\n\nI do find when I have short or medium term goals and I can stay focused on those goals that life is less rollercoaster-y.
0	I looked at your other posts and it says your around 17. So yeah, its 100% puberty mood swings from your hormones acting up. Everyone has ups and downs, give it a few years and they shouldn't be as extreme.
3	What do you think about ENFPs??	
9	I have a hard time with people who have a high Fi. ENFP’s are not an exception to this. I have one good ENFP friend. But the other ENFP’s I know are highly opinionated SJW tumblr girls who are very all over the place. You either like them or you don’t at all. But maybe they were unhealthy ENFP’s? 
8	I’m an ENFP married to an ISTP. We balance each other out well. I think he likes me.  :) 
6	I'm married to an ENFP (10 years together) and while I wouldn't have it any other way...\n\nShe forces me to do things outside my comfort zone and socialize, which is great most of the time but has the potential to put me in situations that I really don't like. \n\nShe is very bubbly and outgoing and can make friends with anyone. Whereas I tend to be more reserved. \n\nThe hardest part for me is the level of emotion that she has. She can be happy and fun one second and then hear that our neighbors sisters friend's dog died and start crying. She genuinely cares for and about everyone and I simply don't have the fucks to give sometimes.
3	The two that I know I really enjoy. They're fascinating, amusing, and clever.\n\n I'm not close to them so I have no idea how well we'd get along beyond being acquaintances. I'm definitely interested in getting to know them better, but am also lazy/have limited energy and would have to go out of my way to do that.\n\nThey do have strong personalities tho, and I can see it not being everyone's cup of tea. You can't ignore their presence so I feel people have stronger reactions to them than some other types.
5	My ex's sister is an ENFP. She's pretty cool and really nice. Whenever we were all hanging out together with some of their other friends, she'd always talk to me and include me in activities if she notices that I'm standing off to the side by myself staring at the wall/horizon (my mind drifts off when women do their girl talk). She's a really smart engineer too, so she rarely said anything trivial or irrelevant. In all honesty, I think I'd like to date an ENFP because they're so much more lively and positive compared to me.
4	I’m basing this off three folks I know. I find the Fi extremely off putting, but they are overall enchanting. As long as I can learn to not take it personally when they suddenly lose interest in interacting with me, time with them is immensely joyful. 
3	Very fun to be around
3	I've met some complete and utter assholes of this type, and then some absolute sweethearts and genuinely amazing people. and There's like no inbetween.
2	In my experience they're a lot of fun to be around, I've met two in the past year and both of them have really contagious attitudes. \n\nThey tend to bring me out of my shell a bit which is also nice. 
1	The only Fi-type I like is I/ENTJ. I don’t think I can manage Fi-dom/aux types. ENFPs are good when they’re at arms’ length. 
1	My bestie is ENFP, I spend my fun time, laugh time, and motivation time only with her. 
6	What do you normally get on career profiler tests? (Holland Codes)	_Look up "career interest profiler quiz" if you don't know what I'm referring to, or, better, explore your personality via [this](https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip) version of the test_\n\nPhycologist John L. Holland developed a personality quiz (generally used for career profiling) that includes 6 personality categories: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. \n\nDescriptions of each personality taken from [this](http://sourcesofinsight.com/6-personality-and-work-environment-types/) website:\n\n1. Realistic: (Do’er) – Prefers physical activities that require skill, strength, and coordination. Traits include genuine, stable, conforming, and practical.  Example professions include architect, farmer, and engineer.\n\n2. Investigative (Thinker) – Prefers working with theory and information, thinking, organizing, and understanding. Traits include: analytical, curious, and independent.  Example professions include lawyer, mathematician, and professor.\n\n3. Artistic (Creator) – Prefers creative, original, and unsystematic activities that allow creative expression. Traits include: imaginative, disorderly, idealistic, emotional, and impractical.  Example professions include: artist, musician, and writer.\n\n4. Social (Helper) – Prefers activities that involve helping, healing, or developing others.  Traits include cooperative, friendly, sociable, and understanding.  Example professions include counselor, doctor, and teacher.\n\n5.

Not very fond of rules or set procedures either.  \nThe high Realistic & Investigate score seems pretty constant in all all ISTPs in the comments. Also it seems that everyone got mid to low Social too.

22	Apparently, we attract mentally ill people. Why is that?	Judging from my comment [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/8ul5lh/comment/e1g58vx?st=JIZJC3OA&sh=09a2a883) we ISTPs have a knack for attracting emotionally damaged people. \n\nPersonally, I have never been close to a relationship (unless you want to count one story, which I tell at the end of a YouTube video you can check out in my post history) but I’ve had quite a few people attracted to me, a lot of them...not very healthy in the head. I always stand my ground and it always turns into a train wreck, one of them recording themselves crying and sending it to me via text. That one was...ouch.\n\nI’m usually, despite the stereotype, a very nice and welcoming person, and in particular I’m very tolerant and accepting, even if others view someone as weird or bad company. I’m also kind of reserved and keep to my own a lot of the time. Combined, I think people perceive me being a pushover who doesn’t stand up for themselves, and I think mentally ill people are attracted to me as they would think I’d buckle to their will, which they then figure out my stubborn ass would do anything but that.\n\nSo, to ask some questions:\n\n1. As an ISTP, does this apply to you?\n\n2. If yes to 1, why do you think this is?\n\n3. If yes to 1, what is your gender/orientation? Do you think that might have anything to do with it?\n\n4.If you are not an ISTP, do you experience this with ISTPs you know?\n\n5. If not ISTP, could you theorize on why this could be?
30	ISTP male. I don't know if gender affects anything, but the type of people I have attracted have nearly always been people who are having a rough time with their mental health. \n\nI'm thinking that maybe it's because I have a tendency (and other ISTPs) to want to fix things. I'll try to help them how I can, and I won't give up on them just because they're a bit more broken than usual
25	Everyone else is mentally ill. It ain’t just the people we date. The whole non-istp world is crazy, or power hungry.
24	ISTP female here. Yes. I attract romantics especially those who were ruined either by their background (childhood, upbringing, family relations, anxieties) or previous relationships. \n\nI think it’s because of my dominant Ti. I like to believe I can understand why anything exists and how it works. I try to trace and know the core of the people I care about (and have decided to love). I can’t stop it, being so self-sacrificial is not even funny. \n\nYes, gender expectations also play a role. My INFP ex sort of was looking for a very nurturing partner. I couldn’t be a mom. 
17	I’m not an ISTP. I’m an ISFJ. I theorize that this is because of the cool stability that ISTPs bring. \n\nI struggle with depression and anxiety every day. My boyfriend is an ISTP. I’ve always said that if I am a waterfall, he is the rock that stabilizes me. I crave being around him, not just because I love him and he means a lot to me, but because he makes my mind slow down. I can think clearly, yet be myself around him. 
15	ISTP male here who's had a fair share of less than mentally healthy partners, ranging from quirky to full blown mayhem. \n\nWe tend to be very tolerant, accepting and non judgemental towards other people. Something mentally ill people don't experience much. Lots of people (and society in general) instantly label them as faulty as soon as they know and stop looking at the person behind the label, whether it's diagnosed or just plain weird behaviour. \n\nLike /u/Kidault said we usually like a bit weirdness, something a little different and might be attracted to that in a partner, I know I am. \n\nCombine this with the feeling of making a practical difference in your partners life by creating stability and thus helping them reach their true potential (once you can see all the good they have behind these quirks and quirks). \n\nThat leaves two ways it can go with no middleground. Either a very synergistic and unique relationship or a trainwreck even an ISTP can't fix. So far the cards seem to favor the latter...
11	We like weird things, we like to know why things work, we are very tolerant of a lot of behaviors, we're intelligent with other peoples' problems. \n\nI'm learning to spend more time applying those traits to myself. \n\n
8	ISTP male, it applies to me. I think, based on my own experiences,  this is because us ISTPs are half a walking vial of psych drugs and half personal counselor with a dash of a calming agent in there somewhere. 
6	I didn't know, but if it's true it sure as hell explains a lot.
7	I’m an ISTP with terrible mental health and said people are still attracted to me.
6	ISTP female.This is true looking back to my entire life for both friends and romatically. According to my INTJ sister its because I am too passive and nice to people. I wouldn't say I'm nice though just not intentionally rude to them.\n\nI think it's because I'm quiet and a bit of a loner. People must see themselves in this or something and think I will understand all their problems. 
3	4. Yes and no.  \n\n5. Yes in the sense that every istp I know will suffer through the worst conversations just to be polite, and give people the benefit of the doubt, but no because they tend to dump those people quickly before...and occasionally after the fact.  You are a bit spot on with the whole mentally ill people looking for pushovers to prey upon.  That's how abusive relationships come about.
3	ISTP male here who ended up dating someone with a border line personality disorder (Didn't realize this until after we were broken up). I think for me at least, she was able to give me excitement (even if it was because she was insane) and intense emotions that I never really felt before. 
3	Ahah, u/skepticallus’s comment hit pretty close to home for me. It feels like there’s absolutely an element of people with a history of mental illness and/or abuse tend to be initially attracted to me because they’re not accustomed to that kind of practicality and emotional stability, and people with good coping mechanisms can recognize a healthy relationship they can benefit a lot from. \n\nA lot of my friends have anxiety and depression, and they know i’ll seek them out to do fun activities if I know they’re feeling down. ISTPs also like to just ‘go do it’ so if the partner has a goal in mind, we’re pretty good about doing what we can to help them achieve it. Given good communication and a lot of trust, I’d be willing to forgive, accept, and roll with just about anything. \n\nOn the other hand, a lot of people need more emotional sensitivity than I’m equipped to provide, which IME is when the the trainwreck happens. Someone who doesn’t know how to set boundaries and becomes codependent is likely to be disappointed, and they’ll feel manipulated and taken advantage of even if they don’t necessarily contribute anything to the relationship. I’m a bi woman, so I think there’s more of an expectation to be emotionally available than I’m capable of providing.  
3	ENFP here - married to an ISTP. I think he needs a little crazy in his life, and I need him to keep me in check. We balance each other out. 
3	ISTPs, thanx to our inferior Fe, have a pleasant and welcoming demeanour. But because of auxiliary Ti, we are very stable people and our emotions don’t swing all over the place. We’re also practical and independent. Because of this, we will naturally attract unstable people or people who are going through some shit. This is because, subconsciously, unstable people will look for stable people because they think we can “fix them” or just make their lives easier. They need people who are like the istp (or intp, entp, etc.) in their lives. So they become attracted to us. We’re attracted to qualities we wish we had in ourselves and in what we value. So it makes sense. 
2	I watched [this on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDbIu9g8h0) yesterday evening and it covers this really well.
2	Because our Ti dominant (which is apparently not an objective function don't ask me why) can rationalize their behavior. I guess.
2	I upvoted your comment in the other thread.  I have dated some crazies, two very notable men come to mind.  I think I put up with way more than I ever should have.  I am a woman that mainly dates men.
2	Cause I'm laid back & chill. & I understand the human condition. It is what it is. Live & let live. C'est la vie ~
3	It's not that we, as in ISTP, attract mentally ill, it's that the replies to the post are composed of people who strongly related to OP and felt the need to share. This will result in a data skewing toward greater propensity of attracting mentally ill but is not necessarily a reflection of the reality. \n\nTruth is that all those experiences are thoroughly anectodal and you cannot generalize with the replies you got as it's mostly anectdotal. \n\nTo answer your questions: \n\n1. I had one bad experience with a professor who harassed me, whether he was mentally ill, or whether that count as a relationship is a topic of debate. but I don't believe it was a result of my ISTP nature, as I have more relationships (even casual) with healthy and sane individuals. One apple doesn't ruin the whole bucket even if the experience was, itself, traumatizing. \n\n2. I was young, inexperienced, and he was older than I was, more mature and had the bigger end of the stick for the powerplay. \n\n3. I'm female, straight. I don't think it has anything to do with it. 
1	1. Yes.\n2. It probably happens because I am also mentally ill.\n3. My gender is female and I am bisexual. Because I am female, and because I am not straight, and most of my friends are also not straight, I think it does contribute to this. I don't know if this is for sure so don't quote me but I think LGBTQ/queer folks tend to have more problems with mental illness? Like, most if not all of my friends have depression.
1	I have had one short thing with a girl who was quite bipolar that lasted maybe a month, and that I wouldn't really call a relationship. I'm a straight guy also. 
1	can you be consistent with your post, man?\n\n"emotionally damaged" and "Mentally Ill" are NOT the same thing. \n\nI thought you were making a post about how everything from the autistic to those suffering from retardation wouldn't stop trying to get into your pants
1	1 yes, I am flypaper for the damaged/strange\n\n2 I try not to think about it\n\n3 straight man
1	ISTP and sadism	How sadistic are you all? No I am not talking about kinks, just in general. 
13	Not at all... once you get past my thick outer shell, I’m a pretty loving person who doesn’t like to cause harm to anyone, including myself. \n\n\n\nI suppose my adrenaline junkie nature could be misinterpreted as sadism, considering I end up injuring myself. 
8	Only the kinky kind and only if the other person is really, really into it. \n\nIn general, I’m the opposite. 
6	[deleted]
3	Not at all.
3	My friend saw a tsundere video and said that was completely me
1	I stick my nose into business that is not mine if I think someone is being victimized. 
1	I'm very nice to people in general. My friends on the other hand...\nI enjoy annoying them in small ways. The same way I do small things to make them happy I do small things to make them suffer a little annoyance.  I consider that a little sadistic. 
1	I can imagine myself being sadistic if I am watching somebody I hate being hurt.
1	Not at all. I’m more of a masochist.
5	Do most ISTPs have WTF years?	I am trying to understand the history of someone I care about.  I am wondering if this person was going through their WTF years in their 20s, or were just a victim of the great recession.\n\nAbout what fraction of ISTPs generally have WTF years after college or so?
14	I think I'm going through them now? Not too sure. Kinda just meandering through life without a purpose. Have some hobbies that make me a bit of money and happiness but can't foresee myself going all in on one and trying to make a career out of it. One thing I've noticed is that my eyes don't really focus on anything when I'm walking or sitting on the train. They just kinda stay open and observe everything while absorbing nothing.
3	I've been trying to understand this by reading the various wiki pages and I'm pretty sure I just didn't. It doesn't sound like me. I pretty much hated everybody when I was a teenager, but I was still a hard worker and not wandering aimlessly. My life has changed (I'm almost 40 now) but nothing that I would definitely call "WTF years" as opposed to not. Just normal teenage pissiness?
3	WTF years start at like 15 and last until were about to kick up some daisies lol. \nYeah he was probably in his WTF years at that time and a few years before and after, most of us are
2	I certainly think it's a little of column A and a little of column B. I am 22 and I certainly had some emotional funk when I was in high school/college when I was figuring out who I was as a person. I was on auto-pilot allowing things to just happen. I still went to college and finished 2 degrees in 5 years because it was a goal I made for myself. I did it because my family would have been disappointed and I knew I would be mad at myself later. I didn't come into my own and out of this WTF mental space until my last 2 years of college. I was in a master's program and met more people that I was compatible with but very different from. It helped me grow and learn more about how I process my emotions and the world around me and how to value other ways of processing things. \n\nI didn't have the economic recession to deal with, so I was able to truck through a lot of that WTF time and just be an emotional trainwreck. Had finances been really really hard, I would have likely not made it through college and then I think I would have had more traditional WTF years. 
2	I think WTF years are just some stupid shit that people make up and it doesn't exist. It's like people thinking they have to act or feel a certain way because they're this personality.
1	Yeah it was basically my 20s. 
1	I think I developed it during late elementary/middle school, and I believe I am just now getting out of them a few months ago. Reportedly, most are suspected to have them their teens through the 20's, and then they mellow out. I honestly don't believe they describe me, except for the tail-end of actually finding friends and being more motivated to be social.
1	we aren't exactly running polls and surverys here man. the period is different for everyone and generally lasts from teens to your 30's, depending on the individual. 
1	I think I'm having mine now. I'm 35 female and ended a long term relationship about a little over a year ago. I go to work and pay the bills about other than that I'm just not... Nothing excited me, dating seems exhausting and I just don't want to do anything with others. 
1	[deleted]
9	Which type do you attract the most romantically?	In my case it seems to be ENFJs.\n\nBonus points if anyone can tell me more about this pairing as I've never actually taken the plunge and dated one.
34	Mentally ill.\n\nIf they are not mentally ill, I think I attract XNFPs and Fe-doms. I had a crush on a ENFP throughout middle/high school that turned out to be mutual but we were both chicken to act on it until the end. In college I know an ESFJ that I think showed signs of attraction but I couldn't tell for sure, but it was definitely something.
14	Unhealthy INFPs. Ugh. 
10	i attract a lot of ENFPs and Fe-doms but i can't handle their emotions well so it never really works. fun people to be around, but its hard for me to work with that long term because i'm not good at really "being there" for people lol 
10	INFP.\n\nSimilar end-game, completely dissimilar methodology. Both types want to be left alone to their ways and to be accepted for who they are, but the INFP tends to be very codependent where the ISTP (me) tends to enjoy freedom.  \n\n\nIn the end, when the "honeymoon" period wears off, it seems like the INFP's excitement about the situation wears off and the direct words of the ISTP seem to pierce their once thicker skin. ISTP gets frustrated with feeling emotionally controlled and is unable to express him/herself due to the other party constantly getting offended when they try to express their perspective. 
7	No one
6	Not sure if I'm attracted to a specific MBTI type, but I'm certainly attracted to women who are funny, compassionate, bubbly (to balance my down-to-earth attitude), intelligent or open-minded, athletic, hard-working, and self-reliant.
6	My favorite personality type in a relationship was ENFP.
4	I’ve had enfj guys attracted to me, but I do attract ENTPs a lot. Which is fine. Sometimes they need to chill out though. 
4	Couldn't really say, but I married an ISFP, so I guess ISFP
3	INFP. my boyfriend is an INFP :)
2	Nt's that are as enamored and possessive of me as they are jealous. \n\nor\n\nA metric fuck ton of INFP (and sometimes ENFP) for reasons I don't really understand. They are, however, the kindest crushes I've had even though I don't think.. many of them make me feel as good as understood as others can. 
2	Socionics says ENFJ is best for us since we use the same functions but in the opposite order. So similar enough to understand each other but different enough for personal growth.
1	In the past, a lot of ESFJs, ISFJs and some ENFJs. Girlfriend is an ESFJ. 
1	i see a trend that yall like unstable women. why is that?
1	I attract xxFPs mostly.
12	All the Types/Fe thing?	Does anyone else tend to subconsciously absorb other people's personality's (or aspects of it)? Examples include: picking up foreign accents in a matter of seconds, learning bits of a new language(also in seconds), mimicking bodily mannerisms (voice tone, winking, facial expressions, etc.), and taking on other people's desires.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I can successfully manipulate people (although I rarely do this). It's kind of like every personality type has become some sort of tool that I change into to best affect the situation. There are extremely rare cases in which I suddenly want to be everyone's best friend, someone to rely on, become very perceptive of other people's emotions, problems, and just want to go out of my way to help as many people as possible. I sometimes don't realize I'm acting differently until someone points it out to me or if I'm alone. However, because ISTPs have Fe inferior and Ti dominant, this tends not to last very long or happen too often.\n\nWhat are you guy's thoughts on this? Can you relate?\n\nEdit: I'll also sometimes get anxiety if everyone's not included in something
8	Personality mirroring.  You mimic the other person's mannerisms to make them subconciously like you.
3	I've had people that stopped being friends with me bc I stole their "catch phrase." That's when I realized it was a problem and I'm more mindful of this tendency now.
2	For me this is something that's always a little there but usually so relatively minor that other stuff takes priority, but I do occasionally go all out like you're talking about. I know an ENTP and an ENFJ that do this way more consistently though, so maybe it is an Fe thing?
1	It's a kind of rapport.  Yes.
1	Sort of but not really. If someone is taking to me and they’re calm, I’ll be really calm. If they’re being polite but not warm, I’ll do the same. But that’s it. 
1	I live in an English speaking country and English is my second language but I picked up the accent quickly and when I talk to someone with a distinct accent I'll almost always subconsciously mimick them. I notice it more and more nowadays and I just make a joke about it. 
1	This is all me, especially the edit.
1	I can totally relate to this. Also to the inclusion thing. I constantly absorb people's personalities. When I spent more time with my best friend (before I moved away to college) I literally had adopted the exact tone and inflection of her voice and her sense of humor. I mirror peoples bodily mannerisms especially when I'm anxious. In my past relationships I have taken on my partner's desires almost to the point it was unhealthy. My music taste has always been influenced by the person I liked at the time. It's kind of sad, but at the same time, people who are cool and care about me understand that I do it because I like them a lot :) and I think that it helps me get closer to people. Also some people think it's cute. I don't know if it's a problem or if it's just a sometimes strange (but not bad) way of coping with social anxiety? In my case, at least
1	I agree with this. I’m a nurse and need to gain rapport quickly. A lot of times my coworkers catch me mimicking patients accents and I don’t even know I’m doing it. If someone speaks English as a second language I tend to speak in very similar broken English as them. Sometimes I notice what I’m doing but it’s mostly subconscious. Never thought of it as an ISTP thing
7	Anyone do something special for their 21st birthday?	Edit: anyone do something not related to alcohol?
16	I was in boot camp. \n\nI kept my mouth shut. 
7	At midnight, when I turned 21, I went and bought a beer and I wasn't even carded smh. 
4	In Canada it’s 19. Yes I did go out drinking to a bar. It was a more chill one with some friends.\n\nBut if you have a birthday in the summer, you can go to the beach, camping, or a nice hike. 
3	I would assume most people do. I went to Vegas with my mom
3	I got a bunch of friends in the basement and we played beer pong... Like we always did. \n\nI think I ended up going to a brewery too. I was already into fancy beer.
3	I was in the Army, in the field, and realized I missed my b-day by 3 days.
3	I took a midterm and then read Haruki Murakami’s birthday short story. My 21st was very much like the girl’s birthday in the short story.
3	I forgot I turned 21; I also forget who reminded me haha
2	I made seafood paella and drank the remaining white wine.
2	Mine was yesterday.  Had dinner and a beer with a good friend of mine.  Nothing crazy.
2	I went to the dentist.
2	Army basic training, 1983, in Alabama, in the field living in a tent.
1	Got hammered with my ESTP father and bar-hopped all over town. 
1	I worked. I don't really care about my birthday. 
1	Went out for pizza with friends, bought booze, and did a drinking game based on a certain vampire-related film franchise from the late 2000s.\n
-2	I'm 15... but I want to do that fancy whine and art shit that rich white moms do. 
15	What activities/hobbies do you have that don’t require spending (a lot of) money?	I finally have a job. A marketing data analyst. I am so happy. I waited for this opportunity for three years. \n\nWorkload can get very overwhelming. I have been pressed in the last three weeks, but I think it’s normal or part of the adjustment period. \n\nI work six hours a day (2 pm to 8 pm). With this schedule, I have so much spare time. These days I’m mostly on my computer and it’s draining me at the end of the day. It feels like I’m missing out on something important outside my comfort zone. \n\nMoney is limiting me that I know. I live in an expensive city so I have a need to be wise about my expenses. \n\nI live alone, but have friends to meet when I can, \n\nI guess I am looking for ideas. Or maybe a perspective on (1) how you spend your time on (2) what you consider a quality activity/hobby would definitely help. \n\n\n
12	Running, chess, programming 
11	Hiking and camping: there is some initial cost to both (good boots, a tent, etc) but once you have all of your equipment it is pretty cheap.  Probably the most enjoyment for least amount of money out of all of the stuff I'm into.\n\nFor now, depending on your terrain, you may be able to get away with hiking in tennis shoes you already have to see if it interests you.
7	Journaling, walking, working out, puzzles, going for walks, utilizing memberships, making playlists, meal prep, farmers markets, walking tours of the city, looking at stars, volunteering, picnics, board games, reading outside, libraries. I strongly recommend limiting screen time. It can feel intense, but looking away from it and doing things with your hands, interacting, being present helps you feel more grounded and satisfied . 
5	Hiking. Get a good pair of shoes ($100-150), a decent backpack w/hydration bladder (or a good size canteen), and go walk/run some trails in the state parks.\n\nRenting kayaks, whole lot cheaper initially, or if you don't go too often.\n\nDisc golf. $50 and your set. Just don't get the camouflage discs.\n\n
3	Drawing. Writing. You can do wonders with a pen and a paper!
3	I used to get bored enough to read through these threads on reddit, but I would usually get all of these good ideas then do something completely different. I think it's because we really just follow our interests instead of doing what we're supposed to do.
7	My husband is an ISTP, and I’m a cheap ENFP. We tend to share a lot of activities that are exciting but inexpensive. His favorite inexpensive activities are:\n\nPlaying soccer (he is a keeper)\n\nPlaying cards (Pinochle, in particular)\n\nSolving crossword puzzles\n\nSolving logic problems\n\nBrowsing reddit\n\nFixing or improvising things around the house\n\nPlaying/winning Scrabble\n\nESCAPE ROOMS (his #1 interest)\n\nKayaking\n\nXBox (usually offline, of course; Skyrim and Fallout are his go-to games)\n\nAlmost everything is done alone/between us and involves problem solving. Not shocking for an ISTP.
2	Geocaching! It's like a scavenger hunt and since you live in a city there should be a fair number of caches to find. It's really fun and you can find some really interesting landmarks and places from it.\n\nOtherwise walking/hiking is always fun.
1	I like video games myself, but I'm very interested at either getting into a martial art or bouldering (indoor rock climbing). \n\nThe former has a high price for the uniforms that puts me off. 
1	100% Bowling.  Or really any sport you can work on yourself, and easily see the improvement and the bettering of your skill.
1	Freediving. All you need is a mask and snorkel. Even for the full gear I.e. Fins, socks, gloves, wetsuit, float, dive flag and float line total is gonna be under 1k and it'll last you years.\n\nPlus if you get a speargun you can shoot fish and it pays for itself through fresh seafood dinners!
1	drawing, art, gardening, cooking, reading, knitting, playing with slime
1	Lot's of really good suggestions here! I'm curious as to what you will consider and start doing. Please update and let us know! :)
1	I a few days late but I’ll give it a go. If you don’t mind me asking, where are you from... just like a general area or region will be fine.
10	ISTP as an rpg class	So I searched a lot in the internet and often times istp presented ranger, assassin or sometimes berserker. What do you think which class would an istp suits the best? ofc I know every mbti can be every class but if you would give it just one what would it be and why?
9	Engineer
9	Assassin when calm, berserker when enraged.
6	Stealthy. But when there’s an option to play stealth over guns blazing I don’t know why I always go guns blazing. Referring to Deus Ex or like Dishonored.
5	I see assassins all over here. So that's why assassin is my favorite class in every rpg and mmo
3	I'm more of a reluctant berserker. I want to be left alone, and I prefer to resolve my problems with diplomacy or mediocre stealth. However, in an unavoidable fight, I'll transition from a standard sword/shield (or a firearm) at the beginging of the the conflict to an enraged sword/axe dual wield (or firearm and melee).
5	I'd rather pick something like a magical rouge or thief rather than assassin. I'd prefer to get to my objective, complete it, and get out. Assassin indicates killing everyone and then going after the objective, with focus on combat skills. I would focus on things which combine stealth skills with magic, such as using spells for invisibility and unlocking than the physical embodiment of stealth and lockpicking. Probably have a focus on offensive buffs rather than pure destruction magic for sake of criticals.
3	I've always loved to play assassin classes (stealthy). I think my perfect class would be a stealthy assassin who can build things like traps. So an assassin engineer
2	really interesting so far :) and is there one who says nah i like playing mage here?
2	I'm very much the - stealthy, get in, get out without anyone ever knowing - kind of player. But I have a serious fascination with the dual wielding berserker and my personality traits mostly fit in with Rangers. If I can avoid combat in a game and still level up and get my objective I usually will as long as it requires a lot of skill. So I'm gonna say Assassin or Ranger. 
2	[**literally this class**](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Shadow)
4	Something related to thieves. Like assassins, anything stealthy.
3	Any history class.
2	Assassin fits best. Ranger is ISFP and berserker is ESTP.
1	According to http://www.playbuzz.com/coltondunn10/which-rpg-class-are-you#eightieth , I'm a ranger. \n\nEdit because I didn't answer your question...:\n\nI know nothing about those rpg games. Nothing. But according to the description I got at the end of that quiz, they're mostly stealthy/silent, self-certain and self-sufficient, and are generally pretty good at what they choose to do. 
1	Weird I see that someone has posted here in my inbox but cant see the text oO
1	If I were a D&D themed character, I'd be [Roy](http://oots.wikia.com/wiki/Roy_Greenhilt)
1	Berserker, yes!!
-1	[deleted]
10	How are you all around kids?	Do you like them? Dislike them? Want them to die? 
21	Kids are cool but brats suck. For some reason kids always love me, I think it's because I'll play their toys with them.
14	I love kids.  I think children (I'm thinking 6-10 years old) are similar to how adult ISTPs think.  \n\n* Play with anything that interests them\n* Little desire to understand unspoken communication/hidden meanings\n* Speak out of raw observation\n* When done, you know they're done.  They just stop and are finished\n\nI'll usually try to go out of my way to interact with kids too.  When I was a kid, I had 2-3 guys that I infrequently saw around town that always gave me attention and treated me like a mini adult instead of a kid who is too young to handle anything.
14	I hate 90% of kids those 10% are fucking awesome but the rest are annoying and useless. 
6	Depends on the kid. If I can relate to them and see part of me in them I like them but may not talk to them, if they ask a lot of question or talk a lot, but not in a stupid, annoying manner, I talk to them and answer their question. If they're loud, obnoxious, annoying, and honestly just need to die in a hole I try to ignore them and forget their existence. 
5	I try not to be around them if possible.
3	Kids are ok. I don't want any, but have always enjoyed spending time with my nephews and nieces.\n\nI purposefully mislead them with silly antics. For example, the other day I was watching my niece swim, and we were playing a guessing game about animals. I was sitting on the porch swing while talking, and at some point I made sure my face was behind the post and just yelled "Hey niece, where did you go?" She kept saying she was right there! As she moved around the pool, I constantly kept changing my head position to always have the post in between us, and would accuse of her of messing with me.\n\nShe eventually got out of the pool and walked over to me, to which I exclaimed "Oh there you are! You can't hide like that from me!" She loved it, we had a lot of fun. \n\nWhen my nephews were younger, our favorite game was "body slam". I would just chase them around the house, and when I caught them I would throw them over my shoulder, walk to a couch and toss them on it. Then they would scramble up and start running while giggling, and the chase would start anew.\n\nI always try to pick up small kids in the air. I always remember my dad picking me up as a kid and loving it, so I try to recreate that for others.
3	I am far better around children than most adults. I dislike parents more than children; buts because I work with children professionally. 
4	Kids usually have way too much energy for me to handle. I don't dislike them, but I'm not much fun for them to be around.
2	People tell me I'm surprisingly good with kids because expect me to be dry and they see me as someone sarcastic, dry humor almost like a daria. But I turn 180 for kids especially the precocious ones and the ones that aren't bratty because they're just so pure and full of life. I genuinely love interacting and playing games with them and asking them about the latest trends in their lives. They have no filter which I deeply deeply enjoy. 
2	I don't particularly like kids, but I'll admit that I get that motherly instinct whenever I see one. I don't want kids of my own because it's impractical and I don't think I'll be anything close to a good mother (comforting, encouraging, interested... yeah, no). \n\nThere's some parts of being an ISTP that I've accepted and have come to like, but for some reason I hate the fact that I suck with kids. I'm pretty awkward around them, and as much as I try to be that bubbly, welcoming person that most of them need or want me to be, I can't. \n\nI'm in still in high school, and I'm actually now volunteering at the library in this children's unit. The funny thing: I only chose to volunteer in that unit because you have to be at least 12 to do so, and I wanted to get as far away from some of the younger volunteers (screaming 11-year-olds) as possible. There's also a toy store within walking distance to my house and school... so as much as I suck with kids, I think I'm going to apply there and suffer through it. \n\nBut still, I really fucking hate the people who wish death on screaming toddlers or babies or whatever. Even if they're being brats, they're still just kids. Walk away, roll your eyes -- do whatever, but don't say that you want them to die. This is really the only circumstance where I turn into one of those "'hate' is a strong word" people. The only circumstance. 
1	I can train them to either fear me or adore me. Depends on my mood, too. 
1	Love kids, can’t stand interacting with kids+ parents at the same time, usually too stressful. 
1	I actually have a soft spot for little children. I feel very protective of them. I want them all to grow up strong, independent and kind. 
1	As long as they aren't bratty I'm fine with them. They do funny stuff so that is a plus. 
1	Depends on the kid and depends on my mood.
7	I can’t tell if I’m an INFJ or an ISTP	Hi. I got out of an abusive relationship 5 months ago and I think I may have been in the Fe grip the entire time. Making me think I’m an INFJ. I was overwhelmed by Fe and didn’t know how to harness it. Sucks right? So I became hyper sensitive, bitter, and would worry about getting people to like me. Then I got out of the relationship and all of the sudden I began using Ti and Se a lot more. \n\nIf you’re wondering why I stayed, it’s cause I was 19 and he would threaten suicide if I tried to leave. Genuinely thought he’d do it. \n\nSo I’ve been told that if you explain a time you got upset or angry, it’s easier to type you. I’m gonna make this as short as I can.\n\nMy ESFJ friend went batshit crazy when she found out our ESTP friend didn’t like her back and wasn’t going to leave his girlfriend for her. She reeked of insecurity and drama (she actually reeked too though. Her room smelled like a dirty sock) and it was so stupid. Like it was so annoying dealing with that. I hate people who are so desperate and insecure. No one has time to deal with it. There’s so many guys out there and it’s not like he did anything to hurt her. And she did that stupid ESFJ thing when she was all like “everything is fine” when it’s really not and sent him a letter in email rubbing his parents divorce into his face. Who does that? \n\nBut I always tried to understand her behaviour. Not to sympathize or empathize with her, but just to understand her tactic. Like how she thought he’d like her if she pulled shit like this. Then I was like “nah. She doesn’t even have a thought process. She’s just being an idiot.” \n\nThis is the only recent time I got angry with someone. I rarely get angry or upset. I’m pretty chill. \n\nEdit: I’m always concerned with the “why” and the “how” like I get really curious. If I’m beginning to learn something, I must know everything about it so I can excel at it. Right now it’s gardening and painting lawn chairs. I’m redoing the backyard. It’s my newest project. 
8	Not being able to understand someone else's unhealthy behavior is very much high Ti/low Fe. From what I understand the way this person is acting is bothering you but you can't understand why or be able to calm them to a more healthy state. An INFJ would excel at this, especially at 19 where dom/aux are finishing out development. \n\nAlso the fact that you mentioned this person smelled really bad means that it's something important to tell which an Se inferior (INFJ) would gloss over as trivial or not pertaining to the situation. \n\nI wouldn't rule out INFJ entirely though bc Ni-Ti loop is extremely similar to ISTP. Ignoring Fe can be expressed similarly to how an ISTP expresses inferior Fe. Hope this helped a bit.\n\nEdit: spelling
7	ISTP. 
4	This all sounds pretty ISTP, especially the bit about wanting to understand how to do stuff, and the fact that you seem to put this as unusual rather than a "breaking of the dam" suggests inferior Fe rather than suppressed secondary Fe.
23	Pleasantly surprised with ISTP... now what?	In a little over two years, I’ve gotten quite close to an ISTP and I’m thoroughly enjoying the genuine connection that’s been naturally developing. With that said, it has been a fulfilling and frustrating experience at the same time, partly because I’m an SJ type.  \n\nDuring this period, she’s surprised me with little things she says or does that's really hit the spot, but I'm not sure how to interpret these gestures, relative to other ISTP, so I thought I could mention some notable ones that stood out without getting into fine details. (disclaimer: have done some readings on ISTP, but still learning)\n\n* Buys food and makes sure its good to eat\n* Makes references to inside jokes, nicknames \n* Remembers my likes/dislikes, personal info, details and builds around it\n* Protective without being overbearing\n* Notices body language and offers to help by listening, hug, food, company without being overbearing\n* Respects my private personality and keeps secrets\n* Expressed sincere affection and appreciation \n* Joked about engaging in dramatic romantic gestures seen in rom-coms (barf)\n\nShe's won me over with these actions over time, but I've had my share of frustrations when the ISTP turns into a "robot" and breaks. \n\n* Rarely reaches out to talk or makes plans\n* Personality and attention seems to come and go (compartmentalization)\n* Feels distant during spans of time not talking\n* Don't ask don't tell philosophy\n* Flaking or doesn't reply or call back for social things\n\nI'm aware of some of the more general ISTP characteristics such as they need their independence, living in the moment and meaning what they say. \n\nWould definitely love some pointers and perspectives to better understand the things ISTP say and do, so I can return the favor in a less SJ way that resonates better with ISTP.\n\n\n
35	Well, fuck her. Sex is our achilles’ heel. \n\nSTOP INTERPRETING THINGS. \n\nAsk. \n\nJust be grateful. 
12	The fact you found a female ISTP should be a sign to just go with it.
12	If she’s been hanging around you for so long, you don’t really need to change much. If she didn’t like you or your interests started to diverge, she wouldn’t stick around  :)\n\nP.s. I follow the golden rule, so I tend to match the actions/effort people put in the relationship. For example, if you reply fast, I make it my best effort to reply just as fast. For the “feels distant” thing, Im usually reading your texts but not replying because something else captured my attention, and what you said wasn’t urgent or interesting enough for me to break away from what I was doing
8	I've noticed some people (J types especially) like to establish some kind of grand narrative over the typically contradictory things other people do over long stretches of time. That won't work for ISTPs, if it works for anybody at all. Sometimes we do things just because, maybe just to give it a try and see what happens, or because we're bored - there's no larger meaning behind it. Actually, we do that a lot. In fact, I would say a bit of chaos is a necessary component of sanity for SPs. If you try to interpret everything an ISTP does in terms of some big pattern like their motivation in life or what they want from you, you'll drive yourself and the ISTP bonkers. So don't. 
6	> pointers and perspectives to better understand the things ISTP say and do\n\nBecause it was fun. Because they felt like it. Because it made sense at the time. Because they weren’t thinking (acting on instinct/in the moment). \n\nThose would be my best explanations. I often, genuinely answer “why would you do/say that” with “I don’t know”. Then much later I realize the answer was one of the above. 
6	I'll take this part because I didn't see it elsewhere in the comments:\n\n> Feels distant during spans of time not talking\n\nThis sounds like an interest check to me. Do *you* initiate contact during these periods, or no? She likely wants you to and is testing you. That sounds manipulative, it's not, she just wants to make sure that you want contact. (I believe this is a hallmark of ISTP): we don't want to force our way on anybody, so sometimes we step back and see if you'll put in some effort to make sure you want it and we're not wasting our time.
3	> Joked about engaging in dramatic romantic gestures seen in rom-coms (barf)\n\ni'll take it if u dont want it, nb
2	>She's won me over with these actions over time, but I've had my share of frustrations when the ISTP turns into a "robot" and breaks.\n\nWe're NOT robots, and we DON'T break. ISTPs tend to be heavily introverted and need a lot of "them and no one else" time. This is not "abnormal", as it is normal for introverts (who comprise one half of the population, with extroverts being the other half) to do that.\n\nTrying to edge in on our personal time is a very quick way to make us cease to care about you.
2	That entire list of negatives looks like typical socially oblivious behavior to me. AKA it's not even intentional. I'll try to explain each one mentioned. \n\n> "Rarely reaches out to talk or makes plans/ Don't ask don't tell philosophy"\n\n(Grouped because This seems like the same issue, or stemming from the same thing.)  \nIt's a pretty common belief with us that if you don't vocalize it, or make it evident through action that you want to talk about something, then we don't know you want to. \n\nISTP are denser than dark matter and allergic to social expectations. We don't create them, we don't look for them, we don't know what they are, we don't know how to receive them. \n\nShe's not trying to ignore you and she's not uninterested. She just doesn't know you expect her to reach out to talk (and about what?) and she doesn't know you expect her to make plans. We just don't work that way. \n\nTo FIX: Talk to her. Tell her you would like it if she approached you more often, or made an effort to make more plans with you. And help her by leading by example, and making plans with her and telling her you want to talk and make plans. \n\n> Personality and attention seems to come and go (compartmentalization)/ Feels distant during spans of time not talking/ Flaking or doesn't reply or call back for social things\n\nThis is also basically the same issue. \n\nThis, i think is just a desire for time alone and need for hermiting. It happens. We need lots of time alone and lots of time to recharge. Social pressures and expectation stress us out and make us feel confined. We don't like schedules either. \n\nTo FIX: You'll mostly have to be very forgiving with this one, and give her lots of space and time alone without any pressure or need to call back. \n\nDiscuss with her that it bothers you that she feels distant and brainstorm ways you would like it to improve. We respond well to confrontation, honesty, and criticism. Have the talk in a quiet, private place, that she won't feel cornered in.  If you use the format of \[x-action made me feel This way\] it helps us understand a lot more. Use your feelings to convey why it bothers you and why you would like it to change, rather than statements about what her actions were and were not. Be patient and understanding. \n\nIt's not unreasonable to ask her to be less flake-y, reply better and more often to texts and emails. \n\nRemember that we don't easily pick up on expectations and to work on communicating your wants and needs with her, and be understanding of her own.\n\nGood Luck. 
1	Just keep doing what you're doing. Maybe copy her in what she does some to show affection, such as going out of the way to remember her likes and preferences, and pick them up for her. 
11	Do ISTPs like to travel?	Due to financial constraints mainly, I really haven't been outside the country, or even more than a few states away. I have had good experiences on trips, and consider them to be fun for the most part. However, my girlfriend (ENFJ) has traveled to Europe multiple times and loves seeing new things/cultures. She has tried to plan trips with me, or tried to convince me to see more of the world, and although it sounds ok to me, I haven't had the drive to actually put that into tangible plans to go somewhere.   \n\nIs this just because of my aversion to commitment to do things, or does my personality type dissuade me from really wanting to go anywhere? I should probably also say that I don't really have a burning desire to leave my family and my hometown, and would be perfectly happy living here my whole life (although I don't know if this just might be because I haven't been exposed to anything else.)
33	I think this is just you man, I love to travel.
8	I don't think MBPI is any indication of one's interests.\n\nIf you want to do something, do it. If you don't want to do something you've never done before, I suggest giving it a try.
7	I do. I've been in 25 states, and a few dozen national parks, and a lot of rivers.\n\nI've no interest in going out of country though. I've more than enough to do in the US. I'm on mountain 10 of like 30 of Colorado's 14000ft peaks.
7	I get bored if I stay too long in the same place. I've lived in 4 different countries and traveled to over 40.
12	I don't enjoy it that much in all honesty. I have traveled outside of my native country before, and I have loved those experiences very much. That being said, I **hate** the actual traveling bit. I can't stand sitting in a car, plane, train, what have you for more than a few hours. I am perfectly content sitting at home and doing my own thing.  
5	Nothing to do with being an ISTP. Any personality can have the desire to travel. Although some are more likely to not.\n\nI myself don’t necessarily look forward to it. But if somebody has it planned for me (which nobody fucking does) then sure.
4	It's what I live for. I wish I made more money so I could do it more frequently. 
2	I really like it as long as I'm reasonably in control of what I'm doing and where I'm going. This honestly sounds like you've never done anything liek that before so you don't know how nice it is, because I used to be kind of the same way until I actually got out a little. Now theres non-stop longing not to be stuck in one little place my whole life, or be stranded anywhere permanently without control. 
2	I love to solo travel so there are no expectations or people to disappoint. 
2	I love traveling and visiting less popular locations. I love the feeling of not knowing what the expect and dealing with things that come up. I actually detest beaches and the ocean. I don't want to go on vacation and sunbathe. \n\nNext few destinations in my mind: Turkey + Iran, Peru, Antartica, Alaska, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea. \n\nBeen all around China since I'm Chinese (China hinterlands are awesome, Tibet and Xinjiang def worth visiting as not many foreigners go yet), Thailand, Cambodia, India, Russia, Germany, France, England, Iceland, Guatemala, Malaysia. 
2	I'm ok to travel if there is someone, like close friends, arranging the itinerary and ticket and stuff. I'm too lazy to do it myself. Probably ask your girlfriend to arrange the travel?
2	I've gone long periods without any travel whatsoever and I've also done lots of sporadic trips, I've even lived in foreign countries for a few years at a time. Every new place, new food, new festival, is stimulation for my Se. But as the newness factor wains, so does my interest. I would say 3-7 day trips are all I need/can stand.\n\nThe planning part is a chore though and the Ti (that boring nerd) sits there like a fucking accountant tallying up each expense and asking, "Do you really need to go there/do that? It just cost more money and is only going to provide like an hour of excitement" And my Se is like, "Fuck yes I do! Now shut up and give me the credit card numbers you fucking nerd"
2	It probably depends on your interest to some extent.  However, I seem to have similar feelings to you.  I enjoy traveling when I do it, but I'm so content to be where ever I am at that I never make the effort to plan trips on my own accord.
1	I've never gone out camping, but I've always been interested in it. My father isn't into the whole camping thing and always brings my family to hotels whenever we go on vacation (I'm 17). And I've gotten sick of it honestly. I do like to travel if I experience the actual place I'm going rather than being in a hotel / resort the entire time.
1	Don't think it has anything to do with personality types. \n\nIdeally, I think I would love to travel to places. But it's hard for me to justify seeing a landmark or culture for hundreds or thousands of dollars. 
1	I don't have wanderlust.  I have no desire to travel to other countries.  I just don't get the appeal.  
1	I like holidays and travelling but I never do anything. I'm comfortable where I am right now. Might be a sign that you're in a Ti-Ni loop though.  \nUsually Fe users like to travel so they can show off that they are a fun person on social media.
1	I don't like planned travels, i want to go where i feel like when i want to and sleep on a tent or on a hotel when i feel like it
1	I like to travel
1	I love traveling, even the driving part.  I do have a little issue of shyness when I go somewhere new, so I like going with an outgoing person so they can do the talking for me.
1	YES!
1	I've taken car trips across country (canada) and around the US a bit. Rode my motorcycle about 100,000km in 5 years. Long ass trips.\n\nI move away from home and family. \n\nOP not travelling isn't mbti related
1	I dont really like to travel but its mostly due to bad experiences while traveling, if i could get rid of those experiences i would probably be able to travel just fine.
1	Yes I Love to travel. And I'm glad I always could. I started traveling alone inside of Norway at 14, and At 17 I visited my bf in England by myself, and traveled to Turkey by myself at the same age. After I became a mom I've taken her everywhere. She had taken the airplane 40+ times at the age of 3. Now I'm planning to go to England again to meet my ex there (we are still very good friends).
1	I love to travel. I've been all over my home country, England, Wales, Spain, Portugal, Mallorca, Tenerife, and the US twice. I like being out and about, away from home. 
1	I dont like travel, unless its something I really want to do. But thats just me and me not wanting to waste money, i guess.
1	I lovvve traveling. I wish make money And buy mobile-home 
10	Can you laugh at yourselves?	I'm an INTP married to a practically textbook ISTP. One thing puzzles me about him though. He's incredibly sarcastic, as am I, and I find him funny even if he is using his sarcasm at my expense because, hey if it's true, it's funny. I may have an ego in certain aspects but I'm also pretty honest about myself.  He on the other hand seems to dish out more than he can take. If I tease him about a weakness or a mistake he gets withdrawn and pulls away in a huff. Now if he were a compassionate feeler type I could wrap my head around this but the seeming double standard doesn't make much sense.  Is this common for ISTPs. If someone ribs you, do you shut down?\n\nExample: He was showing me how to play a video game, a seemingly innocuous activity but his way of describing the object of the game and demonstration of technique were poor. (Honestly I could have figured it out much faster if I had tried it on my own, but it was a way to spend time together, so I went with it.) He laughed at me for screwing something up and I laughed at him for his inept ability to teach. Suddenly he gets offended (of course he says he's not) and then he pulls away and I'm like left with a "what just happened?" moment.\n\nThere have been other instances of this, not involving me being the offender.\n\nIs this an ISTP thing, or is he an anomaly?
15	Personally, if it’s true I will laugh at the joke if I am the target. I routinely make self deprecating jokes. If you have a laugh at my expense, odds are I will join in and make a counter joke about myself.\n\nIf it isn’t true, and in my opinion mean spirited, you’d better watch out because you might end up in tears after I am done cutting you down. Mean spirited is the key, at least as far as I am concerned. Your old man may have more tender feelings.
5	I have a fragile ego and tbh if someone points out an insecurity I have I can be fucked up for real.\nBut that's pretty rare, only happens with people I barely know, but with close friends we just joke about our defects occasionally on a light manner.
4	Hi! I'm an INTP dating an ISTP and he does the same thing too! For the most part we both joke about each other's short comings and insecurities without a hitch. But it seems like there are a few things with him I can not joke about where as everything with me is fair game. 
3	This isn't an ISTP thing, this is a you being a dick thing. We can laugh at ourselves fine, but you've glossed over your friends feelings and conflated one issue for another. Granted it's relatively small, but you're still not realizing three very important things.\n\n1. ISTP, despite not being big feeler types, ARE big feelers. We have a lot of emotions and they play a huge part in us, but we're incapable of understanding our own feelings too much, as they're buried in our subconscious. Our emotions are very important to us, more than we realize, and we may never realize just how important they are.\n2. There's a big difference between those two ribbings. One is teasing as someone making a mistake in a video game (impartial, not applicable to other life skills, or even other video games), the other is an insinuation that someone can't teach, which is not only a practical real life skill, but a skill he was trying to service towards You and nobody else. The ribs aren't equal as you think they are, and you're not realizing the greater implications of your actions; aka that you don't care that he's taking the time to spend time with you, or trying to teach you. Or that you think it's shit.\n3. ISTP, always, even in some subconscious way, are taking everything seriously/literally. It sucks, but there's not a lot we can do about it. It's not something we like, it's not fun, it's just the way we are, even if logically we don't want to be or know that another person might be joking. In other words, you insulting his teaching to him, was probably taken as a very literal general statement "You suck at teaching period. You're a shit teacher."\n\nRealize that when you offend or hurt someone, even without intention, that that's not something you get to decide. It doesn't matter if what you said was true or reasonable or small or big, feelings don't work according to logic. You don't get to decide whether you hurt someone, and you don't get to decide it's unreasonable either, even if it might be. You do, however, get to decide if you give enough of a shit to say sorry and do better next time and care about his feelings.
3	It depends on a lot of things, like the specific topic, context, wording, and tone. I'm very sensitive to tone, and I may feel disrespected just by the way something is said even if the content is totally innocuous. Unfortunately, that's not always easy for other people or even me to figure out, especially for inferior Fe users.\n\nAlso, most people have sore spots or sensitive topics that they don't necessarily reveal, it's no different for ISTPs. But with ISTPs it might be worse in that they're very private and usually hate talking about their weaknesses. So it might feel like stepping around a bunch of landmines at times just because you don't know which specific points to avoid. Hell, he probably doesn't know all of them himself. \n\nWhat I'm guessing is that your husband, consciously or not, puts up a lighthearted facade of self-deprecation while actually being deeply insecure about some things, like his teaching ability for example. It could stem from formative experiences, maybe, or how he constructs his self-worth deep within. Like how some men get really upset when they fail at some "manly" task... especially with their wives/girlfriends watching. Because they feel like less of a man. Yeah. Maybe your husband has some secret self-identity as a teacher or imparter of knowledge and he hates that he can't teach a simple thing to his wife. I think it's actually pretty common for ISTPs to aspire to be a mentor of sorts, which makes sense because if you flip the order of their functions you get ENFJ. And oh, if he acts like a "tough guy" most of the time it's probably worse because he hates weakness in himself most of all. So he's probably not even mad at you specifically, he's mad at himself and the situation as a whole.
2	We value our "expertise" MASSIVELY.  And when something we think we're "experts" about gets questioned or criticized it cuts to the BONE.  Even if it's something innocuous.  Now I put "expertise" in quotes because as I've said before around here we're, "Often wrong but never in doubt" so it's kind of hard to tell when we really know what we're taking about and when we're talking out our ass.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have a great solution to the issue other than please be gentile when questioning something when we appear to think we know what we're talking about.  (Jesus, what a sentence.  How do we ever get dates?)  Maybe genuine questions that start to make us realize we might be talking out our ass.  I also think we get less sensitive as we get older.\n\nBut don't forget, there's nothing that will get an ISTP to shut down faster than questioning our "expertise" especially when we DO know what we're talking about.
2	Self-deprecation is my main use of humor.
2	a huge chunk of my sense of humor is self-deprecating jokes. 
1	Mmmm might be true, I don't know. I do know that our ego is Ti so if you make us look dumb we will get upset at you. It's the difference between laughing at our quirks and poking a stick at our insecurities.
1	I make myself the subject of jokes around my family, my sisters gotten pretty good at attacking me and thinking of comebacks. 
1	Yes, true to me
1	I have no problems laughing at myself for most issues. However, if someone pokes fun about one of my actual insecurities, chances are I will attempt to just laugh it off, and people around me probably wouldn't know unless they really knew me well, but I would be pretty shaken up.  There'd be a good chance that would ruin my day
1	I have soft spots that I don't like joking about, but if it bothers me I will just say it outright that it does. That's usually enough to make the other person back off.  I think every type has their points that are a little off limits, but maybe they just don't realize it.
1	In your example, are you sure he is offended? How do you tell? Probably you're overthinking things.
1	I laugh at my self all the time. One example was when I was running I pulled a classic trip on your shoe lace and fell I just laughed it off and kept running only to trip in the exact same way again 2 minutes later. This time I laughed about it re-tied my shoes and kept going. I think it's good to be able to laugh at your self and I hope I continue to laugh at my self.
0	No.
11	How many close friends do you have?	I know as ISTPs we're not in a super close relationship with our emotions, usually. Subsequently it can be difficult to have really close friends that you could talk to about anything. \n\nNow, I've had friends that I could go to for damn near everything, but at the moment I can't say that's the case. Don't get me wrong, I have friends I could turn to if I needed a ride at like 3am, but to me someone could basically be an acquaintance and I'd do that for them.\n\nAnyway, situations changed, people moved, and the closeness dwindled.  I'm the kind of person who won't really go out of my way to talk to people unless they either go out of their way to talk to me, or I see them on a regular basis. This is the more selfish part of me saying this, but if someone wanted to talk to me, they would, and it's not worth my time trying to talk to people who don't want to talk to me.\n\nMost of the time it doesn't bother me that I don't have someone to bounce thoughts off of, but sometimes it's nice to be able to get outside perspective on my admittedly somewhat narrow frame of mind. \n\nSo back to the question, how many close friends do most of you have? \nAnd if that number is greater than zero, when did you meet them and why has your friendship stayed close?
20	Zero. Don't think I could handle anymore than that.
6	Ummm, I'm gonna say a half a close friend. \nShe's not a very good friend, always comes to me with problems, literally falls asleep if i bore her with the details of my rare problems.\nHer now ex-fiance didn't like me so she quit talking to me for a while. A few times.  And other than her I just have acquaintances, good close friend huh? 
4	I have 5 people I consider close friends. Three of them I haven't seen in a while, but I would still interact with them as if I saw them yesterday.
4	I have 4 people I consider my best friends, and 4-5 more I'd consider close friends.
2	I have two: an ex-girlfriend and someone with whom I cannot spend more that fifteen minutes in person before I become irritated. I could still go to both of them for anything, and they'd come to me. Usually over text though. 
2	I have a couple close friends and I’d rather die than talk to them about any issue I may have. 
2	5, but I've left the USA and won't return for nearly a decade, so.... None as of right now haha :/\n\nEdit: I met all of them at university. We did stupid stuff together, supported each other whenever we were sad and/or drunk, and could depend on each other in any situation. 3 of them knew each other, the other 2 were a separate group. Good times... I'm gonna miss them
2	3 at the moment. I have one that I usually smoke it up with anytime im off from work. The other two are I keep less in contact with, but we get along fine. 
1	0 -- I'm 15 and I moved after 8th grade. Lost contact with all those close, childhood friends. Didn't make any close ones at the new school. Just moved again ~3 months ago in the middle of 10th. Currently losing contact with old friends. Didn't/haven't made any close friends at new place (really no friends at all - of any type). Not planning on it either. Kinda over it. Will probably move again. 
1	I have one. We dated for two years and MBTI was the catalyst to discovering how we could be so attracted to each other yet so incompatible. \n\nNow we are two people who really understand this one facet of life that most people ignore or dismiss, and that is worth keeping. We also have a lot in common that makes continuing to hang out fun and rewarding. \n\nPlus, we get along awesomely as friends. The issues we ran into as a couple aren’t issues in this context. \n\nI have two lovers I see occasionally with whom I have an emotionally close relationship, but they also normally include weeks or months of radio silence, so those are very ISTP-friendly. 
1	I am not even close with my family... I have somehow, definitely not intentionally, grew up to be completely independent unit. My family is not fucked or anything, parents just left us kids be free range. \n\nI have now moved from Europe to Asia on my own for work, it's very strange experience building your social circles from absolute zero in completely different culture and environment, especially if you are introvert
1	I have one person I’m 95% open with. My other “best friends”, I’m like 60% open with. Open with pretty much everything but deep emotions. 
1	Two. One of them isn't speaking to me at the moment but I know she will get over it sooner or later. 
1	What are friends?
1	Yah I have no close friends. I live with my Mum and I don't even talk to her that much.
1	1 close friend, maybe 1 other good close friend and like 2 other good friends. But the one close friend I’ve known for almost 10 years. We’ve stayed close because of how blunt we r to each other, I guess. We know we’re gonna hurt each other, but we see the reason behind it so we’re understanding of each other on that. (Me more than the other tbh) but I’m strong, and enjoy the feedback/criticism to help myself. It gets tiring though.
1	I had few close friends but I barely ever see them
1	2 close friends, 2 more that are their friends, and 6 work friends. That's everyone...
1	3 Best friends, more i would consider close.
1	My two best friends are ESTP and ESFP. I’m close with an ENTJ and ISFP as well. All four are nice for different reasons. But ESTP understands me the most. 
1	About 3.
1	0, I'm 15 and just finished the first year of high school, there have been some attempts by my classmates tho. I don't talk with my old classmates if they don't initiate the conversation
1	i can actually count the number of "close friends" on both of my hands. \n\n2  from HS (not sure what their types are); we don't see each other often and have our own lives, but we maintain contact through WhatsApp pretty frequently. having group things makes it easier to talk sometimes. \n\n2.5 (i say .5 bc the third friend can be flighty too); definitely extroverts, but specifically don't know types. they're always down to do something. when i feel like going out, they're always very welcoming but i can tell they get annoyed when i disappear for months. \n\n2; my best friend from college (intp) and my sister (infp-not sure if she counts, but she's a friend by choice now). actually adore these two. hands down best friends i've made on purpose. 
1	Been about 8 years since I had a "close friend." I should probably get one of those, I heard they can be useful.

1	Ha! So true \nJust replaced propeller shaft for 4WD, after watching YouTube Videos.
12	Why do you iSTPs seem so different compared to us iNTPs?	ENTPs are similar to us. INTJs are similar to us. INFPs are similar. ISTPs feel like completely different people. Badasses vs. nerds. Simple vs. complex. Facts vs. abstractions. Physical vs. cerebral. Blunt vs. sharp. Practical vs. theoretical. In the moment vs. a few seconds from now. "Cool" vs. "awkward". "Doing" vs. "Thinking".
32	Breadth of knowledge is more interesting to us than depth of knowledge.
15	istps want to dissect everything into building blocks/systems.  we seek information to understand, and then we move on. we only need the information we need at that moment, and will ignore all irrelevant nonsense.  we find the puzzle piece missing from the system, and in the process of figuring out that puzzle piece, we learn the system thoroughly.  once we have a systems understanding of something, we seem like we've suddenly mastered it, when we've really just broken it down into some absurd subconscious Ni trainwreck that we could never put words to.  "figure shit out, use new data to be more efficient, do more shit, get better results."  \n\nwe're scientists at heart, but we don't want to circle jerk about impossible hypotheticals, and will quickly tell you which part of the system your poorly thought out Ne ideas will fail at.\n\ni think that INTPs are way more concerned with the breadth of possibilities and care less about the logistics of actually attaining any of those possibilities, while ISTPs are more concerned with the logistics so that when the opportunity to attain a good looking possibility arises, we'll actually be ready to act on it and get what we wanted out of it.  that's my experience, anyway.
11	Because we are.
8	INTPs tend to stick to what they know instead of trying to challenge it. They like to think things over intensely and when they reach a difficult obstacle, they will just sit there and try to think through the situation instead of actually acting on it. They're incredibly smart and analytical people, but sometimes thinking isn't the best action. *Sometimes you can change by not changing at all.*\n\nAs ISTPs we like to take in a lot of information, do thrilling shit, and turn our brains off when we have to do boring stuff. You guys could be entertained by thinking up deep hypothetical scenarios. You guys should remember that sometimes questions don't have answers and that action has more weight than thought. This was written as an ISTP who sometimes tests as a INTP.\n\n
6	ISTPs are nerdy like INTPs but people get distracted by what they see (extroverted function). \n\nThat Se is what’s cool because everyone can see and recognize what it is without much thought. Ideas/Ne requires an extra step and thought and people don’t want to invest that immediately into a stranger for no reason. Se is like bam— right in your face. 
6	No, we are nerdy too, we are cerebral too, we are sharp too sometimes, we are theoretical too, we are awkward too, we are thinking too. 
4	Are you calling us simple or yourself?
3	Are the two that different?  Maybe I just didn't notice since the S & N axis is the one I am closest to 50/50 on.
2	One word: Practicality.\n\nThere's a fuck ton of differences here, emotionally, psychologically, I think. It's hard for me to know which one you might be deferring to, but I feel you're asking about the general difference in ability AND attitude-- Which, also involves our emotional processing, goals, and values.\n\nBut in an overview, as a general purpose of how we work, I'd say practicality is a good place to start. Knowledge for us is only as valuable as it is practical, even if we may read for fun or learn for fun like you. We tend to drop our books when we find the bare minimum of our needs though, because there's still shit we gotta do. Say I have a problem with my car, I read through a car manual to find the solution to the problem, and once I've found it, that's more or less it. I drop the book and fix my fucking car. Now my car's fixed, and I got laundry, groceries, bills to pay, work to get to, ect. I can read the rest of the book later, if I want to.\n\nThis Action Oriented priority value-system shapes a lot of beliefs and ideals, as well as the "Cool" Level headed factual blunt attitude we have.\n\nSo yeah, we're more down to earth than you guys are in a very literal sense. You guys are in your heads constantly, and we're about 50/50 inside and out, literally outside, working. We are as much outside our heads physically interacting and working on the world as we are being inside to be outside and being outside to be inside. An inside workout for an outside problem, which creates an outside result and an inside calm. We are literally physically attached and mentally outside of ourselves as much as we are physically getting ourselves dirty. And that makes us a lot more present, a lot more caring about that outside realm as opposed to our inner one compared to you. It makes us more grounded, more calm, and gives us even more importance on the factual, the physical. It is super important and super serious to us, which can and does lead to taking things a lot more seriously, making us more stoic, more quiet, ect.

11	When do my wTF years end?	I'm 16 years old, and from studying my life it seems that my WTF years started at about 13-14. I've looked at the symptoms of the ISTP "WTF Years", and I seem to fit it. I don't want to go into too much detail, but when does it end?
18	They end when you decide to make them end.
27	Never
5	Unfortunately it's not something that ends spontaneously, you have to work for it. Go to concerts, visit some museums, start a hobby that gets you out of the house and engages your senses (like geocaching or nature photography), etc...\n\nThat being said, the Ti-Ni loop is something that hangs above us all the time like the sword of Damocles, ready to strike the moment you fall back into your old habits.
6	For me it was +-23 years. Just keep on thinking and figuring things out... You are creating your foundation, make it a good one. And try not to alienate to many people! 
6	Read book The Power of Now by Eckhart Tole. May you be enlightened. I'm tired of people talking excessively about WTF years. Too much of an illusion. Good luck with your life!
6	Turning 30. Still there. Lmao
3	It ends on your terms when you figure your shit out. Some people have 2 WTF years and some people have 20. Take care of your shit, pay attention to yourself and surroundings, and do your best to always step forwards instead of backwards. 
3	While I was travelling, I met this German fellow who was dressed peculiarly in black.  He carried a big deep spoon with him, which was how he drank whiskey.  The whole thing was very strange, so I had to ask him about it.  \n\nHe was a [Journeyman.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_years).\n\nSee, in America we seek to keep our kids safe at all times and over there, they deliberately go out of their way to make their kids confront hardship and learn self-sufficiency.  This particular fellow had with him a map, on which was drawn a 50km circle in blue around his hometown.  *He was not allowed to set foot inside that circle for three years*.   This, he explained, is the "Journey".  He MUST learn to live and leave, and support himself plying his trade, in order to achieve the next rank.  Three years!  On his own, no help, just using what skills he has learned as a carpenter.  To barter, trade, negotiate, arrange for lodging and assist others for favors of food or shelter or pay.\n\nThis struck me with a force of revelation, as I too, was on my own journey.  Solo, traveling the world, with a one-way ticket and dwindling savings, but I did eventually find work, and stayed a traveller for my own 3 years.  \n\nDuring those three years, I had to come to grips with the fact that my shy weirdness, my aloofness, my random sense of humor wasn't working for me outside of my circle.  I had to fumble, and learn, and fail hard a bunch of times.  I had to embarrass myself trying to meet women, I had to walk lonely through city streets for hours working up the nerve to talk to strangers and really find my courage and value.  I had to learn what people's responses were trying to tell me, and I had to stick myself out further that I thought I would ever do, to find out that it actually isn't wrong and that I can pull things off.\n\nTo me, the WTF years were awful, the time I needed and when everyone else was like "WTF is with this guy...?"  But leaving your comfort zone, being bold, believing in yourself and finding your true value to the world will anchor your ability to stick firmly in any conversation in the future.  \n\nMight I suggest the following exercise?  \n\nOn a sheet of paper, divide into three columns.  Label the columns Mother, Father, Self.  Under each column list the traits that define you, and place them in the area you feel you developed them FROM.  (Self means you figured out a belief or principle on your own)  Do the same with your weaknesses.  This will really help.  Trust me.
3	**The Ti-Ni loop:** when you loop over and over again between your dominant judging function and your memory function and just ignore your gathering function. You essentially close yourself off from new experiences and new information and get real comfortable. You need Se to grow as a person, to learn new things. Without it you can't properly utilize your awesome Ti. The only way to get out of it is to realize that you are getting comfortable and try doing and learning new things.  \nThere's actually nothing wrong with using Ti-Ni. Sometimes you need to get into a loop when you've gathered enough information just to sort something out in your life. Ni is a very powerful function. Use it properly and you can gain so much insight into how the world works.
2	I had no idea this was a thing but holy shit it makes so much sense now. Mine started around the same time as yours, I'm 21 now and am just starting to get out of them I think. I was definitely deepest in them from like 16-19, those years were rough, but it does get much better!

3	Low-level anxiety when it comes to driving	So I got a car about a week ago. And I got my driver's licence at my country's legal age of 18 with just one test that I'm still shocked I managed to pass. Drove my mother's car a bit for a few weeks which freaked me out cause she freaked out then I promptly moved to the middle of nowhere to work and I walked everywhere and got a lift when I couldn't. \n\nNow I'm 21 and it's me vs car and I'm just about to piss myself. Mom wants to teach me again but she gives me road anxiety because she just snaps and I can't think of my own fuckups AND her reaction to said fuckups while trying not to throw up because I keep thinking of future fuckups. Any advice? How do I get over this anxiety? \n\nTl;dr I suck at driving, anxiety prone and need to stop freaking out. 
20	I don't know about other ISTP's, but driving is one of the things I'm most confident in. I actually didn't realize that people had anxiety behind the wheel until I met my girlfriend, and then I found out there are people who have it worse than she does.. THAT makes me a little nervous, the fact that there are thousands of scared people out there sharing the roads with me.  Know the rules, follow the rules, and be defensive for those that haven't a clue; that's how you become a confident driver.
9	Doesn’t really sound like an istp thing. 
3	All I can say is try to find another teacher. Your mom doesn't look like she's teaching you efficiently. Drive a lot, even if its short distance, and you'll get used to it.
2	Thanks guys, most of the advice I already know but I needed to get it out of my head so I could get over it. It wasn't so bad when I got over myself and went for it.
1	Think you got the wrong subreddit mate\nDunno what you expect us to do to help
1	I had a similar issue with my mom, actually. \n\nI coudlnt find anyone to teach me, because no one wants to stick their cars out. and i was stranded, and i still need transportation so bad. but i couldnt learn with her and half way in she refused to teach me, so i didnt even have that. but i knew, more than anything, i needed transportation and i needed my own transportation, \n\ni had to take matters into my own hands\n\ni went on craigslist and got a cheap motorcycle\n\ni didnt knwo anything about them at the time, i still dont know that much. but it was the best thing that ever happened to me in regards to driving because id idnt have to wory about anyone other than myself and i coudl do what i wanted, and i coudl focus and i could relax and let my Ti-Se out and work its magic. and it did. \n\ni bought the motorcycle cheap off the guy and nearly crashed that night learning to ride it on my won\n\nbut i still rode it out all on my own\n\nand everything was okay afterwords\n\nand i t gave me the crucial experience and information i needed to know through physical learning that i just wasnt going to get any other way, especially not without someone constantly trying to talk to me or distract me at my throat, making me anxious and unfocused and unable to think. \n\ni would say get a vehicle of your own, save up money for it. then teach yourself. practice in small areas with no traffic on your own at first, and go at your own pace. youll get there. practice makes perfect. 
1	I got motorcycle license and car both almost at the same time, but only rode a bike since that. And no matters how much more dangerous it is to ride it compared to a car, i feel completely sure about doing it, because i developed the skill and confidence. And if i had to take a car right now, i would be anxious as fuck because it's been years since the last time. You just have to get skilled again, but you won't if you get anxious because her.  Ask for help for a friend, your father, or someone who only cares about not dying, or you will feel more and more insecure. Explain it to your mother, and if she doesn't understands, refuse to drive with her by your side.
1	That's okay, it is just the necessary level of stress, when you do anything which requires using your reflexes. 
1	Driving is a skill. You've just not practiced it yet. Keep driving, your anxiety will die out.
1	There is ONLY one way to solve driving anxiety: DRIVE\n\n(applicable to all irrational anxieties in life)
1	I was actually terrified about driving and refused to learn until it was a necessity to get forward in life, got my drivers license and car at 23.
25	i have no idea what i'm doing with my life	pretty sure i'm balls deep in my WTF years. i want to do everything and nothing all at the same time.\n\nbiggest obstacle i'm currently trying to overcome is getting a new job.\n\ni keep trying to find something that i'd be interested in and i'm starting to feel like i'm just a person who can do things instead of someone who has passions.\n\nif you've got stories from your wtf years pls share.\n\nedit: thank you for the responses - unfortunately i need the reassurance that i'm not a total failure so thank you for all the positive responses and encouragement. 
22	WTF years lasted from age ~16-25 for me and I'm barely getting out of it. I struggled intensely with apathy, anxiety, anhedonia and didn't really find anything interesting or enjoyable in life. After living in my head for so long, I finally buckled down and *forced* myself to do things that would be good for me.\n\nHere are some tips that hopefully help:\n\nForce yourself to go out and experience new things on a regular basis. It's easy to fall into a routine where you do nothing but watch tv, play video games, zone out, and wait for something to happen but it will only make you more depressed.\n\nKeep your goals close and remind yourself of them often. Try to keep a list visible so you can see your progress.\n\nDon't avoid what makes you uncomfortable. There will be a point in your goals where you feel uncomfortable and question whether you can complete that goal, but push through it. I took a "break" because I was avoiding my goal, and I ended up wasting an entire year.\n\nAs soon as you wake up, make it a habit to remind yourself of what you're grateful for. Count your blessings and list things you're happy for. I'm not a morning person and would always wake up in a bad mood that would carry throughout the day, but once I did this, I became much more happier.\n\nAs always, exercise, meditate, eat well, and sleep well.

5	I can't remember how I survived those years. \n\nI can tell you at this time that nothing you do now matters.  There isn't an easy button to push and you will never get a answer out of anyone of what to do.\n\nLife pro tips.\nFun. Have it. Every day in a lol activities. Have fun in the shitty jobs. Have fun.\n\nSpend alone time, but force together time with people. It can suck, but it gets easier.\n\nBe confident in yourself. You can do anything as long as you out the work and effort in.\n\nFor work, first objective is getting money. Then work in making more money. Before burning out, change career paths, do something different.\n\nMost of all, do not let the oppurtunity to do something different out of your grasp. Take the chance, always.  When someone offers, say yes.  This is how shit in your life moves along. This is how you make friends, network for jobs, get better jobs, etc.\n\n\nEdit: forgot to add, you're only a failure if you quit trying 
3	When you're doing something you don't enjoy, what would you rather be doing? Even if it's staring at the ceiling, what do you most often think about or notice around you that other people seem to miss? When you're within a group of people, is there a topic that when it comes up you want to keep talking or listening about it? Can you say "I'm good at this certain thing"?
3	You are alive, sentient, conscious. But you will die one day. Who even are you? Why are you alive?  \nDoes anything really matter? Are all your "efforts" in vain? Why are you even putting in any effort? Why are you motivated to do anything, really?  \nThese are questions you should probably ask yourself while you're still in your WTF years. Having a purpose really helps get you out of them.
3	I just wanted to say these are my exact thoughts at the moment
3	best advice is from the other comments on here already, but i also have something to add. don't overwork yourself, don't extend yourself beyond what you know you can do. find comfort in doing nothing and find comfort in doing something that is "enough" at least for the time being or to be used as a stepping stone. i don't know if i've experienced my WTF years or if i was just depressed as hell. that can also be something to look out for. learn to love yourself, accept yourself, and take care of yourself. put your happiness and health first, and focus on your life and your loved ones. i'm in college rn and this past semester i suffered from a major depressive episode that had me completely reconsidering my life and choices. i've since decided that i want to pursue something that's different but that i love and will also make me happy. it's not a career that many people look up to, and not one that many people consider if they want to make a lot of money or be considered traditionally "successful" (teaching public school- it's not highly regarded in the US) i found i was holding myself up to standards that i actually had no interest in meeting. i was trying to be something i wasn't to make other people happy. so just be yourself, love and appreciate yourself, accept your shortcomings (maybe they're not shortcomings at all) and accept that even though things can go wrong, they won't last forever, and you don't need to beat yourself up about it. good luck :) 
2	Is it hard actually getting interviews, or follow ups? Or is it hard making a decision on what career field to follow?
2	Working out has definitely helped speed up my exodus of the WTF years. I’m not out of the woods yet, but doing way better than I was a year ago. \n\n\nSometimes all we need for motivation is progress. Even just small progress. Watching my body get more aesthetically pleasing has been a huge confidence booster. It makes me more willing to go out and try new things. \n\n\nI went to Post Malone’s after party last week in dallas. And I was going nuts. With a sober mind, I actually made new friends there who were rich stoner lawyers. They also paid for my drinks all night. And I ended up getting in the pool in the middle of the venue with them. \n\n\nThat was something I had never ever ever done before. Me? Making friends while alone and sober? Taking off clothes In public? Getting in the fucking pool at an after party and dancing? \n\n\nEven 6 months ago I’d never have done that. But confidence is one hell of a drug. 
2	If there's anything that you think you may have even just a little interest in, or that you could see yourself doing then dont hesitate and go out and do it, life's too short.
8	How do you flirt/show interest in a girl when you are already friends?	
8	[deleted]
6	I'm not sure...
7	I’ve had plenty of flings with friends honestly. You can do any kind of approach but it’s always the same kinda bullshit. Basically slowly start slipping out sexual innuendos as light jokes and start studying how she reacts to them. Then eventually you’re gonna wanna be serious with it.\n\nAnd all this time make sure she’s comfortable with your touch. When you start touching her at the right places, you’ll know she wants it too. Do keep in mind girls tend to not wanna ruin friendships from fucking or getting involved in a relationship. So just remind her it’s not gonna be a big deal.\n\nEverything will flow through. 
2	if you're already friends, you have already shown a type of interest. show more interest. ask about her life and interests. get to know her. talk with her and be genuine. adding this because i don't like the comments below. personally throwing in sexual innuendos in our conversations would make me uncomfortable and throw me off. if you want to have sex, maybe that's fine. but that's not how you get into a relationship. just my opinion. to get into a relationship, you just get to know each other as much as you can. just my opinion :) i like men who are friendly, open, communicative, responsible, and genuine.
2	[deleted]
1	Not very good friends if you can’t just tell her are you 
1	1. Become less available\n2. Start subtly showing (sexual) intent. Drop innuendos. Make dirty jokes.
16	Burning bridges	Does anyone else feel like they burn a lot of bridges (accidentally or intentionally)? Specifically with friends or romantic interests. I feel like I do this often and am apathetic until time has passed and I've had a chance to reflect.\n\nIs this an ISTP trait?
31	I don't burn bridges. I just abandon them and forget they were ever even there.
18	I don't have time for bullshit in my life.
6	All the time. I just view them as certain chapters in my life. 
6	Oh God yes lmao. But a lot of times though relationships were short, so I don't really regret them.
3	My bridges are just in a poor state of disrepair and were constructed poorly. 
2	in my group of friends i'm known for this and for "being really good at it" lol 
1	Only the toxic ones, which may or may not be the majority of my relationships.  The few that last have lasted more than a decade with no end in sight.  No tolerance for bullshit, manipulation, or drama.
1	Lol I've done it accidentally and on purpose.
1	i have very low tolerance for bullshit and very shit ability to differentiate between bullshit or not bullshit. so\n\na lot of bridges get burnt very fast and very easy\n\nso maybe. either way, i was always really worried about having this??? so. im so glad ot see its not just me. 
1	I burn those bridges to ash at a moments notice, its like taking out the trash.
1	I’m very ISTP and I’m the master of burning bridges with family and friends. I just give the time and situation to ppl to corrupt themselves.
1	It’s intentional and I can’t stand to be abused, consistently, for long. I’m also not one to walk on eggshells, just to remain in someone’s life. So burn, baby, burn. Set the whole fcking place on fire 
16	Do you practice stoicism? Why or why not?	Answers on a postcard
15	Stoicism & ISTP’s go together like PB&J
17	I've always had decent control over my emotional expression (thanks, childhood abuse!), but after age 30 or so, stoicism took a very firm hold and I don't think there's a thing anyone in my life could do or say to trigger a complaint.  Despite me having a pile of "problems" in my life, I don't worry anymore.  I used to, unhealthily and nearly constantly.  Now I just don't.  Weed MIGHT contribute. lol\n\nI notice the contrast in others, even other ISTPs, where they will be greatly affected by the most insignificant things, and I can't even really say anything without them blowing up.  And more accurately, it's not my job to say anything.  I just observe, analyse, and remain objective.  It may be a bit more robotic, but it's not like I can't access my emotions when I choose to.  I just don't choose to in front of others.  I can't trust most people to listen or react to anything maturely.
5	Diogenes going on Saint Antony
4	It helps me make rational decisions. This leads to less mistakes in my life.
3	I'd like to more, but sometimes I've had a shit time with something and want to vent or having endured something unpleasant, feel it's a badge of honor and wear it with pride. 
3	Not intentionally.
2	I honestly didn't even know this was a thing that people needed to practice until very recently.  I always thought was something you either had or you didn't have, and I have it for obvious reasons.  
2	I do. It's a philosophy that makes sense to me. Focused on pragmatism and improving yourself and your immediate surroundings.
2	I can be stoic, but that's specifically when I'm flexing my Ti muscles. I've been figuring out feelings/emotions over the past few years, and I quite like being able to (somewhat) express them now.
2	No, I think it's a philosophy that encourages dissociation.
2	What a coincidence, I considered starting stoicism like 2 days ago. It felt like a natural solution considering my life experiences and what would fit me better and make life more simple/better. I don't feel like committing though..
1	Yes, but with calculated *huge* risks
1	I do and I wear it like a badge of honor (to look back on a realize I endured something and didn’t give up) and when I need to vent it’s usually to my best friend (husband) who has learned to just listen. Once I’ve vented to him I move on and don’t look back.
1	I don't practice it, it just happens
1	Wouldn't practicing it make it inegnuine??? Regardless...\n\nIdk I don't practice it, but I am that way at times. Just depends on my mood. I shut down a lot when I'm sad or can't talk to people. I've been told that I "brood" a lot. 
5	How are you at playing poker?	
8	I do well.  I usually play really tight.  
2	People say they have a hard time reading me.
2	Always crack a smile when my hand is good. I suck. 
1	I love playing poker. I usually hate being around most poker players though! I am hoping the online poker opens back up soon in a legal way. I prefer a tight/agressive style. Dan Harrington's books were great reads and helped me mold my style.
1	Legit straight poker face
1	Im terrible, i don't have a good poker face. 
5	Are we emotionally manipulative?	
25	No. If we can barely understand our own emotions, how do you expect for ISTP's to *consciously* play with peoples emotions?
3	I know how to, I don't do it often though. It's not hard, you see what you want to come to place, you see the person needed to bring about the change, you study the person and discover what brings out what emotions from them, you implement. Done. 
4	Any type, any kind of person can be emotionally manipulative. I think ISTPs can be manipulative to achieve a self-serving end, but usually not with intent to hurt others, and for the most part are not very manipulative at all simply because straightforward Doing usually produces better results. \n\nPassive aggression doesn’t tend to be associated with ISTPs, but I think some behaviors can be seen as manipulative because saying or doing certain things wouldn’t affect an ISTP very much, but might read very differently to someone else, and we tend to assume other people approach the world the way we do (though to be fair, I think that’s a tendency that’s common across all people)
4	Took a few therapy classes. I can manipulate emotions pretty well. And make someone feel like deep horse shit if I wanted to.
2	I wouldn't think so.
1	I know I could manipulate my ISTJ mother, but I don't do it. Everyone else, idk, haven't tried, maybe I could but I'm so withdrawn they would probably notice something's off.
1	Depends on how you mean. I don't compliment or criticize people to get them to do stuff for me. If I'm complimenting someone it is either deserved, or it is partially deserved and I believe the ego boost will give them to confidence to achieve the potential I see in them.\n\nLikewise, if I am critiquing someone it is because it is the truth and I think they need to hear it, typically because if they continue on their current path they either are doing or will do harm to themsleves or others. Though I will dress someone down completely if they are being an arrogant prick, trying to manipulate others and/or me, or being abusive of their power/authority.
1	Yes. Because we don't take feeling into acount in relationships, we tend to use feelings to get this and that, Or at least this is the impression we are conveing on ppl that don't understand us.
32	Anyone else have very few close friendships and too many acquaintances?	Making my first ever post on this subreddit.\n\nOut of the 100+ people I've met / spoken to in my life (I'm 19), I only feel truly understood by and feel connected to two people. These couple of friends I consider my closest friends. I'm also not "out of sight out of mind". Even when we're far away, I'll skype my closest friends once a month to stay in touch. Everyone else I know I consider acquaintances; I simply do things of common interest with them. I know that after whatever shared activity ends, I'll probably stop talking to them. I don't feel the need to meet up with or talk to anyone else, since I can't fully relate to them. To me, someone's either my best friend or an acquaintance, even if they see me as a good friend. Any other ISTP's like this?
26	That’s pretty much my life. I may casually refer to someone as a friend but they are in fact an acquaintance. The ability to differentiate is a talent istps need to learn to have a rewarding life.\n\nSociety is all about friendships. ISTPs are all about having no enemies and a couple friends.
3	That is exactly how I am as well. I actually blatantly call people acquaintances even when we've spent a lot of time (months, years etc) together if I know I won't be keeping in touch after the shared activity ends. I'm pretty honest to them about this and most people don't seem to mind. Others think I'm kidding. 
4	Describes me perfectly.  I've got 2 very close friends that I've known for over 5 years, everyone else comes and goes and once we stop seeing each other every day for work or whatnot I just don't maintain it.
5	No matter your type, regardless of how introverted or extraverted, nobody has more than a few close friends. If you're terribly closed up, you may have none.
6	I have four closest friends. The rest are fans. 
3	As an intj, I've experienced the same thing.  I often feel like a loner or someone who floats between several different circles and it's not that I don't get along with people I get along with them just fine, but I'm not often not part of that inner circle.  Always on the out edge, rarely on the inside.
3	Yes. I have 2 friends, they don't know each other but know of each other's existence. One of them is my best friend, I trust her completely. We can go months (like 3, not so much) without talking to each other and when we meet again everything's as usual. I don't interact with her very often because most days I have nothing relevant to share. I do have hobbies and go places but I'm usually working towards something or just thinking about stuff, I'm very solitary because otherwise I'm just hanging-out doing nothing. Meeting my friend is something unscheduled and special. That's why I doubt I could be in a romantic relationship lol. Everyone else, I interact with them out of necessity or because they happen to be in the same place I am attending. Some people seem to like me and I'm friendly with them but it's very rare that "click" with someone, most people are temporary in whatever context I'm in.
2	You don't want your life to be intertwined with 10 other people. People suck and have a tendency to fuck their lives over. I'll give you an example. \n\nMy girlfriend and I had a close couple friend. They broke up recently. They broke up because the girl accused the boyfriend of being abusive. The girl however is a complete pain in the ass and everything is about her. She accused him of being abusive after he broke up with her. I know how the girl is because I've known her for 6 years, 3 years longer than I've known the guy. She is super manipulative. I was forced to drop him as a friend because my girlfriend was upset I'm still associating with someone who was accused of that. He wasn't the closest friend but half way there. \n\nThat's why it's good.to have one or two close friends. 
2	Estj with istp	Dating for 4 years, I live st his place on weekends. Since some health issues I lived there for last two months.  He's doing better now so I asked whst he would like me to do move in or not. As usual he made some joke and never answered, so I asked again very directly, no answer , wanted to know what I would do with my stuff.  So I moved back to my pksce.  I later hear from a mutual friend he knows I want him to ask me to move in.  Well yes I do! Its his place, sure I could stop renting and move myself right in, but that's not how I work.  So here is the wierd part, he wants to buy a cabin for us to go to when we feel like it, so why am I renting????  Also we are older I'm 56 he's 66.  We are not young and naive. But I can not get an answer from him. I even said I think I keep my place for a safety net for him, he just laughed.  I totally get the istp but this has me confused.  
23	If I still struggle with commitment at age 66, just fucking shoot me.
11	I don’t know where to start.
4	Yeah just shoot me sums it up LOL. Yes he was married for 18 years and she did him and his entire family really wrong then he lived with a gal for 16 years and that went really bad too but like everybody says I am nothing like anybody he's ever dated and we do have a blast together. A matter of fact he constantly telling me to go with him to everything he wants to go do. We're both very adventurous and have a lot of fun. I know that about the istp that they need their space so I do purposely give him that. I get the impression that if I canceled my lease and moved in he would be fine with that, but I wouldn't be I told him that I would prefer him to be the man in this relationship and to make a decision about our relationship.
2	Well, he’s being confusing. \n\nThat would irritate the hell out of me. \n\nI dated an ESTJ for six months or so, and clear communication was the least of our worries. \n\nHas he had little relationship experience, or perhaps something long-term that wasn’t healthy in the past?
2	I was more happier seeing my last gf 3 times a week instead of living with her everyday. ISTP's need plenty of space. 
15	Over analyzing/over thinking?	I find that I almost always over think or over analyze EVERYTHING. Which is probly why I have had anxiety issues m whole life\n\nMy question is, is this an istp thing? Does anyone else do it? Any advice to not do it lol? \n\nThanks guys I love this community!
8	Yea... specially when on Reddit :B. Maybe do something Se related, something that doesn't involve formulating thoughts using words. Such as cooking, working-out, cleaning, building something, painting, playing a videogame, etc.
8	I have it too. I've been thinking about that a lot. Some people can just make a choice right away but I can't. I need to analyze everything. I'm not talking about small stuff but every thing that is more than 50$ i'll overthink. I'm the guy that will watch 50 youtube video before I purchase a phone, for example.\n\nI'm what Barry Schwartz calls a "Maximizer". You should read the book "The paradox of choice" it's very good at defining maximizers and satisfisers. I don't know if it's an ISTP thing tho.
3	Yea I used to do it a lot, I still do it but I believe it’s gotten a lot better.   \n\nThe question I had to answer for myself has been “Why do I overanalyze ? What do I gain through overanalyzing ? “    \nWhat I found was that it was about having some sense of control.   \nThrough analyzing, I was making sure the outcome was the outcome I wanted.   \nIf I didn’t analyze everything, I felt like I had no control over the outcome and I had this feeling of being completely lost, as if I had lost ALL sort of control I had over the outcome. And I think that, like you, that prompted anxiety.   \n\nBut the anxiety really came from me not trusting myself to improvise, to react to my environment when I couldn’t control, or at least understand every variable there was, so it was really hard for me to loosen up and not analyze everything.   \nWhat kinda solved it for me was realizing that losing control isn’t losing control of everything. Loosening up isn’t letting every variable go completely unchecked. You CAN only control what needs to be controlled, and let go of what’s really not important. It’s about recognizing what you should analyze and what you really don’t need to. When you’ve assessed what you need to control, the anxiety goes away, because instead of wondering whether you’ve got everything checked, you KNOW you have under control everything that needs to be, and the rest really doesn’t matter. This peace of mind lets you then improvise and trust your instincts without any pressure, and that voice saying “dude what if you fail “ just doesn’t matter anymore, and then goes away once you get used to it.   
2	No. I've gained a lot data and information which enables my intuition to short circuit a lot of thinking and give me the answer I need. Granted, this doesn't always work. Tasks which I have no experience with, or at least are dissimilar enough from tasks in a related realm, still requires a lot of thinking to parse through. It's helpful to have a goal/parameter in mind, otherwise you're just doing a lot of thinking for naught.
1	Definitely. \n\nI'm not over it myself, so I can't offer much advice on how to not do it. But I've found that if I overthink and overanalyze why _I shouldn't be overthinking and overanalyzing_, then I eventually come to a conclusion about whatever it is and put my mind to rest. That makes no sense, I know, but say X event happens: First I'll overanalyze everything about that event, but then I'll try to stop myself by overthinking why I shouldn't be worrying about it so much... like, "x event doesn't really matter because of x2, y, and z."\n\nAlright, that made no sense. Ignore all of that lol. 
1	You over analyse for the same reasons you are anxious.  Anxiety doesn't cause the over analysis.  You seem young af, so it's probably more about that than anything else.  When you stop worrying about being perfect, you'll probably stop being anxious.\n\nAll Ti doms "over analyse," but only those who can't accept themselves feel anxiety because of it.  Your analysis is just enhancing your anxieties by covertly seeking out your own biases to reinforce said anxieties.  Se is the path to fixing this issue.
6	How was your childhood like? How did it help shape your Ti and Se functions?	My father is a Marxist scholar, an ISTJ, and also a farmer. ISTJ’s perfectionism at detail-level was the bane of my childhood. He hated me when I lied (even if it’s simple omission of fact) or when my answers weren’t precise and consistent. My childhood was spend either at home reading books and/or following what he wanted me to do, or I was exploring our farm,  doing task experiments (e.g. building fences, chicken houses, breaking logs) or simply being on my own...\n
11	Alcoholic father; bi-polar mother. \n\n\nI spent a lot of time outside building forts, hideouts and on one occasion, when I was 5 or so, tried to build my own home, so I could move out. Help was either unreliable or came with guilt for burdening others.\n\n\nAs an adult, I now own a business that I built from nothing and am saving/dreaming of owning land for a self sufficient homestead. \n\n\nI learned not to rely on or trust others. It's a double edge sword that's led to success and loneliness. \n\n
3	Mum and dad are INFP and ENTJ respectively. I have 7 other siblings, grew up not giving a fuck about attention and just did my own shit in quiet. Guess that’s where Ti came in because quickly I realised it’s better to shut the fuck up when you have nothing better to say or if you have cool ideas and shit because nobody is listening and if they are, they really don’t give a fuck.\n\nDon’t think anybody other than my youngest Brother uses Ti (I’m thinking he’s an ISTP like me or at least an INTP). But I think I developed Se because I was pretty close(ish) to my dad, and man his Se was legit. He likes to get down and dirty to fix shit, and doesn’t call in contractors to do a job he can do (like plumbing etc.) And through that, I am the only Son who isn’t afraid to get soaked in dirty just to fix a problem at home, man honestly I’d go all out more so than my dad.
4	Nothing special, religious upbringring, no Ti users around me, bullying (I thought I was stupid and helpless for the longest part of my childhood). I had to build opinions and grow my cognitive functions on my own really
3	Also grew up with an alcoholic dad and emotional mother. They did everything to try and provide for me but couldn't protect me from their own flaws. Dad was a blue collar worker, taught me how to work with my hands, but was always drunk and erratic when he wasn't working. Mom didn't work, spent most of her time caring for us, but would use weaponized emotion, was judgmental, and incredibly overbearing.\n\nI loved playing growing up, would always be skateboarding, biking, swimming, drawing, taking things apart, or playing video games. Made friends naturally, would always be joking around and playing pranks. I would constantly get in trouble at school, got poor grades because class was boring, and would get harshly judged and punished at home.\n\nStarted high school and tried to stay out of trouble but basically shut down emotionally. Thinking went into overdrive and I tried to walk on eggshells. Kept my mouth shut to stay out of trouble, stopped telling jokes, became incredibly introverted, anxious, and depressed. Seeked pleasure through video games, alone time, and weed.\n\nGraduated high school and made good friends while doing thrill-seeking hobbies in college. Managed to find my emotions again and an idea of happiness. Now I'm hanging out with friends often, actually talking to women, and looking forward to moving out so I can start the next chapter in my life.
2	My dad is an ISTJ schizoid and my mom is a borderline ESTJ. I don't like armchair diagnosing but that's the best description I've got. He was just there, while my mom was very authoritarian and emotionally insecure.\n\nI've been working a lot lately to get over trauma associated to an emotionally unstable/neglective home environment. Building up a narrative of my childhood and seeing how it has affected the person I am today has done wonders to my self-compassion and overall mental health. I have some good book recommendations if anyone are interested. 
1	Father died when I was 1.\n\nOnly one parent, no siblings close to my age since big sis had moved out, bullied at kindergarten and school.\n\n
1	My dad's a borderline sociopath, only undiagnosed because he was a minor at the time, and my mother is a narcissist with a real talent for manipulation. Always have to keep things very logical and fact-oriented to explain my actions to them. They'll both spot and point out any flaw in my explanation so I have to keep everything in line in my head before they confront me about it. \n\nMy dad is very outdoorsy, and since he was the parent I preferred to be around I got quite a lot of development there, but that stopped when I was about eight. Developed it on my own since then, as an attempt at independence. I go out running to get out of the house and have been doing this for years. 
1	Normal parents. I'm only child, so not really many people in the house. 
15	Tips for ISFJ(F) living with ISTP(M)?	ISFJ woman here. Have hit a rough patch with my live-in ISTP partner.\n\n**The rundown:**\n\nMoved in with partner three months ago. We established a great friendship prior to dating seriously (i.e. we were good friends about a year before becoming exclusive; in total, have known each other over two years). Happy to be sharing a space with him, but going through some growing pains—some expected, some unexpected.\n\n**What I want to know:**\n\n* What makes ISTP happy when sharing space with a SO, and how do I go about making sure he feels considered?\n* How much space does ISTP need? Although my partner’s primary love languages are touch and quality time, I sometimes feel like I’m invading his solitude.\n* What cues should I look for when ISTP just need to be left alone? Additionally, when it seems like ISTP is in a bad mood and/or possibly upset about something that *I* have done, should they be approached or should I allow them to come to me when they’re ready/if they find it necessary to talk? I find that sometimes if I don’t say anything, nothing is said at all, which is frustrating.\n* Is it normal for ISTP to text a single friend of the opposite sex frequently throughout the day and late into the night, particularly if they’re generally not someone who likes to text most people?\n   * *Note:* *I don’t question my ISTP and he doesn’t question me. We’re both independent and understanding of each other’s independence, and we appreciate that about and encourage it for one another. But thanks to unfaithful partners I’ve dated in the past, this has admittedly been a point of contention for me as of late (she’s a friend from his past that recently popped back up, and other than her being a mutual of his and his best friend’s I don’t know much else about her). Haven’t addressed it because I don’t want to create a problem where there isn’t one. He’s generally very honest, sometimes brutally so.*\n* When upset by ISTP’s actions (e.g. they did something, most times passively, that I find to be hurtful or offensive), what is the best way to go about communicating this so that ISTP understands why I’m upset?\n\nI find it especially challenging to express my grievances to my partner in a way that he is able to understand the reason behind how he's made me feel. This usually evokes a dismissive response on his part (it seems that if he can’t find the logic in my being upset or if my reason for being upset doesn’t align with his principles, it’s not worth discussing/finding a solution to the problem, and he becomes frustrated). I chalk this up to me be a very emotive person and him, as he has vocalized, not dealing well with others’ emotions. This has been the biggest challenge since moving in, and it’s admittedly caused a few arguments and hurt feelings on both ends. I feel like I’ve made an honest effort to adjust to his needs, but he hasn’t done the same for me emotionally.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nI want to figure out how to re-establish the harmony we had before moving in together, but it’s been tricky… and admittedly tiring for both of us. However, both of us have communicated to one another that we want to work through this rough patch and continue to learn about each other and ourselves. We love each other very much and still have a great time together.\n\nAdvice?\n\n**TL;DR** \- What are some tips for living happily with an ISTP partner?

13	An ISTP definitely needs solitude. He will definitely have a hobby that he enjoys greatly, whether it be video games, sport, working out, music, fixing things, etc. Don't get upset at them if they won't part from it. However, ISTPs love to be physically intimate with you. He would stop what he was doing if you wanted to be pleased. Same if you have a problem that you need help with. Personally, these two requests are music to my ears and reinforce my love for you. If you are stingy in that regard don't be surprised if he resorts to porn or even being unfaithful. Unless they are really good friends, it's not likely for an ISTP to spend a lot of time texting people. They would rather be working on their hobbies, so I don't know what's up there. But if he is still bubbly around you, chances are he still loves you and there's nothing to worry about.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBecause ISTP has Ti ego and inferior Fe you will need to realize that he may say some insensitive things at times and probably won't be aware of your needs. It's probably a good thing for an ISTP to be with or live with a strong Fe user because it helps them to [mature and start to value their Fe](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119940701537/mbti-development-istp). Also, Si users tend to have a very traditional twist to Fe. The ISFJ will often compare the ISTP to past boyfriends or male family members, if there were any, and expect the ISTP to act in similar ways. Don't be upset if they don't. On the other hand, you could learn a thing or two from the ISTP about making more logical decisions. You WILL have a few fights with him, but it will help you both grow as people.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUsually the ISTP doesn't hold onto anger very much. Give them a day and they'll have forgotten what the fight was about. No need to worry about confronting them unless you keep fighting about the same thing. Just be understanding with each other and be aware of each other's strengths and weaknesses. Don't criticize the weaknesses too much but praise the strengths often. Because you are both Fe users, you both like it when you are appreciated.
9	ISFJ married to an ISTP. My love for him has never faltered and he is by far the most awesome person I have ever cohabitated with. \n\nOverall I hold ISTPs in high esteem. I strongly recommend, if you haven't yet, reading the *ISTP Care And Handling User Guide And Manual.* It helped me understand my partner a lot even though I've personally known him for sixteen years. \n\nPer my ISTP (I asked him the questions in your post):\n\n* *1. What makes an ISTP happy when sharing space?*\nDon't move his stuff. He probably has a mental map of where all his stuff is and respecting this is an easy way to avoid conflict. Also, don't put your stuff in his designated areas. "Do not disturb the sanctity of his workspace".\n\n* *2. How much "space" does he need?*\nAs a couple we work different hours (he's full time nights and I'm days during the week) and the answer I got was "I have all the space I need. If I need alone time, I tell you". There's really no guess work for me. When he works on his hobbies or listens to podcasts, I don't bother him. When he says "come to bed", I join him. \n\n* *3. Cues for when an ISTP wants to be left alone?*\nAnswer from mine:"I'll let you know". Also, if he's focusing on something and gives a short answer, that's a cue to stop talking. \nFor the second part, if mine is upset at something I've done, I can't force him to open up. He will do that on his own. Sometimes it takes hours and it's awkward but I can't force him to talk. His response "You cant force an ISTP to do anything. They'll just dig in their heels more". \n\n* *4.Texting* \nI don't have an answer for you, sorry. My ISTP doesn't text many friends, only when he needs to tell them something. \n\n* *5. How to tell him you're upset*\nWhen I'm upset by my ISTP's actions, he can tell (facial expressions, lack of affection, how I carry myself) and asks me outright if I'm ok. He wants me to talk to him in the most matter of fact way possible and also, I need to keep feelings out of the conversation, "It's not that I'm incapable of dealing with other people's emotions, it's just why should I have to, they're not mine". The way he sees it, people are responsible for their own emotions. \nI also keep my complaints it as short as I can. To him I sometimes talk too much, "Sometimes you keep going even when you got your point across 15 minutes ago". \n\nHope this helps! \n\n\n    \n
2	I know I have a tendency to assume other people put as much stock in their feelings as I do (that is, not very much at all), so explicitly say to him that his dismissing you is hurtful, and give concrete examples of when he does it, how you interpret it, and what you'd like him to do or say instead. I think he'd appreciate the clear communication, and you can't count on ISTPs to intuit whatever hints you might be dropping. You /can/ generally expect em to be considerate of what they do know though. 
1	> I find it especially challenging to express my grievances to my partner in a way that he is able to understand the reason behind how he's made me feel. This usually evokes a dismissive response on his part (it seems that if he can’t find the logic in my being upset or if my reason for being upset doesn’t align with his principles, it’s not worth discussing/finding a solution to the problem, and he becomes frustrated).\n\nHaha this is spot on ISTP logic. Trying to explain how you feel to an ISTP is like trying to explain colors to a blindman. I imagine this is what conversations boil down to:\n\n**ISFJ**: This is how I feel\n\n**ISTP**: But why?\n\n**ISFJ**: It's just how I *feel*\n\n**ISTP**: Get over it/You're acting out of line/Hurts feelings more\n\nWe're problem solvers at our core, but when emotions get involved we shut off because we know there's no solution to changing how you feel. Whenever you get upset over something, try to think of the reasoning behind it and your desired resolution. Don't bring it up until you can think of a desired resolution because you may just be bringing it up to vent your feelings and it's frustrating for us because we can't give a solution. Then when you're ready, state the problem, briefly talk about how it made you feel and the reasoning behind it, then talk about a desired resolution. I think a conversation that would work on me would be something like this:\n\nISFJ: Hey ISTP, I'm not sure if you were joking, but when you said [offensive statement] it sounded like [reasoning behind your feelings] and hurt my feelings so I don't want to be told that anymore (desired resolution).
1	I've lived with my ISTP for about one and a half years, and we've been dating for over half that time. We spend a lot of time together, but I always try to give him personal space when he wants it. Often I don't need to leave the room if we're both doing our own thing. If he seems quieter than usual I just ask him if he's okay with me hanging out in the same area, and if not I let him come to me later. \n\nI'm always very upfront and blunt (but not accusatory) about any issues. I think he appreciates that I don't let things fester because he's more passive. I try to be mindful to when he needs adjustments from me that he's not voicing. Sometimes he'll very politely ask me for something and I know that means he needs it, and it's non-negotiable lmao. (Ex. "I love talking with you but I'm tired, can we talk about this more tomorrow?" = "Stop rambling and let me sleep.") I also try to ask why he's done things that have annoyed me instead of jumping to blame. Usually once I hear his response it seems reasonable and I'm no longer annoyed. However, he is also mature enough to listen to my points and not disregard my emotions. If you're presenting yourself reasonably and he still isn't listening, that sounds like an area he needs to grow in.\n\nI do think it's common for ISTPs to inadvertently offend people though. If something that he says or does can be taken multiple ways, try to step back from taking offense to see if there could be a benign or positive way to take it instead. Sometimes he might be the one that needs to adjust himself, but sometimes it will be your own reaction that needs adjustment.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't worry about the friend! It's a good sign that he can be close friends with women as well as men. If she's important to him I think it'd be normal for you to be interested in knowing more about her, or even meeting her. Once you know real details it will probably feel sillier to wonder about their friendship.
1	ISFJs are in "benefit" relations with ISTPs so you might want to read up about this relationship type:    \n[**ISTP relationships**](http://www.personalitycafe.com/istp-articles/110040-istp-relationship.html#post3833733) and [**ISFJ relationships**](http://www.personalitycafe.com/isfj-articles/285-love-types-isfj-5.html#post4235430) as well as about [**"cold-blooded" and "sincere" communication styles**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Communication_styles). \n\n> When upset by ISTP’s actions (e.g. they did something, most times passively, that I find to be hurtful or offensive), what is the best way to go about communicating this so that ISTP understands why I’m upset?   \n    \nTheir "dual" type the ENFJ blows up immediately, being extraverted Fe dom that has trouble keeping in emotions. This makes the ISTP not ignore them. For introverted feeling types like ISFJs and INFJs being in relations with an ISTP is difficult for that reason, because the strength of IxFJ emotions are not as much as that of ExFx types and it's not really conveyed in the same manner as for a Fe dom. IxFJs most often keep everything in and analyze their feelings and relationship in private, instead of extraverting what they feel on the spot. Eventually IxFJ types start feeling tired and worn out having to put extra effort into changing the ISTP's behavior, while the changes are minimal. Being psychologically primed for an ENFJ who have excessive emotions, the ISTP has be super-stable in his own emotions, level-headed, and more dispassionate, which why it's not easy to get across to them how you feel.    \n    \nWhat to do with this? Well there is nothing much you can do with regard to his type. If you *want* to be in a relationship with an ISTP, this is what you'll have to live with. You can study his type further to understand his needs, but ultimately there's always going to be the little bit of miscommunication and misplaced expectations there due to your types.
15	How do You know you've matured as an ISTP?	It's weekend, so I guess some ISTP comrades have time to seriously answer these things....\n\n1. State your age\n2. A major event in your life that triggered or got you thinking introspectively about yourself as a person\n3. What difficult side you have about yourself that you've somehow overcome?\n4. What advice would you have given to your younger self? \n\nYour thoughts are highly appreciated.
12	I'm 30 and I should have learned a trade. Student loans are a bitch.
10	When you stop over analyzing trivial things like this.
7	State your age:  51\n\nA major event in your life that triggered or got you thinking introspectively about yourself as a person: Hearing someone say, "Humans are not meant to be alone."\n\nWhat difficult side you have about yourself that you've somehow overcome?  Learned to disagree without coming off as arrogant.\n\nWhat advice would you have given to your younger self?  Lighten the fuck up.  Don't be a stick in the mud.  Stop being selfish and suck it up once in a while.
7	1.	18\n2.	getting out of an emotionally abusive relationship. i realized that it’s okay to reach out. it’s okay to accept things I don’t deserve. although we value self-sufficiency, it’s okay to rely on some people. just find the right people.  \n3.	i kinda got over social anxiety and general hatred of people. I’ve become good at asking good questions so that I don’t have to suffer through superficial conversations. i still hate talking to people but some people make it worth it. \n4.	advice: stop procrastinating in doing what you love. pursue projects you love making. it’s okay if you never finish anything. keep creating. keep working with your hands. 
6	1. 32\n2. divorce, then weed, then lsd, age 29\n3. how to put myself first.  i used to be an acrobat for the needs of others i found weak and needing of help.  it was bullshit.  help yourself.\n4. never get married, try weed at 25 rather than 29, and buy more crypto than you did
11	1. 15\n\nProbably haven't matured yet -- no point in answering the other three questions lol. 
3	* Age: 18\n\n* Traumatic Event: My grandmother who was and still is the most kind and helpful person I've ever known dying this Christmas \n\n* Personal Issue: Thinking that I'm above everyone intellectually and that other people, especially classmates were just dumb and "mainstream", thus not being worthy of my respect.\n\n* Method of Change: \n\nI had chatted a little bit with a girl in my class before Christmas and it turned out we both lik the show Black Mirror. I had a spare copy of Orwell's 1984, similar theme as the show, lying around so I borrowed it to her and she really liked it. \n\n\nChristmas break passes and it's her birthday in mid January. I decided to give her a birthday present in the form of another book by Orwell (Animal Farm).\nShe's very surprised to get a gift from the grumpy cunt of the class and also very happy.\n\n\nWhen I realised that I could make a positive impact on those around me and that it made me happy as well, I started being nicer overall. Even made a few friends.\n\n* Advice to little me: \n\nOther people have qualities that you might not see at first, don't judge them instantly. \n\n\n\n
2	49\n\nNever happened\n\nCan’t communicate with women. Still working to overcome, but maybe a little bit better.\n\nNever get married
2	[deleted]
2	1. Early twenties\n2. When I was 15 a girl I really liked said yes to going out with me and then the next day I woke up to a message that said she changed her mind. Basically, I got rejected in the worst way possible. Even though it wasn't that bad, ever since then I've had depression and my Ti-Ni loop began.  \n3. Ever since learning about typology I have realized that I've been in the [Fe grip](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/135002965032/how-functions-work-inferior-fe-istpintp). I was that little kid that got upset when he was killed in a video game, I'd often get so worked up if someone was trolling me on the comments section. Over time I have stopped using Ti immaturely and stopped repressing my Fe and actually started becoming more aware of the social situation. I have actually started live streaming for the sake of improving this part of me that I suck at and I have learnt how to treat my family and friends with less criticism and more "fakeness". I have learnt of the value of Fe.  \n4. My advice to my younger self would have been to realize that nothing matters. The world is your oyster. Do what you want and not what the external world expects of you. Don't be scared of trying new things and going against the grain. YOLO
2	* 22, almost 23\n* Graduating with my master's degree and thinking about how much I have changed as a person in the last 5 years. Looking at what I prioritize, how a now tackle problems, and how I have learned to let my insecurities go/work in them to improve. \n* I learned I do feel and have emotions, they just manifest physically rather than a feeling in my chest. I am not "broken" emotionally or a sociopath. Nervous is just when my whole body shakes and I start to sweat rather than feel butterflies. Just because I am a female doesn't mean I have to be a primary emotional being.  \n* Don't avoid pain or suffering. It makes you the person you are today and will make you a better person in the future. College and graduate school will be the easiest educational experiences of your life.
2	Thank you for this thread. I am very thankful for this sub. These stories of people with similar struggles and striving give me knowledge, hope and feeling my feelings 
2	33 male\n\n2/3. Getting sober at 21, started me on  a path of healing, a word I would have taken issue with up to that point. Lately it's been falling in love (and marrying my partner) and really letting my heart open to the world AND all the darkness that my love and relationship has been pulling up out of me. I feel like I've spent my life running from my personal truths mostly because I got caught up in my mind and confused the hell out of myself.\n\n4. Feelings are for feeling, the mind isn't much help with that. You'll never feel complete until you can accept the whole package of yourself, emotional, thinker, logical and loving. Also I love you.
2	To the title question: I stopped giving a shit about the expectations of other people, even those I care about (this might sound callous but at the end of the day it is your life and you are the one that has to live through it, so you might as well enjoy it - ask yourself the question, "What if I had to repeat every moment of my life exactly as it is/was, i.e. eternal recurrence?").\n\nJust because I'm intelligent doesn't mean I should be stuck in some BS, white-collar, "intellectual" job. I drink cider because it taste better than beer, and I'm the one paying for it. I eat what I want because I only eat one or two meals a day, I don't snack, I fast the rest of the day, and I workout.\n\nThe other questions:\n\n29\n\nI've always been introspective, no life altering event to really speak of other than losing my religion - but again that happened because I was introspective in the first place.\n\nInstead of trying (and mostly failing) to ignore my emotions, I embrace them. Not in some kind of showy, expressive way but with my Ti. I take a moment to identify the emotion, and what triggered it, I then adjust my response appropriately. This prevents me from belittling people that don't deserve to be belittled (somewhat - my wife says I still come across as a know-it-all sometimes).\n\nStop being Mormon the second you leave the house (go read some Philosophy Bro), start working out more seriously in high school, forget the other sports and just play ice hockey (its the only one you'll care about as an adult), you can still join the military but just enlist straight out of high school - do enough time to get the full GI Bill and then get out, get a degree in philosophy or criminal justice, get good grades, enjoy college, travel, graduate and join a large police department, ~~do your time~~ excel as a patrolman, stay in shape, and make SWAT.
2	i don't know if i've matured as an ISTP (i'm really young) but i think i'm getting there\n\n1. 21\n2. major depressive episode about 3 months ago, not the most major event in my life but the most recent\n3. i used to hold grudges, used to judge people, used to be so insecure and hold myself to such high standards. at the same time i was somewhat arrogant and blamed everyone else for my problems. i was resentful, ugly to myself and others, self-absorbed, and close-minded.\n4. learn to forgive. others and yourself. open yourself up to new experiences. try things you never considered. accept people, accept strangeness, accept awkwardness, anxiety, pain. life is a continuous learning process. there's no final boss and you can't "win" the game. it's about balance, love, acceptance, and forgiveness. and not even forgiveness for wrongs, but forgiveness for the silly things you hold against yourself. being wrong, making mistakes, failing. forgive and learn and move on.\n\nsometimes i think i've become an INTP. all my friends are Ns and they've really opened my eyes to the world in a way i can't really fully explain here.
1	1) 14\n2) when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes \n3)My ego and ignorance\n4) To expect the unexpected and whenever, be the unexpected. And to also rely on yourself and to choose who you trust with causation 
1	1. 16\n2. I don't think there was one major life event, i think it was more gradual\n3. Self-hatred, I've gotten a little better at avoiding that\n4. Stay away from (not saying names) and all the others around her, focus on bettering your social skills
1	1. 37\n\n2. A solo journey to New Zealand at 27, lasting 3 years, having to learn how to make it on my own, socially\n\n3. Shyness.\n\n4. It's more about *listening* than talking.
1	1. 24\n2. I developed a huge crush on this guy when I was 21. The main reason I liked him was because he came across so warm and genuine with his interest in people. While thinking feverishly about whether I was good enough for him or not I realized how much I push people away when I actually like them. So... with the power of puppy love I started to suppress my pride and actively show affection to people. Like, it used to be I couldn't say "I love you" out loud to my mom. Now I can and I do. I used to be really uncomfortable giving hugs, now it's no big deal.\n3. Guess I already answered this but to give another example, I used to have social anxiety in my teens. I don't anymore. Part of getting over it was just lots of socializing and part of it was learning to stop overthinking everything. It's funny because it's almost like I went back to the time when I was small and a bit too bold. I had to re-learn how to turn off all the intrusive thoughts like "Oh I'm not saying it right, I did something stupid again, this conversation is going really awkward, blah blah" and just focus on the moment and react naturally.\n4. To my high school and college self: take electives because they look fun, not because they make you look smart.
1	-19\n\n-Nothing did trigger me, it came really slowly, starting by watching some videos about politics, i've seen how easy it was to make people believe garbage and to manipulate  people emotionally, so i decided that i wanted to save my ass (and some other people's if i can) from this insanity by being financially independent.\nI watched videos about money, how to save, now i'm learning a bit about house-building from scratch and watching documentaries about these eco-houses...\nMy first final goal is not to have to work anymore, only eventualy for myself, to be totally free from exterior pressure. I want to be in control of my situation\n\n-My big problem is procrastination, i do useless things like playing video games or masterbaiting so i started nofap and i get motivated by other people, my big motivation is telling myself "i want to be a man" unlike what males tend to become these days, i also have some other big motivation but i keep it for myself.\n\n-I'm not sure because i don't think i'd listen to advice even from the futur me when i was young\n\nMaybe something like "come on, go outside and try to build a real shed in the woods" 
1	* 19\n\n* Had a variety of things happen in my life, can't pin point what exactly. All impacted me in different amounts. Can safely say my experiences gave me valuable life lessons I'll take with me for life though.\n\n* Being able to ask for help when you need it. Spent the majority of my life relying on myself, the thought of asking for external aid seemed ridiculous to me. Fortunately I have a select few people in my life who remind me I don't have to be "strong" all the time.\n\n* Still young but I'll give it a go. Hold on to that drive you have. Listen attentively to the people/things around you and continue to be the quiet observer you are. Don't neglect your emotions. They're more important than you think. \n\n\n
10	Would you rather be a Pirate or a Ninja?	As much as I'd love to be Pirate King, being a quiet assassin sound pretty dope too. I'm curious as to which faction ISTPs align themselves under in the Ninja-Pirate War
23	The sea is kind of boring and since there's nothing to do you'll probably have to socialize. There's no internet. Rather be a ninja.
14	Weeks at sea? Months at sea?\n\nNo thank you. Now if you are talking some sort of a Robinhood or Mad Max land pirate.... sign me up.
8	Ninja because the sea would get boring 
8	Ninja. Pirates are reckless fools who run around and make loud messes. Ninjas are decisive and they execute carefully calculated detail oriented plans. \n\n\nOne of those sounds way better suited to our style than the other lol. 
4	Pirate because rum. Too much work and dedication being a ninja.
4	Samurai
2	Ninja I guess. dc
3	Ninja without a doubt
3	Ninja because I get sea sick
3	I'd rather not be a swaggering, (and/or scurvy-afflicted) fat, and dirty drunkard on a poorly maintained and unsanitary ship with other swaggering, fat, and dirty drunkards. So, a ninja. 
3	Do vikings count as pirates, or at least part-time pirates? If they can be considered pirates, I'd choose to be a viking over a ninja. I'm definitely a controlled berserker (I only let loose when the situation becomes desperate) and raiding/discovering new places with moments of respite in between would really be exciting/interesting.
2	Ninja because the sea is fucking boring, also being sneaky is my thing.
1	What if you could be a ninja during peak ninja season (if there is one lol) and a pirate during peak sea booty season? But anyway, if I had to pick one I'd be a ninja because I'm a land lubber.
1	ninja.
1	Pirate minus the scurvy, seasickness, disease, battle amputations, and monotony
1	I'd rather be a gypsy. Gypsies always win.
7	Are all ISTP’s chronically late?	
47	Other way around, I'm always 10-15 minutes early.  \n\nGrowing up, my mom was chronically late to everything, and always laughed it off as just a fun personality quirk.  I hated it, and as soon as I was old enough to drive myself anywhere I made sure I was always on time.  
23	I wouldn't think so. I would think an ISTP it's both aware of the time, and of a reasonable estimation of travel time.\n\nAny fault in prioritising other obligations or activities over a future events leading to tardiness, I would think, isn't related to the factors that make one an ISTP.
56	I’m never late. I hate being late. \n\nWell, I’m late to things I care so little about that I would have skipped them if social pressure didn’t obligate me to be present.  But that’s probably partly intentional. 
14	I’m late to things I don’t care a lot about but if something’s important to me I’ll be early 
9	I am very punctual.\n\nI’m never late for work, and other than that I make very few appointments. 
15	Yeah I'm pretty much always late. It's not that I'm unaware of the time, like someone else said. I'm just late. Always.
4	I’m always early actually. 
5	No. I'm chronically exactly on time.
5	Never late. Normally early.
3	Only if I'm feeling low.
4	I show up about 15 mins early to just about everything. I hate things getting interrupted by people coming in late.
4	What?  I just got here.  What did i miss?
6	Yes, and no.\n\nI usually show up as late as I can get away with. School, work, whatever. People have told me that I need to get better with managing my time, but the thing is, I am managing my time. Why would I be somewhere I don't *have* to be if I could be somewhere I *want* to be? Give me a reason to be early and I will be, but otherwise expect me to be there last minute.
3	5 minutes early is 10 minutes late.
4	got ADD (actual diag, not self-diagged), i'm usually late, or just ditch whatever the hell i was suppoed to do unless my mind changes hours later, make up some bs excuse as to why i didn't go earlier, gotten really good at that
2	I'm on time or early if I care enough to be there, which is on rare occasions or if I'm meeting someone who's always early.
2	Before I started dating my wife, I was always early. 12 years into our marriage and I'm always late. 
2	I was always late, then a few years ago I needed a break from life and did three months solo backpacking.\n\nAfter that, friends and family noticed I was always on time. Kind of becomes habit when you need to be at the right place at the right time in order to get anywhere.\n\nBuilding habits seems to be the only way I end up consistently doing something.
2	I'm usually not, I'm usually really early. If I'm going to be late, I just won't go at all lmao
2	I absolutely hate being late to things. I'm always 10-15mins early to anything. I would say that in pretty good at keeping track of time and I like figuring out how long it will take be to get somewhere (cause traffic) so I can give myself buffer to be on time.
2	I'm literally always 25 minutes early to everything, on purpose.
1	It depends on what it's for. For classes I'm almost always at least five minutes early, though for work I'm usually anywhere from a few minutes early to a few minutes late.
1	I'm never late, nor ever too early.
1	A mix of the answers here. I hate being late but I still end up late tho
1	One hour early to everything
1	I'm usually late, and 95&#37; of the time it falls into two categories:  \n\nI underestimate the amount of stuff I have to do before I leave. Instead of leaving at the time I set out in my mind, when that time gets there I realize I have more stuff to get ready/do before I can go. Either that or I'll look at the clock earlier and be like "oh I have plenty of time" and just lounge around until the point where I have to start getting ready in order to leave on time, which is when the first part of what I said happens. It annoys me because I try so hard to plan out in my head exactly when I need to start getting ready, leave the house, etc.  \n\nI have a fear of arriving places early, before anything happens, because that's when it is the most awkward, or when you have to make small talk or just loiter around, which I hate doing.
1	For the thing I remember, I am very punctual. If I forgot about, expect anywhere from 15 mins - 1 week of being late.
1	My life mottos are “Always late but worth the wait” and “I’ll be late to my own funeral”
1	I am a hardass for being on time. If you aren't 5-10 minutes early, you are late. 
1	im usually not late. i dont really like it.
1	I'm late if it doesn't hurt to be late and I can use the extra time for something else. Although in our society it's rude to be late. Wish I live in Spain.
0	I know it depends on the person but generally because we have Se we end up so engrossed in the present moment, in what we are doing, that we often forget about the future and our Ni plans. Also, having poor Si means we aren't the best at remembering our to do list and we let things get out of hand. If you notice, we have P in our MBTI code which is often described as someone without much of a plan, someone who prefers flexibility rather than structure. J types have strong Ni and Si.  \nSPs and TPs are known to be lazier than other types due to the combination of Se/Ne and Ti/Fi. And it's made worse if the individual is depressed.  \nHere is some further reading: [Understanding ISTP "Laziness"](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/12/12/understanding-istp-laziness/)  \n[Celebok commentary](https://youtu.be/Dg0_uhJXioM)
0	10-15 minutes like clockwork
14	Learning to Trust Ni	Has anyone else run into a situtation where your first guess or instinct is the right one, but end up doing something else due to overthinking/lack of concrete data? I'd like to think that I have well developed Ni since my intuition is usually good, but damn do I always second guess it, which ends up biting me in the ass sometimes.
15	For the big decisions in life.. Trust your gut.\n\nThe one time I didn't.. I regret it to this day following advise of others.\n\nTrust your gut. 
10	It's not like our Ni is that bad. Even our Fe isn't that bad. We just tend to repress it for the sake of Ti logic. If you know an Se experience is pointless based on your Ni experiences/hunches then don't waste your time. Having Ni is such an amazing function at times. Same with Si.
2	Yeah happens all the time on tests. Pisses me off.
2	I've stopped doubting my hunches. If I get a sense about something, I go with what that sense tells me.
1	Oh for sure. I’ll give you an example.\n\nSo last year, I was going out with this ENTP guy who was cheating on his girlfriend with me. Except I didn’t know! So I ended it with him when I found out. Then I was like “Why do I have this feeling like this isn’t totally done yet?” I just had a feeling it would come back to bite me somehow. But that’s not enough evidence and I had no logical reason to think this. I wasn’t worried about it, but I did overthink it a tiny bit. Then I joined this club and all of his friends were in it. One of them knew. So it’s kind of like that. 
6	How can i improve from being ISTP ?	Hey everyone,\n\nI have tested myself many times and i am sure i'm an ISTP.\n\nWell the thing with me is i want to be more social in life, i'm 23 and till now i had no serious relationship till now. I mean girls seems interested in me but i was not. Now i want to be more social and make more female friends basically.\n\nFrom what people tell on internet, is going to some meetups or join any class or hobby which can find people like you. I live in very small city, and there aren't many meetups for IT related people. I don't know if i would go some random meetup then i would be able to make a conversation with other people or not but in case of IT or tech related i can keep on going. \n\nI have followed /r/socialskills for sometime and i know it is something which i need to improve myself and move out to different city, that's why i have thought of being digital nomad. It seems really tough in starting because i have kind of social anxiety, one of my university friend has also agreed to be digital nomad, so i guess it won't be that difficult now.\n\nNow the main thing, i know if i keep reading about ISTP then i will surely become more of like that, i do not want to like that, i want to be out of it, no offense guys about ISTP but i need to be more social, i think i can be more extrovert i can be really great at starting business and all. \n\nIn the past month i have made some really great friends online, mostly they are ENFJ, INFJ, ENTJ, and INFP, but i do not like INFP, i like to pursue them in starting but after some time they start giving me too much attention and which i don't like.\n\nI really want to make friends, both male and females, i have some really close friends from university and still in touch through whatsapp group, but they all are in different cities now. I think i am just being too picky about friends. \n\nAlso i have noticed one thing when in past one month when i starting chatting with different people that i sometimes end up hurting them or offending them, i don't really know why i do not understand from others point of view. Also i say sorry to them after that and apologize but that sorry never comes from my heart. I feel like they are the people who are doing it wrong and complaining to me. \n\nI want to hear your views guys, like what should i do more to be more social and make a better life after all ? I think hearing from other ISTP or people in MBTI gives me more better way to improve. 
10	Read about ESTPs and their main function, Se. Watch videos about ESTPs. Just pretend that you're ESTP and you're learning about yourself basically. In terms of not offending people, that's probably never going to end - just learn from experience. If you don't understand something about them, ask questions. Take interest in their perspective and try not to prioritize yours over theirs even if theirs sounds stupid.
6	Dont let this stuff define you.  We all have some of both types.  These are just PREFERENCES.  Theres no reason you can't work in your non-preferred types.   It's just not as comfortable to work in, that's all.  Pretty rare to change your type but you can become more comfortable working in a non-dominate type.  For me it got much easier as I got older too.\n\nHard to beat Meetups for low pressure social events.  Met my wife at one.  
5	 Hi, I hope you don't mind me interrupting the ISTP discussion hehe. Thank you for sharing your experience! The fact that you want to improve in itself is very encouraging tbh but I believe you can improve as an ISTP rather than "from" being one.  \nISTPs who develop their functions well are resourceful, smart and fun people who can perfectly be willing to adapt to any social situation.   \n\n\nEngaging with Se (as I see many ISTPs stated here) might be really helpful as it is, after all, your first way of interacting with the outside world!! Se is also about experiencing, so it might feel weird and awkward at first, but it will only get easier as you go along.   \nAlso, as you said, you already have some close friends, and made quite a few others this month, so you're more than capable of connecting with others!! You even said that you are interested in others now, when you weren't really before, so that's already some really cool improvement :)   \n\n\nEven if you offend other people at times... it's not what you meant to do, right? Everyone is different, we all have our own experience and degree of sensitivity, so we do not have the same reactions to most things. That's why some people get hurt in situations where you would not have been. Also, those people may also be getting offended because they do not really know you well yet, so they are not aware that you do not mean it in a bad way. If they did, they might not even bat an eye because it's you. Of course, even if they know, some will still easily be hurt, because that's not what they're used to. But I think that if you're open about the fact that you meant no harm, most people will understand. Adapting to others, no matter how different they are, is quite a challenge, but it's totally something ISTPs can do. You don't have to get along with everyone \- and it's probably impossible \- but if you stay open to the possibility, it will come to you more and more easily as time goes by.  \n\n\nIt's a good advice to basically... go out there and do things (new things as well) that you think might be fun. You can meet people anywhere; you don't even have to think too much about whether or not there is a special place to meet people "like you", just focus on stuff you might enjoy. It's easier to connect with others over something that's fun for both you and them, even if they are a bit different from you. This way, you'll feel at ease quicker and will be able to make good use of your humour and all that! Random example of an activity that's good for that: a sports team, or stuff like this \- not saying you have to get into volleyball or anything though but you see what I mean ahah   \n\n\nYour decision to become a digital nomad is really cool as well! If you ever feel stuck somewhere, it's important not to hesitate to move forward hehe. Also, that way, you will be able to meet plenty of people \- some you'll feel nothing for, some you might even dislike, and some you might actually get pretty close to. I think that, as introverts, the best way for us to improve is to learn from others tbh  \n\n\nWell, this got long... feel free to kick my sorry ass! I was wondering, though, what is it that got you to feel this strong need to improve? Did something happen in particular or did you simply have enough?  
2	Yeah I experience the same stuff as you. We're going to offend more people compared to other types because we are natural assholes, but like others said, focus more on Se function instead of Ti and Ni when you're in a social situation. I know that I, personally, don't care for much about other people's bullshit but sometimes we kind of have to in order to make friends - at least to get past the "stranger" phase into at least "acquaintance" phase. Don't get too worried about being denied, everyone has to deal with it.
1	I was sociophobe when a was 20. So I solved it with a lot of practice with people. Let's say you always start from dirty experience (in terms of mistakes). You communicate with people day by day every evening. And you shouldn't just communicate with them but experiment using different approaches, your inner intuition says you. Sometimes you would intentionally spoil communication, that's okay you should do a lot of mistakes before you understand how exactly to communicate. \n\nAfter 30 or 40 spoiled contacts you learn better approaches. The best inner attitude to socializing is "run..shoot..run". So If you couldn't go along with someone, just leave it and go to the next position, it sounds harsh I know, but that is the only way to gain experience. \n\nAlso I would recommend you to look through this (it is classics of pick\-up, but it is not only about it, it is also about communication in general, with people in general, not only women) . Pay attention to social games people play. \n\n[https://conquistaperfeita.com/wp\-content/uploads/2016/06/The\-Mystery\-Method\-How\-to\-Get\-Beautiful\-Women\-Into\-Bed.pdf](https://conquistaperfeita.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Mystery-Method-How-to-Get-Beautiful-Women-Into-Bed.pdf)
2	> Now the main thing, i know if i keep reading about ISTP then i will surely become more of like that, i do not want to like that, i want to be out of it, no offense guys about ISTP **but i need to be more social**  \n   \nYou sound more like an ESFJ male who has mistyped being an ISTP, which hey happens for SF guys wanting to pose as logical, but your whole thing of "I want to be more social" and "I don't relate to typical ISTP things" gives you out.
5	Offer IT services for free. Everyone will wanna be your friend. Done. \nAs for changing from ISTP, just take the MBTI tests again, but change your answers to fit that of ESTP. You will automatically become an ESTP. 
1	Identity isn't something set in stone like this sub would have you believe. I've just stumbled here through the random button, so I don't know how strongly you all buy into it, but you can always be the kind of person you want to be - sometimes it might be a struggle to improve yourself and meet your own standards, but it's never impossible.
1	Oh boy. This is a lot. Not sure I completely understood everything you were getting at, what issue it is and therefore how it can be solved, but it feels like you're coming at a lot of your problems from a perspective that's only gonna hurt you, or make it harder than it has to be. Other things just seem like you haven't developed or you're having trouble understanding, and you may need to take time to gain that understanding and wrestle with it for a while. \n\nTwo things I do feel would help you to understand though.\n\n* Don't try to become someone else. Become a better You instead. \n\nIt feels a little like you're saying that ISTP is almost like. Some First Stage of development, and to become another type, become extraverted, or something along those lines, would be to Develop or, advance. And that's not true. \n\nYou don't have to become someone or something else entirely, and chances are, you'll have a hard time trying. And there's little reason to. It's perfectly possible to be an ISTP and still be happy, successful, and social. \n\nI and a select few other special fuckers on these forums can sometimes be seen screaming "I'm not an extrovert you fool, you fucking *philistine*. I am simply outgoing, although still an introvert!" and it's.... actually true. At least in my view. You can be plenty social, enjoy others presence, and want to have a large community or group of people and friends who like you, and that's completely normal. Everyone wants that, not just introverts. Extroverts just tend to have an easier inclination towards how to go about it better than introverts do. \n\nISTP are perfectly capable of being social and outgoing in their own ways, more so than other introverted types. Form those ways instead of trying to change yourself entirely. Adapt different strategies and coping mechanisms. For being social that work to you and your personality.  \n\nThere are a LOT of facets to socializing and making friends, and yes, going out to places where people with your interests will be around is a great strategy, I'm sure there are IT conventions or other things around for IT if you look a little harder for them. If they really don't exist, try looking for a convention or gathering or community for a different interest. \n\n* *" i don't really know why i do not understand from others point of view. Also i say sorry to them after that and apologize but that sorry never comes from my heart. I feel like they are the people who are doing it wrong and complaining to me. "*\n\nShould be obvious to you already, but work on this. Think about people. Think about how they work. Think about their opinions, why they have them, make a genuine effort to understand others even if it doesn't make sense or bores you. MBTI is and continues to be very helpful to people here for this exact purpose, so you already have a tool to help you with it.  But understanding others and holding an interest in them is pretty crucial to making friends. \n\nAlso understand that when someone is hurt, or offended, that is something they decide, not you. Like it or not, you do not get to dictate anyones feelings, so you cannot decide whether or not someone gets hurt. Whether or not the hurt is reasonable doesn't really matter because feelings don't ever follow reason anyway, now does it? The best thing you can do is always try to be understanding and apologize anyway. Apologize because it hurts no one and can only help, and it's a good habit to have. Then just be respectful of whatever decision the other person may make about you. \n\nThis should jump out at you as really important if you seriously want to be better about socializing and making lots of friends. How can you hope to be liked and understood by many if you yourself are not willing to offer the same thing?\n\n* Honestly over all you just sound really young and inexperienced. Take time to get some kind of income and get some independence and just explore yourself and the world. Try different things, learn and listen to others. 
1	I like to see people as meatbags with rational and emotional, crappily written functions. Its just like IT, really. Get in front of a mirror, practise body language until it seems to be genuine. Smile a lot. Then go to istp wikia and read the istp Manual, it helped me a lot. If you give critique, do it friendly, higher pitched voice and smiling. If you have nothing useful or positive to say, dont say it. If you roast someone, dont apologize or take it back, they have to understand that an ISTP gives no fuck. If you are not sure what to do, dont start laughing. I made the experience that it is not socially accepted to laugh when people tell you your grandparents died.

Then he cast aside his shield, and wielded an axe two-handed; and it is sung that the axe smoked in the black blood of the troll-guard of Gothmog until it withered, and each time that he slew Húrin cried: ‘Aurë entuluva! Day shall come again!’ Seventy times he uttered that cry; but they took him at last alive, by the command of Morgoth, for the Orcs grappled him with their hands, which clung to him still though he hewed off their arms; and ever their numbers were renewed, until at last he fell buried beneath them.”\n\n- JRR Tolkien, all taken from The Silmarillion \n\nLike with all Tolkien, it's very long and winded, but delivers a very good message when pieced together.

9	Your Most Fucked Up Job Experience	Whether it be customer service/dealing with unholy customers, or working with a boss or co\-workers themselves\-\- Whats your worst experience with any job?\n\nI just had what I'm sure is my worst so far and I wanna feel a little less like the world is ending.\n\n>!Company that I'd idolized for years since it appeared hired me, then fired me illegally after two months in the middle of work week (in other words, they still had me scheduled for more work when it happened), wouldn't tell me the reason why, was very vague and shady, right after one co\-worker snapped at me over a misunderstanding.

10	Working food service fuckin sux. I worked at an ice cream shop that had a drive-thru so you would have to help people in front AND cars in the drive-thru. To top it off my boss was a cheapass and would only schedule one person at time. You would pray that a customer didn't order a custom cake because that would take 15+ minutes. It was like getting gangbanged in two holes and you had to force a smile.\n\nIt was the most stressful job ever. Had nightmares of customers yelling for me to hurry up, developed a nervous tick, and picked up drinking and smoking. Even thinking about it now made me nervous.

I see this one dood who has his computer positioned away from the front desk so I path around to avoid his sight. I go up behind him and I see him beating off to some hentai porno, balls out and everything. I give him this blank stare like wtf. Guy turns around, face stunned and pants shitted. I'm laughing inside. I tell him, "uhh, you're not supposed to be doing this here." I just write him up and he gets banned. \n\nEDIT: I forgot, I also had to disinfect the whole work station and around it because no one knew if he splurged anywhere. This wasn't his first time acting sketchy.
7	I used to be a cashier at a grocery store back in highschool. This old woman pays for her $6 purchase with 10 loonies (In Canada a loonie is a $1 coin. So she gave me 10 coins each worth $1 when she just could have given me 6) so I said “Your purchase is only $6, so I’ll give you these 4 back or else it’ll just be change anyways.” I said it politely. She got really mad at me and started screaming at me and telling me to go back to school and that I was an idiot. She went to the manager and asked “What kind of people do you hire here?” And then the other people in the line up were trying to explain to her that she gave me too much money. But she didn’t care. She told me I was stupid and didn’t deserve this job. I was honestly trying not to laugh at her. 
5	Cutting cheese at a pizza place. It was repetitive and coworkers were dumb af and spoke about whom they've banged, where and how. That's why I attend college.
4	About 2 years ago I was an intern at a pet supply shop. One day a really posh lady and her chihuahua walk in. I greeted her and went on with my work (it was a really busy day). about 5 minutes later she walks up to me and says her dog took a shit on the floor and immediately she walks out of the store. I had to look 15 minutes for that bloody turd and clean it up.
5	I've worked for 34 years now.  I have worked at varying capacities. \n\nThe worst job was the one that made me question my health and sanity due to working for an inept manager (I suspect not very bright), who had made at least 6 employees break out in tears over fictional claims or blaming other's shit work on you.\n\nAny complaints and next thing you know, hours are cut.\nIt was a true meat grinder, so much so that most would churn out in 3 months.\nThe inept store manager kept this going. \n\nI've done dirtier jobs, harder jobs and some that just were not the right fit... but in my whole  resume of work  that's the job no one deserves.\n\n
1	The job before this one, my director told me to quit or he'll "make things hard for me".\n\nI got fired once from a bakery after 2 shifts because, as the manager said to me, it was clearly "too fast paced" for me.\n\nThe worst one I guess would be a long time ago I was a 'part-time carer' for a partially sighted lady, which entailed me cleaning a house that had 12 cats in it twice a day. The lady who I 'cared' for was a member of the British Nationalist Party (super far-right nationalism) and one time she asked me to roll her spliffs for the 2 guys coming to her house for a BNP 'meeting'. Another time she asked me to take photos of her naked, I declined. Another time a cat was sick next to the bath while she was in the shower, and she asked me to clean it while she was in there. I spent 3 long minutes cleaning up cat puke while she (65 yo, minimum) stood naked in the shower 3 inches away from my head, telling me I was missing bits. I quit after that.
4	I wish I could do any job I wanted	I have so many jobs and careers that I'd like to do. \n\n* Infantry in the Marines, or a Navy SEAL \n* FBI, CIA agent, or Police Officer\n* Sales; I have my eyes set on being a Realtor\n* Real Estate Investor \n* Business Owner; (I'd like to own a huge business like a ford factory, or AirBnB)\n* I wouldn't mind being famous either\n\nI could spend my life trying out each and every one, but then I'd be a jack of all trades. I always here successful people saying "specialize".
6	Well, if, like me, you start in the Marines, you'll learn a lot of skills about how to work with people and hold a career together, give and follow instructions, work with stress and emotions.  But I went into IT.\n\nIn keeping with your stated goals, from the armed forces you might go on to become a police officer in a growing town or small city, which gives you many hours a day of actual experience in various neighborhoods and learning where the problem areas are and the better areas, which gives you the intel needed to invest in profitable real estate- using a network of realtors and a few financial tricks, you secure your first rental property in your city, which begins paying for itself within 3 months.  Showing savings and positive cashflow to the lender, you are approved to buy an additional 3 properties at low interest rates with intents to do the same.  You now have enough property to hire a superintendent for $10 an hour or so a few hours a month to go check on the properties, answer maintenance complaints and so on.  Other members of the force are wondering how you got all this rapidly building wealth, so you get the idea to make a website for others to register and pool their money in order for you to buy more properties in the name of a new corporation you'll set up, with the intention of bringing small-time working investors into the game on a share basis, and also helping others with their own properties access some other services, like having your $10/hour guy go photograph homes and type up basic copy to list them on places like AirBnB for busy realtors who don't want to do it themselves.  Pretty soon, that website has about 5000 subscribers, (but these are big, wealthier subscribers dumping a lot of money per person), and one day you get a phone call that Entrepreneur magazine wants to do a piece on you.\n\nYou look back and realize that you have achieved all your goals and quit the police force to work on the businesses full time. You keep friends on the force and routinely gather info about more properties for the other lines of work, making you a quite wealthy, sly investor.
3	Dude yes, if only we could live forever. Specializing is a funny thing, it's putting all your assets into one project, which may fail or succeed. Stay generalized, but when you find something that does really well, nurture it and pour time into making it grow and prosper
2	you sound ambitious. good. \n\nall you can do is make the best of your time alive. so go out there and take the world by the balls. i’m sure you can do it.\n\n(since when did i become a bad motivational poster?)
2	Well it looks like you are interested in 2 different pathways, public defender and businessmen why not join the marines as a military police for 4 years then enter the FBI and then retire and become and entrepreneur businessman :D
1	I have this problem as well and my indecisiveness was part of the reason I dropped out of university. I was aimless for a while but after spending some time helping my parents get a garden going I started to love the idea of becoming self sufficient. I'm now in the process of growing my own food, producing my own electricity and bio-fuel, composting, seed-saving, alcohol production, cooking fuel production, collecting wild plants and using natural resources, building useful things like greenhouses/ladders/bridges/fences etc... I love it. Can't imagine doing anything else. Lots of problem solving, designing, and freedom. You can make things more efficient and automate processes to free up more time. There is a business and sales aspect of things if you want to sell surplus produce, cash crops, or wine. \n\nRead lots of books. You may like "The 4 Hour Workweek" by Tim Ferris for a start.\n\nI think a good strategy towards financial freedom is not necessarily to make more money but to spend less money. I eat a pretty minimalist diet based around oatmeal, potatoes, rice, dried beans, bananas etc... cheap healthy foods and I can grow a lot of what I need. You can find ways to cut spending that don't hurt your quality of life and live more of a minimalist lifestyle.\n\n  \n\n
1	If I could be a lumberjack in the Northwest, that would be a dream come true. If money wasn't a problem, I would definitely have pursued it.
1	Noticing that your first pick was Marine Infantry or Navy Seal, I think that those should be the jobs you should really make an effort to do. I was in the 75th Ranger Regiment for a little over 4.5 years and now I do private contract work overseas and I can tell you I am very fulfilled in my line of work. Its challenging work and is more of a lifestyle than it is just a "job", but I can't imagine having done anything else. 
1	I think ISTP's benefit from lifestyles, not jobs. Jobs restrict us too much. IF we can find a career that takes over our whole lives in a sense, we'd be better off.\n\nMany of your options work well together or lead into eachother. If you start with Marine or Navy Seal, that will help you with everything else. Look at Jocko.
4	KDrama?	KDrama definitely isn’t the first thing one would think an istp likes spending their time on, but I doubt it’s that clear cut. I’ve only watched Descendants of the Sun but enjoyed it a lot with the humor, romance, and action. Anybody into them and any recommendations?
2	I like:\nAngel Eyes (this actually gave me feelings lol)\nMoonlight Drawn by Clouds\nI Hear Your Voice\nStrong Woman Do Bong Soon\nWhile You Were Sleeping\n\nCdrama:\nTen Miles of Peach Blossom\nGeneral and I\nLove, Now\nAutumn Concerto\n\n(I watch a lot of kdrama and cdrama, hahaha)
2	My wife is into them, me not so much.\n\nHer favorites: \n\nGoblin\n\nCoffee Prince\n\nOh My Ghostess\n\nHealer\n\nI am not a robot\n\nGoblin was the only one I actually liked. It was pretty good. Cheers!\n\nTogether we watched Train to Busan, which is actually a pretty decent zombie flick with the guy from Goblin.
2	I guess it could be useful for developing Fe.
1	I'm not a big fan of kdramas but I do have a few choice ones that I enjoyed.\n\nHistorical/Romance: The moon embracing the sun\n\nRomance/Comedy: My love from the stars\n\nCrime/Thriller: Stranger (or "Secret Forest")\n\nThe first two especially are widely acclaimed. The third can be found on Netflix. Give them a try!
1	Have you seen Coffee Prince? Has comedy, romance, drama etc. it’s about a girl who gets mistaken as a guy and continues with the ruse to get a job at a coffee shop that only hires guys aka princes.
1	I'm from southeast Asia so kdramas are hugeeee especially among women (might be a persanality type thing?). I'm a guy though and have watched a few episodes of some but never been able to get into them because of the drawn out romantic elements :/
6	What makes you sure that you are an ISTP ?	
21	The MBTI tests I have taken over the past two ears have confirmed it every time.\n\nI love being objectively critical, and I am always interested in how and why things work. Independence is paramount to me. I thrive on variety, being confident yet adaptable, and making decisions based on facts.
6	I generally agree with the sentiments of the posts on this subreddit. I therefore conclude I must be, if not ISTP, close to it. I do not believe this to be all-encompassing of my personality (no 10 traits could ever be, probably not even 20, let alone 4) but it can be a good go-to when examining myself or my relations to others.\nOn a side note I can say the same for INTP. \n\nI also read the "Your ISTP Care And Handling User Guide And Manual" and nodded on the super-majority of points (not all of them, but a lot).\n
3	I'm not sure. This is my preferred sub-reddit out of all the other mbti ones. I find them somewhat pedantic and lenghty after a while. Functions-wise, I'm bad at logic (Ti?) and blurt out wrong answers generally but I like learning stuff in my own way. I'm not sure if I've been coming to terms with being myself and matured or if I'm depressed, since as time goes on I'm getting more and more into simplicity and I don't care about most things people seem to care about. My current guess is that I see myself as odd since I don't know anyone as minimalistic and laid-back as myself. I like the ISTP approach to solving things, that's why I hang around in here.
4	My lack of commitment and boredom in many relationships. My problem solving skills and quick decision making under what would normally be stressful conditions when playing video games. 
3	Sure? Nothing. Likely? Tests, a type me post, and holland codes.
3	I'm not even sure, I've always hopped around from ISTJ, ISTP, INTJ, and INTP. But based one function stack, I figured ISTP is the best fit. ISTJ and INTJ wouldn't fit, because I don't see my self using Te based on what the common descriptions of Te often are. Narrowing down further, my thoughts are based on the information given to me at hand, and speculation on that information, thus a Se/Ni relationship, therefore ISTP. As opposed to coming up with new ideas and comfirming it based on past instances, a more Ne/Si relationship which in turn is INTP.
3	I like working on stuff and fucking love motorcycles
1	The company I work for spent money on the official test so I like to hope its accurate, but I also sometimes think I'm an intp because I don't trust people who charge money for a personality test.
1	Aside from the MBTI test I took in college that said that I was an ISTJ, most other tests I took list me as an ISTP.  I love aviation and working on anything from craft projects to DIY work.  The tools of my trade range from knitting needles and mechanical pencils to cocktail shakers and spanners.  
1	I took the test and I dont fit in, now I know why 
1	this subreddit, i can relate to most. i've gotten istj and intp tho before. i feel like i can be intp at times, tho i believe istp is primary.
1	I suck at introspection but when I stay conscious of my behavior, it's tell-tale of my ISTP tendencies I have problems when someone says something and refuses to explain it to me, or brushes over the details when they absolutely must not be brushed over (imo). I hate planning and thoroughly believe staying open to possibilities is more important than having a set plan and sticking to it. 
1	a test told me.
1	I’m not sure.
1	I consistently test ISTP.
1	lBecause I can't be anything else
69	Developing Fe	
17	Yeah. \n\nYesterday I got out of my car when I got home and I realized there were tears running down my face. \n\nI was like WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN
16	Oh man this is so me. Sometimes during conversations I think to myself "I should show the other person I'm feeling happy, I should smile" thrn I do this super artificial smile, then feel bad afterwards lol
10	my most dreaded question: how do you feel about ___? \n\ni can tell you what i think but i cant tell you what i feel
3	This was me yesterday trying to figure out why I wasn't feeling depressed.
16	How Trust Is Created/The Evolution of Trust.[repost from r/estp]	> This is an interactive game theory minigame. I'm curious to see whether personality types tend lean towards any trust style.\n\n> [The Evolution of Trust](http://ncase.me/trust/)\n> Which type are you, and which cooperation style do you use?\n\n> Did this game change your perspective?\n\nFound on r/estp, as someone who has struggled with people and forming friendships and meaningful relationships, and trusting others, this game was amazing and mind blowing to play. Turns out, there's a lot more factors to it than ISTP just kind of sucking at it.\n\nPlease give it a shot, it doesn't take that long and it uses interactive demonstrations to teach a big concept in a simple way. Please give it a try. \nKnowing some of the simple things taught here can help us a long way in forming better friendships and navigating others if you're not too good at it. 
1	Very neat, thanks for sharing.
1	I have some level of education in game theory, so the information wasn't all that new. But having it in an interactive format was neat.\n\nIf anyone is interested: game theory uses different names for the strategies than the animation:\n\n\n\nAnimation | Game theory\n---|---\nCopycat | Tit-for-Tat\nGrudger | Grim trigger\nAlways cheat | Hawk\nAlways cooperate | Dove\nCopykitten | Tit-for-two-Tats\nDetective | Forward induction\n
7	ISTP - How to use Fe?	I read several times that using Fe can bring to good results. \n\nSo how to use it? \n\nWhat does that mean "using Fe" or "developing Fe"? 
10	Filling in the gaps in your knowledge regarding being able to read people, assess their emotional state, empathize, and relate on an emotional level.  It also deals with projecting emotions, and telling stories that use emotions as part of the rise/fall of the mood and tension.  Developing the intuition about how to say or ask something in the right way to click with their emotional state.\n\nWe can do it, we're just not *naturals* at it.  It takes a bit of socializing and study to work it into an ISTP life.
6	First you press the Power button, then you go to start. Search "Extroverted Feeling," Then right click, Run As Administrator. \n\nyeah no we fucking wish that was how our functions worked. fact is we're using all of them, all the time, at different moments in our lives every day. so you may want to rephrase your question if you want to get an actual answer here. are you asking this sub how you give a shit about people, how you develop empathy, or do you even know what Fe/Extroverted Feeling is? Depending on your answer you just may need to think outside of yourself, socialize more, or just research mbti some more. 
2	You mix it with some C, make a pointy plane out of it, sharpen one side, then you can use it to chop some meat and vegetables which makes them easier to eat.
13	ISTPs and Meditation?	I've seen a few people on here mention that they meditate regularly, to get in touch with their feelings, or whatever. I've been wondering if you've tried meditation, and if yes, if it worked for you? I tried some youtube videos for meditation newbies recently, and I definitely felt less anxious and generally more balanced afterwards. I would like to get into it more, but most guided meditations that I can find on youtube are either esoterical, or linked with yoga practices. Do you have any recommendations for good videos?
12	I started meditating regularly and it changed my life.\n\nI'm the type of person to live in my own head. I'm deeply introspective, I would identify with the voice in my head, and it would lead to depressive thought patterns. Even though I'm not an emotional person, once I started meditating I realized I had emotions running in the background, unaware to me, and they were orchestrating my thoughts, influencing every decision I've ever made. For example, if something stressed me out, I would have stressed thoughts, which would lead to stressed behaviors and decisions even though I wasn't even aware I was stressed.\n\nMeditation is simply observing all of these emotions going on in the background and letting them go so they can't affect you. Your mind loves to chew on problems, make observations about the world, come up with abstract theories, and create all of these other useless thoughts, but when you focus on your breath with meditation, all of those thoughts get silenced so you can observe what's *really* going on.\n\n[Here's the most simple way of meditating, used by Navy SEALs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/7ubgaa/i_wtl_how_to_collect_my_thoughts_and_speak_like_a/dtjxvbk/)
2	No clue, but after reading this I wanna try it
2	I've never been able to. My meditation comes from long motorcycle rides. I don't do them often because they are long. Some over a month. It's hard on the resources.
2	Not my thing. I know it’s the “in” thing to do but when you get into meditation it’s all about inaction towards the outer world (cant control it so control yourself etc) and that’s not something that appeals to me. Truth is there’s a balance and I enjoy actively trying to make a mark on the world and not just zen my way through life. To each their own. \n\nI would much rather physically exhaust myself running or gym, working on or learning about something that interests me, going for a drive, etc. That gives me peace of mind and happiness. That clears my head. \n\n
2	I love meditation, I’ve found it incredibly beneficial over the past seven years or so I’ve been doing it. \n\nI don’t know of any YouTube guides or anything, I learned meditation in person from old Buddhists. \n\nSitting quietly for 20 minutes may be difficult, and of course the benefits might not be immediately obvious, but it’s a really good habit.
1	I had to once as part of a college class and it was nice. I'm not really interested in pursuing it though bc my surface level life is pretty nice so I don't really want to deal with my issues deep down yet. 
1	Look at apps like Headspace and Calm.\n\nI find removing the 'video'/visual component helps me.\n\nMindfulness and/or general awareness can be beneficial for all situations in life.
0	Trying to empty your mind doesn't really help, but definitely being more aware of the negative sensations in your body and trying to relax them really helps. Sometimes we don't even realize we are stressed and our stomach has tightened up. And the most important part of meditating is the breathing. Experiment with your breathing. Try belly breathing - if it feels restricted then you've got a muscular imbalance. If you lie on your back and everything isn't flat and there's lots of pressure points and you feel uncomfortable then you've got a muscular imbalance.  \nIf none of this applies to you then there's probably no point in meditating because you're grounded already.
3	Hello, ISTP's. I want to understand what other ISTP's do with friendships.	Growing up my circle of friends changed quite often until I was maybe 20/21 years old, and for the past 8 years I've had a tight\-knit group of friends. Or I thought I did.\n\nWhen I really think about it the thing that these friends and I had in common was trauma.\n\n1 divorce, 1 personality clash, 1 accusation of theft, 1 stupid thing I said a long time ago and nearly 10 years later and I'm looking around and I can see a friendship with only one of these people now. And I love him, he's like a brother, but we have nothing in common. We don't like to do the same things.\n\nBut I don't really have any other friends except this guy I chat with online, and he only partially likes me.\n\nAnyway this is all beside the point. The point is \- what are your friendships like? What do you get out of them? What do you see their purpose as?\n\nI'm not entirely sure I completely understand friendship or what it's for.\n\nMy bordering 90 year old grandparents tell me that friendships are things worth looking after, and that they'll become more important the further into life that I get. So I'm figuring sometime soon I'm going to have to make some new friends. \n\nWhat's everyone's thoughts or experiences with friendships?
18	I'm friendly but not good at following up on communication. I'm worse at following up with buddies (who consider me a friend).\n\nI won't say I "ghost" friends... because that requires malice/intent... But it is fairly easy for me to disconnect from a few people to focus on some phase/task or person in my life.\n\nI've only relatively recently realized that screws with people. I partially don't feel bad because I always felt I'm doing  both of us a favor by disconnecting.\n\nWhat has recently got me rethinking my behavior is seeing introverts make genuine efforts to make a connection; or them reminding me how hard that is.
7	Funnily enough, I feel almost like a parasite finding its host when it comes to friendship. (Not in the way that I would take advantage of them, and they definitely don't take advantage of me.) I almost always have one very very close friend and a few other close friends within my vicinity. Once that very very close friend isn't within my vicinity anymore, I go searching for a new very, very close friend. I have a friendship of 9 years, and we consider each other as "twins" or "sisters". She's still the closest to me, but since she isn't within my vicinity, I have found another super close friend. \n\nWhat do I get out of them? I'll always have someone that I can depend on, should I need it. I didn't finish my homework on time or school is too hectic to manage all this freakin homework within one night? I'd feel comfortable asking them to share answers. I need to skip class cause of a job interview? I know that they wouldn't mind sitting in for me and taking notes. Of course I'd do the same for them. \n\nI guess the purpose is that it's just mutually beneficial. As much as I like being alone, I still need someone that I can share my thoughts with. They're there for me to vent to, to share my thoughts with, to send memes with, and to gain a new perspective when I feel wronged in a situation. 
5	People confuse friends with acquaintances. They are two different things. Personally, I will bend over backwards to help acquaintances and people mistake that for friendship. It is not. Just because I help you in a tight spot does not mean I have any positive feelings for you in the least. I’d do the same for a complete stranger. Likewise, if I  don’t jump through hoops to help you it does not mean I don’t consider you to be a friend, but that is far less common.\n\nFriends are few and far between. Acquaintances abound. Until you have a true friend, it is very easy to confuse acquaintances with friends. Society makes little distinction between the two. \n\nTrue friends require no maintenance at all. I will go even further: a true friend knows when to refuse your help.
3	As a kid I made friends easily, but as I got older I distanced myself further and further from people and narrowed down my circle of friends. I even moved to a new state and now I have no real-life friends at all. \n\nI still have friends I talk to online which keeps me going, but it would be nice to be able to see them.\n\nI've been looking at share houses recently and have been meeting a lot of strangers, but it's hard to connect with someone straight away and make a good first impression. I can't help but feel like people think I have some ulterior motive because of how reserved I can be, but the truth is I just have no idea what to talk about. And I don't want to fake anything because it feels weird. \n\nFriends are useful for a few things;\n\n- Learning different perspectives\n- Social connections for discovering employment opportunities/hidden job market\n- Forming romantic/sexual relationships \n- Laughter & creating memories\n- Giving/receiving help/advice\n- Overall happiness
3	People are literally everything. You might not see it now, if you are in school, don't have a job, or dont live alone or are entirely supporting yourself, but when you get to it, friendships and people and connections are needed for almost anything. It's just kind of the way life works, at least for us humans. We need people-- Either in our businesses, or for our emotions. We are social creatures. To work for our communities and give to others and be accomplished in that, in whatever way we do it, is ultimately what makes us satisfied in life. \n\nAnd that last one-- trust me i had issues with it. I didn't think that, and even a lot of this-- was true for a long long time. It.... took me a while to accept. I'm still trying to accept the last one, but no matter how much I want to deny it..... 'its kinda true. \n\nI'm not about to tell you who you are and what you do and dont want so i wont\nbut i will tellyou that im an istp and i grew up in isolation and i thought i was completely fine with it. but after i made some friends for the first time, and lost some- I realized that was  what had been missing from my life, and i wanted nothing more. I'm not sure that's much changed since. 
2	Are you younger? When you said you don't understand what friendship is for sounds a lot like me when I was in my 20s. I didn't have many friends, and I didn't need many friends, because I just didn't care. \n\nNow that I'm closer to 40, I feel the need for friends. A solo life gets to be a lonely life, and friendship for me is basically a shared companionship based on compatible interests or points of view.\n\nBut I'm very picky with friends. I'll strike up an acquaintance-ship with just about anybody, I can be very outgoing in that respect. But this is usually a basis for "testing the waters". I'm looking for a deeper connection. Do we have similar interests or ideals? Does that person have qualities that I would like to see in myself (therefore, being friends with them is helpful, to remind me to be better), etc. If we click, then I go out of my way to foster the relationship. If we don't, I just move on.\n\nThat can come off as almost manipulative, like I'm trying to see if people are worth me leeching something off of them. That's really not how I see it, it's essentially a huge interest check -- is this person worth my personal investment? The time and effort and becoming emotionally attached is draining for an ISTP and I need to make sure I'm not going to get burned.\n\nBeing ignored is one of the worst feelings, I try really hard to avoid that.
1	I haven't made 1 friend since college ended over 10 years ago. I have a few friends that I can go for months without taking too. That's my experience.\n\nNo thoughts on the matter.
69	What do you think? :D :D	
27	Exactly me except that I'm not black /s
9	Haven't related to a meme so much. People call me unemployed, but I am playing my stocks right and doing pretty well.
7	Haha same. My first career choice was to be a cop, something like a prison guard just so that I could get paid to do nothing all day.\n\nThankfully I realized I would hate being a cop and fell into tech. Now I spend most of my time automating my job and researching methods of making passive income.
5	I lose my fucking mind if I'm not busy. It doesn't have to be working but I can't sit around all day doing nothing. 
2	i'm actually pretty good at coming up with money making schemes. some of them work, sometimes i want to write a book, though too many people will use my ideas to make them work better, so i just make a note of them and put em on a floppy disk
2	Damn, if you're gonna call me out like that, just tag me next time. 
2	ENTP. Can relate. 
2	Hah not at all. My job is quite lucrative and I rarely pay attention to money. Don't have anything in the stock market, which is really foolish but I can't bring myself to care enough to spend the time. 
2	Selling digital products seems to be the way to go.

18	Do people underestimate your intelligence?	So I’ve been thinking about this and I was wondering if you guys had experience with people underestimating your intelligence or what you know (especially Te users). Since Te users verbally express their logic do you sometimes find yourself not being talked down to exactly but people assume you don’t know things when you actually do, or when people are talking and you are kind of absorbing what they are saying (and connecting it to previous knowledge that you already have stored — this is what Ti does) do you find you are under estimated ? 
38	I feel that I'm overestimated. I don't talk that much and I'm a software developer, so people sometimes assume I'm a sorcerer of the Android and that my field is unknowable.\n\nI'm not really very smart. Just got lucky being born into a good situation with education and stuff, which goes a long way. Good nurture, ok nature.
18	I think I surprise people when I succeed... Like they don't expect me to?
8	I guess I do what a Ti does (I don't exactly know all of my traits), but I'm not very vocal unless I need to be. There are some areas in my life where I might jump up and carry a convo, and no one challenges me on whatever I might be saying... but I don't think it has anything to do with _what_ I'm saying since those certain areas of interest are generally in open-thinking, socratic seminar type of environments. \n\nI don't really care if people underestimate me or not. I mean, I'll remain stubborn about it in my own mind, but I'm not going to start potential conflict unless the topic is very important to me. I suck at talking, though, so that can make people roll their eyes at me, but I'm not sure if that is entirely relevant to your question. 
4	Lol yeah, definitely. Because there are more extroverts in the world, introversion sometimes gets frowned upon. I have had people assume I was stupid just because I didn’t talk much. However, the fun part is suddenly surprising them with with all the information you know and watching their reactions. Their faces are priceless.
3	People that I don't talk much to, probably do, due to some extroverted traits being interpreted as intelligence and the lack of which having implications of stupidity, at least in America (personally, I heavily dislike those kinds of people. That kind that blab before they stop to think). And those people definitely do try to explain things that I already know to me. Though, I don't really waste the effort to tell them I know it already. Most of them won't stop talking even if I tell them, but most also mean well in doing so. Though, almost everybody I've ever had a decently serious conversation with has deemed me "smart," when I can act like an idiot sometimes. So, both yes and no.  
3	all the time! constantly! my friends think i'm an idiot to be honest. sometimes i act silly/foolish but it's only a joke/my sense of humor. and especially men, i don't know why, maybe it's a dude thing, but they ALWAYS underestimate me and assume i don't know anything. it just ticks me off. i don't like saying "i already knew that" because it sounds petty and childish but sometimes i don't want to sit through an explanation of something i already understand.
3	Yes. But I think that has more to do with looking like a ditzy blonde girl than being an ISTP.\n\nI work as a chemical engineer. So people will eventually ask my job and then they're always surprised. I think it's kind of funny at this point.
2	I'm still in high school, and for years now everyone has known me as the genius kid who is google in human form. My abilities are extremely overestimated, I'm not as smart as people think I am.\nAm I gonna tell them I'm not that smart? Nope, lol the higher they think of me the better. \nMaybe things will change after high school though, being a quiet kid thrown in with people who haven't known me for forever may get me underestimated for a while. 
2	I think it's the opposite. People overestimate how smart I am. They expect me to be a mathematician or scientist and keep telling me to go to uni but I really couldn't give a fuck about that stuff. They see how good I am at music, video games, rubik's cubing, thinking logically, and they think that means I must be good at everything. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. I have to say ISTP is the most versatile type since we are both "smart" and good at sport but we still have our weaknesses. Like, having weak Si means we don't have the best memory, having PoLR Ne means we suck at the meta-physical, having inferior Fe means we aren't the best at talking to people (so many times people have told me I should become a teacher - that is the worst kind of job for me).
1	yes, a lot of the time. lot of people of authority judge based on looks that i get in trouble a lot or don't care for knowledge therefore dumb. there was a time wherein college someone insisted on teaching me excel when in fact, i knew it.
1	Oh all the time. And even in the topics of my expertise. My fucking roommate will constantly argue with me about Car related stuff. Me? I’ve been to 4 years of school, have an ASE cert, and taught a college class. Him? A dad who liked to work on VW busses. \n\n\nHe somehow seems to think his dad’s passed down knowledge over a couple years is worth more than my official schooling and *teaching*. \n\n\nNot to mention, I’ve built 6 of my own cars and helped build dozens of other peoples cars. And by “build” I don’t mean suspension and wheels. I mean basically fully stripped and rebuilt vehicles for performance including engine rebuild. He has built a grand total of 0 cars. \n\n\nWhen he questions me, I bust out laughing on the inside. Hell even get super stubborn about how right he is. And even when he’s dead wrong, he’ll find some way to force a justification. And he almost never actually ends up admitting he’s wrong. 
1	They either think that I have potencial which I choose not to develop because of laid-back stubborness or they overestimate my intelligence because they are talkative and dramatic
1	No people overestimate their own intelligence if anything. Also people call me smart because i can google and fix things but I'm dumb as hell compared to people who are actually smart.
1	my close friends actually have a very good gauge on my intelligence (rational, practical, and with a  working knowledge of just about every topic but hilarious, glaring inconsistencies in some common-knowledge subjects)(the reasoning for the latter is that if there's some information everyone knows, there's no need for me to know because if that info becomes relevant, I can ask just about anyone and get an accurate answer), but people who're passive aggressive and immature tend to assume I'm being a devil's advocate when I ask for clarity or dissenting views. I want to understand an issue from many angles - I don't necessarily have to agree with all of them. 
1	Always. I don't like discussions when they are not efficient and don't lead to anything useful.
1	Yeah I don't have the same thinking process as most people around me (Te users) so it definitely occurs to me. \n\nI'm also overrated in some of my abilities, for example memory. I have a good memory but people exagerrate it to hell.
1	If I\nm ever vocal/conversational: Depends on the persons age. \nOlder people (and im 24 but i look like im still in highschool, because i take care of myself) around 40+ think im really smart and independent, and it feels like they afford a decent respect, and I respect that a lot. \n\nYounger people/peers: hardly. the only ones that do are just the very Real/Down to earth ones. \n\nUsually if i talk more theres a less chance of being thought of as smart\n\nIf i talk less.. idk it's a wonderball. Some have given me a rare "Mysterious", some think I'm "Smart", others think theres something wrong with me just for not being social.
1	Yes, but I am a female with learning disabilities out the ass. Often times my spelling issues and inability to do math make people assume I'm stupid for some reason. 
1	Yes extremely frequently. I have platinum blonde hair that goes down to my butt, love makeup, and wear dresses 90% of the time. I can be reserved but also have a really silly sense of humor, and people have a habit of seeing me as ditzy or a non-intellectual upon first impression (especially men tbh). But being underestimated can be fun. \n\nI love the incredulous look that people give me when they find out about my military service, that I can speak Russian, that I studied mechanical engineering, blah blah. I think that 90% of first impressions are based on appearance and not personality so I wouldn’t necessarily peg this as an ISTP experience but maybe not. 
1	Yeah, most people. Mostly because I don't talk and I give off the impression that I don't give two fucks about stuff. I usually don't share knowledge with other people whenever I don't find it necessary. My family though (Fe/Si users), overestimates my academic ability when it's just having a way of getting good grades while exerting the least amount of effort.
1	Very much so. Many people have this assumption that "smart people" must be like how movies display smart people. That is entirely not the case (and it should be obvious, being that real life is not fiction, but some people are really that daft).\n\nPeople I don't know are usually very shocked when I make an extremely salient point "You're so quiet, I didn't realize you were that smart". Intelligence has a high correlation with knowing when to speak.
4	Developing Ni?	Eg. What steps have you taken to develop Ni? What activities activate Ni? Thanks!
7	The most natural way we use Ni is when we get a "hunch." For me when I want to develop this function, I follow this hunch and go deeper into it developing my own ideas. Usually the initial idea is sparked from someone else but basically I take that idea and run with it. The easy thing about it is you can keep it all in your head. Explaining these ideas to others would require Ne which normally causes the whole thing to fall apart.\n\nFor example, I saw a post over on r/mbti about what the world would be like if people were 100% intuitive (I think it has since been deleted). I saw a comment that said it would be hell and a 50-50 split would be much more useful. I took that comment and started theorizing what society would have to do to raise intuitive population and I was thinking about "intuitive" Montessori schools and what kind of S dominated aspects of life would start to diminish (like the Western world's obsession with sports). I had more when I was doing the theorizing but that's the beauty of it, you don't have to do anything but speculate with Ni. There's no outside pressure to explain and you don't have to worry about how others will perceive these ideas. Ni users have Te or Fe for that but we don't really have any way of getting our ideas out of our heads too easily (Se and Ni don't like to play nice). \n\nJust remember to not fall into a Ti-Ni loop, take breaks and exercise Se when you need to. Overall, it's about finding a balance between your functions because they are all important in order to lead a healthy life. 
3	Reading, personality theory, anything that really causes you to make connections. Also, take a second, stop using Se as much, if only for a short time, and plan things out instead of taking things day by day. Practice makes perfect 
3	Also accept that your Ni will always be off balanced due to having Ne Polr.  So it will never be super comfortable around people. 
2	A lot of alone time, a lot of quiet. A lot of seperating myself from distractions and just thinking on something and letting myself ponder. Thinking about whats bothering me and thinking about myself and asking a lot of Why's and letting myself sit on those whys, I'll find a lot of self-answers. When done healthy, it's great for self exploration and emotions. \n\nWhen done badly it usually comes out in the form of paranoia and fear. Thats when you break out the Se and get a physical distraction. 
50	Does anyone here actually like talking about themselves? Me personally whenever someone asks me something about myself, I respond with the least detail possible, and continue to ask them about them.	
39	Some people manage to get me talking. It’s all in the subtle art of asking the right questions. You have to try to pay attention to what the other person seems to find interesting, and that won’t always be something about them. 
11	I like talking about myself but even when someone asks about me I try to keep it short because I don’t think anyone could actually care about details of my personal life the same way I don’t care about theirs. 
9	And then they get all snappy cause it feels like you're interrogating them...
8	I like sharing details if I'm developing a friendship with someone and I notice they actually care, otherwise it's just protocol and a waste of energy so in that case I don't like it.
6	I'm the same way. I answer the question with the least amount of words. I know that isn't the best for job hunting so I turn up talking.
6	[This](http://imgur.com/q1IPB4V) is a a conversation I was having with my dad (with the irrelevant parts blurred). All of my texts are usually less than 5 words. 
6	That's how I was when I was younger. Its only in the last few years in my mid 20s that I give people more information about myself but even now I always steer conversation to about the person I'm talking to. I just stopped evading peoples questions about me to me. Which is what I used to do.
4	This ^\n\nThe worst question to me is when someone asks me how has been my day. My typical answer : As usual. lol
2	Not at all. Interviews are the worst thing for me because of it. I think it stems from the disdain I feel towards people that brag about themselves...and there's nothing to brag about. I'd hate to be thought of as one of those people.
2	I can go on for hours. I'm an interesting guy. I've done cool things.\n
1	idk, it depends on the way someone goes about it. If its genuine, sure, but only if I get to ask equally as many questions about them, so its even. if its not, then ill shut up real fast and try not to feel hurt about it. \n\ntalking about interests is always going to be the cruz of it either way, and id rather talk about interests and passions and hobbies than me or my personal history anyday. 
1	I try to find subjects that could be of general interest and I will share my findings / experiences e.g. I'm renovating my house and can give advice on what to pay attention when contracting workers, why I did something a given way and not the other \(because I already spend a lot of time pondering different solutions\)... Or lately I've been asked a lot about my weight loss \(19kg since August\) and people genuinely wants to know how I did so I explain to them the concept around CICO, show them the apps I use and give them advices how to get started. Your past and next holidays are also a good subject of discussion.\n\nEven if you think something is boring it can end up a valauble source of information for others because you already did all the thinking/research beforehand.
1	I don’t like talking about *myself* per-say. However, if I’ve been engaged in a really fun new activity (or just anything interesting), I like to share that. \n\n\nI’m not the type to just spout it off though. Usually if someone asks me, I respond with a low detail answer. Usually I just expect the questions to be “social courtesy”. But if they keep asking for more details and are truly interested, then I’ll start laying on details. 
1	If I like a person enough to share my "story" (for lack of a better term/phrase) with them, I'll talk in terms of what I do, not what I am.
1	yes makes me sleepy, drains excess energy at the end of the day
1	I tend to do the exact same thing.
1	I recently realized I keep talking about myself and projecting my own experiences on others... Not sure how and when that started, but I freaked myself out on that realization, since I always thought otherwise
0	[Rant/Vent] man hitting on iSTP tells him he's dysfunctional Because he doesnt believe self-taught learning is real.	Continued Title; ISTP Flips Man Off And Continues To Learn Anyway\n\nOkay so this conversation wasn't even about MBTI, did not involve it, but the whole thing just reeked of typical Holier Than Thou, Superiority Complex NT Bullshit. You know what I'm talking about. This whole, "This Is The Right Way To Learn", "You're Dumb Because You Don't Learn Like I Do." which then descends into, "NT's are Actually God and Sensors are stupid cavemen bashing rocks against the ground."\n\nI will edit this post with the direct argument later if anyone requests but for now I just wanna rant/argue my point; I'm not fucking stupid because I don't learn the way most people do. I'm self taught and I just learn better on my own, and I can learn a skill faster and better on my own in a confined space than many people can being taught one on one. Hell, there's been plenty of times I've outlearned intuitives themselves because I'm great at just learning on my own by messing around with something, completely instruction and google-free, while my N and NT friends tend to flounder or give up without even trying if they don't have someone who knows what they're doing on hand, or a source of information at their disposal. I once dated an INTJ who could not understand my learning style to such an extent, that that she was absolutely awestruck and flabberghasted when I learned or practiced something that, to her, seemed to come out of nowhere. To her, it didn't make sense. She didn't understand how it was even possible I didn't read a manual, I didn't look for instructions, I didn't ask for help; And most of the time? I don't need to. It's just how I fucking am, and theres nothing wrong with that, It's not weird, it's not abnormal, it's not even fucking unheard of. It's not a disorder, it's not unnatural, It's completely fucking fine. \n\nI really value MBTI because, for a long time, I didn't know that that way of learning was normal. That it was a documented, absolutely real thing, and many other ISTP learn the exact same way. I just wasn't interested enough in others to watch ISTP learn to learn that that was normal. :'D\nI CAN learn with teachers, (It really just depends on the pacing and communication style, but that's true for most people y'know?), but I prefer and even *like* learning on my own, whether it involves additional information or not. \n\nNow for the parts that might actually interest you;\n (im slightly calmer now) this man has been sexually pursuing me for the less than 24-hours he's known me, offered me to stay with him/live in, and wants me to join his poly harem (I can't make this shit up.). Evidently, he thinks he knows me. He does not. And at this rate, he's going to learn that very quickly. I've been telling him I've got too much on my plate right now for a relationship, have not been reciprocating his flirtations, and have outright now told him I'm only interested in friendship and to please stop flirting. And now he pulls out this. \n\nDude better get his head out of his ass if he wants anything to do with me. Like it or not, everybody is different and no one works the same way anybody else does. Everyone has different learning styles, all suited to different things. \nAnd I'm getting sick of being told I'm stupid or autistic or dysfunctional for learning differently when I can teach myself college courses through just experimentation and independent study in less time than It'd take to actually buy them, than someone who simply learns better in classroom or while listening to music and might fucking fail the class altogether. And fuck anyone who thinks they know me and has any authority to tell me what is and isn't objectively good for learning. Like fuck off, you don't get to decide that. My brain doesn't work according to how you think it should, whether you accept it or not. \n\nFuck it. [Heres some condescending as hell screenshots.](https://imgur.com/a/bxp0iNP)\n\n~~And before anyone says anything: Yes, I get what hes saying about googling help technically being getting help. I don't always use that, however; I have fixed my houses plumbing and electricity with no help from google or any prior manuals or information at all before; Just me, my eyes, and my hands, and experimenting with an object. Yes, I also get what he's saying about not being an island: obliviously everyone needs help if they want to get anywhere in life; Keyword, *in Life*, which is what that poem is about. I can still learn fine and safely to do many things all on my own, with or without aid. And no, even if I am using some fucking wiki article off google, if I'm not actively trading information with another person and getting real time feedback, I don't consider it communication. Reading an article is not the same as talking to someone, the article cannot respond to me, nor I it. He's still a creepy asshole who thinks he knows me and can tell me who I am and how I work when he's known me for less than a fucking day.~~
8	"Marginalized women with daddy issues" and a cave allegory reference? I rolled my eyes so hard I'm pretty sure I saw the inside of my skull.\n\nI have an amazing urge to drop that screenshot in /r/iamverysmart but I won't.
5	Shit.  I have no further words to add to the frustration, you illustrated it nicely.\n\nThe problem is, he probably isn't going to listen since he's made up his mind.\n\nJust remember that every time someone makes such a big point about something like that it's point at their own insecurity.\n\nAlso, that dude sounds kinda nuts from your description.\n\nNo matter what you do, he’ll always keep his own lens on it. 
5	tl;dr and r/Titlegore
3	>Dude better get his head out of his ass if he wants anything to do with me.\n\nWhy even bother? He's already proven to you that he is an Asshole of extreme magnitude. You'd be wasting your highly valued time on him.\n\nEDIT: In the first screenshot he compared you to another woman. No one likes being compared to another in terms of romance.
1	How did you fix your electricity by experimenting with your eyes and hands?  Did you at least have a multimeter or circuit tester?
19	Am I the only one who thinks putting stickers about an opinion on your laptop is sketchy as hell?	Just curious.
34	Sketchy? I'm not sure why it would be sketchy, but I think it's just risky and overall stupid/unnecessary. The best example would probably be politics: say you have a sticker on an expensive personal procession, like a car or laptop, showing that you're pro-Republican. It's just incentive for some people to damage your belongings or form an opinion of you for no reason. I don't want a random stranger knowing who or what I believe in. They have no reason to, and I have no reason to _want_ them to. I have Reddit for that. 
10	Yeah I thoroughly don't give a shit what other people's political opinions are.  And if they have stickers expressing their opinions it tells me they are probably up for a political discussion or debate.  People who seem to have an opinion about everything and are always up for a debate (ENTP for example) are perhaps my least favorite to be around.
11	No. Let people advertise their crazy opinions. Saves a lot of time getting to know them. 
8	You should put that on a sticker and put it on your laptop.
5	I quite like politics and enjoy talking about it. But I don't like advertising it to people I don't know well. It could be due to the fact I'm pretty conservative in a more liberal generation. 
5	I have an Organ Donor sticker on my laptop. And on my wallet and on my phone. I don't know what I will be carrying when I die, so I have those stickers everywhere, lol. 
4	I usually don't adorn my stuff with addons because doing so typically ruins the overall flow/look of it.
6	On a similar note, I hate bumper stickers on cars. Except the ones that make fun of other bumper stickers like the "0.0" stickers making fun of "26.2" marathon bumper stickers. I think those are hilarious for whatever reason.
3	Yeah always thought it was weird
32	Great Female ISTP Example	
4	Yes!
3	Oh god. It's damn true. 
3	yasss i love this movie and i love rooney mara
1	Pretty sure Rooney Mara is an INFJ so she does share our cognitive functions but she isn't an ISTP.
7	Definetely ISTP why do I care what people think about me.	In what i’ve read ISTPs usually dont need the approval of others, yet i find myself doing things to look good in front of people. What are some ways to solve this?
21	You have Fe; It might be your quaternary function, but it's still there. For you, it means harmozing with everyone (ish), so you DO care about what people think about you. Younger ISTPs have virtually no awareness of this function, so they typically go with the "fuck what everyone else thinks of me" attitude. However, most ISTPs start developing Fe somewhere in their 20's, so they DO start caring about others' opinions to some degree.
16	Its how being human works, everyone needs recognition. 
11	that is a bit of a generalization. We don't need people's approval when it concerns our logically-driven reasons for why we do things or think things. We don't give a fuck.\n\nHowever the realms of values and the human condition is a bit foreign to us. We don't know how to navigate it, but we do want people to like us. In other words, Fe.\n\nHow to solve it? Respect your own psychological need for Fe. You want people to like you? Learn to like them. Do things for them because you like them, because you want them to be happy. Accept that we are humans and not everything needs to be rational or economical or logical.
3	If I had to guess, I'd say you give less fucks the older you get. I'm pretty sure I've always been an ISTP, but middle school was brutal for caring what other people thought. High school started the not caring and by now (almost 40), I'm quite content in my not caring. \n\nI would probably still take it personal if someone thinks I don't do a good job, that can be an indication that I need to try harder (or maybe because I take a lot of personal satisfaction in doing a good job), but I still don't feel an overt sense of duty to meet their needs. It's more like, re-evaluating to see if I meet my own requirements.\n
5	That’s a good question to ask yourself. \n\nIt’s also a good question to find your own answer too. \n\nFor starters, presumably you’re human or at least some form of social animal since you’re here. That tends to lead to one caring about what others think. 
2	For some reason you find it necessary to care, what is that reason? Maybe researching into enneagram can help digging deeper into that.
2	That's your Fe finally seeing the light of day.
2	I'm in the same boat. I think the good (and insidious) effects of Fe probably started showing up earlier in us than other istp's.
1	Inferior Fe is really strong in ISTP, it influence how ISTP thinks. 
1	If you want to be successful in career, social life etc. you have to care what others think about you.\n\nFor example clothes, it makes massive difference how you are perceived and treated by other between over-sized t shirts with cargo shorts and when you know how to dress, at least wearing clothes that fits, you still can have batman logo on it.\n\nI personally couldn't care less about clothes or shaving or haircut if it was just for myself, it's pain in the ass, but the results of caring has been so dramatically positive, that I do care a try my best to reap the benefits it brings
6	Study of 300,486 individuals identifies 148 independent genetic loci influencing general cognitive function	
3	TL;DR?
10	What do you like learning about?	And how do you go about it?
31	Never know til it piques my interest. \n\nThen I read everything I can find about it on the internet until that’s a dead end or satisfying. If the former, I’ll move on to books. \n\nSo far I have a large collection of books about typology, a growing collection of various books on philosophy, and about a dozen internet tabs of articles on whales. \n\nIf only I liked learning about math or something...
16	How to make stuff.\n\nBy making stuff.
6	History, like wars and such. Especially WWII and the American Civil War\n\nMusic, I love listening to and playing music so learning new things to do on guitar or fun facts about bands/musicians I like is fun.\n\nRandom facts and things like that. Like something on r/TodayILearned\n\nActually, anything really. Just whatever interests me at the moment
6	anything that involves electronics, vehicles, engines, along with programming and some "psychology" if you even wana call it that.
11	Everything.\n\nLook around and just think about stuff I don’t know yet.
5	Everything, but mostly history. 
3	How systems work? Isn't that what makes us ISTPs? I particularly like systems where I can improve my abilities, like playing music, sport, video games, chess, debating, rubik's cubing, or things like learning about people, physiology, psychology, philosophy, programming. Anything that can improve your life is worth learning about. ISTPs usually don't give a fuck about random facts. That's something Si/Ne users like to do. They collect a whole bunch of random facts to fuel their curiosity. I just want to experience the world and perfect myself, which is all about Se/Ni.
3	Started my own e-commerce business. I took in information from a fire hose for several weeks. It was so enjoyable. 
2	Artificial Intelligence 
2	Secrets
2	Music. Not sure if that's an "ISTP thing," but I play the guitar, and I love playing around, finding something that sounds great. Of course, I get picky with my own playing, and get dissatisfied more often than not, but it's all part of the process. Just gotta keep on truckin'...\nI wanna know everything I can. I may not use it all at once, but it's nice to have that knowledge at my disposal, should I ever happen upon any of it. I spent so much time as a kid learning music theory, it seems like a waste of time if I don't actually use any of it for anything, right?\nEven still, nothing wrong with a healthy hobby I'm good at.\n\nThat, and playing fighting games. Kinda want a Switch soon so I can see what Ultra Street Fighter II is like.  :/
2	World War 2\n\nI'll usually just look up videos on youtube
2	Mostly physics, and everything about engineering and technologies. You won't be surprise If I tell you that I'm studying in Physic engineering, more accurately Nanotechnologies, uh?\n\nI do like mechanics as well, just bought an Airsoft and planning on making a team and stuff and I already started looking forward to upgrade it myself, how it works and how to fix it if it ever breaks lol. So on, I already know exactly how I'll build my own silencer, how it actually "suppress" the sound etc.\n\n Yeah, I love engineering.
1	The world, universe, science. History and random facts. Music, how it evolved and influences over the years.
1	movies! but more than anything i enjoy a good lengthy peruse of the Wikipedia dot com 
1	History, ancient civilizations, politics, demographics, policy, some light universe/physics stuff. I usually just read about this stuff or watch a documentary.
1	Anything that I find interesting that I can get value out of.\n\nBack in high school I loved working on photoshop (which I still use to this day). College - magic (which I kinda practice every few months just not to lose my slight of hand.)\n\nTried speed reading, got bored since I find reading a bit boring.\n\nTried photography/videography for a few months but that didn't last long since I'm not really the creative type.\n\nCurrently learning coding (did some html coding in high school) for building websites. Not sure how long this will last after I make a website. But with that I'm learning the basics of python, js, html, css and Django framework with plans on learning vue.js for front end.\n\n
3	How many hobbies have you had in the past year?	
6	Not as many as I would have if I hadn't spent money on my current hobbies...drawing, painting, working out, house plants...there is more I can't recall right now
1	A lot
1	A few, not many.
1	Around 10 that I can think of
1	1. Urban farming\n2. Graphic design\n3. Online learning\n4. Exercise\n5. Lockpicking\n6. Darts\n7. Forumming\n\nMost of them I only practiced sporadically and stopped after a short while. Of these, the major ones I'll probably keep into the future are urban farming, exercise, and graphic design.
1	* chess\n* Brazilian jiu jitsu\n* wrestling\n* piano\n* guitar\n* coding\n* gaming\n* Making money outside of a job

14	What are you judgmental about?	We're supposed to be one of the most laid\-back types but what are you judgmental about?\n\nI think if somebody is really air\-headed, indecisive, a terrible listener or just fucking useless \(ignorant and incompetent\) then I judge them pretty harshly, whereas most other things aren't really polarizing.
46	Dishonesty.
31	Tbh, "air-headed, indecisive, a terrible listener" actually describes a lot of the flaws of the ISTP. I know we think a lot, but we come across as boring people with nothing much to talk about. Having dominant Ti means we tend to spend a lot of time thinking about how something works before making a decision. That's actually a big problem with ISTPs and it's called the Ti-Ni loop. And of course we're pretty terrible listeners due to inferior Fe. We think we're so right all the time and say some blunt and insensitive things that offend people but when we open up to people and they do the same to us we can be just as offended.
16	passive aggressiveness and dishonesty drive me nuts, and I tend to avoid people who are inconsiderate of mine & others' time. 
13	Hypocrisy. 
20	**Helplessness**.  I shouldn't have to help people that are over 30 on every step of there problem.  I should be able to give them an idea what to research and they should take it from there.  I get tired of hand holding. \n\n**Poor Financial Lifestyle**.  I'm not talking about people that are stuck in poverty.  I'm talking about people that make enough money to save up, but live beyond there means.   
18	being incredibly overwieght really annoys me when i see them, like how did you let yourself become this bad
5	I judge parents who smoke inside with their kids there, because everyone knows the danger, but they don't believe in facts, or they don't care enough about their children. Fuck you, parents. 
7	Passive-aggressive butthurtness, intolerance (also trying to force tolerance about something stupid SJWs I'm looking at you), sheer stupidity, dishonesty, closed minded people, emotions over rational thinking on absolutely everything, racism.
5	If they try to manipulate me (acting dumb, helpless, using fancy terms, being indirect, passive-aggressive, etc), be "alpha" over me (especially women) or if I can sense they're trying to pull one of those "48 laws of power" shits, I screw them over or ruin their reputation and will not stop till I'm satisfied. this goes for liars too
4	Everything. 
4	Incompetence. If you're responsible for something ... then _be responsible for it._ It shouldn't be my problem if you can't hold your own end. Albeit, I would much rather do whatever myself and double check each thing they do to make sure it's okay, but still - have a clue what you're doing, please. 
2	Betrayal, dishonesty, hypocrisy. I hate when people think they are the only persons who knows the truth. Hate when people say "no" or "yes" with a little information. Hate when people want to rule, I don't like authorities when they "want to rule". I accept the only authority who wants to make better the system, nothing more. 
2	Ghetto people
1	One of my roommates leaves food lying around everywhere, then complains the loudest about the apartment having mice. 
1	You just described myself as the people you judge very hardly lmao, I have ADHD and those are obvious symptoms of it, so maybe you should be a bit more accepting for people like that, it's not really something we choose, unless we're medicated of course.\nI usually judge people who are manipulative and hypocritical or people who care too much about small things.

8	INTJ vs. ISTP	Hello!\nI've wondered for a few years now what the difference between ISTPs and INTJs is. I'm an INTJ myself, and have always been fascinated by fictional ISTPs and felt a strange kinship to them, and it got me wondering. \nThanks, everyone!
14	At an objective level, the difference between the two is that ISTPs are Ti dominants, Se auxiliary and INTJs are Ni dominants, Te auxiliary.  \nAt a basic level this means that ISTPs like to pick apart and overanalyze things and care about the present moment and INTJs care about their vision and get things done in life.
14	They can look similar. I know I tested as INTJ, INTP and ISTP as a teen fairly fluidly. Problem solving techniques can look similar outwardly. I have a INTJ brother and best friend. \n\nI think main difference is...Te (no matter where it’s placed in a stack) has an emphasis on WHAT. What it takes to get x done. \n\nTi digs much deeper. It answers WHAT right away but finds the challenge in finding the BEST answer for it. Ti is subjective so this could be best in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, looks, time, etc. \n\nNewbie Ti looks overly detailed over-worked compared to Te (and it is!) because we spend so much time laying foundation but if we keep at something that foundation becomes a wealth of knowledge. Te just gets it done. What do I have to work with? Lets use that. Etc. \n\nTi is slower, more detailed and gets lost in creating the tools we want to work with...then we work! We troubleshoot ourselves. “How can this fuck up?” “What if I did this?” I don’t see Te doing this as a process. \n\nReally great teammates if you can get in the groove with one another. Balance you out. 
3	according to /u/uptimex\n\n>I read somewhere that in most of the movies psychopaths are INTJs, but in real life, most of the psychopaths are ISTPs.
2	If you're interested might want to take a look at complimentary ISTP socionics profiles. They are quite detailed and ones written by Statievskaya tend to be somewhat astonishing:    \n[ISTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ISTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42483) | [ISTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4440-Discussion-of-LSI-ISTj-Subtypes?p=142621&viewfull=1#post142621)    \n   \n[INTJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ILI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INTJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42488) | [INTJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/15943-INTp-ILI-Subtypes?p=283525&viewfull=1#post283525)    \n
4	How does Ti works?	Hi everyone! I'm probably an Isfp, surely an Isxp, so I'd like to understand your type a little better.\n\nI suppose that it is a question you've been asked billions of times, anyway how does  your Ti work in practical terms?
9	Ways that I understand my Ti are:\n -When I was younger, I decided that the best way to handle anything was to consider every side of the issue and all possible outcomes, and prepare for it. I learned later that this is typical Ti.\n -I'm *really* into semantics. Different words and ways of saying things have different denotations and connotations, and exact phrasing is an important way of how I communicate myself to the world and how I gather information from it. Basically, I think a lot about word order and choice. A guy I was dating once had a "talk" with me, in which he asked that I not get caught up questioning/correcting the details of his speech so long as I could pick up his general meant. Big sign we weren't meant to be. I tend to take things pretty literally, so accuracy is important.\n -When trying to make a decision, someone with Te will jump on every not-bad food option. "Let's go!" It's always jarring to me. "What, no, wait, we need to think about this for a second." My Ti needs likes the shoe to fit juuust right. How far is it? How expensive is it? How recently have I eaten it? Is it really something I should be eating at 10 PM? Etc.
4	Thinking about things deeply for ourselves to understand. Te is the opposite; absorbs outside information, usually not questioning it.
3	Ti is simply the classic meaning of "Im thinking (about it/her/something/whatever)". You take all the information you already know and sort out the truth of the matter.\n\nWhat complicates matters is that ISTPs also have Ni. Older, experienced and more mature ISTPs dont need to put as much explicit thought into things as our subconscious brains have become really good at analyzing in the background and promote answers to our conscious selves with no explicit effort.
2	My understanding of the world matters most to me. I don’t care about my personal values or value-system (Fi). 
6	Am I a female ISTP or INFJ?	So for a while I’ve believed I’m an INFJ because that’s what I was told I was. But sometimes I wonder if I’m an ISTP. Here are my reasons \n\n- I like to work with my hands. I love creating things. I like to take old furniture and revamp it into something new. Create art. I enjoy pottery.\n- I also like kickboxing and going to the gym \n- I set goals for myself and I do it\n- I want to help my friends when they’re sad, but I don’t know how. I don’t know the right things to say. \n- I live for myself. If someone insults me I just think “well I’ve heard worse from better!” \n- I do what I want\n- I know what I want\n\nHere’s why I continue to think I may be an INFJ\n- I’m chatty. I like to talk to people. It may take me a bit to get fully comfortable with people, but I do like to talk \n- I’m not very sporty. Besides the gym and kickboxing I don’t do much\n- I’m very expressive in my face (high Fe?)\n- Not entirely aware of how I come across to others\n- I like to focus on the future. My goals. What I want in life. 
13	I'm gonna say INFJ because istps aren't exactly known to be very goal-oriented or focused on the future
10	Seconding that ISTPs arent goal or future oriented.  We even just had a thread about how we don't have goals/dreams.
6	I wish I could tell, but for some reason I can't indicate. Some of the points were mentioned has to do more with a person than a type. So perhaps if you could expand somehow or give more examples?
4	I'll say ISTP\n\nObviously for the reasons you provided, but, also, here are some rebuttals against the contrary:\n\n> I’m very expressive in my face \(high Fe?\) \n\nActually could be a sign of repressed Fe. Just a question to ask yourself: *Is it too much? Is it tone deaf, or shallow?* If you answered *no* then that particular point is moot.\n\n> Not entirely aware of how I come across to others \n\nAn INFJ would likely be painfully over\-aware \(even making up what other people think of them\) \[but I can't be sure I'm not an INFJ\]\n\n> I like to focus on the future. My goals. What I want in life. \n\nAnd I'm an ENTP who cares what people like and value. You could be an ISTP w/ good Ni.\n\nFinally: none of your pro\-INFJ points were *"hnnnng I care sooooo deeeply for everyone and everythiiing", "I'm like an emotional sponge", "Man I try so hard to help comfort my friends but no one comforts meeeee",* >!"tfw no ENTP bf".!<\n\nYeah. That's what I gather from your post.
4	You are an INFJ. You Ni is pretty strong in the information given and even the way you phrase your sentences using words which exude self-oriented certainty/goal. \n\nISTPs don’t really put so much value on Ni-things because that function contradicts Ti (the motherfucker who always questions the reason of everything we’re “supposed” to do e.g. Do I really have to do that? Why it should be done? Is it necessary? Is it urgent? Will it bring so much stress? What will I get from it? Is the world going to eat me up if I won’t do it? Etc...) \n\nTi scans everything. Se is a decision maker. So it’s all about what can be done (to perfection) in the present. \n\nISTPs care about the here-and-now, and it’s something I haven’t seen in your post. \n\n“I don’t know the right things to say”. \n\nISTPs know. We simply don’t say it unless it’s going to help or asked. \n\nI can be wrong. 
2	Little do people know, ISTP with Ti - Se - Ni is adept at goal setting. Ni provides much fore-vision while Se - Ti take care of the details. What they are not good at is following a strict schedule, whether made by themselves or others. Ti - Se prompt independent timetable, result oriented progress.
2	Probably ISTP or another SP type. Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.    \n \n[INFJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=IEI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INFJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42491) | [INFJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/44198-IEI-INFp-Subtypes?p=40033&viewfull=1#post40033)    \n\n[ISTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ISTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42483) | [ISTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4440-Discussion-of-LSI-ISTj-Subtypes?p=142621&viewfull=1#post142621)    \n
1	How old are you?   \nI'd say ISTP. I can relate to all the above except for "I’m very expressive in my face". I have goals and I know what I want in life but that didn't come to me until late 20's. 
1	I can't see J in your behavior. But also I can't see ISTPs awkward half\-cold and oriented on physical senses behavior. Is it possible that you are INFP or ISFP? 
1	Oh, and one more thing to distinguish the two types. Auxiliary Extraverted Sensing of ISTP contribute to a “silent” impression of the individual as s/he immerses in Se mode, even in the face of extraordinary scenes such as natural landscapes or manmade marvels, ISTP would rarely exclaim about the Extraverted Sensing beauty in front of them. This is because of inferior Fe being uncomfortable in talking too much (too much in ISTP’s sense), and auxiliary Se’s simple need of just silently watch things. Meanwhile, INFJ with auxiliary Fe will want to share their feelings to form conventional bonds, their inferior Se is easily amazed by what they perceived as extraordinary aesthetic beauty, which they are quick to comment with others. Think about whether you are more comfortable continue being silent or better off discussing the contents of your mind. 
1	have you considered any other types? ISFP, INTJ, etc?\n\nhonestly, I could go either way on ISTP vs INFJ (and as a very tomboyish / rugged INFJ, I def feel your pain on this)
26	What do you do in your spare time?	I basically just watch YouTube videos or movies, listen to music, read Twitter and browse reddit in my spare time. I’m 24 and can’t help like feeling like I should be doing something more productive, but I already feel quite content.\n\nAnything more feels like work or too much effort when I’d rather just be relaxing alone. I wish I lived on the beach or mountainside then at least I could say I was taking in my surroundings but I’m mostly in my bedroom. Does anyone else relate?
26	Just turned 28. All of the same things as you, sans Twitter. \n\nI also run (ran my first marathon yesterday! it hurts), do indoor climbing, and work on [hobby Android apps](https://gitlab.com/davidwhitman/eventvods) (but usually in spurts of motivation; I've been working on being disciplined about it but it is challenging). \n\nMy advice is to turn off the computer and the phone, anything with a screen. Do it for 20 minutes. \n\nWhy? Because the mind gets into a loop and it takes a little shock to break out of it. You want to do more productive things and "get out there", but it's nigh impossible to see how because your comfort zone won't let you. I struggle with this often, but was fortunate enough to be with someone for a time that taught me to recognize the pattern and fight it.\n\nTurn that shit off, and go into a different room and sit on the floor. Grab a whiteboard and a marker. Go outside and take a walk. No phone. \n\nGo to a classroom with a blackboard and chalk. Sit still somewhere and focus on your breathing. Take a notebook and pencil. \n\nWrite down what you did yesterday. Write down a list of people that you want to catch up with but have been unconsciously avoiding. Write down a few people that you want to talk to but almost never have. Write down something that you want to sign up for; dance lessons, a gym program, an intro to climbing, a race or couch to 5k, speed dating, a yoga class, something. \n\nBite off more than you think you can chew. Shortly after college, I signed up for a Tough Mudder with some friends. They had all recently trained for a marathon; I had never run more than maybe 6 miles at once and was not at all in shape. But I took the leap and signed up with them, then trained for 6 months and was able to do it when the time came. Fast forward seven years and I never stopped training. It's so easy to look at a dancer, or a runner, or someone who looks fit, or a public speaker, and imagine that they've always been like that.\n\nNah. Everyone started somewhere. Take a break from the comfort zone, just long enough to commit to something that scares you. Then rise to the challenge, work for it, and it'll become part of you and take you places you can't expect. You're surrounded by people who are, like you, trying to step out of their comfort zone and try something new. Get out there and you'll naturally group together, building each other up and slowly drawing each other into new things. That, to me, is fulfillment. 
15	I'd like to say I draw, read, and be productive, but in reality I pretty much do what you do. 
6	The older I get, the more restless I get. You sound like me when I was in my 20s, but now that I'm closer to 40, I can never stop. Perhaps it has a lot to do with me being in school while working full time for so long that I got used to just always being busy.\n\nGeocaching, kayaking, writing and recording music (play guitar, bass, piano, drums, sing). Every now and then I'll play video games, but that's one of the things that I've all but lost interest in over time. I'd rather experience real life these days.\n
3	Reddit and video games.  I do a little fishing too.  I used to play a lot of pool, but I don’t have access to a free table anymore.  Lately I’ve been screwing around with an Arduino 
3	pretty much the same for me and im 22. I stay in my bedroom but ive picked up a few hobbies that make me feel like im being productive in some way. I make shitty bedroom beats, i do photography and im into cars. i also got into PC's a few years back so i built a personal gaming rig. Some goddamn expensive hobbies of mine but they all take up my time which makes me feel like im constantly doing something productive
3	Yeah, I hear you. \n\nIt’s good to get out now and then, though. \n\nI’m fortunate to live in an area where I can walk to the ocean from my house, so sometimes I just talk a long-ass walk. \n\nMost of the time though it’s just video games or books or the occasional gal pal. 
3	I watch YouTube, do Brazilian jiu jitsu, play video games (fortnite, chess, clash of clans), practice the piano, research things I want in my life, ponder my goals/purpose/path/self, work on my side business with my friend
3	I'm also 24. I watch youtube videos, do a little side job to make some money, attend college (which doesn't mean I study), jog once in a while. I used to watch movies/tv-shows a lot but now I get bored super quickly and go do something else.\nI also reply to my friends' texts (they always text first). Idk why they reach out tbh, I'm not entertaining and I'm very introverted. And I scroll on tumblr if I'm really bored and reblog stuff I find funny. And there's that.
2	I just put a principle for me to meet someone new when I have time and want to relax. Actually it is not very relaxing, but I have some routines that I repeat all the time and master them with every new person, so it is pretty much joyful to improve your skills of communication. \n\nIf no one new or worth to go out with, then TV shows, maybe little gaming, a movie, Facebook chat, Reddit, materials about MBTI or something else \(but useful\). \n\nAnyway if you want to get pattern of how ISTP chooses how to spend time: it must be fun & useful. If any of this parameters do not match, ISTP just won't do that. 
2	ISTPs have strong Se (as do other SPs), so we often don't have a big vision like Ni users and we don't have the best memory like Si users, so most of the time we don't really have an aim in life, or we at least tend to forget it and become too complacent.
2	depends. i like things that give that dopamine flow upon completion. fixing shit, making things look purrrty, ie. washing a car, refurbrishing old junk, restoration bla bla. making unnecessary life hacks/improvements, coding. entertainment (games, movies, mainstream time consuming garb) bores me to death aside from music which I also try to limit as to not get carried away. hell i even like cooking, slong is it's from scratch
2	Mostly the same as you. Recently though I’ve made extra effort to get out. I’m content, but only for now. One day I know I’ll need more so I figured I’d start now. \n\n\nI added 3-4 days of gym and a weekly bible study to my schedule. Just getting out of the house more often has really helped my mood. 
2	I'm 21 and I just read, listen to music, watch series and movies and play crossword puzzles
2	Im 25 and this sounds a lot like me too, except instead of youtube and music its video games and netflix. Its easy to say that if you lived somewhere else that your life would be different but I live by the beach and I still end up spending 90% of my time inside.\nEven with a full time job and graduate schoolI have this nagging feeling that I could be doing more with my life, even though like you said I'm usually pretty content. Recently I started walking and running though, I found out lately my mood is directly tied to how much physical activity I get.\n\nOne thing I found really helpful is to not turn on your computer when you wake up or get home unless you have to. If you have a list of things to do, do everything that doesn't involve technology first. It really cuts down on distractions. 
2	After I've cooked dinner, I put my headphones on, listen to some music and read a book with a cup of tea. In summer, i sit outside. In winter, i sit inside. Even if I only have 30 mins, it makes me feel more relaxed.\n\nI also go outdoor climbing at the weekend, I'm a member of a reading club. I play darts regularly. I meet lots of people through work and I'm communicating all day, but I do want to spend time with people where I'm not working. Just depends on your interests dude, you'll find something.
1	I watched John Fish on YouTube  and adopted his strategy for productivity. I’ve never been more productive... 
1	Videogames, Netflix, drinking, and the occasional going out with friends. Basically sums it up
1	Youtube takes up most of the time, some gaming here and there, reddit, Discord... And drinking whenever I can.\n\nSometimes, on a blue moon, if I wake up early and I'm in a good mood, I like to go out for a jog. After so much enclosing, it's refreshing to get some fresh air and exercise.
1	I'm 27 and don't have or want any hobbies. YouTube or documentaries while solving a Rubik's cube or sudoku and drinking coffee.. that's living.  I live near the fjords in Norway and can go there when I want, or just go up one of the 7 mountains around my city.. but I never do that though.  The last times I went for a walk in nature was with beer after midnight.  
1	I’m playing video games, reading books and I’m very into cycling 
1	Work on my car or random junk in the garage.
1	Gardening. I love it, the independence, saving money, rewards.
5	Love And friendship	What is your definition of love or friendhsip?\nI want to have a definition, even if i know those are vague words, because I don't consider to love or to have a strong friendship with anybody on earth. So maybe with some kind of definition I could have a better understanding of those feelings. 
6	The definition of love changes as you get older and go through more life-defining experiences. A 12 year old and a 50 year old can certainly both experience romantic love, but they will be very different.
6	I can't put it into definitions nor I am best with short and accurate posts, as I tend to go in way too much details\n\nLove, I have been in love before and for me it wasn't about stomach butterflies, TV romance cliches etc. it is about having someone I could 100&#37; trust, rely on, be completely open and honest with, while not being annoyed when they needed the same from me. They also had something that was always impressive to me, so I didn't get bored over time kept me attracted to them\n\nAs for paternal/family love, my all family doesn't do hugs, nobody ever said "I love you" as far as I can remember to each other, but we all know we do. It is more about mutual respect, support and acknowledgement within family and for parents being grateful they raised me well.\n\nFriendship, I never had lifelong one best friend, I never moved cities or schools or anything, but somehow I am always only able to have that bff close friendship, sort of synergy, where both get naturally along and together are better as we compliment each other in many ways, only for limited time, few years maximum, then it will start deteriorating as we gradually each start following different paths. \n\nCurrently I am in strange period of life when it comes to relationships. I moved from Europe to Asia for work, alone, I didn't know anyone here, didn't really make any close buddies at work nor found romantic relationship, so went with the mindset of being fine alone, which I am finally realizing and admitting to myself failed miserably after 2 years and I genuinely feel lonely now, which is something I would have never thought can happen to me. \n\nI am not depressed or anything, I am putting myself out there and slowly building new social circles upon realization, but it does play tricks on your mind and your behavior and it is quite fascinating experience.
4	Here’s my definitions. \n\n\nLove: a non decisive unconditional attachment to someone. I personally believe you don’t choose who you love. And I do mean that in both romantic and non romantic ways. I don’t love all of my friends and I haven’t loved all my SO’s. But when you know, you know. I’ve found that truly loving someone means to fully accept them for who they are. Every good and bad thing about them. \n\n\n\nFriendship: friendship and love go hand in hand. As you should love your best of friends like family. To me it’s basically an understanding between two people. Two people who really get eachother become good friends. 
3	it depends, most people never find the love they're looking for in life, if you get it, then you probably know my definition. it's almost when two puzzle pieces fit together in terms of shape and look.\n\non the contrary..\n\nthere are people who plaster themselves about being "professionals in knowing what love is" sharting out quotes of rumi, mahatma, some dumbass with (literally) a plant pot on his head and other garbage, poetry, some books they haven't read, one being "it is only with the heart one can see clearly .. yadayada [bullshit].. for what's essential cannot be seen" yet, irl they're blind as fuck, racist, judgemental, define themselves as "in relationship with god" as a defense mechanism for *still* being single at 32, bring me a fuckin barf bag
2	My definition is the same one you can find in any dictionary. 
16	What are your most important worries right now?	Some friends are slowly recognizing that I have high-level skills to offer (and it’s natural for me to help as long as it’s “in the moment” kind of need), but lately I often end up in occasions (conversations/parties) where I’m floored by their validations while being mentioned in their future/long-term plans/projections and that they assume I am equally invested and will help. \n\nA perfect example is my ENTP friend asked me to sketch a logo for her business (high end villas) and I ended up doing it. Then these series of “in the moment” help led to me doing the photography, interior design (staging the villas) and the website. \n\nWTF. \n\nI usually don’t talk about nor respond to these things around people. I am not sure if it’s my baby Fe acting out, but I think I’m giving them a wrong impression. And yet my INFP best friend told me today, “Because you’re too kind. You don’t have to do that.” \n\nWhat do you think? Can you relate? And what worries do you have? \n\nNote: I appreciated all your insights. This subreddit is such a comfort. 
26	Anyone else here seem to only exist to other people when they need something from you?
9	I’m a very good natured and helpful individual. Don’t take advantage of it.\n\nIf you think you are going to take advantage of my good nature you may find yourself on the wrong end of a very demeaning and hurtful tirade. You may end up in your room crying. 
7	For me:\n\n- I ran two races in the last couple of weeks and didn't do as well as I wanted to on either. Silver lining is that now I'm more determined to train harder, and now that the races are done I can focus on training for a Spartan. \n\n- My memory seems to be terrible and it leaks into everything. Hard to have a great conversation because I often don't have much to provide; no fun stories from my past, no interesting bits of information, I forget it all. Hard to answer "just a quick question" at work because I never have it off the top of my head. Hard to remember if I've met coworkers before, sometimes (usually ones I met at a party or something). \n\nI am in a similar situation with helping out friends, although I have only myself to blame. We decided to work on a video game together, but I can never summon the energy to work on it, as we're all distributed. I'd much rather work on my own projects, even though I know the social reward of building something with friends will be much higher. 
7	You know the saying "perform a miracle and they'll add it to your job description"? It's the bane of my existence. 
7	I hope you're being paid \(and backed with a good contract\) and just don't do everything out of generosity because in the end it may bite you in the ass i.e. end up being responsible for all issues arising in her business with no gratitude in return. \n\nI will still do things out of goodwill for the people I care, and because I want to do it, but in the past I often had to ask myself if so or so person would still be around if I refused to help them.
2	There’s a very blurry line between being used as help and just plain being used. \n\n\nHelping your friend with a few logos or photos when she’s in a crunch is one thing. But if she’s basically having you do her work for her, it’s totally acceptable to ask for compensation. She’s using you for your skills so you get to put the stipulations on it. \n\n\nThe other thing is, what do you get back in return? Life and relationships are about give and take. If you’re constantly doing things for them without getting anything in return, it’s a one sided “relationship”. And it’s not that you should *expect* something in return, it’s that true friends would *want* to return the favor. It’s the principal of the matter, not the lack of getting anything in return. \n\n\nMy personal thing is, I’m more than happy to use my skill set to help friends who also return the favor. For example helped Work on a friends car in college while she was tutoring me. It felt like a fair trade off to me so I was totally okay with it. However, if she was refusing to tutor me while also asking me to help her with her car, I’d be asking her to compensate me for my time. (Mostly because at that time, working on engines was my actual job). 
2	I can relate, someone even asked me if I'd draw and paint their floor, for free, because I can draw. At the time I didn't decline, I said something like "i see".\nI find it hard to decline doing favors because my first thought is usually "can I solve this?" rather than considering how much time and effort it would take, I also prefer people to like me so that I'm comfortable around them. I'm currently working on that. What worries me at this moment is money and college classmates bugging me to study.
1	That’s great you have many skills. I’m sure there may be times in the future you may want to use those skills to help your friends, but you can always politely decline.\n\nI think showing them you can be a friend in other ways is good, so they don’t think there is only one way to be friends with you. Show interest in their life, have chill hang outs, be supportive in their personal stuff... whatever things you feel more comfortable with 
1	Idk what to say about your situation. Just dont let people take advantage of you tho.\nAs for me, I have no worries right now...I think. 
1	> I’m floored by their validations while being mentioned in their future/long-term plans/projections and that they assume I am equally invested and will help.\n\nLOL, I tell em no, they even include me in some of their projects that never happen, I just leave.\n\nBiggest lesson you can take from those things is people will say a lot of shit, but actions speak louder than words (i know, i hate that quote too, overused by crybabies on fb, etc)\n\n--\n\naside from that, yes, this also happens with old folk too. i'm not gonna get into specifics as idk who knows my reddit account, but there are times when something needs to get done that's been literally fucked up by a *professional*, then I *have* to fix it for them for like 1/10 of the cost coz i'm not *certified*. not only that, but they watch me like a hawk too, but trust professionals with any fantasy story they tell them.
1	I won't find my life path
0	hey,istps how good are you at?	how good are you at self hypnosis?.eg if you forggot something be able to enter a meditative state to retrieve that information.or using auto suggestion?
10	Never tried it. I'm gonna.\n\nUnless I forget to. Boy, wouldn't that be ironic.
5	If I forget something, it's not important to solving whatever problem is in front of me. I'll find another way to fix it.
3	never tried it
2	I’ve never forgotten anything.
2	Tried and yeah you can use it. You can use non\-direct hypnosis. Established by Milton Ericson and called after his name, Ericsonian Hypnosis.\n\nBut I guess you will need a lot of experimenting to master it.\n\nJust one advice, try it only in one location. Because it sometimes sticks to a specific location. Like I was doing it in library, and after some practice I was entering hypnotic state automatically. It can be not dangerous but not efficient, when using it in different places. You can enter that state not in right place and time.
2	How much weed did you smoke before you wrote this?
53	I laughed.	
15	Couldn't agree more lmao
8	I'm a bit more social than the average ISTP, but this is SO accurate for my different-typed friends. I laughed too.
8	I really feel like I've found my people
4	I think they mixed up the ESTP and the ESTJ
2	What does the ISTJ one mean?
2	As A 16 year old, I would have supremely identified with "FUCK OFF", but Ive mellowed out a lot since then. Of everything on that chart, I most identify with "not one but three WMDs" but mostly because I enjoy making things and destruction (I am both BLU team *and* RED team ?!).
1	Lols should check on my beloved ENFP sister. 
6	About ISTP's commitments problem, maybe a solution	I found something about ISTP commitment problem. Is it a solution, what do you think?\n\n>At the heart of your desire to avoid commitments is likely the fear of losing yourself by integrating your life with another’s – the idea of losing your independence is downright suffocating. For you, it may just be a matter of slowing down. Rather than constantly trying to infuse excitement and disruption into your life by any means necessary, consider how your partner feels when you prioritize your own needs and desires over theirs. While it’ll be to your benefit to choose a partner who respects your need for space and maintains their own sense of independence in the relationship as well, learning how to stick to your commitments and at the same time stay in the present will be your challenge.\n\n[https://thoughtcatalog.com/kathryn\-stanley/2015/06/each\-myers\-briggs\-types\-fatal\-flaw\-in\-relationships\-and\-what\-to\-do\-about\-it/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/kathryn-stanley/2015/06/each-myers-briggs-types-fatal-flaw-in-relationships-and-what-to-do-about-it/)
5	I don't think we'll ever get over our commitment problems, it's integral to our identity. Of course, the dream is that we'll find someone worth committing to...someone who completes us in a way that bring astronomically more value to our life than our independence was. Being Ti-Doms we all know ourselves intimately, so when that person comes along, it shouldn't be hard to recognize.
5	Just recently expressed my need to stay independent to my boyfriend of almost a year and it went pretty well. At first he was hurt but when I explained myself he started to see where I was coming from. We settled on a compromise that once every week I have an "alone day" where I'm not expected to see or do anything with anybody and in exchange when we are together I give him my 100% devoted attention (that's something I've struggled with). \n\nI don't think it's a problem to struggle with codependence or commitment in itself but when you refuse to grow and overcome them (as many ixtps do) that's when it's truly unhealthy. 
3	I don't avoid commitments, it just takes me a long time to commit to something. It takes me awhile to get all the information that I need to make a decision on something including people. But after I commit to someone/thing it would take a lot for me to change my mind again.
-3	Not committing is a problem that needs a solution?\n\nThat’s a load of horse shit. Go back to the SJ forums and leave us the fuck alone. You can’t control us. You see that as a problem. Piss off.
3	Got requested to talk about relationships as an iSTP, maybe few people here will find it interesting.	
8	White Aryan 7'0 CEO God. How can we comprete. 👶🏿
0	Are you sure you're ISTP? I see more Fi instead of a Ti by your body language.
25	Actually stole it from INFPs channel, wanted you to see guys	
20	I don't think we are creative thinkers, we are more down-to-earth thinkers. Oh and after I take a photograph of the pudding I would eat it.
8	I want the ISFP jobs. You could roll them all into one even. You'd be required to have an Etsy store with a job like that.
2	Why evil clone? Lol.\nWhat do evil clones do btw?
3	Useful article about cognitive functions, what do you think?	[https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi\-priebe/2015/12/how\-each\-cognitive\-function\-manifests\-based\-on\-its\-position\-in\-your\-stacking/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/)\n\nWhat do you think about ISTP functions?
3	Interesting read. I honestly never considered that the Ni of an istp could be different than an intj. Don't know how credible this is but good stuff imo.
26	Why are ISTPs so Hot???	-INXP
44	Probably because they haven't moved from the computer for 6 hours and it was in the high 80s today. Open a window up and help 'em out!
47	It seems to me that a great many ISTPs get some of their confidence, and therefore attractiveness, from the fact that they don't seek anyone's approval. \n\nWe have mastered the art of not giving a fuck (unless it *really* matters. Then we put on our ass kicking boots)
38	How *you* doin’?
12	Probably the only type worth losing my Te over lol
12	Because my truck does not have air conditioning 
20	Works better for males than females. Most guys just think I'm an ass
10	Oh piss off. Asocial behavior an an aggressive attitude to those we deem lesser are not attractive qualities 
8	If you saw me you'd change your mind
6	Agreed. Please have mercy on all other types 😥
5	Am I? Haven't seen daylight for years :C \n\nDate-tip: Just intentionaly get something not to work and ask help for fixing it. Even better if you ask how to repair/fix it while we are doing it. There you got your ISTP 
5	Lmao this question, I ask my ISTP boyfriend all the time, he doesnt know either. Anyone care to explain?
3	I'm intp and my husband is istp so I get you lol. I think it's that he lives out in the real world when I'm stuck in my head. It's really exciting to be dragging into the physical world.
7	I read somewhere that in most of the movies psychopaths are INTJs, but in real life, most of the psychopaths are ISTPs.   \nI guess that's why.
2	Oh why thanks.
2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo
1	Depends on what you think an ISTP is. With inferior Fe you should consider us to be awkward as the INTP. Honestly I think INTPs are more attractive because they have Ne/Si and don't stumble over their words.
-7	Personality type has no correlation with appearance.
35	Are you more into the lyrics or the melody in music ?	Personally I'm way more into the melody, I can listen to almost every kind of music according to my mood. I usually don't give many shits about the lyrics.
20	I need both to be fully immersed. I think that's why I'm not much of a fan of the dance genre 
18	Usually I favor the melody but sometimes I enjoy both if the lyrics and the sound of the singer is good.
37	I listen for the sound and not the lyrics.  I can hear the words and even sing along in most cases but in the context of music the actual meaning of the words somehow cease to exist for me; they just become part of the sound.  It doesn't matter if the lyrics are deeply symbolic and metaphorical or very literal.  They just don't process as *words* in my brain.
11	Melody for sure. I have no problems listening to foreign music for this reason. Classical is also really nice.
7	Okay wow:\n\n14 comments for melody\n\n2 for both
7	Lyrics are definitely low priority for me to enjoy music. 
6	I need both. Singing is one of the ways I interact with music. Lyrics don't need to be profound or anything (I mean, I've been singing Super Nice Guys by Undercover S.K.A. all morning and those lyrics are just silly) but they need to be there.
5	Way more into the melody. Yet I like songs, not just instrumentals. Go figure.
4	Melody.  I went to go see Deadpool 2 a couple of weekend and really dug one of the songs they used.  It was about halfway that I realized that the vocalists were basically saying, "holy shitballs" over and over again.  
3	The melody. This is what allows me to enjoy basically all genres.\n
3	Lyrics are nice if they are relatable or tell a storu, but I'm a sucker for good melody.
3	Melody for sure. For an example, the song [You Reposted in the Wrong Neighborhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybxjrKqWdE4) has lyrics taken from the song "Shake That," which is about sex and drugs, but I still find the song calming. I do listen to lyrics, but they merely supplement the melody, and I'm mostly listening to the notes the singer \(if applicable\) and melody make. 
3	Melody. \n\nI even most of the time choose soundtracks or just instrumental things to listen.
3	Melody.\n\nI've gone through phases where I would listen to nothing but music whose lyrics were in languages I didn't understand, usually eastern european rock like Siddharta or Myslovitz. I don't speak Slovenian or Polish. It bothered everyone else, but I liked it.
3	Melody. I often don't even know what the lyrics are saying in the song. Sometimes they can be distracting and I think that's led me to really like music in a foreign language. That way the lyrics just blend into the music.\n\nThat being said most of my favorite artists are ones where I enjoy the lyrics and meaning behind the music as well. 
3	Depends. The first time I hear a song I’m looking for something to grab me. If I like the melody then I’ll listen again and again. The more I listen to it then I’ll look for the lyrics.\n\nThis of course depends on the genre. If it’s metal then the paragraph above is how I go about it. If it’s rap on the other hand, there are usually no instruments being played; it’s all just playback so there’s more of a focus on lyrics. If the lyrics suck, then I probably won’t listen to it.
3	Definitely melody, if there is a voice it is just another instrument.\n\nAlthough I have listened to a lot of Scandroid lately, and the story he tells of Neo Tokyo and Adam7k is pretty cool :)\n\nCome to think of it, I also like and listen to "talking" segments in songs. For example:\n\n\nAlan Watts quotes in some Rameses B songs, \n\n\nOr Richard Dawkins in The Greatest Show on Earth by Nightwish
3	Melody
2	Melody for sure. \n\nGood lyrics is a plus and I appreciate that, but at the same time I don't really care if the lyrics are crap or if I just can't understand them. After all, I listen to music to please my ears. Like, there's a band in my country that I really enjoy, but it took me months of listening to them to notice some of their songs were in my native language and not English.
2	melody
2	This definitely depends song to song. Also of there’s an awesome melody thats one thing, but if it’s delivered with a dope line that invokes a lot of emotion, then that definitely enhances the experience.
2	Melody. I almost only listen to foreign music and metal anyways. I don't really know wtf they are saying without reading lyrics. And I couldn't really like GG Allin's music if I cared about the lyrics.  He has some great melodies but his lyrics are fucked up
2	entj and same 
2	I only care about the lyrics when I'm thinking deeply about the meaning of life or a relationship breakup or something
2	I hear no lyrics when I listen to music. Just melody. So I usually don't know what the songs I listen to are about.😏
2	Melody definitely. I just recently discovered Thomas Bergensen and he's now taking over my entire lyricless playlist
2	Melody for sure. But most of my favourite songs are ones which the lyrics AND melody really resonate with me, so a combination of both is best.
2	Melody ... Half of the music I listen to have no lyrics or have made up words for lyrics.
2	I am more into melody than into lyrics, but I enjoy well-written lyrics that goes along the music (Amon Amarth's theme for example, or some lyrics from the Doom metal band Funeral for example. I did research most SOAD songs lyrics, but only so I can sing them as I'm listening to them since i'm 4 YO. Gotta admit they have pretty good lyrics on some songs though).
1	I am more into the music for sure, I really don't care about the lyrics really. 
1	melody ... /r/postrock
11	ISTP, what do you like more, shooters or stealth actions?	Gaming question to ISTPs, what do you like more, **shooters** \(call of duty etc.\) or **stealth actions** \(splinter cell etc.\)?
21	Rougelikes
13	Stealth for sure i suck at fast paced shooters, open world rpg is my favorite genre pref fantasy setting\n\nI always go with stealth option if the game lets me choose between stealth and balls to the walls\n\nfavorite game for stealth gotta be dishonored series
11	I think a game we would all love to play is METAL GEAR SOLID. Man I was obsessed with it being when I was 12 playing on psp. Executing perfect missions without getting caught...almost orgasmic honestly. 
7	My favorite character in Borderlands 2 is Krieg if that says anything
6	I like fps' but in a shooter campaign where you can choose loud or stealth, always stealth
6	I am currently in a bit of a fighting game phase but I really like shooters and MGS no lie is one of my most favorite series
3	I'll say I'm definitely more into shooters, but I still enjoy stealth games.
3	Both. I thoroughly enjoy call of duty and assassins creed. I suppose it depends on my mood. Sometimes I just feel like fucking shit up and sometimes I feel like precisely and quietly executing a plan. \n\n\nI will say that sniping games/missions very much entertain me. The majority of my personality is more into the meticulous detail and accuracy in sniping. Also my favorite weapon of choice in call of duty. 
3	Stealth all the way. I don't like FPS games at all.  I enjoyed the second and third Metal Gear games but I'm more into fantasy.\n\nAction-adventure, sandbox RPG's are my weakness.
3	Far Cry 3/4 are like the perfect mashup of stealth action and shooting, for me, plus the open world story discovery and hunting/collectibles for unlocks.  Played the shit out them both, multiple times.\n\nPlanetside2, as an MMOFPS is my go to, featuring options for just about every playstyle ever invented.
3	[deleted]
2	Used to play cod casually several years ago on console but after moving to PC I started playing CS:GO. I got good at it very quickly but got burnt out on it so I don’t play it anymore. Now I mostly just play OSRS and other games casually with my friends. 
2	My 3 most played games are CS, Wot and WoW. 
2	I prefer story driven single\-player experiences so it can be a shooter \(Half life 1\-2, Bioshock 1\-2\-I...\) or any kind of other gameplay, mainly 3rd person action games, like Assassin's Creed, Metal gear Solid or even GTA :\)\n\nI never had much interest in "brainless" shooters though like Doom, Serious Sam, Wolfenstein, CoD and the like even if I did complete a couple when I was younger.
2	Racing games or turn based strategy 
2	anything that doesn't feel like a waste of time (saves progress, ranks, etc), and you can modify the code in. which is why i don't play games 
2	Stealth, I love Metal Gear Solid games and I also used to play a lot of Payday 2 stealth.\nBut I also love FPS games, I spent 1600+ hours into TF2, and I used to play CSGO a lot as well.
2	Def. Stealth, but I'm a lot into the story of the game (wich is why I love the Witcher trilogy so much. The politics in it is really interesting.)
2	Stealth, definitely. Love it, idk why its just really thrilling, really fun. Sly thievious raccoon was a fav for most of it until it just became about minigames.

10	"Any job worth doing, is worth doing right." Agree?	
6	I agree, but only if you define a job "worth doing" as something you are motivated to do. 
7	Of course, in principal. \n\nIf I’m tired I may half ass it. 
4	If you're fresh out of high school, yes.
2	That's what my dad always told me. \n\nBut whenever I didn't do it right if get in trouble do it's definitely conditioned, not my true nature.
2	What is "doing right". If you are about "acting according the plan" it is sometimes useless.
2	I'm either all in or don't do it at all. I can do stuff half-assed, but I know that I did it that way and it kind if bothers me. This mostly applies to big jobs and cleaning though.
2	depends
1	My inner perfectionism just got tickled.
1	You go slower when you're in a rush.\n\n
9	ISTP congnitive functions, what does every function do?	ISTPs cognitive functions are \- Ti, Se, Ni, Fe.\n\n1. My questions is what does every function do?\n2. And if there are any loops besides Ti\-Ni and Ti\-Se, could you say how do they work?\n\nIDK, for example\n\nTi\-Fe,\n\nSe\-Fe,\n\nNi\-Fe,\n\nSe\-Ni\n\netc.
18	*inhale*\n\nFirst, I like to think of functions as skills, and you like to use the skills you're good at more than those which do not reward you as much. To be precise they are skills we use to satisfy the human needs of: Identity (Ti - that of reasons, Fi - that of values), Validation (Te - that of reasons, Fe - that of values), Order (Si - that of observable facts and things, Ni - that of abstract patterns), and Gathering (Se - that of observable facts and things, Ne - that of abstract patterns). Second, beyond the conscious functions, the first four, three of the other four may be used unconsciously; synthesized by the interaction between a function and the function below it; when a function is synthesized, it takes on the type of the initial function (T, F, S, N) and the attitude of the second (e, i). Ok here we go:\n\nTi - skilled at focusing on and knowing the reasoning and logic of the self. Prefers its own reasoning over that of others making it highly original in its logical technique. Differs from Te which looks for objective reasoning, that which is easily expressed to others; ISTPs have decent amounts of unconscious Te via Ti-Se.\n\nSe - skilled at gathering observable facts and things. Very efficient at absorbing concrete information. Differs from Si which organises observable facts and things; ISTPs have a little unconscious Si via Se-Ni.\n\nNi - skilled at organising abstract patterns. Focuses on specific meanings and ideas. Differs from Ne which gathers abstract patterns; ISTPs have very little unconscious Ne via Ni-Fe.\n\nFe - skilled at harmonising with group values. Focuses on the objectively valuable, that which is easily explained to others. Differs from Fi which focuses on knowing the values of the self; ISTPs have almost no Fi whatsoever as it is made redundant by such high Ti, and there is no conscious function below Fe to synthesise it.\n\nThat's a pretty accurate way of describing without erroneous fluff (which is not all bad, as such descriptions can help people get a feeling of a function they don't have but it also leads to a lot of mistyping).\n\nAs for loops, there is only the first-third one; other interactions are described differently.\nUnderstanding the first-third is quite simple: the first function is obviously used almost all the time, but what's so special about the third function? Well the third function may often be used by less mature, or just down-on-their-luck individual to mask or cushion the failures of the fourth: as a coping mechanism. However, it is not a well developed function and its use may not be appropriate so this can be a problem; extroverts may neglect their inner world (ExxP - neglect inner judgements/actions, ExxJ - ignore inner perceptions) and introverts may neglect the outer world (IxxP - ignore outer perceptions, IxxJ - neglect outer judgements/actions).\n\n
5	Your cognitive functions are way more interconnectef than you think. Analysing them seperately Ti is very “self”  attributed cognitive function. Thus Ti are very in touch of what their self wants and thinks at the very moment, usually not really concerned about the “others”.  You could essentially see that this forms a very contrasting relationship with your Fe. Fe, if beimg a dominant function being all about the external relations and emotional behaviour/ understanding. According to NT Support, the functions were made essentially to protect your last inferior one, thus being so contrary to each other. Each of them relates greatly and form a slightly different way how they would work. Eg. Te with ENTJs and ESTJs work very differently as supported by different 2ndary function: entj are thus more planning in the long term visionsry way, whilst estj would end up beimg visionaries.\nSo with ISTP your Ti would support focus and accuracy in all those Se adrenalin driven activities you do. \nI would reccomend lots of googling, own observation and discussion with people interested in the same topic. Alternatively PersonalityHack podcasts are pretty cool too. There is too much info about it to just be shrunk into a reply. And at the end of the day, it all honestly depends on the context of the person in his life.\n
15	Technical skill vs creativity and originality in ISTPs	I practice drawing, dance, and playing keyboard. I'd like to take up painting eventually. I used to dabble in writing fiction and poetry but I never had any ideas of WHAT to write. Nowadays when I look at most poetry I don't "get" it.\n\nI've noticed that while my technical skills in these three hobbies I've taken up are getting noticeably better - my ability to create anything original is nonexistent. The concept of "inspiration" is lost on me even. Maybe the fact that I said "hobbies" rather than "passions" is a clue :/\n\nThe ability to improvise during dance does not come naturally and any attempt at improvising usually throws me off. After almost a year I can't seem to find my own style - I am just mimicking what I see down to the exact movement.\n\nImproving at playing keyboard has been slow and painstaking. It takes me an excruciatingly long time to learn anything and it has not gotten easier with time. At this point it's easy to admit that I lack any natural talent when it comes to music. And yeah, I can't write music at all. I can only learn to play what others have written.\n\nIt is probably telling that when it comes to drawing and painting - I strongly prefer realism over abstract. Realistic depictions of nature and figures are my favorite. I couldn't sketch you a wilderness scene to save my life UNLESS you put the forest in front of me. Then I can copy it in decent detail. \n\nLol at this point I feel like a wanna be ISFP. Maybe if I really apply myself I'll be a backup dancer, studio musician, or an art forger someday -_-\n\nSo how about you guys? What do the artistically minded ISTPs think?
7	I have no creative talent. I relate to a lot of what you say, I know what you mean.  \nIf you asked me to draw something, I'd draw a stickman. But if you put something in front of me, I would be able to [replicate](https://pre00.deviantart.net/a248/th/pre/i/2011/240/1/0/olivia_sketch_1_by_jeniusjj-d48318h.jpg) exactly what I see.  \nWhen it comes to music, I think you just need to practice. Keyboard/piano is one of the harder instruments to learn because there are just so many notes you have to play at the same time. I wouldn't say you suck at it until you've tried playing 3 hours a day for a number of years. There's many ways to improve at music, like learning how to chunk, doing scales, arpeggios, chords, finger placement. If you can type fairly fast on the computer keyboard then I'm sure you have the talent to play music.
4	I am a hobby songwriter/musician/sound engineer. I feel the same way: I can put together pieces if you ask me, and I will do it exceptionally well, but embracing my artistic side is a constant challenge. It’s partially because I look at it like fulfilling a contract rather than creating something.  I need puzzle pieces, but who makes the pieces?\n\nBut, everything in life is derivative- it’s your perspective that is dragging you down, because other people don’t judge your work the same way you do. Pure id creativity is not a thing, and that is not what gives artistic merit.  Sometimes uniquely combining things is more interesting to others than we think.\n\nThe breakthrough for me was learning to be more vulnerable and less judgmental of myself- trying to judge my art from a more distanced perspective, and embrace my art more enthusiastically. You need to indulge your emotional side sometimes, and grow it like a seed, and be positive toward yourself. \n\nWhen I first record a song, I’m like “this is garbage”.  It’s very rare for me to give myself an ounce of credit.  But I go back and listen to the songs I’ve made all these years and I feel great about them. They’re something that I can build with my hands and my mind that will last as long as humans have ears, unlike so many other things, and it’s worth it even if it only makes me happy.\n\nYou are what you let yourself be.  Don’t be afraid of failure. Even if you do the stupidest first idea that comes to your head, it helps you learn to be better next time. And here’s a secret: people like vulnerable, non-perfect people because they’re less intimidating.\n\nSome things that can help-\n* Take an improv comedy class. It is terrifying but it really helps with the mental blockade. It’s not that you can’t improvise, but that you don’t allow yourself to.\n\n* Look into Song Fight if you’re dedicated to music - it solves a lot of the “I need a prompt and a kick in the ass” problem. You get a title and a week to submit an MP3 to compete with others for votes. I’m currently in a similar contest that spans a song for 8 weeks. I hate it but I love it.\n\n* Talk to yourself about the things you are most afraid of even thinking, let alone saying to others. Why do you do the things you do? Why do you assume the things you do? Answer those questions to the very core level. It’s so easy to create a lackadaisical blind spot when you’re afraid of honesty. This is just another thing I thought of and added as a bullet point because I’m on my phone, but it ties to everything else. 
4	I took up painting briefly. Maybe I didn't give it a fair shake, but I could never really come up with something of my own to paint. Just copied another piece or painted a landscape I was at.
4	I don't have a creative bone in my body.\n\nI can tell you what's wrong with anything though
4	My best art is as an internet troll.\n\nEmbrace your ISTPness.
3	I have no creative vision but I'm great at taking something someone else has started and tweak it to make my own. I love arranging music but every attempt I try at composing I get too worked up in the details and end up giving up because progress becomes so slow in making sure every track blends and meshs perfectly before moving on. 
3	I manage/maintain a small group of websites for work and I built our main highest traffic site and several others but I did not design them.  Basically we hire designers to do all of the creative elements and I plug it all in and make everything work. I am good with various design software packages as tools but not as a means to be creative. If you give me an example and say I want a page that looks and works like this I can do it but I can’t generate original content. 
3	If you're not naturally good at something, I suggest asking yourself why you want to keep doing it, and then find a way to fulfill that need in a way that is more agreeable to you.\n\nBy all means if you enjoy dancing/painting/whatever keep doing it, but if you are frustrated at not being a super creative choreographer, what is it that keeps you trying? Is it because you want the recognition? Do you want to create something and have people appreciate it? Do you want to be seen as an artsy person? Is there something inside of you that needs to get out but you don't know how? Or is it something else?\n\nNo matter what your reason is, you can find something that satisfies it and better suits your natural talents so you can avoid the frustration. 
3	My ability to create extends as far as what I can already see. I absolutely suck at drawing. But LEGO? I can make anything out of LEGO.
2	depends on the chemical makeup in my bod at the given moment
2	I get a lot of creative EDM beats when on acid
2	I enjoy drawing, but I find it really hard to draw anything other than faces when I'm drawing without references. The expressions I draw are often stoic too, unless I'm feeling strong emotions. After years and years' worth of drawing portraits, I can say that I've certainly improved, but my drawings are boring as hell. Even with prompts like Inktober, I still have difficulty in making creative pieces. Like you, I can't understand how inspiration works. I think I can feel inspired by other artists' works, but I don't get how it's supposed to manifest.  
2	I relate to what you just said. I've played guitar for now 6-7 years, and I can't write a single song. Though I can play a lot of riffs, and can even re-play some basic riffs I hear almost perfectly (Seems like I got THE ear, I like that tbh!)
12	How exactly are ISTPs supposed to break their notorious Ti-Ni loops?	Most of the things I've seen online don't exactly spell it out in a way that I can understand. "Your Se is being ignored - do something that engages it" is the best understanding I've come to. And the answer within that seems to be to do something physical that will thrill us, engage our five senses, exercise, solve a physical problem (fix something) etc. \n\nAm I understanding it correctly? Am I missing something, or is this it?
8	As introverts, we are naturally more likely to prefer our introverted functions and ignore the external world. And if you ignore the external world, you can get into a rut where you constantly loop over what is logical based on your past Ni experiences, without actually testing it in the real world.  \nIt's interesting to think about, but Ti and Ni may be different in function, but they share the same attitude, whereas Ti and Se share neither function or attitude.  \nKeep in mind Ni and Se are perceiving functions - it's how we gather information. And then we judge what we have gathered with Ti or Fe. Using Ti+Ni isn't always a bad thing. There are different ways we can do things: Se>Ti, Ni>Ti, Se>Fe, Ni>Fe (and that doesn't even include our other weaker functions).  \nThis is the [forum post](http://personalitycafe.com/articles/25205-dominant-tertiary-loops-common-personality-disorders.html) where the loop idea came from. Have a look at the ISTP/INFJ Schizoid Personality Disorder description.
3	Sounds right to me
3	Yeah, I guess it must be switched to the healthiest Ti\-Se loop. I mean you can't avoid being in any loop, so the Ti\-Se is the best choice I guess.
2	I'll give you an example from my own observations.  My istp and I had been refinishing a part of the house that involved a lot of paint stripping.  At some point we decided to take a short break for maybe a week or two since the work was tedious.  As we are getting ready to stain my istp starts telling me about how he thinks the end result is going to look like crap and how he's regretting having started the whole thing in the first place.\n\nI thought he was being ridiculous and told him that he's spending a lot of time worrying, that we should just stain it, assess the situation and find solutions if we have a problem with the way it looks.  After the first coat his worries melted away because the result was lovelier than we expected.  So moral of that story is to stop overthinking it, and just do what you do best which is to feel your way through the process, tackling the problems as they come up.\n\nSomething else he's mentioned in the past is how he used to have a lot of emotional problems.  He told me he realized it's because pent up energy makes him irritable and on edge so he works it out by regularly exercising.  Too much testosterone he says.  I'd like to think it works because he's always in a cheery mood.  Hope this helps.
2	For me it's playing a sport I enjoy, gets me all energised and aware of my surroundings, kinda like if I was on cocaine or something, but it was just my Se that kicked in, but after a day without playing sports I enjoy I get into a Ti-Ni loop again.\nI wish I was like that all the time.
1	meditate
-1	Loops aren't real, so. 
17	Have any of you been good paper writers?	I’m in college, and I would say one of my biggest strengths is I can produce an excellent paper in relatively short time. \n\nFor example, I wrote a ten page, ten source final paper in a matter of two days for a very difficult class. No one ever gets an A on this professor’s papers, so a high B is about as good as one could get. \n\nLo and behold, I ended up getting a 175/200, a high B. Other, higher preforming students (Honors students, I’m not Honors) who spent weeks on the paper apparently got lower scores.\n\nDo you think Ti-Ni is a good paper-writing combo? Being able accurately synthesize lots of data into sentences, while keeping focused on the subject of the paper without losing detail? \n\nCurious how well other ISTPs handle papers.
21	I've been told I'm pretty good at it (not phenomenal) but I absolutely hate it. I can't stand sitting down to write a paper. Very much a math and science person. There's (almost) always one true answer and if you don't get it, you're wrong no room for debate. For some reason that's comforting to me. Writing by it's very nature is open ended and a single prompt can have an infinite amount of correct responses. 
9	Yeah I’m better at writing than math/science. It’s easy once you find a good style to follow. I’ll outline a draft with thesis and main points. My intro and conclusion summarizes the thesis and my main points in the body of the essay. Then I write my body paragraphs with: sentence and supporting quote... wash, rinse, repeat. I’ve gotten nothing but A’s in college on papers using this method.
6	I work in IT, the last time I wrote up a paper as a proposal on how to rebuild part of our system. Our front-end guy (with next to no coding background) commented that based off my paper, he felt like he could do the work.\n\nI really should get off my ass and start blogging on some of the libraries and techniques I’ve picked up over the years. Namely to help me remember what I know
4	My best subject in high school was English. Language is definitely a Ti+Ni strength. Unlike Ti+Si though, we aren't the best at remembering big words and recalling grammar rules, we just intuitively know how words go together.  \nThe other thing is that I would always procrastinate. Being Se means we live in the moment so we're often not the best at managing our time, which is something I struggled with all throughout highschool and uni. It's why so many ISTPs drop out of tertiary education. SPs are the laziest of all the types.
3	I’m pretty good at writing papers as well, but I’m in a STEM field.
3	[deleted]
3	im not an ISTP, but i think there is probably some sort of connection with thinking functions and intuitive functions to things like writing papers\n\ni have been known to be a good researcher in school and i can process things pretty easily, along with being able to create insights. i think that is Ni working\n\nthe Ti i guess comes in to aid in doing what Ni does\n\nif i remember correctly about all of this, i think it would be similar for ISTPs, except “backwards”\nthe Ni is used to aid the Ti, which in the original post is already described really
2	I'm great at writing papers, but horrible at math.
2	> Do you think Ti\-Ni is a good paper\-writing combo? Being able accurately synthesize lots of data into sentences, while keeping focused on the subject of the paper without losing detail? \n\nI think that makes sense. In my case however, I always space out while writing. I'm spacing out right now while writing this. I have trouble organizing my thoughts and putting it into words, especially if I'm writing about abstract concepts.
2	umm, it depends, when I work on something I truly enjoy I can produce objectively superb paper/documentation/reports and really enjoy, researching, sorting and writing it, however when it is something I don't care about, it is usually just bare minimum I know that has to be done to pass and it's borderline mental torture to get it done\n\nAt the same time I take a great pride in any work I do, so I will keep certain standard even for the stuff I don't like since it has my name on it
2	I would say I’m pretty good at bs-ing a paper last minute. I always think they’re bad in the process but when I read it after I’m impressed at how decent it is for the amount of time I’ve given it. 
2	Yeah, I've written papers for various courses within an hour before they're due and received As or Bs. Sometimes it was written at 11pm, other times it was at around 4am after I had worked on other assignments throughout the entire evening/night. I'm pretty good at getting myself out of a bind in any situation, but I really shouldn't procrastinate so bad ever again. For the longer papers, I tend to give myself at least a week. However, I've had a bad habit of waiting till the last couple of days if it's 5 pages or less.
2	My best draft is my first draft, and my record is pumping out a 6 page essay in 3 hours and getting a B on it. I used to wait until the day it was due to actually write it.
2	Yeah I'm great at that. And kudos to you man :)
2	I can write a long essay in one day, shorter if I have a huge interest in the topic. If it's a topic that's just theory based or common sense, I just delay it. Or like "respond to you classmate's posts" to a theory topic, I'd rather take the F, but I have to do the dumb bullshit lol.
2	Oh yes. I often did information gathering during the length of the assignment, and wrote the whole thing the night before. I'm already picking out patterns and connections to begin with; it's very easy to just rattle them off/write them down. I always felt like I was just regurgitating what information I gathered for a busy work assignment.\n\nReports and Analyses for Engineering Coursework, however? Yeah, that's challenging because it requires real work.
2	I've always been good at writing papers and I've gotten a lot of compliments on my writing style. On the other hand, I find the process stressful and as I progressed through college it somehow got harder and not easier. I'd chalk it up to 1. always starting at the last minute and feeling crunched for time, which I ironically haaaaaate, and 2. being too perfectionistic and not being satisfied until everything is just right, which, combined with 1, makes me hate writing papers.
1	I'm horrible at writing papers.  Although I also have a bit of a learning disability in it.
1	I love writing, it's arguably what I'm best at in college. I'm not particularly fast at writing, but I only ever do a single draft and skip the brainstorming stuff, and I don't normally need to edit much unless I have to cut something out due to word count. 
1	Absolutely not, I was never good at writing papers lol
5	What do people mean when they say ISTPs can't see the big picture? General examples? Family examples?	
16	Never heard of this, I always thought we were one of the few mbti's who do see the whole picture
11	Not sure how to put this in a family example, but I think of corporate life.\n\nI haaaaaate theoritical BS sooooo much. Unless I can see the practical application, I have zero attention or desire to spend any energy on something.\n\nSo long range planning of where a company should be in 20 years? Don't give a crap, at all. But if the higher ups tell me where we need to be, now I have something *pragmatic* to offer solutions for. Something real.
6	... I've always heard the opposite.
5	We are Se users, we prefer to live in the moment rather than plan for the future, which is what Ni is good for. Se/Si is concerned with details, Ne/Ni is concerned with the big picture, as they say.
3	They have no idea what they're talking about. ISTPs are able to make tons of logical connections between things with seemingly no effort; That is invaluable for picking out larger patterns.
2	I never understood what the term "big picture" meant either, we are pretty good at being aware of all the details of a problem if that's what it means.
13	What’s your SO’s/best friends’ type?	I have a lot of acquaintances and am quite popular in the city. I think I’ve gotten better and better in dealing with people than 10 years ago. I’m turning 30 this year. It’s a recent realisation that the few people closest to me are as interesting: \n\n(1) my long-term best friend who still says she will never give up on me (INFP)\n\n\n(2) my partner/social wondrous darling for 3 years (ENFP) \n\n(3) the couple who lovingly act like parents to me (ESTP & ISFJ) \n\n(4) my conversation/troll/activity partner (ENTP) \n\nI think my life is so good right now with this mix of friends. \n\n\n\n
10	> my conversation/troll/activity partner (ENTP)\n\nI swear this relationship is imbedded in the laws of physics it’s so common.\n\n“HEY WAFFLE IM GOING TO (insert stupidfunny shit here) WANNA COME!?!?”\n\n“Aight”
10	I wish I could use Twitch emotes everywhere on the internet. This post gets a \n\nCoolStoryBob
5	My closest friend is an ENFP. \n\nMy typical lovers seem to be INFPs and some ISFJs. \n\nIf Socionics intertype relations have any validity, I think maybe I prefer some psychological distance. 
7	My wife is an ENFJ, so she is the complete opposite. One of my best friends is also an ISTP and married an ENFJ. A lot of my friends fall into the ISTJ category (I'm a programmer and it seems like the majority of my programming friends are ISTJ).
3	enfj (if i remember correctly, we be blood brothers), then rest are intX's. i usually have lot of beef with folks my type, dunno why, prob narcissism. still not fluent in mbti, but it's a rough estimate
2	ENFP, INTP, ESTJ, INFP, ENTP
2	My boyfriend: INFP  \n\nMy brother (we're close): INFP (mom is INFP too)   \n\nMy closest girl-friend: ENFP  \n\nAnother friend: ENFJ (even though I totally thought they were INFP haha, and also they used to have a crush on me but I just see them as a friend. We both like Japanese stuff a lot though)  \n\nEx, but still a close friend: INTJ  \n\nI have more friends but it's hard to guess their types for sure, but most of my friends are just nerdy guys :P (I'm gonna guess INTX for a couple, and there's probably a couple more INFXs too, oh and a couple of ESTP guys too I think! They always seem to like me haha). But yeah, I have mostly intuitive friends so it's fun to talk to them about literally anything and be weird :P
1	My wife is an ENFJ
1	Both are INTJ. It's....interesting for sure. Works alright.
1	My wife of 8 years is an INTP and we get along better than anyone else I've ever met.
1	My ex was an ENFP. I want to say that it was nice while it lasted but it definitely had its downsides even during the good parts. I was unhappy for a long time due to his ongoing lying in regards to his ex "just a friend" girlfriend. He also cheated on me with her early on in the relationship and you know how us ISTP's are about betrayal. When I found out that he had given her a key to his apartment I told him he could go kick rocks with her and I never looked back. One of my few good qualities are that I am loyal and honest to a fault so I felt that I wasn't getting that in return.\n\nRelationship-wise we were in a D/s relationship where he was the Dom and I was the sub. It was probably the only thing keeping us together because that dynamic worked really well for both of us. We basically both took care of, looked after, and served each other in different ways.\n\nTwo of our biggest issues were 1) I felt he was overly emotional and he felt that I didn't have emotions or didn't express them enough. And 2) I thought that he over-analyzed and over-complicated every issue while he felt that I over simplified things and missed important details.\n\nFuckin A 🙄 
1	My closest friend is an ENFP, my other close friends are INFP, ISTJ, ISTP and ESTP.
1	My fiance and best friend are both ESTJ 🤷‍♀️
1	SO/male bff  is INFP, female bff is another ISTP, other close friends are another ISTP (male) and ENFP, plus various others I havent pinned down log enough for the test or remember their results (mostly introverts with like 2 other extroverts)
3	ISTP Ti - Ni loop, checking reality with Se	Have you tried to check reality every time you think something with your Ti? \n\nI just want to understand the healthy ISTP state. \n\nAs far as I get, the healthy state is like "thinking something" with Ti and then "checking it" with Se. \n\nBut then, what is Ni for? Why to use it? In which cases?
8	Ni gives you deeper insight
4	Ni allows you to think about / consider the future. 
2	[deleted]
0	Your purpose on earth	Is not to 'fix' anything, rather vote/decide. Nature is fixing\n\n
18	Are you high?
12	I vote that you need a direct object and a  punctuation mark at the end.
1	Finally I know what to tell people what my purpose is :)
1	Thanks to Navin Johnson, I found out what my special purpose is for.  
1	uhuh ?
1	Ok
1	Nope.  \nImproving.
1	Soooooo. My purpose isn't to fix anything? MY LIFE IS A LIE?
0	Your stupid
14	ISTP overcomplicating things	I noticed that sometimes I overcomplicate things I do. \n\nDid you notice that in your modus operandi? \n\nAnd also I noticed when I imagine that I give suggestions to another person how the thing must be done, I stop overcomplicating and switch to "better done than perfect". What do you think about this method?
26	I either overcomplicate or over simplify
13	Yes and no. To everyone else’s standards, we overcomplicate. But in my eyes, other people *under*complicate. \n\n\nWhen other people tell me I’m making things to complicated or that I’m over thinking it, it’s painfully obvious that they haven’t even fully thought it through. \n\n\nThinkers tend to get called over for overthinking. And it’s simply because our decision making process is driven by logic and rationality. So we search for that logic and rationality. If we struggle to find it, we keep looking, and then we’re “over thinking it”. 
3	I created a (marketing) video this week for a client. The time allowance was reasonably limited. The video must be shown tomorrow. If it’s a personal project, I’d probably perfect it by going into little details and it would take at least a month to finished everything. I’m not happy with the output but she was extremely pleased with it. \n\nLet’s not be too hard on ourselves. 
2	Sounds about right to me atleast.
2	Yup
2	I only overanalyze and complicate things if they are solely in regards to me. If they are about me & somebody else or other people I tend to oversimplify and quickly settle my mind on an outcome that works out pretty well.\n\nHonestly, I wish I could just oversimplify things in regards to myself too. 
4	I can never explain things to people in a simple way xD  \nI'm just bad at explaining things I guess and I'll make something really simple sound complicated. Like I only can explain it in a way I understand it, so people either can get it or they don't :P
14	I discovered a New Drug	It's called ENFJ. I'm addicted and I keep coming back for more, even though it only wants to keep things casual between us. When I'm not on it I feel paralyzed with depression, my body becomes physically ill, I lose my appetite and any feasible chance at performing basic mental and physical tasks. Then once I feel better I FOOLISHLY go back for another taste, thinking that my resolve will not be corrupted by the Fe-Ni black magic this time and before I know it WHAM ENJOY THESE NEXT 48 HOURS OF DEPRESSION BITCH.\n.\n\n.\n\nThese are all classic withdrawal symptoms.\n\nDon't fuck with the stuff guys. Your soul and psyche will try to latch on to it at first contact. Be smart and avoid it. Avoid it like it's commitment.  
5	How did I get here? I thought this would be more pharmaceutical drug related.  Haha\n\nDon’t worry, not all ENFJs are exactly the same. Maybe a dark version will break the cycle for you. I’m kidding!\n\nYou’re description is vivid and I feel terrible for you. Perhaps are you confusing these withdrawal type symptoms for maybe being in love with someone?\n\nI really don’t understand why people say ENFJs are manipulative (supposedly there is a positive version). Are you implying we’re manipulative? \n\nHope you feel better. :)
3	Hit the showers, Romeo. 
3	The NFJ and STP attraction is real\n\nThe initial attraction between my ISTP boyfriend and I was literally intoxicating. Comparing it to the withdraw and overdose of a drug is pretty accurate.
3	Been there. Hell of a drug.
2	Hey, they are the best dramatists you can ever find. They can easily convince you that the world is one huge tragic or that the world is one  huge blessing.\n\nJust know that ;\) And don't give very big place to their "emotional \- dramatic" approach. Actually you can, but it consumes huge energy. Better to stay in our natural "shoot, run, shoot" position.\n\nBut anyway if you like it enjoy ;\)
2	Why do ISTP's like ENFJ's so much?  Other than that they are pretty dang hawt usually...
1	NRE is real feel.
30	Being calm and yet have explosive anger?	Hi all, long time lurker here.\nJust wondering if this was a common trend among ISTP, as is with my boyfriend. He's super calm at all times (we thought there was a train coming as we drove over train tracks and while I screamed he just calmly kept driving. Later said that it did scare him but he was just focusing on getting the hell outta there) but yet he can get so angry? For example he has terrible road rage, honks people all the time, high beams people, rolls down his window to talk shit. He also can get physically aggressive? (not to me obviously) but like taking out anger by punching a wall or breaking something. \nKind of interesting, I guess, how someone that is so calm, so emotionally neutral and logical can get so irrationally angry about seemingly small things.\n\nTo me it seems like he has 3 emotions: neutral, sleepy/chill or angry 
28	sounds like me, I am usually pretty flat emotionally and when put in stressful or dangerous situations I switch to complete detachment from any emotions and focus on problems solving.\n\nHowever I can get really irritated/angry by the stupidest of irrational pet peeves
16	This doesn't seem like something MBTI is going to provide an answer for. He clearly has no healthy controls for his anger. \n\nThe train thing? Maybe that's ISTP.  The other day a semi-truck almost ruined my day in a big way and I was able to duck and weave in traffic. I felt pretty good about it, gf was still freaking out about it after we made it to the restaurant.\n\nBut to be honest I'm maybe a bit older than the average poster here and have age on my side. Violence towards objects is a GREAT way to dispose of bad energy in the body but not when it's putting holes in walls and breaking your stuff. \n\nDoes he work out at all? The best way to get that aggression out is to not deny it, or even "cope" with it, but just let it out naturally. Hit some weights, play a contact sport. 
14	Inferior feeling functions seem to be associated with difficulties identifying and processing emotions. \n\nYou know how frustrating it is to be full of feelings with no idea why?
8	Testosterone is a hell of a drug.
7	Because we're dead inside (jk). Low Fe.
5	I don't think it has to do with his type. My boyfriend's family is so terrible with anger they have to replace doors every few years because they destroy them (his esfp brother is the worst offender). But every one of them has gotten scary angry since I've known him including estj, isfj, entj, estp, and infp. I'd say this shows it depends more on your upbringing than type alone. 
3	That is me exactly, except when I road rage out no one knows but me.
3	I've never seen my istp go into a rage and frankly, I hope I never do. I think I'd be scared shitless
3	My room is full of broken holes, I usually get angry when I feel trapped
3	This could almost be about me but more aggressive. I have some issues and he probably does too. He should probably find an exhausting or physical hobby. If pot is legal wherever you are that will probably help too. 
3	It is me. \n\nISTPs are impulsive. We accumulate emotional energy and then "BOOM". 
3	This was me! \n\n\nI used to have explosive rage problems. Literally blind rage. And yes I literally mean literally. I could get into a rage so bad that I physically couldn’t see. Everything would go blurry while my entire body burned with pure rage. Trust me. It’s terrifying even for us. \n\n\n\nWhat helped me? LSD and ego death. A high dose of LSD took me to a new place. Showed me myself from an objective third person view. Gave me a chance to basically simultaneously forgive myself and be forgiven. To love myself and be loved. When you see yourself objectively, you can really dive in and find your problems. \n\n\n\nIt’s been a long road to fixing all my problems. But my anger issues and lack of compassion was the first thing I targeted. After my sense of ego was crushed, I basically became a different person. I mended a decade long broken relationship with my dad, I became a better brother, I made up with my step mother. I became a better more caring friend. I’ve been taking care of body, gotten off other hard drugs, trying to be financially responsible. \n\n\n\nHonestly tripping balls saved me. I was headed down a really bad path and was too blinded by having fun to see it. Then acid changed everything. I was embarrassed at what I’d become. And now, for the first time in my life, I’m starting to develop a sense of self esteem. \n\n\n\nSo I’m not gonna sit here and say “give him acid!” However, I would like to put it on the table. If that’s something you guys would be okay with, do some research. It’s an *amazing* bonding experience too. It’ll connect you on a deeper level I haven’t achieved otherwise. I would suggest 125 micro grams for a first trip if yall are newbies. But for ego death, you’ll want over 300ug. And that would make for a good second trip. 
2	I'm kinda like that.\n\nInside I'm usually some sort of roiling tempest, outside cool as ice.\n\nPeople see me as laid back until they get to know me and see that I'm actually high strung and a hard ass.\n\nIt got better with age for me. He needs to learn to express himself emotionally better
2	I am very similar to this..my rage and anger was very surface level as a child maybe you can ask him  if it was the same..now I'm a lot more level tempered but I know my anger and rage is there just deeper..I very seldom let it out..I noticed though it's like a life cycle of anger..certain periods of my life there were different triggers..arguements video games technology device or like my fire alarm going off while cooking.. road rage is kinda bad but I'm becoming more and more chill with age and understanding my triggers.. I think once he realizes what's a trigger and that they are actually a thing he can use this as a warning sign..almost like knowing it's going to happen before it happens..there are things he can do to avoid the triggers so that his rage won't come out...I've also been wondering if buying a punching bag would release some tension..I use to hit walls too but honestly let him grow out of it my entire life up through my 20s my rage was there..let him know about this maybe it will work maybe u just have to wait it out phase like
2	I'm the same way, I think it's because we try to conceal our emotions, as a result our anger stays bottled up. So when it does come out it's explosive and powerful.
2	I can relate. Although my rage is often related to football mire than anything else. Occasionally  i do get into these anxious states where i feel like i need to get into my body and smash something. I took up smacking golf balls at a range.
2	I am a relatively young ISTP. I do get angry at certain things \(my nuclear buttons are few, but the nuclear buttons are in easy to reach places\), but at others, it doesn't make me angry, or feel any kind of emotion at all; I just continue doing what I was doing, or adapt to the new situation. Perhaps your boyfriend's case is similar to mine, in that we are pretty fucking calm most of the time, but we do have nuclear buttons, and our nuclear buttons are fat, red, and are in places that are far too easily accidentally pressed.
2	That’s me. \n\nIt’s something I cannot change about myself, and I still wish nobody would see that part of me. Two of my exes broke up with me because of this tendency (which rarely happened, actually). \n\nUnderstand him. It happens when the baby Fe is acting. It’s a part of him you can probably help since you’re a high Fe user. \n\n
2	[deleted]
2	>To me it seems like he has 3 emotions: neutral, sleepy/chill or angry \n\nThat just about describes me. \n
2	ye, specially when crashing off any uppers, its usually one of the two
2	That's me. I'm pretty calm until something upsets me. I'm good about controlling it though, my rage really only shows when I'm alone or with people I'm comfortable with. I wanna break stuff but don't allow myself to, breaking stuff and creating another problem isn't gonna help anything. 
2	Can't explain how, but I am somewhat like that. I remain calm most of the time, but once I get angry I can be somewhat "explosive". Might be because we repress feelings until we can't (as we approach - or try as much as we can - things with cold logic and rationality over feelings until feelings bypass our cold logic).\nYou can clearly see my impatience when I start being "angry" though, but it takes a lot before it explodes (as I'm trying to stay as calm as I can while showing my impatience somewhat discretly). \n\nAnd when I do "Explode" in anger, most of the time I just say things I wouldn't normally and sometimes find your weakness and press on it (if you know what I mean). I don't like it, but I can sometimes do quite a lot of damage whitout really wanting to. 
2	Ask what his enneagram is, he could be a 9w8. But yeah, I would agree that the behavior be typical of an ISTP. I'm pretty chill most of the time. But put me on a road during rush hour where all the shitty drivers are in a mad rush to get home, or go to work, you'll see a very angry side that you would't want to see. I wouldn't go out of my way to be an ass hat, but it scares me to think that I enjoy fantasizing of beating up a dumb ass driver that never uses their turn signal. \n\nISTP are sticks of dynamite with long fuses, the more things bother us (especially the little things that add up overtime) the shorter the fuse gets, and you'll get an explosion of anger. \n

12	Anyone else struggle with"Passive"entertainment?	I don't know if this is just a personal trait or common among ISTP. In terms of what I mean by passive, I'm referring to movies/TV. Not to say that I don't have some movies/TV that I really enjoy, I just find more active (Video games,playing music, etc...) forms of entertainment too be far more enjoyable. 
4	Really I think this comes down to how passive you are when you're being entertained. Personally, I don't care much for video games. I've tried a bunch with different friends and I can get into stuff where I can try the same situation in multiple different ways but not much outside of that. I can absolutely get engaged with music and tv/movies though, as long it's not watching a predictable movie or listening to "pleasant" music. With music, I usually prefer stuff that's very dense or full so I can explore the different layers, and with movies, I love stuff that doesn't go for the traditional beginning-middle-end narrative structure, so my mind can wander a bit while still thinking about the relevant story. I can't really do "turn your brain off" style stuff because I can't turn my brain off and will get distracted, but I love being absorbed into something spacious. And I don't mean for that to come off as me thinking I only like "deep art" stuff because actually I'm pretty shallow, I just almost physically *need* something to occupy my mind.
4	yes. i don't really watch a lot of movies or TV, i spend most my free time learning new languages, doing research on topics that interest me and trying to make money through getting better skills in my own time.
4	I can watch just few movies per month or week max. On the other hand I can play games all day long
3	Absolutely. This is something I’ve often mentioned, and often attributed to type. \n\nSitting still watching tv or a movie has always been hard, or even a group conversation. \n\nIf I’m not able to fidget or move around I’ll go nuts. \n\nVideo games do not have the same problem. 
3	Same, I actually like the walking dead, and I still haven't finished the second to last season just cause it doesn't hold my attention enough.
3	Yeah, I gotta watch or listen to something that has a lot going on or is moving at a fast pace. Heck, I have a hard time running at a slow pace. I like everything to be at a fast pace, except for breakfast and dinner--a good breakfast and dinner should be relaxing and stress-free
3	I never watch tv by myself. It’s always if I’m hanging out with someone else (and usually high lol). \n\nI don’t find tv that engaging - I’d rather read reddit or do something active. My ESFP ex always had the tv on, though hed usually play video games while watching tv lol.
3	All entertainment struggles to hold my attention tbh. 
3	I have not had TV service for over 20 years at this point. Most things on TV are outright insulting to even the average person's intelligence. I do have a large selection of movies though.\n\nI much prefer playing music and games, for sure.
3	Well I really enjoy cinema and interesting movies so no not really. But yeah I'd play video games much more
2	Sure, but it is a sign of Ti \- Ni loop. Try to switch to Ti \- Se. Do something more physical and physically enjoyable. Even if you have to force yourself to do it.
2	I usually watch Netflix/Prime/Youtube/BR during cardio sessions on my stationnary bike. \n\nOtherwise the movie/serie has to be really good in order for me to stop everything else I'm doing, it happened a lot in the paste with animes and some series \(I was following 10\-15 series each seasons\) but nowadays I'm very selective on how I spent my time. \n\nVideogames is hit and miss, I'm more and more often starting games and just dropping them after 2\-5\-10h of play. Last one was Ni No Kuni 2 and did the same with Xenoblade Chronicles 2, I think I'm done with JRPGs :p\n\nI completed Zelda BOF and Mario Odyssey though, I guess the Switch portable form factor is more convenient to me as I can play during my train commute or in short 15\-30min sessions.
2	No
1	playing music is ok, games bore me to hell can't play past 20 mins. tv i only use to watch news, some news reporters are babe af. \*\*cough\*\* only reason i watch business news \*\*cough \*\*
12	ISTP being enterpreneur	What do you think can ISTP be a successful entrepreneur? \n\nOr it could be like long\-term commitment that we don't like or something?\n\nAnd if yes, is there a way to avoid this negative approach?
13	There are so many aspects associated with starting a business, and so many tactical problems to solve, that I wonder if a successful enterprise can be started without an istp in the mix.\n\nAs long as we are interested we are engaged.
6	I know a successful ISTP entrepreneur.  Have had may discussions with his wife who's really into the MBTI.  She thinks key was knowing his weaknesses and hiring people that had those strengths.  She also always calls him out when a personality weakness starts getting in his way.  
3	Yes, we're good at entrepreneurship. Just not sales. \nBut, building the groundwork, streamlining operations and making things more cost efficient is a strength that makes us good at it. 
3	I just started my own self-employment and now operate an LLC.  Only been at it a month.  Only have one client so far.   \n\nBiggest obstacle?  Not marketing myself.  I have a big safety net and i can always go back to full time work.  Just...  it feels so good to be lazy right now.  I worked full time most of my adult life and stress builds.  This is a break. \n\nAnyway, i’ll let you know how it goes. 
2	I worry about this. I'm pulling together my business plan to open a bar. Both worried and excited.
2	This is the route I am trying to take. I just try to put myself in situations where I have no choice of slacking off.
2	Rock Climbing	I recently started seeing an INTP who has a healthy obsession with rock climbing. I’ve only done it once, when i was like 12, and the belaying hurt so I wasn’t a fan. but i was also fat and sedentary then, so i don’t really put much stock in that one experience.\nany ISTP climbers on here? what draws you to it, and what do i need to know?\n\nUpdate: went two days in a row. addicted. bought all the gear. highly recommend. :-)
6	The book "Flow" which captured this whole idea about being "in the zone" or whatever used rock climbing as one of its premiere examples.  It's a challenge that meets you at your level, and requires total concentration.  The total concentration, being completely present, aware of every inch of rock and every crevice, aware of each instance of fatigue, it's a complete experience: sight, sound, texture, smell, kinesthetics.  Each move is strategy and changes the entire dynamic.  \n\nBeing in that moment, that "flow" state is something we should all aspire to more often.  \n\nUnfotunately I've only climbed the most basic of things and can't comment on the gear and technique.  I feel the calling, though.
4	Properly adjusting the harness for comfort it's huge for having a good time.  Avoid the urge to just crank down on all the adjustments as tight as possible.  Source: am a climber, skydiver and rope rescue technician; have sat on my balls too many times from poorly adjusted harnesses.
2	I've rock climbed quite a few times, I'm not very good or anything though. \n\nIt is one of those few tasks that keeps you in the moment. Like, you are aware of everything you need to be to get your job done. It's really great. And a pretty complete physical workout.
2	I'm a climber, not outside but indoor climbing. I'm not very good, but I enjoy it.\n\nI'm not obsessive about climbing so much as physical activities in general (as long as they don't require too much thought :) ). So, running, functional bodyweight stuff (crossfit-style), obstacle races, and indoor climbing. \n\nBelaying doesn't hurt or anything (I'm 28). My hands have toughened up over the last months, so I'm not hurting afterwards either. \n\nBasically, I recommend it. Find a meetup group or do what I did and join a beginner's class. Everyone was of varying abilities and trying to meet other people, and a few of us have kept climbing together ever since. \n\nStart with a class, then do hole punches if it's offered. If you keep going back, get your own equipment (not too expensive, ~$150 for harness and shoes) and a subscription. 
2	I've started bloc climbing a few month ago, and I love it. It's just you and the wall, you have to develop your strength, flexibility, endurance and technique in every part of your body. It's also mentally challenging: if you stay in your confort zone you will not progress so you have to try, fall, try again until you find a way to get at the top.\nAs a reserved guy it's also a way to meet new people and be social.\n\nThe only thing you need to know is that you don't have to be afraid to fail, nobody will judge you, in fact they will help you.
2	i rock climb pretty regularly! both top\-roping and bouldering. highly recommend. every route is a different problem to solve, it engages every sense while requiring thought and providing a challenge on a level that you choose. it's's fun to do with friends but just as productive to do solo, and i'd say indoor gyms are a great place to start. i like sports that are mostly sitting on my ass with bursts of energy once all the pieces are in place, and that burst of activity takes some skill to do properly. \n\ni think most importantly, you should know your limit when you climb; it's hard on the hands, you can tear off calluses and seriously strain something. i know multiple people who've broken their leg bouldering, so always be aware of how you land on the mats \(although it's not a problem in top\-roping\). your arms will probably tire out first, so take your time between problems. rock climbers are the chillest, most encouraging people i know! the vibe is really great
2	I've never been rock climbing, but I feel like I would enjoy it. I enjoy climbing up trees and other vertical surfaces a lot. Sucks to live in the flat and boring lands of New Mexico lol
1	I would love to do something like rock climbing, always have. I used to always want to do it when I was younger (probably orly elementary school), but I just never asked my parents for some reason. I'm 15 now and don't want to do it anymore for the sheer fact that I'm not in shape and idk. But in a different world, I would still love to do it because it's a mostly individual sport (other than spotters) and you can progress at your own pace. I never liked the idea of being on a team ... partly because of too little confidence in myself, or too _much_. \n\nI want to join fencing now for the same reasons: individual sport (mostly) where I can set my own pace and work on myself. I also always wanted to do fencing when I was younger -- I liked the idea of rowing, too, but I've realized that I'm way too short for it lol. Kinda weird, too, since rowing is a team-sport.  \n\nAnyway, try to get into rock climbing! I know pretty much nothing about it, but it seems pretty cool. My uncle used to be really into it, and I believe that he was some form of an introvert. He only stopped because he got sick with Parkinson's. 
73	My approach to life	
5	Lol everyday? I find that I have to force myself out of the house/off the couch.
5	Somedays I'll keep throwing myself at a problem until I die of bloodloss or triumph.\n\nOthers I'll keep trying to avoid everything.
2	Yeah
2	Yeah, maybe coffee or something from time to time.
1	Sometimes it's nice nice to just chill, but being motionless makes me get bored.\nBy the way, you like King crimson?
5	MBTI survey results!! - What did the correlations from 1200 answers say?	
2	I took this test as an INTP but in the last week I've done some researching that made me realize I've been mistyped. I'm definitely an ISTP.\n\nFrom looking at your data it seems I should keep meditating either way. I could definitely use some of the reported benefits.\n\n>Another interesting one may be that people who reported breathing deeply also feel their emotions more.\n\n...as well as holding my breath :P
1	I’ve always been a definite mixture of thinker and feeler. But I’ve always been emotionally retarded (in the literal way. As in emotional IQ) so the feeler dude took the outside (blame my mom for this lol). Most of my life is perfectly characterized by the feeler. Fat, bullied, alone, etc. But over the last few years as I’ve become an adult, I’ve begun letting my thinker side take hold. I’m 100 pounds of fat down and 12 pounds of muscle up, I do feel intellectually superior to most of my friends (its justified. They aren’t a bright bunch, but they’re self aware of it which is part of why I like them), I’m not alone anymore, etc. \n\n\nI gotta say. Forcing the change from thinker to feeler probably saved my life. I’ve been in some deep deep pits in my life. And I thought my way out. I think refusal to accept defeat with the easy way out plus using thought and deliberation started the journey. And over the last few years I’ve put In some serious personal development. I was tired of being a fat lonely angry socially awkward freak. So I slowly attacked each issue. Sometimes one at a time, sometimes more than one. \n\n\nIt’s been a hella tough battle. But since being typed ISTP, my life has been so much better. I have no idea what I was growing up. I think I was always meant to be ISTP. But my mother passed when I was 14. And she was the only parent developing me emotionally. So I got set back *years* emotionally with all sorts of damage. But I think I finally developed enough experience of observation to develop emotional control on my own. \n\n\nSorry just sorta ranted. May be a little high lol. Anyways. I love being ISTP. 
1	Sorry didn't get anything of this, too scientific. 
69	Hey ISTPs, does this sound like you when you fancy someone?	* being mean (in a joking way)\n\n* saying things like "you don't annoy me" \n\n* replying almost instantly to texts (though replies are sometimes unenthusiastic)\n\n* giving underhanded compliments about the other party's appearance
26	Oh hey it's my boyfriend
21	All, but under 'mean' you meant 'little sarcastic' I guess. And yes, it is.
14	Hit the nail on the head.
8	Occasional teasing with a side of dry humor is my personal style.
6	That's a Bingo!
5	Yeah, except the second for me is, "I can tolerate you.."
3	All except for being mean. I just become even more of a little shit.
5	Everything except being mean.
2	Absolutely
2	Nope.
2	1. I like to tease people, but I'm not mean.\n2. No, that's dumb.\n3. If I *can*, I will respond immediately; That's just courtesy. Courtesy on your part would be to *not expect* an immediate reply.\n4. No, that's dumb. If I care about someone, I will give them a genuine compliment.
1	I swear
1	Yep. 
1	\# 3 needs more clarification, but rest seem accurate
1	I wouldn't say mean but Teasing? Yes, absolutely. As well as like... idk what to call it... playful call outs? If that makes sense. \n\nOtherwise yes, all of this. \nThere will also be a sort of uh, spark? Or Excitement? Which varys from anything to asking questions about what someone elses interests are, to "Wanna go for a ride?"\nIdk, I get very fun. \n\nIRT the fourth bullet: I will be really straight forward and genuine with compliments, but also as respectful as I can be. Though I can do underhanded ones too, and I'll have fun waiting for the moment they realize it's a compliment. 
-1	No, that's what someone socially awkward and desperate sounds. \n\nThat's not neccessarily ISTP but def been through it as one. \n\n* being mean joking way: don't know how to give a compliment or pretend to adhere to social norms without coming off awkward and rude/mean\n\n* being blunt to the point of uselessness even though you think it means being upfront\n\n* not taking texts seriously or not understanding most people think you have nothing going on if you reply to texts immediately\n\n* again back to one, lack of confidence, self-esteem, awkward\n\nBe best ISTPs
14	ISTP Bruce Lee quote "Empty your mind.." is about Introverted Intuition	Hey, I just thought that maybe this quote of Bruce Lee \(who was ISTP as we know\) could be about Ni, or more about not being in Ti\<\-\>Ni loop. So I guess, when you, as an ISTP, are in your normal state Ti \<\-\> Se loop, your mind is pretty much empty \(clear\), you are efficient. But when you go into Ti\<\-\>Ni loop, you stuck in your assumptions instead of being in action.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\-\-\-\-\n\n"Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."
5	I thought it was about Se. Going with the flow and all that.
2	Works for me
5	ISTP what is your Ti-Ni loop like?	I just wonder is it the same as when I am in this loop. \n\nCould you describe it: how you act, think and feel when in Ti\-Ni loop?
11	I get obsessive about things, especially health related. I can't get out of my head, and then I feel bad about not doing anything, and then I come up with some ideas of things I should/could do but don't actually do them. Rinse and repeat until I kick my ass into getting out there and doing stuff.
10	I spend all of my time *thinking* and none of my time *doing*. \n\nI over-analyze myself into paralysis.\n\nI have to break it by forcing my brain to shut up and just DO.
4	I waste my time by passively consuming new information through the internet while consciously thinking about how much time I'm wasting on the internet and on overthinking itself. I tell myself I should stop thinking and start doing something, but then I realize I have nothing that I care about enough to actually pursue doing, so I try to find something on the internet that's interesting enough. The cycle repeats. 
2	I do and say things that inner me would want to do and say, effectively causing my relationships and health to suffer.
2	Getting into construction was the best way for me to keep from self-destruction because of this
2	I don't even understand this concept. Intuition is specifically something you have no conscious control over. They're not called hunches because you explicitly thought them through.
39	I’ve been invited to an ISTPs surprise bday party.	I’m sure it’s been a lifelong dream of his to have one of these. A surprise social event with tons of people where he is the singular center of attention. \n\nAll the perfect ingredients for ISTP happiness, no?
43	My ideal birthday would be to have everyone I know forget about it and just go on as any normal day.\n \nThat being said, I had a surprise party thrown at my expense once, it was actually pretty cool to see how many people gave a shit enough to make it happen.  Pretty uplifting.  \n \nYMMV
25	Sounds horrible.
24	Just gift him a lot of booze. He'll get over it pretty quick.
30	As his gift, I'd secretly warn him. 
12	A few days in advance drop a line like i can't wait for your party Saturday or whatever. Best gift
7	What a predicament! 
7	there are two ways this could go if i were the ISTP. either people pay way too much attention to me and i hate my life the whole night. or people gather “in honor of me” but mostly ignore me and i have a great time being the good excuse that brought everyone together to have a great time. \nit’s all in the hands of the planner/host. 
6	What kind of fresh hell birthday present is that?! Does the person planning this party secretly hate your ISTP friend or something? 
6	He'll probably be overwhelmed but will forever cherish the event even if he doesn't like to admit it. Just get some alcohol in him, fast.
4	Oh my god. as a dude who dislikes celebrating my own birthday, this sounds like a nightmare. 
3	ISTPs hate the center of attention lol
3	I say don’t tell them bc they will be anxious about it until it happens! Bc they don’t know about it they may just not make it a priority and not show up though!! Lol
3	I actually could like it, but if no one expected any emotion from me, even a smile. I hate fake smiling when my birthday. And saying "thank you" to congrats etc. \n\nJust leave me as a monument somewhere there, and I will be happy. \n\nAnd give him something to do, I don't know a riddle, a Chinese box to open. Something to be busy with, to avoid unwanted small talks etc. 
2	I would want to leave the whole time if someone threw a party for me, if it was a surprise I don't know what I would do. Ghosting out of there would be tempting.
1	Lifelong dream? I felt worst when my parents set up a birthday party for me. It’s a torture that comes with hot seat and ego-stroking compliments (which I don’t need). 
1	Think I had a nightmare about this once :/
1	I think I'm the only ISTP Here that would like this, but even then I think I'd like a warning first. that being said, I'd probably cry and get emotional and that sounds nice in theory but... not if I'm not comfortable doing that in front of all the people coming. It could quickly become humiliating then. 
6	How can I help my ISTP to make friends?	Recently my boyfriend (ISTP) and I (INFP) have moved to our University town. It was my first semester and I made a few very good friends after going through a gruelling process of trial and error, but I feel that it was worth it now and I cherish those I have met. My boyfriend on the other hand, despite having been in University and living in this town for over two years has yet to meet people whom he deems to be worthy of his friendship, with whom he connects. Our friends back home are very intellectual and technologically talented, but he has known them since highschool and met them by spending time with them every day (as one does in highschool). He constantly tells me that he wants friends like them, but he doesn't make any effort to get out and actually meet people, instead choosing to remain at home watching youtube, scrolling reddit, or gaming. We do occasionally do activities with the few friends I have made, but I know that he wants to have his own set of friends, which is perfectly normal.\n\nISTP's, do you have any tips for him to motivate himself to get out there, or methods of making friends that you have noticed work for you? \n\nTl;dr ISTP boyfriend is having trouble making friends in new town, looking for advice or tips from other ISTP's in motivation/methods for outreaching
11	he will gather friends over time as he accumulates through his various IRL interests, let it evolve naturally.\n\n-ISTP
4	Give him a hint to start from something small. ISTPs develop and improve everything they touch even friendship or relationships. Don't worry, when he get the exact method, how to make friends, he will almost virtuously make friends after. You will be scared of his speed :D
4	Keep introducing friends with interest overlap to him. Even if he connects with someone, he will not interact with said person unless there is a good reason for it.\n-ISTP²
3	Atypical ISTPs, how are you sure about your type?	And does it or does it not matter to you if you are certain about your type?\n\nI've been quite obsessed with MBTI typing recently as it is all my INTP friend talks about, but it has been a year since I took a typing test and I'm still unsure about mine. I'm pretty sure I use the same functions as the ISTP, but upon observation I notice I don't use a lot of Se and my Fe is more developed than my fellow Fe\-inferior INTP. \n\nMaybe I worry too much about my type, or maybe I'm in the Ti\-Ni rut, but this uncertainty bothers me. It shouldn't even be a surprise to me that not all ISTPs are the same. I'm curious, are there any atypical ISTPs here and how do you differ?
4	What’s bothersome is the extent of obsession one has (reached) only to be certain about his type. There are many facets of you that mbti cannot explain. Take what information you get as perspectives. 
3	You say you have more developed Fe than is typical for IxTPs and aren’t sure if you use Se. \n\nAssuming you use all the same functions as an ISTP, you could be an INFJ: Ni Fe Ti Se. Infjs also have Ni-Ti loops.\n\nAlternatively, if you’re not an Se user, you might be an ISFJ: Si Fe Ti Ne.\n\nHonestly, if you aren’t sure if you use Se, then you might want to look into types other than ISTP. Se is an easy function to identify if it’s high in your function stack. 
2	Personalityhacker's podcast on ISTP has said that, out of all the types, ISTP is the one that varys very extremely in difference to other ISTP. In other words, everyone, even the of the same type is different of course, but ISTP's apparently take it to a very extreme degree. "Even among ISTP's, each one might be radically different than the other."\n\nA good example they said was that ISTP might all do this thing where they'll act, behave, or wear, or do something to signify that they're not like other people, but each one might do it differently. One person might do it via the way they dress, another might get tattoos, but they'll find ways to deviate very radically from stereotype. For me, I do it in the way where I'm just... very unapologetically blunt and honest? Dressing style might also factor in as well, but it really comes across in my personality I'm told. More or less anyone I've ever met has told me they've never met anyone else like me before. Other ISTP too have questioned whether I am one or not. \n\nI'm a really non-istp looking ISTP in the way that I actually give a shit about my emotions, and believe that taking care of that shit is important. I think other ISTP could benefit from it too. The reason I have this belief is because my own give me hell all the time, as they do for most ISTP. And there's no real way to fix it, of course. I still have little to no coping mechanisms, but trying to be aware of them more, ask for help, talk to people more, and just... be more aware, ask myself questions, ect, has been starting to help. Looking up more self help things as well, like building a habit of focusing on myself and not others has also been helping. \n\nThat, and I'm obviously more ranty and less tight lipped. I've gotten a lot of shit for that too, but I still think it's better to be more detailed than not. \n\nI once met an ISTP on here that said that his cool interests were all about people. Figuring them out, learning more about them, seeing how they worked and how different others were from each other, which led him to being more Fe too. \n\nIf you're really unsure I'd just say do more research on the functions, on Jungs work, ect. You can be emotional and considerate and nice and still be an ISTP. A lot of are, and I think theres more of us out there that are this way than you might think. Just remember that you know yourself better than anyone, and it's up to you to decide who you are. 
1	Sometimes people who know about MBTI think I'm an ISTJ. I'm only just orderly enough to maximize the agency I have; If I'm acting in a disciplined manner, it's only because doing so lets me act with as much undisciplined discretion as I can.
10	Here’s a good one—anyone change their MBTI after getting through the WTF years?	I had to take the test as part of post grad training and scored INFP, but I also had a lot of finding my way and unloading baggage to do. I even chose a career based on that stupid test and hated it. Years later after therapy I couldn’t be happier or more at peace and it’s kinda cool to have some insight about yourself. Looking back I have always been the same basic person, but didn’t understand my mental wiring, so I struggled answering the test questions then—but now I know exactly what I think and how I feel, which hits ISTP and 9w8.
12	I took some philosophy classes and tripped acid and now I get typed as INTP
7	If I've already been through the wtf years (which seemed to only last a few months) then yes. Was typed intp or infp like you but had no awareness of functions. I'm still young so it's possible for me to go back to the wtf years but for now I'm a happy and productive istp
3	Most people get INTJ on those tests. They are based on behaviorism rather than the functions. But then I guess you have to ask - what exactly are the functions? There are so many different opinions and Carl Jung doesn't do that great of a job of explaining his "intuition".
3	Type preferences can flex all the time depending on what a situation calls for and how capable a person is at flexing, and if you were in a different mindset at the time due to environment or life events that would impact your type preference.
3	This is why ISTP is an endangered species.
2	I’ve gotten INTP, INFP, ISTP, and ISFP. I really just identify as an introvert because that’s the only one that’s definite
2	As I mentioned in another reply here. I was typed as an INFP in high school and over the course of a decade shifted into an INTP.\n\nI think I spent 15+ years of my life in "wtf years" and I'm only now finding out that I'm actually an ISTP. I am now making sense of my Se. Which has gone unused for a very long time. \n\n
1	Speaking from the opposite end, I appear to be slowly moving out of my formative years and am now typing as ENTP.
1	I've gotten ISTP, ISTJ, INTJ, INTP, and INTJ-T. I think ISTP and INTP are my two most frequent types, however. The most recent was ISTP ... so that's the one I'm sticking with. 
1	I got intp intj and istp. I think its bc im smart derp hehe oink
10	ISTPs, how do you make major life decisions?	Do you have a general sense of milestones you'd like to achieve, and if so how do you plan for them?Or are you happy to let life unfold, and see what happens?\n\nAs an ENTJ I feel like my ISTP is the immovable object to my unstoppable force, so I'm not the one controlling proceedings. We've talked about it somewhat, but I'd appreciate any general insights you have. \n\nHow would you approach a career, buying a house, having a family? 
18	I look at every possible path and weigh pros and cons. I do this for about everything. Like picking a place to eat. Could take hours or days for me to be happy with my choice.
10	 .I have pretty clear cut milestones for most of the areas of my life currently and I feel better motivated for having them.. I dont want to give you my life story but from 18-30 I was lost in every sense of the word and directionless even though I was appeased because I was in a stable career (military)..make milestones my man I feel a lot less miserable now with them then I did making decent money and without them..we are aiming creatures, aim yourself high and struggle your way there..do not wait until you are 30 to realize this..I hope this will make your day better good luck
10	Probably not very “typical” of our type, but gut feeling, which is based on a shitload of unconscious thought ahead of time—never steered me wrong.
8	Very, very slowly. I usually wait until the absolute last minute to make a big decision or until someone is sick of waiting for an answer. This applies to jobs, moving, relationships, buying a car, etc.\n\nI also hate being forced to make a decision. I’ve had boyfriends try to force me to make a decision about our relationship status and it makes me hesitant. It’s really weird.\n\nI wish I was more decisive.
5	I overthink and then just go do *something* 9 times out of 10 it’s impulsive but it usually pans out 
3	I don't plan, I hate planning. \n\nI like the future to be a blank slate full of possibilities and once you nail down plans sometimes it feels suffocating. \n\nI also have problems with commitment in relationships due to this. 
4	I don't.
7	Like 2-face. I just flip a coin
5	>How would you approach a career, buying a house, having a family? \n\n1. Getting an interview.\n2. Acquiring a mortgage.\n3. Having sex.\n\n
2	I have a gut feeling that if I start to think, I would go overthinking, so most of the time I just try to not see these major decisions as too serious things.\n\nActually there is nothing too serious in this life.\n\nSometimes I just wait until there is no time to decide, and decide just almost randomly. I know this doesn't seem very responsible. But I guess I trust my sensors more than my Ti and Ni. 
1	I do what I want, I want to do what I like and what I like is changing as I am living life.\n\nI like computers, my job is in cybersecurity, I wanted to travel Asia and leave home, I found myself cybersecurity job in Southeast Asia and keep travelling around the region and beyond. Will see, what I will come up with next, when I will inevitably get bored with this.
1	what do you think/ i wait for the last second, impulsivity does the thinking for me
1	I write out pros/cons, deliberate with trusted friends, then the most important step: flip a coin
13	I think if I were an open book I could make great friendships, but my fear of being judge for who I am, what I believe in and how I think parálisis me from opening up to the possibility of new found friends	
6	I read from somewhere that even if you lie down for people to walk on you, they're still going to complain that you're not soft enough. Be yourself. Live your life the way you want. People are going to judge you no matter what you do anyway.\n\nI am an open book, and that doesn't necessarily make everyone likes me. Quite the opposite haha. But those who love me, love me dearly for who I am. And that is enough :) 
5	How old are you? I haven't been afraid of what people think of me since I was like 16
1	starting to open up to people and openly discussing what's going on in my head was one of the most liberating things I have ever done... Now I have developed the opposite problem, I need to stfu
1	Oh, just make new friends without opening up to any possibility. And without opening to new people. You don't need to expose yourself to make friends. And that is okay to be scared of judgment. But as I once realized "Feel your arms, feel your appearance, and yes that is you, don't give a fuck about anything.". It is you and no\-one else, accept it and make others accept you. In truth you are untouchable, you just didn't realize it yet. \n\nAnd another question "why to make new friends?". Not many ISTPs can answer that question. The answer is "because it is efficient, and allows you to solve problems, inner problems or outer problems". Just remember: tribe is efficient. Build your tribe, in any style you can. 
1	Oh sure. I'm very guarded because I totally don't want people exploiting me if I open up to them. The only real result of that is that I maintain few friends, which is fine by me since that's exactly what I want.
26	TIL that I enjoy working with my back to a wall	With my back to a wall, I never have to worry about being ambushed by unwanted conversation. If a coworker is walking by, I can choose to appear too busy with work to talk, even if I was only mindlessly staring off into the distance a moment earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if I want to get work done, I find it helpful to work facing a wall, which allows me to completely shut off my Se function.\n\nCan any of you relate? Agree or disagree?
12	I hate people being behind me always - I sit with my back to a wall at restaurants whenever possible.
4	So agree, work at my corp job was never more "fun" for me then when we're up against a deadline. I like the rush with it. 
4	I agree but I also like working facing the window. It's better for your eyes and you don't get any glare on your screen.
3	I thought this was going to be a different conversation. I excel under pressure. \n\nI prefer to be in a closed room by myself
2	Sure, I always take places with back to the wall and if I can't, I'll just quit the job. ISTPs are natural action\-related people, so you don't like when you back is unseen and in danger. I would recommend also avoid situations when your back is toward the door.
2	I read “TIL that I enjoy walking with my back to a wall” and I read most of your text box til I realized it said “working”. \n\n\nBro I was so confused at first😂. 
1	And you can also survey the whole room with your back to the wall!
1	i like sitting in the corner at cafes and restaurants.
7	A reminder to keep fighting out of the WTF years/moments!	
2	Ok, I never understood... what are the WTF years?
2	Omg, hes the author of 48 laws of power right? I know every cm of that book. 
2	Random Question Friday: What Hogwarts House are you?	I’m Ravenclaw. \n\nEdit: A lot of people seem to have a problem with this question because they think it has nothing to do with MBTI. MBTI and Hogwarts houses are similar because they both play off of personality traits and typical tendencies. I was just trying to see if there was a correlation. Which doesn’t appear to be true. 
9	I am not a house. \n\nOn a more serious note, what the hell does this correspond to?
7	This isn't mbti related.
10	Slytherin 
3	Dont know if youre trolling or just "special"
3	I'm like Hagrid and I live by myself in a little shack.
6	Still haven't read those books. Still have no interest in them.
2	I got gryffindor in the quiz but idk?
2	Slytherin.
2	Technically a Ravenclaw (usually the house I get on quizzes) but if I was actually at Hogwarts, I think I would prefer to be in Hufflepuff.
1	band leader
1	I francied myself a Ravenclaw in my younger years but if I'm being honest I'm a total Slytherin.
1	Hufflepuff 
1	Ravenclaw here as well.
1	Hufflepuff. I was surprised when I took that test. 
3	ISTP seeing the big picture	I wonder, do you have such a problem \- for example compared to Intuitive types, sometimes loosing the big picture and concentrating on details, especially when details are crucial for mechanism to work? 
19	Small picture guy myself.\n\nFor example: when you use a dash as punctuation you generally need a second dash, otherwise just use commas.\n\nQuite distracting.
4	I think my Ni is getting pretty developed, so I'm able to think both ways simultaneously. I'm good at details(able to figure something out before it becomes an issue), but I'm not detailed in a perfectionist way. My husband is an intuitive(ENTJ) and he misses a lot of the minutiae when we're working on a project together that I catch, but we're both able to see how all the parts go together. I think he's better at figuring out what needs to be done, timeline-wise(whole picture). My projects are kind of thrown together and work well, maybe not as pretty. His projects take forever for him to complete, but they have a lot of issues that pop up from things he missed BUT it looks pretty/organized.
2	As someone with an INTP thesis partner, I can relate to this quite well. I have trouble seeing how our parts relate to the main objective as I see it as disconnected paragraphs, so I end up focusing on the little details like the consistency of the formatting.
14	Hey Everybody. What are you jamming on right now?	Rocky Mountain Way by Joe Walsh

21	ISTP is being a programmer a good career choice?	Hey, how do you think is programming kinda good thing for ISTPs? Or it is too boring? Or too theoretical? 
23	Programming gives me an opportunity to regularly solve problems. I am able to have purposeful conversations with users about those problems. In general it is understood that I need a block of undisturbed time to solve those problems. It works for me! 
15	Programming gives me a career where I can think hard about difficult problems, undisturbed for days sometimes, and then come out the other side as an expert. It provides me with an outlet for my inner creativity while also letting me to be practical to solve real problems. Programming means books to read (or write, if I so choose), people to associate with, events for when I'm feeling social, and quiet time when I'm not. It's only as boring as I let it be. Plus it's safe, so long as you avoid RSI & try to keep your posture, and it pays well. Finally, I'll say that programming is not for everyone, as it just doesn't work with certain brain types. Perhaps it's an IQ thing, but it helps to have a computing introduction at a young age and it helps to have challenges to overcome where you'll hate the world for at least a week until you learn the right way to do a thing.
6	Don't let the personality quiz creep into how you run your life. Do you like programming? Would you be good at it? Then do it.
5	It depends what you end up working on but yeah with the right programming job you get to build and tweak things.  
4	Theoritical yes and no because while you need to learn algorithmic and design patterns you also need hours of practice, each language you're discovering something new... The kind of programming you'll have to perform in a professional environment CAN be boring though.\n\nPersonnaly I studied computer science with a lot of programming involved, which I loved doing, but I started working as an IT analyst then a domain/project architect. I quickly found I prefer that role as you need to come with solutions opposed to bare programming where you usually execute what was designed by others with a variable degree of freedom and creativity involved.
3	yes, but if you like shortcuts to just about anything, i'd think twice, idk whether its the morining liqqor or im in the wrong sub. \n\ntl;dr: yes
3	MIS or analyst is probably better for the pragmatic nature of the ISTP. Would you want to be locked in a room all day, coding exactly what you are specifically told to code? No, me either. Too rigid. Some problem solving skills involved, but mostly, it's how to solve a problem to meet a very specific need.\n\nBeing in MIS or an analyst is the go-between the business and the developer. To take what the business is talking about and translating to how that would work in a code structure/environment. Way more problem solving and analytical skills. Believe me, these two groups do NOT speak the same language.
3	Tech is fun. Programming makes me go insane, though. That's my girlfriend's forte. I prefer networking and admin stuff.
2	In general, yes.\n
2	Even if you don't take it as a career, I've found it to be a really interesting hobby.  I don't have any formal education in it, so it takes a while for me to get over plateaus, but I do enjoy it.
2	I would say yes; I've been doing for 20 years. 
2	Programming gave me a logical structure for creative output. Best of both, to me. And no one bothers me except like-minded people.\n\nNever thought it to be boring, it's a hobby as well as a job.
2	Its a great career with great pay, just beware the boredom.  Going in to the same cubicle every day to work on the same project every day will leave you in a funk of boredom and apathy.  Fight this by working at smaller companies and finding adrenaline pumping hobbies to do outside of work.
2	I am a ISTP developer. IMO it's one of the best profession for ISTPs. The only disadvantage It's kinda hard to be "lone wolf" developer nowadays due of SCRUM&TEAMWORK plague but I enjoy being most productivity, competent and creative developer each time and project.
2	The good thing of being a developer is that you can create your own problem to solve whenever there isn't one lying around. Just be sure to make it small, otherwise you'll lose interest in that task.
2	Not for me. I tried it and couldn't stand the bore of it.
7	stressed	how do you guys kno when you are stressed? and what do you do?\ni probably am a mixture of being tired and stressed, since ive been oversleeping lately.
15	I become impatient and aggressive towards colleagues and family.\n\nNo secret there, you have to remove your foot from the accelerator, think about what is eating all your energy e.g. a situation, a project, an individual... and assess how you can mitigate or avoid it.
6	I go rogue and stop answering phone, doors, email, etc.
5	I feel anxiety.
3	I just disappear for everybody. 
2	I over sleep as well. However as soon as I wake up I leave the house and do something like fishing or hiking or anything. 
6	Team sports? Yea or nay?	I grew up playing all the standard sports but we moved a lot. Nothing made me want to cause bodily harm more than a teammate know-it-all who wanted to give unsolicited pointers and tips. The last time I played organized team sports, I beat out another pitcher who saw the mound as his turf and gave me so much shit I said “it’s all yours, Dickhead!” Then I walked away from team sports, got into surfing, skateboarding, motorcycles, Hell any chance to go fast—and never looked back. Now it’s just occasional pick up volleyball, but I say f—k team sports!!
19	I like them if the people are friendly and not aggressive assholes
10	I prefer individual sports and activities that you can also do with small groups of people. 
6	I really don't mind team activities once I get to the know the people. There would be a long period where I would not trust anyone and feel uncomfortable. 
4	Tennis, disc golf, racing, and fishing for me 👌🏻. So not much of a team player haha. I can do a teammate or two. But I couldn’t be on a field or court full of people. 
5	I hate team sports. I liked shooting, bow shooting, fencing, sometimes swimming, horse\-riding. You could like team entertainment sports, like paintball or something like that. 
5	You're putting yourself into a situation where you're relying on others to not let you down. That never works out well.\n\nI've found I'm much more competitive than other people. Due to their perceived lack of competitive drive it seems like they don't try very hard, and in tern I feel like they've let me down.\n\nIt's just outright frustrating to be let down all the time so I've also stuck to individual activities. Motorcycles, solo's Table Tennis, Mountain Biking. Any PC games I play I tend to enjoy more if I can just play on my own team, or very small team sizes.\n\n
4	I was only ever into individual sports. Mostly epee fencing.
4	I like basketball, but it's not very often you get a team that plays 1985 unselfish style.  Those teams are a blast.  I can't stand playing with younger guys that all want to be Steph Curry.  \n\nI loved baseball in high school, but you're right, without a good coach in charge people get freaked out about who plays what position.  \n\nI like volleyball too, but I need it to be super competitive to have fun with it.  Playing with a bunch of people that can't serve over the net can get really annoying.  \n\nI mostly play 8 and 9 ball pool.  It's one of those games that I will never perfect, but I improve every time I step up to the table.  Kind of the same Idea with bowling.  
2	I quit sport when my teammate broke his leg right in front of me
2	[deleted]
2	I play hockey, so I'm very much into team sports. Having teammates that you like is very important though.
2	In general? No. With friends? Sure, every once in a while.
2	strong nay, hate having to work as a team. im with you man, hate the idea of being the one to drag down the team or be the one to have to carry the team through.\nNever sat well with me so i got into scuba diving. Its a team sport in the sense you always dive with at least 1 other person, but its more of an objective to find than it is beating other teams. like i like working as a team but just not against other teams, you know?
2	I like both. But for things that matter (i.e competing), I prefer individual sports. I was a high level competitive runner and swimmer and I liked that my performance only depended on myself. \n\nFor recreational sports, I prefer team sports. They’re more fun and I don’t really care about winning in those situations.
2	I always liked soccer. It was always fun playing midfield. I always felt like it required a lot of improvisation and I loved working out possible plays on the fly: it makes the sport worth it. \n\nI also loved my old team because we had great chemistry we would do a lot without too much communication. 
2	I grew up playing ice hockey since I could walk and aimed to be a pro... I thrive in team set ups, I was team captain for few years and generally always able to be in top positions within any team\n\nThere is nothing better than a team of people sweating and working together for common goal... at the same time there is nothing worse than a team of people who don't get along at all.\n\nNow in adult life, I hate team activities most of the time, because there are too many lazy fucks in average population without any discipline and giving up at sight of first obstacle, ruining it for everyone. If you are going to be on my team, I want to see honest effort and spirit, I don't mind losing or having 'weak' people as long as they try their best and have fun in process.\n\nConclusion is, as always, it's about people you are with
1	Sports don’t interest me in the least. My (probable) istp kid is into taekwondo.
1	Only Volleyball so far. I haven't played it for several years now. Nowadays I just run/jog, lift weights in my room.
1	Absolutely love hockey, I'd be lying if I said I didn't like performing individually well equally as much as winning though so I can be a shitty teammate in that regard lol. When it's time to win tho I'm super team oriented.
1	I've tried Running, gymnastics, climbing, judo, kickboxing, football (actually football aka the European kind), dancing, and fencing. Fencing was my favourite there.. football and dancing was fun but I hated having a team. I feel like I've forgotten something I went to as a child.. I always did something.
1	I only played team sports growing up. I love them.
1	Nice!👍 some people just need to shut the f-k up!
1	👍
15	ISTP in a corporate Environment	I am wondering who out there currently/in the past has worked in corporate. I have been working corp (finance) for almost 3 years now. I was extremely excited when I get out of college for this job (great pay,benefits,etc...) but I have been finding myself disconnecting more and more. The job I currently have should be a great fit (a lot of analytical work) but I am finding that the overall corporate structure is too rigid for my liking.Has anyone else had this experience and if so what did you do to handle it?
16	Shudders.
11	I worked in a corporate environment for a year and a half. \n\nHated it. My boss and my boss’ boss were just such useless individuals and contributed only confusion and pointless friction to the job. \n\nThat was probably what killed it for me. \n\nI work for a university now. Gigantic quality of life increase. I work at my own pace with no one breathing down my neck and the freedom to find my own best way to get the job done. 
7	Been corporate all my life.\n\nI'm a developer though, so people know to leave me alone. I only talk to coworkers, and give the boss status updates.\n\nNone of them really understand why I pass on team lead/management positions. No way do I want those responsibilities.
4	Have worked in corporate environments for years. There’s always the law and order ESTJs and stiff people without humour but overall I’ve found it a bearable environment. I’d prefer the types of people I work with there any day over being surrounded by a bunch of ENFPs. 
3	What is meant by 'rigid'?
3	Do you have the possibility to change job/team/department via internal job postings? That can renew your interest and perspective of the company, maybe fall under better management who understand you need your autonomy, as long as results follow...\n\nI had control freak managers in the past and I had to openly explain them how I work and that breathing on my neck was counterproductive, eventually they get the message after some time.
3	Worked a corporate martials science job for about eight years after college.  I didn't hate it but I sure didn't love it either.  I dealt with it by taking up skydiving so I at least had something to really look forward to on the weekends.  Eventually I took the test for my city's fire department (and aced it).  Best career move ever.  Now I actually look forward to going to work and have lots of fun there.  And the pay and benefits are better than I had as a scientist.
3	I did it. I hated it. I left it. I freelance.
2	I've been in corporate America for ~20 years. There have definitely been challenging times, especially working with some other types who force their rigidity a little too hard. But overall, I see it like a logical problem: I need money to do the things I want to do (outside of work) and work pays for those, so in the grand scheme of things, it's a necessary part of what I want to do. Something like: "I work to live", so it makes sense to just play the game.
2	I'm currently in law school. I did a corporate law internship because there's definitely a lot of pressure here to go on to ~big law. It was soul crushing. At the end of my time there, I knew I didn't want to do anything like that at all. I'm a firm believer in proper work-life balance, but I personally didn't see how that would be possible with a 70+ hour work week.\n\nI guess my advice would be to find a good outlet to blow off steam outside of work? It's hard working in such a rigid environment. Need to find a way to let loose afterwards. 
2	I've been in the corporate environment for nearly 6 years. I'm lucky enough in my position that I'm officially there as a sub\-contractor, I have a lot of autonomy in my role, and thankfully I have an excellent team overseas for support. But I totally get what you mean about feeling disconnected.\n\nOne of the better ways I wound up blowing off steam is maxing out my Se at the end of most days. Hit the gym, loud music, play video games, hang out with friends, whatever you need to unwind and get yourself into a more active mindset.
1	I can handle it max 8 months. Checked and tested :D But you can try to show your teeth. Make them understand your modus operandi. If they accept it \(for example your disappearances sometimes\) then you can just make it more and more comfortable to you. And actually an abstract idea can help you "see we wear clothes right? And yet we feel free, right? Why is that, clothes are prison if you think. Because you wear clothes you want, you feel comfortable in them.". Put the same to your work. If it is not comfortable and you can't make it comfortable just don't try to stay there and torture yourself. You can actually, but you will feel lack of motivation, feeling like in prison and other unpleasant things.

1	Corporate has some advantages, if you learn your job you can autopilot way easier than at a small place. If you have been there for 3 years it may be time to try something new. Don’t burn any bridges on your way out

10	I think my daughter may be ISTP	Hi, everyone. So, I have a ten year old daughter who I've been trying to type for some time, but it finally occurred to me that she has pretty strong Se tendencies but has always been a very calm, logical thinker.\n\nI've got a rather unusual and tense parenting arrangement, having 50/50 custody shared with my ex wife. So every 2nd week, my daughter and I spend a week together and live our lives outside the influence of my rather hostile INFJ ex.\n\nThere are several peculiarities about my daughter which are worth noting. One is that she started out as a very quiet baby and toddler, silently observing others as if she was intensely evaluating them rather than jumping in and engaging. As she got older, she became fairly confident socially, though her idea of social interaction is to suggest games for other kids to play rather than joining in on their games and their rules. Often, this has led to her feeling like "nobody wants to play with her" when in fact, other kids were already busy and not wanting to stop what they were doing to learn her rules and play along with her ideas.\n\nIt's worth noting also that she has never needed to be disciplined. She has always been what everyone considers a "very good kid". Never has been spanked. When she does something wrong, it can be dealt with by simply explaining things to her rather than punishing her. She responds very well to reward incentives or the threat of having something she likes taken away, but she has a very hard time motivating herself to do what she is supposed to do (clean up after yourself, do your homework, etc).\n\nShe's very much into critters and pets to look after, and she loves games like Minecraft which allow her to build elaborate environments to house virtual animals. She does not like survival mode in Minecraft so much and prefers creative mode where infinite materials are available.\n\nShe seems to take no interest in complex philosophical or intellectual pursuits (like I would) and is content to watch her favorite shows on Netflix or play Minecraft for hours on end. She seems to have a hard time with games that have specific rules and makes up her own rules as she goes instead. This leads to difficulties in playing with others, as mentioned earlier.\n\nSocially, she seems fairly healthy. She has a drive for competition but not overly so. She takes pride in being fast and strong relative to her peers. Also, she is quick to defend another kid if she feels they have been picked on unfairly. She even admits to getting physical in self-defense without any remorse whatsoever, and I have to remind her that she should get teachers involved rather than bringing herself to the level of the aggressor. I am considering the value of putting her into a Jiu Jitsu training course.\n\nOverall, she is not particularly forthcoming about her own emotions. She appreciates spending time together doing the same thing, but we do not have "conversations" really. She seems uncomfortable with the idea of conversation as a "thing to do". This makes her appear to be not very deep, intellectually. Additionally, she never fusses or throws a tantrum or cries or any of the usual kids stuff. Even the "terrible twos" were quite smooth (and thank goodness too because that is when things were exploding with my ex, from her age 3-6). Everyone finds it very unusual that she doesn't express the usual childhood emotions. I think I've seen her cry maybe four times ever. And it is *always* when she has failed to do something she was trying to do, breaks something important, or loses something important. She seems to feel the need to be competent and if there is an obvious, indisputable failure, she will feel terrible and cry (briefly) while apologizing and asking for a hug. This is notably the *only* time she asks for a hug, which I find peculiar. She normally does not like physical affection much at all.\n\nSo... does this sound like an ISTP to anyone here? I know she's only ten, and kids are notoriously difficult to type. But it all does seem to line up really well. And being a *girl*, I realize that ISTP traits are very stereotypically male. This may cause some challenges in terms of finding interesting things for her to apply herself with. I have not yet seen a high degree of "hands on" aptitude, though she does enjoy crafts and drawing. I'm just not sure what I should do at this point to guide her and help her become what works best for her. Additionally, she has dyslexia, which makes her interest in reading pretty much nonexistent. Any advice at all would be helpful. Thanks!\n
30	Only thing I got from this is that you are a very good parent who knows their kid well and looks out for them. Amazing work comrade
6	There is no way that she is an ISTJ. She displays no controlling tendencies. Also you added that she requires little to no discipline. This is because like me and all other ISTPs, she takes the golden rule to heart. She is also a logical thinker. Because of these two things, she can be reasoned with even at a young age. An ISTJ cannot be reasoned with, it is their way or the high way. \n     All of the info you gave on your daughter suggests that she is an ISTP. However I believe the fact that she needs no discipline and seems to naturally understand right and wrong is the greatest give away.
3	It was very long, actually I couldn't read it, sorry. But I read the question. You can just test it. Try to understand her strategy of doing things. If she takes the whole, breaks it to small parts and test each one of it, then she's probably ISTP. But she could be ISTJ too, that's why the second part of testing must be testing if she likes perfect order or she likes to put things in different positions each time. For example her toys. If different positions then she is probably ISTP \(putting things in different positions and places stimulates our energy :D \) . Try to not concentrate on her authority issues, because several types have it \(for example ESTJs, ENTPs etc.\).Also try to notice if she tries to improve everything she concentrates on. That is because of Introverted Intuition as a tertiary function. 
3	Her personality is still developing.  Let her get older before administering personality tests on her.  Jus continue to be a good dad.
2	I easily get bored even with my own hobbies. I like it when someone reminds me of my progress. Give her clear reasons why she must not stop what/where she’s excelling at. Our dominant Ti always goes back and forth with our Ni, hence the negative possibilities we often weave in our minds, and judges our secret need of honest validations. Baby Fe wants to hear sweetest thing once in a while, especially from those closest to us. Even though we might not ask for it or seem to forget or do not react to the fluffy parts. 
1	They make type tests for all ages.  Even infants!  Might be more accurate that way.
6	ISTP calculating outcomes	Are you calculating outcomes all the time? I am just curious about other ISTP, if they do it too. As an ISTP I noticed, I do this kind of thing \-  I take a big  strategy and try to test all the small parts of it before to initiate whole the strategy, I am trying to figure out what would it be like when I initiate the whole mechanism. Do you also do this?
6	I do it all the time. It can get unhealthy though, like in moment of doubts, something that I easily fall into when doing something (projects/planning) with other people or when I’m pressured to do something I do not want to do.   \n\n
0	Any sexual 4 istp?	
9	What?
4	Hate enneagrams :D 
2	I'm an ISTP 2w1 (286), but I think that's as close as you'll get to an ISTP with a feeling enneagram
1	Looks like that's a no. Lol
1	No, Ron. Go find Becky.
16	Anyone else play this little game of trying to get in and out of the store with the least syllables spoken? My record is 2.	
22	Huh? Went to the store plenty of times without saying anything. A smile and a nod is plenty. 
7	I usually never speak. But I heard that americans talk to you at the store? Sounds like a nightmare. 
6	My Walmart gives me no need to speak a single word. Walk in, read signs, find what I want, take to self check out, pay, leave. All without making a single vocal noise. \n\n\nThe most I ever really do is a nod to the greeter on the way in and out. And that’s just a respect thing, not a necessity. \n\n\nI do most of my grocery shopping high (only way I can get myself to do it is to smoke bud lol) so it’s convenient to not have to have those “oh god do they know” moments. I can just walk in hyper focused, get my shit, and get out ASAFP. 
5	My biggest pet peeve is when the dental hygienist tries to make small talk while cleaning my teeth. 1) I don't like to talk and 2) I can't talk with your f'n fingers in my mouth so shut up.  
3	I'd say if I go by myself, it's rare that I use more than two. Thank you is all I need to say once on the way out.
3	Got out of the store today with just a nod and one of those approval grunts. Although that's partly because I'm the most foreign looking person in the country I'm in and no one really bothers trying to speak to me in the local language.
3	I know ASL, so sometimes I pretend I'm deaf to make people leave me alone 
2	Sometimes I'm feeling chatty and I get a little sad when the cashier doesn't want to say more than 2 words.
2	Smile and grunt
1	Unless it’s to comment on all the stupid “chit” people chatter about
1	Autism.
1	I enjoy exchanging pleasantries with cashiers, but no else is going to be conversing with me unless I have inquiries for department employees.
8	ISTP to become more sociable	If you are an ISTP, you know our approach to every unfamiliar person as a potential threat. My question is \- how to become more sociable, more friendly maybe? Or is it worth anyways to become more friendly?
15	Everyone who I have become sociable with was mostly out of necessity. If I'm gonna be with them all the time, I might as well find something to talk about. I.e. regulars at work, classmates, housemates. It takes time but it definitely does happen and I'm glad it does. \n\nEdit: also I'm unfamiliar with the mindset of new people being possible threats. I don't live in a very urbanized area so people that I see in public are just people, not threats. 
6	It's totally worth it, and its easiest/best for me to do it in the context of some activity I love. \n\nSports, motorcycling, gaming, car racing, fixing cars, building race cars, etc. lol
4	Threat? Paranoid?  Being sociable is just not our preferred MO.  We all have "some" extraversion in us.  Just work in your non-preferred mode some. Helps to hang with an extrovert.  However i hope your word choices for what keeps you from meeting people is humor.  Might be something other than introversion going on.
5	follow wat trump does, ESTP
3	I find that by participating in an activity that I'm interested in, I become more familiar with the people/place and am able to become more social that way. I even made friends to hang out with outside of the activity! I think it is worth it because I can work on my Fe and get more adept at talking and relating with people.
3	Husband is an ISTP. He socializes at work out of necessity. There’s 2 guys there he chit-chats with about non-work things (probably gaming). I don’t think he would ever hang out with them in public, outside of work. \n\nHe’a also into gaming. It’s his main hobby. He found a Final Fantasy XIV group a couple years ago (maybe closer to 4 years actually...) to do stuff with in-game, and he still plays different games with some of them now through Discord (just a group voice chat app, if you’ve not heard of it). Sometimes he just pops into their Discord server to chit-chat with them when he’s playing something they’re not. \n\nBut again, I don’t know if he’d hang out with them in public. I don’t think he likes going into public much outside of required things like work or a relative’s birthday dinner. We do have a DnD group every other Friday. We go to the DM’s house for a couple hours to play.\n\nWe’re going to a family member’s graduation this week. We plan on being the first ones out, not out of rudeness, but like “we’re here, we saw her walk, let’s go!”\n\nI’m not a fan of public either.  Find a hobby, see how it’s been turned into a social deal, fake it ‘til you make it with the chit-chat, see what happens.
2	It's worth it.  I've managed to do it by just finding a social activity to do.
2	[deleted]
2	I'll put it simply, How can one be a threat if they are vulnerable?\n\nBe vulnerable. Put yourself outside your element. Do what not you would do. \n\nStep outside of your comfort zone and be someone else. 
2	I have an ENFP friend who has helped me out a ton when it comes to developing my lesser cognitive functions. Just from hanging out around him I've started to see other people differently and become more open, and as a result more sociable.\n\nEven if people with really different types, and extraverts in particular, can be annoying, finding one to hang around with can help you by giving you an example of how to be sociable.\n\nAlso self help books. But they tend to either be too general or too specific, so you have to process and actually use the advice irl. They should only serve as a springboard and a way to keep yourself moving when you hit a plateau in your social ability. It's easy to get caught in a loop of doing nothing but taking in more and more information, but still never going outside.
2	become an estp! xddxdxdxdxxxdd
2	Make lots of puns.
7	ISTP quotes	What ISTP quotes you like most? \n\nI am kinda collecting quotes about ISTPs. I am ISTP too :D 
34	“I’d like to not get involved in these matters, or any matters of any nature.”\n\n“If any of you need anything at all, too bad. Deal with your problems yourselves, like adults.”\n\n“If there were more food and fewer people, this would be a perfect party.“\n\n“I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.”\n \nAll of these are credited to Ron Swanson\n
11	"You're doing that wrong"\n\n-Me
11	'Listen, smile, nod, then do whatever the hell you were going to do anyways' Robert Downey Jr.
5	"What the hell kind of quote am I supposed to share here?" -me
5	"If I were any higher, id be an art major."
6	“...”
2	"...." -me
2	Istp's is disturbingly accurate holy f*ck	
31	>not into anything too crazy sexually\n\nOh, sweet summer child.
10	This is as "accurate" as horoscopes. 
3	> You enjoy the physical component of sex much more so than the romantic/intimate portion. \n\n\nThis was the only part that didn’t match up to me. But I chalk that up to nurture over my nature. I’ve had some things happen in the past to really cripple my ability to trust partners. Because of that, sex to me is most enjoyable when it’s paired with romance and intimacy. If I don’t feel close and connected, having sex would just be a waste of time. It wouldn’t go well. \n\n\n> You can err on the promiscuous side but if it requires work, forget it. You can masturbate alone. No issue there.\n\n\nThis is hilariously accurate though! The majority of my encounters have not been pursued by me, but by whatever partner I was with. Idk why but if I have to put in too much effort, I just say fuck it. 
3	I enjoy sex but at the end of the day it's pretty stupid and not worth the webspace
23	Sharing my timeline of WTF years (Intense)	Age 15: I dismissed a big scholarship grant on marine biology and enrolled in creative writing (because the degree sounded cute) Major regrets later\n\nAge 16; I joined fraternity (experiencing hazing and all that, drugs) Major regrets later\n\nAge 18: I joined a leftist movement group and rallied on the streets (never told my parents who were both activists but they found out about it anyway) \n\nAge 20: I wasn’t able to graduate on time because I fuckin fell in love \n\nAge 21: Graduated and experienced walking on the streets, looking for work and vacancies, ended up as a broker (I quit after a month) \n\nAge 23: Got promoted as a manager at an IT company (and quit the job because I wanted to be self-employed) Also becoming better and better at photography \n\nAge 25: Became the head analyst consultant of a marketing agency and quit the job because I decided to transition (yes, I’m a trans woman) and fell in love lols major regrets later\n\n26: Move to another city (a more liberal one) and started my MBA (and quit it after three months) lols \n\n27-28; A life of getting drunk and extraversion (travels to two countries with the love of my life) and getting published and known as first trans poet in my country\n\n29: (my age now) Not caring about the past, jobless, just ended a deep romantic relationship (got bored out of it) and now starting a travel company with three friends \n\nMy parents (ISTJ father and ENTP mother) had no idea about this timeline lols except those that I humorously exposed (only when they asked) \n\nI’m 9w1. Super broke, fucked in the head when it comes to “future” \n\nMy biggest dream is to build a cabin and be a farmer forever (my father already set out land for me) \n\nDon’t you have that feeling that life just sort of happened and you harbor no ill feelings nor a speck of grudge that you could just laugh at every stupid thing you did? \n\n
11	Atleast you've done things. I haven't done anything at all. Just married a guy who doesn't bother me and lets me do my own thang lol (been 3 years now). After highschol 5 years ago I just been chillin ever since. Only had 2 jobs so far. Currently jobless. Might go to college to keep distracted and so family members can stop asking lol. I have no motivation for the future. I just wanna chill and be at peace.\n\n23f, Istp 9, Sp/Sx
6	I get confused. By Trans woman you mean born a man and now are a girl?
2	/r/Stoicism 
1	Damn girl! You’ve got one hell of a history haha. Sounds much like mine but I’m a few years behind you. 
1	I'm 45 and had a very different experience.
1	I'm going to ask a question that I've always been curious about, but feel like I can't actually ask people relevant. My curiosity is really high, because I don't understand and can't process the thoughts. I completely understand if this is way too personal and you don't want to talk about it, I'm just asking to learn. \n\nWhat thought process brought you to the point that you decided you wanted to change sex? \n\nDo you see Men or Women? (or both?) Did it change after?
1	Just keep calm and go with a flow. Seriously sometimes the best decision is to not do anything. I know we ISTPs try to achieve something, master something all the time. But let's say just try to keep calm, make a coffee \(not literally, just go with that mood\). \n\nI found out that the best method to get solutions to problems, or demotivated states, is to play with time. Sometimes you need to compress time, but now I think you just need to make it slow \(make a coffee time\). \n\nAnd yeah \- the problem is to find purpose. Or not to find it, but to make a principle to live in the present, without any purposes, achievements etc. 
22	For my mid twenties and older istps....	Do you ever wish you were in a perpetual state of drunkness?  At the risk of sounding like an alcoholic, it's just feels so nice to not give a fuck or overthink + be affectionate and connect to everyone around me.... oh god is this how ESFPs are like???\n\nEdit: in case any of you youngins get butthurt, I specify age because I feel like by that age there's a certain established level of self-knowledge and relationship w alcohol.\n\nEdit #2: such diverse responses. I am intrigued.
42	Hate being drunk. Don’t like the way it makes me feel. Hate not being able to jump in a car and leave on a whim. Dislike being around drunks. It’s an expensive hobby, I have better things to spend my money on. I could go on.
9	(Late 40's) Cherish the two beer buzz for parties.  No more, no less.  Just right to enjoy the crowd.
6	If I could be in that state without actually being drunk that would be awesome, but all we can do is wish upon a star.
11	Yes. I have a hard time opening up to people or connecting with them unless I am somewhat inebriated for the most part. Especially when it comes to romantic partners.\n\nBeing drunk or even being just a bit beyond buzzed helps me let go of some of that whatever it is I've got going on that makes me so closed off to people.\n\nI had a whole live-in boyfriend that I used to have to get drunk just to cuddle or be affectionate with. I could be playful and silly and fun and not have to worry about anything.\n\n We'd drink a little and have these hours long talks by candlelight with music playing in the background and it was just.... well it was always amazing but the next day or when sober I would feel super self-conscious about even randomly wrapping my arms around him but he was the same way. Surprise! We were both ISTPs....\n\nAnd I'm not really a worrier but I do have moments of anxiety and panic about things both Beyond and within my control and honestly the alcohol just melts all that bullshit away. I'm actually amazed I'm not a full-blown Alcoholic by this point.\n\nI'm 27 btw.
2	I used to drink too much, had to give it up. Not sure if that's an ISTP trait or something else, but I used to really like drinking 'cause it would make me feel less self-conscious and able to socialize more easily. Self knowledge is the better route though.
4	No, when you're over not thinking that is when you are at your weakest. That is when the world either kills you or throws you into the streets. Our distinct advantage is that we overthink things, we are always ready for the next attack, whether it be a terrorist or an exam. It is more painful to be vulnerable than it is to be sober. The moment you let your gaurd down, that's when life puts out a cigar in your eye. I was never the popular kid, I couldn't afford to "let loose". If you're still in the WTF years while still in your twenties then get a hobby, join the military, or watch Jordan Peterson videos.
1	I used to drink hard in my early twenties , now that I have a motorcycle and a dog I find my life is more fun by just having the occasional craft beer at dinner. 
1	I'm 32, I've been drunk exactly once in my life and can't forsee it ever happening again. I don't mind have a bit to drink in social situations but it's a rarity. I like to be in control of myself and my actions.\n\nI also don't want to feel like shit the next day
1	Even black out drunk I like to be in control of myself. Never had to be carried anywhere, went by myself, walking miles to get home if I have to. And yes, being drunk all day every day for a while sounds great. Good for your mind. \n\nBad for your health though. If I don't drink a drop for the rest of my life, that's ok too. I don't really get how people get dependent of the stuff. \n\n
1	30, ISTP, I want to be drunk all the time. But I don't do that. I noticed that I can 'not to give a fuck' without being drunk. It is just little harder to enter that state. But let's say "feel your arms, feel your appearance, and yes that is you, don't give a fuck about anything" ;\) 
1	27, I used to like being drunk, because I have ADHD and the dopamine spike would get me to focus, and I could get anything done I wanted. Hate it now, though. Don't like feeling out of control. I don't need it to be social, I've seen too much shit to ever be insecure again.
1	Alchool is toxic and I hate it. 
1	Nah, I don't really like being drunk. 
1	I've never been drunk but it sounds like I would make a mess out of my life, I already have enough with procrastination
10	What potentially life changing decisons are you guys thinking about doing?	I feel like the restless bunch of us are always going back and forth between different ideas and such. Anybody thinking of career moves, quitting jobs or school, starting a business, a big move? 
10	Thinking about quitting a job that pays well but asks me to present solutions to their stupid problems all day.  I’ve also realized I hate managing people. Who’d thunk that.
4	Not currently thinking about it, but every 10 years or so. Currently self employed. 
3	I'll go myself. I recently decided to put some time into becoming a Web Developer... at a coding boot camp. Web Dev is not something I've really thought about before, but it's something that really interested me the more I looked into it.   \n\nSay what you want about coding boot camps, but I really can't wait to get started and this is the perfect thing for me right now. I'm not great in school all around so diving into something specific and having to skip Gen Eds is really invigorating. I've closed a lot of doors for myself academically and I realize this could become a career; which is something I've been looking for, for the past 3 years. 
3	I handed in my notice on Wednesday and I consciously made that decision the same morning I did it.
3	I started investing in stocks relatively recently (start of the year), not much, $500 here, $300 there, a little of some ETFs, some Bitcoin, etc just to learn the ropes. I played around with penny stocks and mock trading as a teen which was nearly a decade ago, so I needed a refresher.\n\nI made some gains but nothing life changing. Feeling more proficient at it, I'm strongly considering taking a chunk of my savings and really going big in the market. I'm not going for high-risk or anything but I do realize that I'm going to have to put a lot of money in it to make anything substantial. Right now I'm about 60/40 in favor of investing more in but I'm still unsure.\n\n\n*edited because I was using voice to text at the time which made some parts incoherent. 
5	Quit my job last year to work for the family business. Prior to then felt pressured into healthcare because of the stability and earning ratio. Failed out of a healthcare post bacc program in 2016 while drinking myself into a stupor 4x a week because I hated it. \n\nAlso no longer talk to anyone from more than five years ago save for three or four people. Realized everyone I knew prior weren't really my friends since I met them when I wasn't self-confident or actualized enough to be my true self . This meant I would let them disrespect me and didn't stand up for myself.  \n\nIn hindsight the further I get from those events and people the more perspective I have about how sad those people were too. Allowing yourself to be disrespected by people who act that way is two sides of the same dysfunction coin; one side feels they deserve to be treated that way and the other wants to avoid feeling that way by projecting those insecurities onto others. \n\nNow I'm financially secure, can do my own things, have supportive friends and family, am becoming aware of my shortcomings and trying to improve myself. Life is too short to be worried about what a bunch of dysfunctional people think about how you should live your life. \n\nThe biggest sign you're doing well is when you can understand and rationalize their behavior, why you sought them as friends or partners, how they affected you, and what your own issues were that allowed it to happen. \n\nThey're simply not worth the effort or time if they already dismissed your advice or comments when you tried to communicate with them. It also means making new social circles with people who are role models and push you up instead of drag you down. \n\nPeople with a healthy self-perception are open to communication and resolving conflict. They don't put you down, get defensive, offer excuses, deflect, etc. This is one of my biggest things I notice about people to gauge their emotional intelligence. You might be 30+ but if you act like a teenage twat when someone calls you out or disagrees with you, it means you're fucked up bro. \n\nRecognizing people who are high value vs low is something that comes with maturity and experience. \n\nIn short, you should totally shake up your life because it will probably teach you many things, directly and indirectly, that will help you as a person in the future. 
2	I'm thinking about breajing up with my boyfriend of almost a year :/. I feel like I need a fresh start but I don't want to throw away so the progress we've made. It's not like I don't like him he's great but I just want to feel single again. 
1	My summer break starts today, it’s going to be a busy one:\n\n- Finally learn how to drive.\n- Work out again.\n- Learn Russian.\n- Focus on making my own food.\n\nHopefully, by the end of the summer, I’ll be a different person.
1	Thinking of building a boat
1	Thinking about going back to school to learn programming. 
1	I have one more semester of my mech. engineering degree I’ve been struggling through for forever and I’m suddenly thinking of getting into real estate investing. I think the idea of working a desk job freaks me out. 
1	I'm seriously thinking starting a gamedev company by myself, despite the odds at succeeding. That wouldn't happen soon though, more likely in 5 years or so, when I'm done repaying the loan for my home.\n\nBut yeah, meanwhile I am in the process of switching my programmer job to being freelance, so I can earn same money while working less (greatest plan ever!), so I have more freetime to refine my skills for game development.\n\nHopefully this will lead me to what I truly want to be!
1	Dropping out of college and selling cars for a few years. Already got the job and haven't talked with my parents about college yet (I figure they'll be open to it when they see I failed almost all of my classes this spring. Thanks depression) but I'm optimistic. 
1	Finally taking up guitar for real!!🎸🎸🎸🎸
1	I'm in my mid 30s and never worked with machinery but I want to throw away my well paying office job to become a tower crane operator (previously considered helicopter pilot but seemed too difficult/expensive what with the massive flight hours required for getting into commercial flying)
2	i made you guys a promotional video	
9	Could have done without the bullshit techno beat.  
2	I liked the compilation, but background music is like.. you know it can be used for DIY videos, not for this. Just remove it. I hope you can edit YouTube video. 
11	To text or not to text	I was dating an ISTP for about 4 weeks who I really liked. At first he came on really strong, but then at week 4 said that he wanted to slow things down. I gave him lots of space and we continued to text the following week, til it eventually stopped. I thought that if he were really interested, he would ask me out, so I haven't reached out since then. A few weeks passed. Strangely enough, I have run into him twice in the past week! Each time he seemed genuinely happy to see me, with a big smile on his face each time. He even asked me specific questions about things going on in my life that he remembered me talking about. But that was it. No message or anything.\n\nI'm wondering if I should send a flirty message, like "Are you stalking me? : P" without seeming overtly interested, or if I should just let it go. Again, I feel like if he was really interested, he would get in touch. I do like him though.\n\nP.S. What do you guys think when you run into an old flame?\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for all of your wonderful responses! I decided to text him yesterday. It took a day, but he responded! Hope that means he's interested! Haha
48	I don't know if this is just me, or if this is how ISTPs work, but if this person is like me, they are probably interest checking you. \n\nPeople like me get really emotionally invested in people (coming on strong) but it's only worth the energy to us if the other person wants that. So we will turn down the flame to see if you put in enough of an effort to show us that you still want it. It doesn't have to be much, just more than zero. \n\nSpace is NOT helpful. That's not what we want. We just want to make sure you actually want us to put in the effort.
37	Text him, ISTPs are notoriously bad at keeping in contact with people and are bad reaching out themselves. You'll know if he's interested if he responds. Chances are he's probably wondering the same thing but doesn't want to text you in case you arent interested.
9	Text him!!!!
9	If someone doesn't go out of their way to get in contact with me, I can easily just not talk to them for long periods of time. \n\nIf you really want to talk to him, then you gotta text him first, because if he's anything like me, it just won't cross his mind. \n\nEdit: or it will cross his mind, but if you don't seem interested, he probably won't pursue you
6	Don’t play it cool with an ISTP. We are already bad at reading signs. Dont exacerbate the situation by acting like you’re not interested or you won’t get him. I guarantee that.
5	Go get him you idiot!! :)

10	Why do you think you're an ISTP?	I'm pretty curious about the other users of this sub, because I've noticed a lot of comments that don't seem congruent to the ISTP temperament. \n\nSome examples:\n\n- People saying they're control freaks. Control freaks are the opposite of the SP temperament. ISTPs are known to be "chill" and not uptight.\n\n- People with strong Fi preferences. \n\n- People with little to no Se preference. Or those who prefer rules and structure, indicative of Si.\n\nSomeone on the mbti sub mentioned that they think a lot of users in this sub are mistyped, which I initially disagreed with. But now am beginning to agree with them. \n\nAnyways I'd like to hear your thoughts on how you determined your mbti type!
27	Can't decide if I want to do engineering college like society wants me to or live in Iceland as a farmer.
14	Because I'm an ISTP
13	Because I'm not an INTP
11	I don’t mince words.
11	I had to take the MBTI test for my highs school and got ISTP. Every other time I've taken it, I get the same result. Maybe it would be different now. I am a adrenaline junkie and pick up and put down hobbies like no one I've ever knows. I love doing hands on projects, and love to problem solve. But in my college years, I've become a huge planner. I think it's because I'm so forgetful so I plan everything even when I plan to eat and brush my teeth. So much time wasted unless you optimize the day.
5	The first time I took the test I initially scored ISTP. Didn't really think much of it until I retook the test a year ago at 18. I've managed to get INFJ, INTJ, INTP and on some occassions ENTJ. Since then I've realised mbti descriptions are too innaccurate so found solace in cognitive functions.\n\n Of course I have my doubts but that's just the hallmark of my thinking. I like accuracy. \n\n\nIf I had to list traits though it would go as follows\n\n* I'm very observant and can pick up skills fairly quickly after trialing it firsthand. \n\n* I'm a blend of thinking + action and cant stand people who talk for the sake of talking. If I don't see any use behind it I'm quick to dismiss it.\n\n* I'm really calm in stressful situations. For some reason it's when my thinking is most useful. I'm a good problem solver. I can easily pick up when things go wrong and work around it/fix it\n\n* My emotions are a foreign concept. I would describe it as "detached"  I'm just not aware of it until someone points it out.  Not to say I don't have emotions, I'm just unsure how to express them. It feels like an act when I try\n\n* Anger and annoyance is probably my strongest emotion. Due to negative impacts my anger had on the past I'm very hesitant to act on it. I don't trust myself in that aspect. I get overly emotional but stop when I realise I'm in a vulnerable position. I like to be in control and angers debilitating\n\n* I'm pretty polite and welcoming but in a sharp and direct way. Laidback and calm\n\nAnd a whole lot more that I'm too lazy to mention.
4	My reasons are: definitely IxxP, no one irl would argue that. I seem to prefer Se over Ne in order to stay sane. I like simplicity and minimalism, getting to the core concepts and functionality of things, I read that's common among ISTPs. I tend to categorize people inside my head, that's why mbti is fun to me. I don't have strong values, I don't mind discussing values, making sense of them and modifying them. I like improving methods for doing things in the most efficient ways (fitness, food related, studying), I'm not structured though. I've described inferior Fe to an ENFP and ISTJ, they both giggled and said it definitely sounded like me, and they consider me more logical than I thought they would. At the end of the day, I want things to be simple and make sense, that's the biggest reason I think I'm an ISTP (and yes we all know it's just a non-scientific theory)
4	> - People saying they're control freaks. Control freaks are the opposite of the SP temperament. ISTPs are known to be "chill" and not uptight.\n\nI would say from a personal stance I can have a perfectionist streak in me from time to time, but I hardly care about "control" enough to be a freak, especially with others. Live and let live.\n\n> - People with strong Fi preferences.\n\nDefinitely not Fi. Can't really expand this further.\n\n> - People with little to no Se preference. Or those who prefer rules and structure, indicative of Si.\n\nI live in the moment, it is the most real to me and it is where I am the most responsive. I might not write a college paper until near the deadline, but I can knock it out in three days or even less with the same or even better quality than many try to do in weeks of research and structuring.\n\nI like rules and structure when it makes sense from my point of view, but I am not willing to accept rules and structures for their own sake, and I do not care to structure anything myself if I do not need it. I have an internal structure from which I can make sense from and then operate within chaos (which I think is quintessential Ti.)\n\n-\n\nI can not judge with confidence, but I think a lot of people here being mistyped is likely. I definitely do not get the "unfeely" part about ISTPs here because I consider myself to be open in person, but I would agree I'm not "lovey-dovey," or at the absolute least in the traditional sense.
5	Didn’t know there were ISTP police. Can’t escape can we?
2	Because I've taken the test many times and I initially typed as an Istj, however I Iater discovered that the Istp personality fits more with who I am, and though I am at times somewhat strict is because the situation calls for it, I have always had a leading mentality since in every school project I am chosen as the leader, but I am also very interested in the why of things, I am usually very chill, pretty introverted, I use logic most of the time and while I have taken time to explore my feelings, I still don't let them out and will suppress them if my logic says so
2	I took a bunch of tests and checked out the functions. I was pretty sure I was an ISTP, but had considered others. So, then I did a type me post and those who responded also said ISTP. I also noticed that my Holland Code was [the same as other ISTP Redditors](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/6h4cyi/what_were_you_guys_holland_codes/). \(RIA/RAI. My A and I usually come out equal. If you want to take that test, there's a quick one [here](https://www.123test.com/career-test/).\) And then there's a type me questionnaire posted in the MBTI sub that I had ignored, but then tried out last night for fun when the [answer key was posted in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8i82dz/hey_super_new_to_mbti_wondering_if_anyone_could/). So I did the questionnaire before looking at the answer key, and then the answer key confirmed it again. So, feeling pretty confident on this lately.  And definitely not a mistyped J as some think we all are. There's nothing J about me. On the tests with a J\<\-\>P scale, I always come out something like 97&#37; P. 
2	Why do I think I'm an ISTP? Frankly, I don't know. I show certain traits of both ISTPs and INTPs. I took MBTI tests on several websites to confirm my being an ISTP. In 16personalities, my Se was dominant by only \~10&#37; more than iN, which could be the reason for my confusion in typing \(or mistyping\) as an ISTP, but still having many traits of INTPs.\n\nI do prefer having rules and structure, unusual for ISTPs, but only to a certain point. I basically embrace how the US makes laws \(at least, ideally\); if it doesn't infringe on someone else's rights, it's fine. I can be a bit of a control freak in certain matters, but that may be because I don't trust people with sensitive things, and that I prefer to do things the tried\-and\-true way if it's something that cannot afford to fail. Otherwise, I don't care how you do it, as long as it's not a stupid way of doing it, stupid defined as having a high chance of failure.\n\nOne of my traits that seems to occur semi\-frequently in ISTPs is willingness to bend certain rules. For example, I don't really see the problem with "cheating" on it's own on spouses \(the potential effects of extramarital affairs, such as higher risk of divorce, is not considered here. I need to do more research to fully understand what "cheating" does to a marriage\), as long as the person doing the "cheating" is communicative to the other spouse, and the other spouse is accepting of it. However, there are certain Asian cultural habits that I cling to tightly, and take pride in. For example, speaking only when necessary, which may be part of the reason why I'm introverted as fuck, not knowing how to use knife \+ fork to cut stuff while eating \(okay, that might just be because I have used chopsticks my entire life and never really cared to learn how to eat like a white dude\), deference for the elderly, using my "native" \(I learned how to speak English after I learned to speak Mandarin, so English is my second language, if going by the literal meaning of second language. However, I am far more fluent in English, due to more exposure in English, so  my native language, if using the definition of the phrase "native language," is English\) language with great fluency, stuff like that. It could simply be because I greatly respect my Asian heritage, and this is my way of demonstrating that respect, but looking from the viewpoint of a detached observer, they are merely rules, the only difference being that they are self\-imposed.\n\nStrong Fe preferences? Fuck no. I have nothing like that. I do have emotions because I'm not a sociopath nor psychopath, but [I prefer to be unaffected by emotions](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/8bzhaf/explained_mbti_to_my_istp_engineering_coworker/) \(see my comments in this thread\). I can quickly calm down when angry, though I do need to learn how to not get angry as quickly. I am too easily annoyed by certain things, such as willful ignorance, and incompetence \(including my own incompetence. If I feel I am incompetent at something that I am doing ATM, I feel very embarrassed, or angry at myself\).\n\nAnyways \(or TL:DR if you prefer\), I don't really know if I'm an ISTP or not. But, some of my personality quirks are consistent with those of ISTPs, and personality tests call me an ISTP, so an ISTP I am.\n\nI typed as an INTJ at one point in my life. Essentially, I was going through the emotional part of puberty, and was somewhat paranoid.
1	I have taken the 16 personalities test multiple times. The first time ever got me ISTP, once was something else I can't remember (istj maybe?), and a few times I've gotten INTP. I took an enneagram test as well that put me as type 5 with balanced wings. I've read up on everything I've been typed as (really just ISTP and INTP) and while I can definitely see the traits in me that line up with other types, not all of them of that type do. Pretty much every thing I've read about ISTP rings true to me. 
1	My psychologist who diagnosed me with ADD and was acting as a councilor told me I was textbook ISTP. So he pulled out a huge test that took me like 30 minutes to finish. At the end of that, he goes “yup, as I suspected”. \n\n\nI’m a little more of a feeler than most ISTP’s, but it doesn’t negate the fact that I’m mostly a thinker. I chalk that up the nurture from my mother. 
1	Like everyone else took the test and figured it out, just like u, so whatever u are why do u think so
1	The test told me.
1	About the OP : \n-I'm not a control freak at all. I'm not a control anything tbqh.\n-Ti is my strongest function\n-Yes I think there might be some mistyped users on here. Not exclusive to our sub obv.\n\nSo how do I know ? Took the test multiple times. Verification through study, also heavily recognized myself thanks to this sub. \n-I also think alone. I engage problems through deductions and suggestions compared to my ISTJ brother and father who only uses external facts and certainties. They're not very comfortable deducting things and almost need to hear some things out loud to understand.\n\n- I'm a lazy fuck\n\n-I love thrills and living in the moment. I procrastinate a lot and I don't care about traditions or whatever norms if it doesn't make sense to me.
1	On test, I'm about 50/50 on N/S and J/P. Overall I'm an IxTx but, I ruled out ISTJ due to my views on authority and structure. I don't mind following rules and authority figures, but if they restrain me from doing what I think is correct, I completely disregard them. INTJ and INTP could be a decent fit, but I don't find myself having the long range imagnative thinking that INTJs do, nor the paitence to carry out long term plans or commitments. I could be an INTP,  since I don't consider my S a strong point, but I find my intuitive is more of envisioning the likely outcome from a situation I see currently, instead of seeing multiple ways a situation can happen.\n\nPlus I unintentionally ghost people a lot, which I heard is pretty common for ISTP.
1	I think that because I read the comments and they are describing exactly how I feel (for most of them).\n\nI also took several tests online , each delayed by some month/ a year and was always categorized as ISTP. One single time it said INTP though, and I can also recognize myself in some ways...
1	I don't fit the stereotypes, the world has forced me to grow beyond them, and I'm more emotionally intelligent than most people, let alone ISTPs. 12 years of studying, though, and nothing solves my puzzle more than Ti Se Ni Fe.\n\nIf anyone here understands enneagram, I'm a 2w1, which can make me look like an ISFP pretty often, but I think the best test for your dominant function is what relaxes you when you're tired, and for me it's logic puzzles and studying mechanical systems.\n\nSe is obvious, I'm very concrete and can identify a car within a given generation of make and model by catching a glimpse of a taillight passing by at 60mph. Most of my friends are N types, and I'm the grounding factor anchoring them all to reality.
6	ENFP - ISTP relationship asking for advice	Posted this on ENFP forum but might as well post it here:\n\nHi Redditors and fellow ENFP,\n\nI am an ISTP male and just currently starting a relationship with an ENFP female. We've been best friends for 10 years before finally the "spark" exists.\n\nWarning! long post ahead!\n\nWe've only been dating for the past 3 months until I pulled the trigger and asked her to be my girlfriend. she agrees. but, this is where all the problems started.\n\nEven though she agrees to be my girlfriend, she also said that she hasn't completely develop her feelings to me yet. I said it's fine, as long as she wanted to try. \n\nThe problem is, 6 days AFTER I asked her to be my girlfriend, she goes on a trip to Korea for 2 weeks. I feel that I won't have enough time with her for the next two weeks, so on the 3 out of 5 weekdays before she goes on a trip, I called her after office hour or close to end of the work-day to ask if she wanted a lift to go home. The first day she agrees, but I think at some point it became an annoyance to her. She started to respond to my text coldly, I panicked and bombarded her with messages to "try" to make her not angry anymore. She did not respond well here, and basically only replying with a single word or even none at all.\n\nAfter she went home from Korea, I again, foolishly bombarded her with messages and saying things like I missed her, I want to meet up, etc. She became uncomfortable and she confronted me. She says that after I asked her to be my girlfriend, it looked like as if I became obsessed with her and she is not happy with it. So I backed out a little.\n\nThen the weekend came, we both have plans to meet out that day, so I finally able to see her again after 4 weeks not seeing each other (and right after I asked her to be my gf, this is our first meetup).\n....\nit became awkward. she didn't spoke at all, I didn't know what topic to discuss. the day ended with her unsatisfied with my behaviour that day.\n\n(mind you all of this is happening 2 weeks ago)\n\nnow the story of last week,\n\nLast sunday, I got asked by her to accompany her attending her friend's wedding party. I agreed and I think it will be a good chance to meet her friends and making a good impression (both to her and her friends). \n\non the way to the party I asked her about her favourite shows, she asked about mine. and from there our conversation flows like a water. During the party, I met with her friends and giving my best to impress them (and it's NOT EASY to do with my Introverted mind), I think it all went well. I managed to have a little chit-chat with few of her friends. And considered this a success.\n\nnow, what I confused most is that why sometimes I feel the connection, but sometimes we missed the connection completely? \n\nTL;DR\nI have problems connecting with my ENFP partner. sometimes we feel the connection, sometimes we doesn't.\n\nhow do we ISTPs communicate to ENFPs so that there is no misunderstanding between us? any of you fellas had experience in this?
12	To me, it seems that at the beginning when you were bombarding her with a lot of panicked texts and trying to spend a lot of time with her, you may have made her feel claustrophobic. She may be your girlfriend, but she also enjoys her freedom to live her life independently of you.\n\nJust continue on with your life like before you two agreed to enter a relationship. Don't treat her too much differently than when you weren't a couple. The only difference between the time when you were just friends and now is that you can make romantic gestures to her without it being creepy. Just don't over do it!\n\nBest of luck :)
8	Nah. Personality types aside. All I know is to never be--or act on--desperate especially as a guy.. like you mentioned you achieved a flow in your interactions. Don't try to force anything. Just do you. Dont be extremely concerned about the relationship. Your life will be easier for you.
8	To be honest, she doesn't really sound like an ENFP. I wouldn't actually know, just wasn't the vibe I got from her in your story.
2	I click thread, I see long post, I click back. 
1	ENFP here, she doesn’t really sound like an ENFP lol I would LOVE to be bombarded with texts and pursued and if she liked you even a LITTLE bit she would’ve been giddy you asking to give her a lift home. Just the fact you cared enough to reach out on your own. \n\nThat being said, she might just genuinely not be interested anymore. For whatever reason, and you constantly reaching out is making her feel trapped. No quicker way to initiate annoyance 😂
-8	[deleted]
187	Yep	
29	I know when I was younger(and still to this day if I can...less opportunity when you're older), I'd basically just try to show off in front of my crushes. I'd play a sport or do something athletic around them to try and impress them. Usually from there I'd gauge their response and figure out if they were into me.\n\nThe problem with me though, is that once I decide I want to make something happen, I freeze up. I start freaking out, like ice shoots through my veins and I start thinking, "crap dude, idk if I want a gf." Then I usually shake it off and decide I'm better off single. Idk what my problem is.
20	Almost always:\n\nIntrovert girls want an extrovert boy\n\nExtrovert girls want an extrovert boy\n\nIntrovert boys just are not very popular according to most girls
7	Don't forget the death stare. Or is that just me?
5	Oh man, I'm struggling so much with this. Whenever I go for a run, I always run by at least one girl who would pause whatever she was doing and gaze at me for a few seconds. Instead of smiling and approaching her like what any normal guy would do, I'd smirk or do something stupid like wink at her. TBH, I prefer to run shirtless, but I feel really embarrassed when other people stare at me, so I always blush and run faster whenever I notice someone looking at me for an extended period of time.
11	This is an ISTP thing?\n\nI think I'd either come right out and say I like you, do you like me? Or at least try to spend some time with the person until it became clear if they liked me or not.\n\nIf someone doesn't like me, I have zero patience with wasting time on them. They have to like the real me, or I'd rather just be alone.
3	So, I'm a girl, and I hear that it's a thing that other people meet people through exchanging eye contact at bars or wherever, but personally I do my best to avoid eye contact with strangers that I'm not already interacting with. No across the rooms sparks for me, I've already continued the trajectory of my gaze so as to not be seen looking. I sometimes wonder if this is why I don't get as much attention as I would think my looks should grant me (is that big-headed? I have good physical self-esteem).\nI mostly only "meet" people through repeated interactions (like in college, currently devising a plan to express interest in one of my TAs now that the semester is almost over, wish me luck). Unless someone's on the higher side of attractive or we happen to click, I really need to get to know them first to start liking them. And it takes me a while to get to know people and feel comfortable around them. I have a tendency to like my friends because of this.\nMy main point is that as an ISTP I don't really flirt by casting shy sideways glances. I go for the direct approach. I can usually pick up on if someone is at least a little interested in me through nonverbal queues (a certain look in their eye, looking at me when laughing, closer physical proximity). Once I get these queues, if the other person is too shy to initiate something in their own way, I typically ending up confronting them. Not always as direct as "I like you, we should hang out," but I have done things very similar to that too.
1	oof
1	Applies to this ISFP as well, lol. Although I've never really been attracted to anyone since I was like 14 or so.
1	It are a fact.
1	fuckin a, tho i go further than that, when they 'give up', then she off ma list
2	Some Questions Relating to Se	Let's say you've become addicted to a laptop or website or have to spontaneously take action on something else on a laptop when you're addicted to a website.\n\nDoes the website addiction make it more difficult to switch to another task spontaneously?\n\nDoes the addiction to the laptop or website make it harder to take action not involving it?\n\nWhat if it's put in front of you with everything set up and ready to go?\n\nHow easy is it to not pay attention to it and instead pay attention and take action on something else (e.g. going back to sleep with your laptop nice and tidy set up ready to go right next to you)?\n\nCup your hands for a few seconds and try to feel a ball of play dough or compressed air there. Does it feel like something is there?\n\nDo you feel a push or pull of things and people in your environment?
11	That's a lot of questions
4	xstp here. That’s way too...I mean I don’t think like that and if I had to it would drive me a bit nuts tbh. 
2	I'm not addicted to anything, I just get bored and if there isn't anything more interesting to do at that particular moment I do whatever. I can switch easily say from overeating to working-out. I guess it has to do with getting involved in real time in a certain environment.
2	> Cup your hands for a few seconds and try to feel a ball of play dough or compressed air there. Does it feel like something is there?\n\nWhat? This is definitely related to an an intuitive function. It's literally imagination, not experience. Se is limited to reality and manipulating that reality to change it to your own needs, not creating a new reality out of nothing. \n\nTo be honest its hard to find a connection between your questions and Se at all. If I were to pair addiction with a function (not that it really should be paired with anything) I would pair with Si. 
2	I don't really understand what your trying to ask here. The last two questions seem completely unrelated to the first few.

54	The truth hurts	
10	Sometimes I think about how much money I’d have if I charged my ISTP, INTJ, and INTP friends by the hour :)\nWe empathetic gals kinda like it though, sometimes. 
3	I’m usually the therapist to my friends 
3	I am an ENFJ and my boyfriend is an ISTP. Problem is that he doesn’t share his emotions with me. Like I think he just doesn’t like emotions and stuff so he just ignores it. I’ve tried to get him to open up about his past, but I’ve only been able to crack him once or twice. Lol he does not utilize the therapist he has in front of him. 
2	I'd say therapists are the ones replacing empathetic people.
2	I don't understand where the idea that ISTPs lack empathy came from. ISTPs are very capable of empathy, though we might not know how to act on those feelings. As Fe users, we're more attuned to the feelings of others than an Fi user.\n\nI'm guessing that a lot of people relating to these posts are actually ISTJs.\n\n-empathetic female ISTP. 
13	“All we do is fuck and snowboard bitches!”	I showed my intoxicated husband (who is an ISTP) the chart linked below. I shared with him how surprised I was that ISTPs are not as represented on reddit as I thought they would be and he replied with the title you see above. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/8hgwkk/chart_of_personality_types_subscribed_to_reddit/
20	I wonder if they could have made those pie chart labels any harder to read, given time and effort. 
13	Istps are actually one of the more active sensors on r/mbti. This sub is small but there are a consistent few istps posting/commenting/contributing their ideas. Same can't be said for, say, estj. 
9	Fuckin nerds!
5	Sounds good to me. 
2	I read this as "All we do is fuck snowboard bitches", as in girls who snowboard.\n\nA bit strange, I thought.\nBut I wouldn't mind.
1	how do you snowboard a bitch?

3	Relevance? I mean you’re literally pasting this to every mbti subreddit

5	Differences between ISTP and ESTP? (ENFJ here)	Besides the differing I/E tendencies, are there any other ways to tell the two apart?\n\nI know someone whom I typed as ISTP. I sent him the type explanation and he related well with it. However, he is rather outgoing and talkative. Can you ISTPs being outgoing? Excuse my ignorance! I don't believe he matches with the 'adrenaline-junkie' persona of the ESTP however. He seems fairly responsible. \n\nI'd love to hear any of your input
28	I am an ISTP that is outgoing and an adrenaline junkie.  The I/E in your type name has nothing to do with actually being introverted or extroverted, it just means that your dominant function is internally or externally focused.  It also happens to commonly line up with whether or not you're extroverted or introverted, but that is not a good rule to follow.  Do some reading on the cognitive functions to better type your friend.  
13	Wait, 'adrenaline-junkie' and 'responsible' are mutually exclusive??  I, for one like the occasional physical thrill that gets the heat pounding, and yet I'm a law abiding, bill paying, home owning, job holding, committed husband and dad.
3	I would think if he's outgoing with a small group / single person vs outgoing with a large group, that's the only difference between the E and I. I'm super outgoing but I prefer one or two other people, not a group (I'm an I).\n\nAdrenaline junkie and responsible can go together because we live more in tune with our environment and have a smaller "margin of error". So we push the line, but we know where the line is and are responsible to not go over it.

They go into more detail than MBTI making it easier to tell them apart.   \n[ESTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42478) | [ESTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/6796-Two-subtypes-of-SLEs-ESTps-which-one-are-you?p=129978&viewfull=1#post129978)   \n[ISTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ISTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42483) | [ISTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4440-Discussion-of-LSI-ISTj-Subtypes?p=142621&viewfull=1#post142621)    \nESTPs ime come off as more gruff and short-spoken. It's almost like the ESTPs are giving everyone short commands or making observations of the world around them. They don't like to explain or expand on their statements considering them self-evident. You have to prod them for an explanation which they might provide with reluctance but even then it will seem brief. They like deconstructing other people's thoughts and analyzing their proposals rather than explaining themselves.   \nISTPs are much more detailed and thorough in how they think and what they say. They will provide thorough argumentation when trying to make some point even if they weren't prompted. Each point logically flows from the next and you can easily trace their reasoning. They distrust incomplete information and want to examine and know everything thoroughly. Their Se is auxiliary and more situational, and as introverts they need time to themselves to introvert and cool down in their Ti-Ni. In general they come off colder than ESTPs, however, their duals the ENFJs are warmer than INFJs so it all balances out.   \nISTPs of sensory subtype (Se-ISTP) will sometimes mistype as ESTPs. ESTPs mistype much more frequently than do ISTPs in my observations, likely due to extroversion and not enough introspection, and one of the more common mistypes is an ESTP assuming that they are an ISTP.
3	Introvert means you recharge by being alone or taking part in solitary activities (reading, gardening, hiking) whereas extraverts recharge by going to a party or participate in a social event.  An introvert can be outgoing, but it will empty their "gas tank" and some quiet time will be needed to recharge.  
1	Am a very outgoing ISTP here. Its not uncommon for ISTP to not look like introverts at all. THe difference between i and e is where youre getting your energy-- by recharging by yourself or with people?\nISTP are doing it by themselves, prefer doing their activities alone and being by themselves while learning. \nESTP? Are largely getting a lot of energy from others, or taking in different energies from people that can build them rather than just drain them.

21	How’s everyone doing? Anyone want to share what’s going on in their life right now?	I’ll start. Currently 22. Not really happy about my life overall but currently happy with my day to day life. I have boxing training (5 times a week) and 5-5 basketball (3 times a week), and the NBA Playoffs are on so I’m enjoying that. \n\nI’ve left 2 jobs in the span of 2 weeks. One after 8 months and another after 3 days (was kind of a scam) and I couldn’t be happier. I start my next job on Monday with better pay and hours than the others. \n\nThinking about going back to school or the military next year. 
17	My istp has declared war on the centipedes in the house.  The other day I found him balancing himself with one foot on a stair railing and another on a window sill.  He had a broom in his hands and managed to one shot a centipede with the end of the handle.  I was both amused and impressed.\n\nHe already had a bunch of sticky pads down, and sprayed the house with raid. A few days ago he comes home with a box of borax and now there's white powder all around the vents of the house, and yet he manages to find and kill more centipedes.  \n\nLast night he said to me we should waterproof the basement as our next house project.  I asked him if he's saying this because of his personal vendetta against the centipedes and he replied yes.  I chuckled and said ok (I want a dry basement for better storage).  For now the next things on his list are bleach down the drains and a dehumidifier.  He even mentioned to me how he's been reading up on their lifecycle.  \n\n"Did you know they can live up to 3 years???" \n\n"Just killed one this morning.  It was a little guy, means they're multiplying.  It is that time of year for them to be laying eggs though so it's the perfect time to cull their numbers."\n\n"I shouldn't feel like I'm in the starship troopers movie every morning."
7	When I was your age I joined the military and it was alright.\n\nGood experience to have had, some exciting moments and all that. \n\nLife right now is kinda stable and boring. Trying not to blow my situation up for something to do like I’ve usually done when it comes to this. \n\nNeed a new hobby. 
7	I'm sitting in reception at my therapist's office.  \n\nI got a promotion to a management position and then had a bunch of stressful things happen outside of work and now I'm basically agoraphobic.\n\nHoping I can get to the bottom of it because anxiety attacks suck and having to leave a family dinner because you're nauseous is embarrassing.
5	VRChat is helping me immensely with the exposure therapy I needed to interact with people more easily and comfortably.
5	Well, my life is shit right now. I'm 23 and I'm in Argentina studying medicine (I'm chilean), a career that I only choosed because, at the time I left school, it was the less bad choice of all the careers that I look to study. I didn't get the chance to go to a Chilean collage because it's pretty hard to enter. And it's expensive as fuck. So Argentina was the closest option. \n\nNow I know what I really want to be in the future, want to study vet, but I can't make the choice to do so easily because my parent won't accept it. And I hate to admit it but I care maybe too much that people I care about validate me. So yeah I'm pretty unhappy with my life.\n\nPlus, because I'm lazy as fuck and never found the motivation to study, I'm not in medicine right now (you have to pass a year before enter a career in a leveling shit that doesn't have to do anything with what you want to study, and I didn' pass it). So I lied to my parents because I don't want them to be mad as fuck with me. Remember I'm 23 and this is not my first year of collage, so I get why they would be mad.\n\nI'm in a relationship too, but she lives and study in Chile. And I'm super in love with her, like I never loved anything in my life, and she seems in love with me as well. It's pretty hard to be away from her. And of course it's hard to mantain a healthy relationship too. Also, I'm lying to her the same way I lie my parents about collage. My relationship would probable be over if she founds out that I'm lying about it and I don't want that. \n\nI spend most of my time sleeping,  smoking weed and watching anime or series. I think I have depression. I can't sleep when I go to bed and when I get to fall sleep, I wake up after 10 hours sleeping. I don't feel like buying food, of cook, or shower, or anything for that matter. I feel lonely too. I don't know what to do with my life or how to fix it but I'm tired of living like this.\n\nSorry for the wall of text xd, wasn't my intention but ended up like that. I don't even know why I felt like writing this but fuck it, maybe I wanna read what other ISTP's have to say about this.\n\nEdit: Sorry if I made mistakes in my writing, english isn't my main language
6	23 Aussie. Still single cause I havent clued in on how to meet girls yet.. lol. I feel like this isn't changing any time soon.\n\nGot a good paying job with one of the largest corporations in the country.\n\nSeem to be swapping hobbies every month. This month it's electric guitars. Forecast suggests it's mountain biking next month.\n\nMy dog is awesome.\n\nLife is meh atm.
4	WTF are you me? I'm 23 years old.\n\nI quit a job after 4 days because it seemed like a scam.\n\nI've started going to the gym again, and I'm also enjoying watching the NBA playoffs.\n\nI've applied to join the military and I'm going to meet a representative in a week.
4	33, stable job in IT, gf for 9 years, dog. I'm buying our first house, so looking forward to it because of new things to do there.\n\nMy life is quite comfortable and boring, lots of daily routine as I can't find a hobby which would satisfy me. It seems I have no interest about everything. When I start something new, it gets boring quiet fast, I lost focus and don't even care about that.\n\nIf my GF wasn't be an ESTJ, my life would be boring stereotype show. 
3	I'm 24. Attending college, jogging, spending time inside my room and my head, avoiding people, not worrying much about making money.\nI want to improve in many areas and I find that solitude, online research and introspection are the most effective ways. I'm probably going nuts.

1	Just another typical night stressing as a 21 yr old college student. \n\nCurrently applying for jobs and scholarships. Studying, researching, volunteering, losing my life to school. Maybe looking for a relationship... I think I finally ended my WTF years, so everything seems bright right now, lol. (Although my experiments haven't been going well.........but I guess thats what research is all about). \n\nOh right, and college has effectively destroyed my sleep schedule! :)  I nap from 6-9PM, stay up til 1 or 2am, and then go back to sleep tili 6am. If I tried sleeping continuously, I'd probably wake up in 5 hours instead of the normal 7-8 hrs.
1	I'm at a crossroads where I can potentially fuck my life up
1	[deleted]
1	I'm 30 . . . tomorrow. Which is causing a mild melt down. I feel like I'm 23 still.\n\nI'm currently resting in between sets and about to do some lat pulldowns. I finished chemotherapy in January and it took until April for me to return to the gym because of fatigue and general recovery. I've lost so much strength and muscle mass.\n\nOn the upside, I recently bought a 3 bedroom house that is larger than typical for my area. I'm also starting my pupillage (on the job for barristers in England; barristers are a specific type of trial lawyer) in October. Just crossing the days off until then.
1	In a rhythm I'd like to break. Early work hours (5am) till just past noon and nothing but leisure to fill the rest but I don't really enjoy the time since the things I can do and want to do don't align. ~~Think~~ Know I need to break out of it but my current schedule insures stability, in money and intensity, at the lack of progression and increased opportunities. I really need more mental stimulation but am afraid to really commit to more responsibility because I will likely have to sacrifice some of my stability or possibly over extend myself. I have a plethora of things going for me but am such a cynic and skeptical of potential opportunities due to past experience that I have a hard time not defeating my own thoughts about how to better myself.
1	I just found a keltec sub2000 for 360 fucking dollars. A FUCKING KELTEC SUB2000. \n\n\nI’ve been looking for one for about three months now waiting for the perfect model/color to be at the perfect price. Keltec is always hard to find because they’re a 0 debt company. They only build what they can afford to build without going into debt. It’s a great business model, but makes it very hard for the consumer to get their hands on one at decent price. They usually are marked up 150-200$ over MSRP not marked down 40$ under! \n\n\nI woke up to the biggest check my job has ever given me so I said today is my fucking day I bought myself that gun. So today I’m on top of the fucking world! I feel like such an adult patiently waiting for the right gun to cross my path. Two years ago I’d have overpaid for an under-featured gun just to avoid waiting any longer. I was initially looking for a 9mm version, but the 40 S&W runs 80-100$ cheaper. So I did settle there. But I’m still super stoked!
1	23, life is going pretty well but not without speed bumps. \n\nLive in an apartment with two roommates, now one because one of them burned himself in a grease fire he accidentally started. My landlords are still trying to blame us for the dishwasher's water leak from last August even though they are the ones that installed it improperly, so I'm currently dealing with insurance adjusters (the leak caused 7k in damage to the unit below us and I'm pretty sure the landlords don't have insurance so they've been lying and pressuring us to admit fault). \n\nGot a promotion last month from the 11 month training position I had to a 2 year apprenticeship. I'm also dating someone I met at work (never dated before). The days are passing by quicker. I only trip once every few months now. Going to start saving money specifically for traveling. It's definitely an interesting time for me.
1	I'm 20. I'm pretty moody and lazy atm. I have finals in a month, finals that I failed last year. I just have to work much much more.\n\nI'm getting better and better socially so that's one good point.
1	Glad to see you're doing well for yourself! Keeping busy with things that are good for you is so important. \n\nI'm doing well, too! I've started reading more books, and I don't use social media anymore. I feel happier every day :) There's so much beauty around us, and so much to be thankful for. 
1	I'm 23. Have been working for a company I co-founded with a couple buddies for a year now. I would say life has been the hardest it ever has been over that time feeling some pretty crazy mood swings. I've been in a good place for a little while now and feel like I'm getting a better grip on how to really carry myself, not only in a professional setting, but in my everyday life. Since I've started to really take things seriously with helping run a company, it's helped me kind of make strides in other parts of my life like building better habits and breaking some not so good ones. 
1	18 and beginning to feel the WTF years. Ti-Ni loops fucking suck.
1	No.
4	ISTP partner ignores me sometimes?	I've had a weird issue with my istp partner of 5 years ignoring me in certain social situations and it's getting me really down. Our relationship is great in pretty much every other aspect except for this. I don't know why this happens and I know he's not intentionally trying to hurt me, but when we go out with a group of people (like to a club, bar, party, etc.) he just ignores me and tries to people please everyone in the group. This has been happening ever since we've been exclusively dating and I've brought it up numerous times. \nHis answer is always that he doesn't know why he does this and that he's bad at multitasking. I'm okay with that answer because I get that he doesn't process social situations the same way that I do. However, he did this to me at my own birthday party recently and I feel really hurt about it. This year was special to me because I’ve struggled with depression and this was the first year I felt up to throwing something for myself. He was also aware of this. I said I didn't want X to happen at my party multiple times before the party and day of, but a couple of his mates suggested that X happen and next thing I know he's off making that happen without even asking me if it's okay. \n\nOther examples of the behavior: 1) When we were dancing together in the corner of a room at a party he abruptly walks away without saying anything about where he was going and started talking to other people. 2) When we used to go out dancing with a big group of people he wouldn’t dance with me, even when everyone else was coupled up. 3) He ditched me at one of my friend’s going away parties.\n\nCan I get an istp’s input on what’s going on? I’ve been putting up with this but my bday party was the last straw. He’s not technically harming me but I feel like when we’re in a group of people he turns into someone else. It’s like he’s trying to be the life of the party or something and wants to ensure that everyone (but me) is having a great time. I’ve asked him to spend more time out with mates. Everyone knows we’re together so I hope he’s not embarrassed to be seen with me. It doesn’t happen all the time but enough to make me feel like I don’t want to be around him in these situations anymore. \n\nPerhaps this is a better thread for /r/advice but I really just wanted input from an istp on what might be going on.\n\n\ntl;dr: My relationship with istp partner of 5 years is overall great, except when he ignores (and sometimes abandons) me at parties and other group events. 
10	I'm just amazed that you get him to go into social situations like partying and dancing willingly.
5	I don't think walking away from your partner in the middle of a dance without saying anything is OK. I don't know if OP demands too much or not because this story is told from his side and it can be biased. But this dancing issue doesn't sound right to me. ISTP or not you don't get to be rude to your partner. A quick 'I'm going over there' doesn't hurt anyone.\n\nOP, I sent you a PM. 
5	Well, I don't know about other ISTPs, but I tend to act like this as well...\n\nIt's actually kinda logical (to me): since I live with my girlfriend, I already have plenty of time with her. So when I meet my friends (which doesn't happen often since I don't really like hanging out with people), I want to pass this time with them rather than with her.\n\nShe complained once at the beginning of our relationship, that she was afraid I was ashamed of being with her, but that really is not the case.\n\nI wonder whether there is not my Fe acting as well in this: since I want other people to be happy, I do my best to be with them. I kinda expect that my girlfriend would act the same (probably not a good thing).\n\nI don't know about your partner, but that might be a starting point to understand why he acts like this?
15	This is why I avoid getting into a relationship lol 
2	He might get bored sometimes and think you get it or feels saying such would be more upsetting than just wandering to the more interesting part. Or you are in a relationship so he's thinking more about the fact that you're one in the group instead of a primary person to pay attention to since you have a deeper relationship outside the group that doesn't require as much attention. I know I can leave people hanging when I lose interest or am there for a certain reason. It can mean he's trying but honestly if I'm bored I'm so tapped out that I would leave.\n\nThese are my own thoughts though, might not be the case
2	Not that you say much about him but he doesn't really feel like an ISTP to me, just simply seeking out groups of people is way out of line.\n\nI've probably done similar things a few times, and it was usually in a situation where there was something really engaging, though I tried to include my girlfriend when possible. This would be hard to overcome. People being needy really bothers me. I feel like the answer is sitting down and talking about it. Something along the lines of "I'm okay if when we're out with others if you want to spend time with them, but let me know first so I'm not surprised and I can do my own thing." That's somewhat self reliant on being able to handle yourself in those situations and realize okay I'm going to have to enjoy myself. I'd also have a line though, where there is an understanding that I'm priority one in situations (your birthday) but it has to be something that doesn't happen frequently. \n\nI had a girlfriend do similar things to me once, and it was a girl I had cared about for a long long time. It lasted very very few times before at one party I simply walked out and left. I don't think I even got a phone call till the next day. By the time I walked out the door I was already done though. \n\nEdit: Also ignore the guy who said do it back. That's immature and will only cause resentment and more problems. 
0	I'm not an ISTP, but regardless of type, he's putting others above you consistently. I really feel for you. I've been there before, and it's an absolutely miserable and disheartening feeling. \n\nYou said you've brought it up numerous times, so clearly that's not working. The way I see it, that leaves you with two choices: 1) do something to make him stop taking you for granted and disrespecting you, or 2) dump him.\n\nI'm guessing since you posted here seeking advice, you don't want to dump him, so what I'm going to recommend is something that some people will find manipulative, but honestly, it won't hurt anyone, and it's kind of your last shot at this since he won't listen to your words. I recommend you read a book called "Why Men Love Bitches." (Not a bitch in the sense that you walk all over people, but a bitch in the sense that you don't let people walk all over you. It's about learning to value yourself.) \n\nSo, how do you put some of the principles of the book into effect? The author says that men don't respond to words, they respond to action and no contact. Start focusing on your own interests and stop prioritizing him. Now that you'll be busier with your own stuff, you'll naturally become less available. And next time you're at a party, don't be by his side. Genuinely have fun, socialize with everyone, disperse your attention outward and really put yourself in the mix. Over time, as he notices you becoming more emotionally independent and less hung up on what he is or isn't doing, he'll start to worry you're losing interest, and he'll up his game if he still cares about you. \n\nI think people who ignore their partners in public are like those kids that ignore their "less cool" friend to seem cooler to the "cool" kids. It's immature and psychologically weak. Someone who can't stand by his own convictions. Someone who is so blindly eager for validation he'll hurt those he loves to suck up to those he barely knows. \n\nDon't prioritize people who don't prioritize you. You deserve someone who puts forth the effort that you do. You deserve someone who cares how you feel.
-1	The problem here is you. As a fellow female, I think you need to work on yourself. I will inherently try to get away from large groups of people. The fact he is going to any of these events tells a lot how much he cares about you. \n\nYou've been together for 5 years. You either need medical intervention for your mental health or get over yourself. You sound 15 IMO. 
15	Impressing an ISTP male	Looking for advise on how to impress an ISTP. He is the most interesting man I know, in that he and I share interests and hobbies.
27	Confident. Self sufficient. Creative. Be those things and you're well on your way.
20	The Naked Man
17	(male ISTP) I'm quite hard to impress or excite. I just like doing my own thing. Try and participate in something he's doing and enjoy yourself. Like others have said be confident and self-reliant, I'm not really into someone depending on me or babying someone through something. I'm selfish, lol.\n\nThat said, everyone is different. Just try and have fun with him. That's all I really care about, having fun.
14	Ask him his opinion on topics that are below surface level and actually listen to what he has to say and contribute to the conversation.  \n\nIt's amazing how often no one asks me anything that has depth.  It's really refreshing to talk to someone that actually cares about my thoughts on something more complex.  \n\nalso, if you can show that you put actual effort into thinking about a topic it makes you a lot more interesting.  I like to learn about things that I don't fully understand.  it's kind of annoying when a person brings up a topic i want to hear more about only to find out that the person who brought it up knows nothing about it.  if that makes any sense.  \n\nDon't be helpless.  it gets annoying really fast if I have to solve your problems that can be easily googled.  It will seem like a waste of my time.  Something I never seem to have enough of.  
14	Boobies. We like boobies.
6	Idk. give a shit about the ISTP. Know the right timing to poke him when he’s ghosting you for whatever the fuck reason we do.\n\nEdit: incompetence is a pet peeve. Don’t try to impress when you have nothing to prove.
9	Being self\-reliant, on time, having situational awareness, remembering just one of the two or three important dates in their life.
23	Talk about the concepts, ideas that underpin the things you love.  If it's music, don't *just* talk about the last concert you went to, tell about how their choice of rhyme structure leads to more interesting ways to form lyrical pivots, or how you love how the bassist studied at Juilliard and uses 12 different pedals and you always wanted to play bass because it's the thing that drives the dance floor and did you know that certain low-frequency bass tones can elicit a sense of danger or panic in crowds and research shows that it might be evolutionary and it's the same pitch as the roar of a tiger?\n\nIf travel is your thing, talk about the place you want to go most of all, musing about the character, scenery, cultures, etc, the one place where women would go to partake in that ritual, or the place where the birds will come up and land right in your hand, or how the locals have a word for coffee that will immediately mark you as a tourist if you say it.\n\nPsychology, philosophy, or the real honest details of a skilled trade that only a real practitioner would understand- we're going to notice if you bring your particular angle into an interesting insight into the topic at hand.\n\nI don't care if laser-pointer cat-toys are your thing, you can still interest him with a demonstration of the differences between coherent and incoherent light via a stabilized laser pointer and a wall with a sheet of paper to catch the reflected photons in their perfectly unchanging streams.  It's actually quite a fascinating thing to see.  Ever tried?  What you do is tape down or lock a laser pointer in the ON position and point it at a wall in a darkened room, then you stand with your back facing the dot and hold up a piece of paper.  You'll see a dot pattern on the paper, reflected from the imperfections in the wall.  What's fascinating about it is that the pattern remains perfectly unchanging as you move the paper around through this dot reflection- no source of natural light anywhere in the universe will do this, only a laser will.  This is because the nature of coherent light means that *every single photon* leaves the element with exactly the same direction and phase, so every single photon reflects *exactly the same direction* in every moment. No randomness. It's like looking into a representation of one of the hidden laws of the universe.\nLasers aren't even my line of work, but that shit is cool as hell.  If you like science and can get all jazzed up about physics.  That's my thing.\n\nI may not speak for all, but as an ISTP like to see depth and passion and interesting things and to have my mind broadened with new ideas, perspectives and insights.  Surface-level conversations rarely lead to any kind of growth or learning, though they may be entertaining.  We can hang around on the surface in social situations, but I get bored if the depth and interest isn't there in a partner.  I want to see and understand how and why things work and people operate.  Going deep when necessary is not only welcomed, it is required.\n\nMy stance is that there's so many interesting things in the world and in people, that if you don't know or can't find them to talk about, you probably aren't actually *interested* or passionate about those topics.  Maybe a lot of people aren't interested in life in general.    \n\nShow me what you yourself *have found*.  \n\nEDIT: farts are funny too. 
16	I usually find farts pretty funny.\n\nEdit: 1) do impressive things. 2) don't try to impress us.
4	Be different?
2	Be as ENFP, show him that you are very confident in social circle and talkative, and after that just return to him and show that you can trade all that influence with time spent with him. He will appreciate it. And show that you are loyal to him. You can play a little with it, but just a little, or he will be pissed off. \n\nBe like a mediator between him and society. \n\nAlso as ISTP's are Sensors anything sexual can be impressive and desirable. \n\nAnd yeah talk to him about dark and practical things like: what is the best way to kill a person knife or gun.  Well or something like that. ISTPs like weapons and solving problems. I guess it is the best routine you can use to impress ISTPs :D 
20	Escape Rooms	Quick to the point:\n\nEscape rooms are fantastic and you should all try doing one. \nThe puzzles really let's our logical and pattern seeing side work on high intensity.\nStimulating and really fun.\n\nJust make sure to bring your 2 - 4 actual friends since some teamwork is usually required.
22	Escape rooms are my favorite place for a date. \n\nIf you win, you can brag and show off a bit while having a nice sense of accomplishment. If you lose, you get an excuse for a second date. Win-win.
5	I know this is a few days late but I haven't been on in a while so sorry in advance...\n\nMy wife introduced me to escape rooms about a year and a half ago and I'm straight up addicted to them. So much so that i recently started working at a local franchise. After doing 10 rooms in two locations, I got to know the owner pretty well. He and I are opening a third location and I'm designing a couple of rooms and buliding all the props myself. I'm making half of what I was in my corporate job and I couldn't care less. Getting to work with my hands, seeing it all come together and having that freedom... So worth it.\n\nTLDR: Escape rooms are amazing and I'm opening one.
4	I didn't know these existed and I've just found out there's one in my town! :v and I have friends, cool. Thanks.
1	I've only been to one escape room and it was really fun. It's a great bonding experience especially when me and my friends usually just play video games.\n\nI started feeling worthless/frustrated halfway through because I felt like I wasn't contributing enough since I was the only first-timer in my group of friends. It was hard to focus because there were so many thought processes going on at once, we had a group of 10.\n\nWe completed it with less than a minute left on the clock, but personally, I didn't feel accomplished.\n\nDefinitely would try it again with a smaller group though.
1	Strange I never thought these would be fun because it is not real and there are no consequences. 
1	haha i actually initially hated them because i wanted to solve the problems all by myself. once i figured out how important teamwork was, I asked the "leader" to just assign me to problems and I'd report back. funny note, when we escaped, my GF existed the room and screamed "it's better than sex", while crying from happiness....
2	Has skydiving turned me into an ESTP? Also thank you guys	I'm trying to figure out if I'm an ISTP or was I just an ESTP waiting to "blossom" but held back by childhood influences. I really like the in-the-moment experience of skydiving, and am hoping to get into racing/piloting in the future, and eventually cross proximity wingsuiting off my bucket list.\n\nI used to really like video games and a bit of the solitude, but as I'm approaching my last couple years at college (24), I don't enjoy them nearly as much anymore. Having top-end World of Warcraft raiding go to shit started the turning point, since that was sort of my life for many years. I really enjoyed the awareness + in-the-moment requirements, as well as the individual/group strategizing & coordination.\n\nAlso I guess I just wanted to vent somewhere that I'm so fucking happy to see the beginning of the end of my WTF years after years of some degree of depression. Starting this hobby has already helped me be more self-confident & outgoing, make new friends (who knew hobbies could attract similar personalities?), inadvertently lose my virginity (👉😎👉), and accept & appreciate the randomness of life.\n\nI want to thank all you similar-minded ISTPs for your many stories and insights I've read that have helped me along my journey in different ways. ~~Regardless if I'm an evolved ISTP or an ESTP now~~, I'll always consider you as bros.\n\n**\#STP4L**\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the input guys, I guess it really wasn't that complicated haha. Probably an introvert. Still wondering if my IST career choice would suit me best but I'm just enjoying the ride for now
11	Thanks for considering us your bros, bro! \n\nIf it helps, being an introvert doesn't mean you spend all day inside and don't have friends. I'm very introverted but I still love dancing at the club. \n\nThe way I see the difference is "I spent all Weekend with my friends and now I want to take a nap and not talk to anyone for a day or two" =Introvert.  \nvs. "I spent all Weekend with my friends and now I want to continue talking to people and maybe take a nap" =extrovert\n\nThat's not to say seeing friends can invigorate an introvert and that extroverts cant get tired. Its just the level of people interaction tolerance.\n\nAlso not liking video games as much is more of a sign of aging in general. I used to play a lot of games too but being 25 I feel like I just have other stuff I'd rather be doing although I do play from time to time. (I never got into multiplayer games though I'm more of a Zelda girl myself).\n\nAnyway glad you found a hobby you really enjoy and good luck with college.
5	How do you recharge? Can you recharge around lots of people? Or do you need some alone time?\n\nThis sub seems to skew very heavily introverted. ISTP doesn't mean antisocial or has no friends. We're aux Se users, which means we like to do exciting stuff, have new experiences, etc. \n\nI've always had active hobbies, I like doing "risky" things, extreme sports, concerts, bars, drugs on occasion, meeting new people. But I'm still an introvert, because at some point I need alone time to recharge.\n
5	Being an introvert doesn't necessarily mean being a totally secluded, antisocial hermit.  It just means you need some alone time to recharge once in a while.  \n \nThey say a weekend at the DZ is 90% social and 10% skydiving.  Embrace it.  Talk to the old-timers and learn all you can.  Be involved in the weather hold shenanigans.  Hang out at the bonfire after hours.  But when you feel you need some alone time, allow yourself that.  Have fun in the sport.  It did a lot to make me who I am today.  Blue skies!
2	The biggest difference between ISTP and ESTP is that one is Ti dominant and the other is Se dominant. Your dominant function is the thing you are always using and it defines a big part of your activities. The other functions are said to serve your dominant function, so there is quite a big difference between a Ti user and an Se user. It's more common for an ISTP to think they are an INTP because they share the same dominant function.
3	One week no reply: am i written off?	So I've known someone for about two or three weeks, and I'm pretty sure they have many qualities of the ISTP Myers-Briggs personality type if I had to choose one.\n\nIf you were to suggest plans for someone in the future, but don't follow through or make the plans when the time comes, does that mean that you would have silently written them off or are just waiting for them to make them?\n\nI don't want to push it because an angry ISTP doesn't sound good. I know that you guys like to have lots of space, but I don't know if I'm written off or if they're just getting some extra space.
15	Let me get this straight. Someone suggests we do something at some point in the future. I say it sounds good. As the time approaches I don’t get back in touch.\n\nIt means I forgot. You should bring it up again.\n\nEvents in the future are not written in stone. They are merely one possibility on a list of many possibilities that continually gets whittled down until the last possible moment that a decision needs to be made.\n\nI wasn’t lying when I said it sounded good. A dozen other things would have sounded good too. We just never spoke of those.
10	Just hit them up again man. Don't think about it too hard, they probably forgot.
9	Take the lead. If an istp agrees, they will follow.\n\n
3	Making plans is easy. Following through, not so much. It could be both because he really likes you and doesn't want to screw it up, or it is because he doesn't like you and forget all about it the second he said it. If it's the latter, he will avoid you. If it's the former, he will seek you out. Eventually. Maybe.\n\nIf he's important to you, make a move. Try to be honest about your intentions, but beware: you will get an honest answer.
3	He's probably just completely oblivious to your interest. 
1	Depends. If the person doesn't seem interested at the original conception. I would lose interest as the time passes.\n\nThe person could have lost interest over time then forgot.
24	Anyone else find it relatively easy to make friends, but hard to start caring about people? Read below	If I think someone is not good enough for me or there is one thing about them I don't like, I stop caring about them and take a different stance to them immediately. Even if I've known someone for quite a long time, my opinion of them can change in the blink of an eye through a small fact. Sometimes I even say mean stuff out of disregard for the others persons feelings simply because I have nothing else to say to them and I don't care very much about their opinion of me. This works in the other direction as well and someone I clearly disliked before, I can start to think of very highly because of a small action towards me or my close friends. The thing is, if I find someone that cares the slightest about me and shows me a hint of caring for my needs, I see them in the most positive way as this is one of the triggers for the change of opinion.**\***\n\nFor me, this makes it really hard to make new/good friends, and so I'm kinda stuck on how to do that. I don't think I've really met someone before that appreciates a good long silence or thinks similarly to me and so I feel like trying to talk to new people is useless/pointless since I know any relationship I make with them will probably come to an end soon. Don't get me wrong, I do like talking to people it's just that I don't feel like I connect with them at all since it's kinda hard to keep the conversation going.\n\nI don't like to pretend to care about something and I'm very upfront about things and that's usually the nail in the coffin for me.\n\nAnyone else? How did you 'solve' the problem?\n\nI'm a 17 yr old guy about to go into uni and this has pretty much always been a problem for me but I thought maybe now it's time to 'solve' this.\n\n\*EDIT: Anon suggested this has something to do with low self esteem
12	I'm 18 and I've lately developed a sort of swaggering, jokingly confident attitude. It makes it possible to say what I think while still managing to play it off as a joke. Although I think my Fe may be more developed because I'm quite sensitive to actually hurting peoples' feelings. Almost to the point to where I start feeling bad for making more friends and having people like me more because it feels like I'm just playing a game with them.
3	Easy to make friends, but impossible to care enough to maintain friendships. 
3	I think it’s due to not *really* actively listening to people (we hear a lot but I know I don’t pay super close attention most times...attention span for convo ebbs so I know miss a lot!)\n\nI think that’s just istp stuff. So when you pay attention....you learn something good or bad about someone you didn’t “see” before. Totally normal to have first impression judgements change. \n\nI also think you should really mark what you find positive and mark what you find negative. This will seriously help you determine what is important to you in others and help with keeping better friends and SO’s. \n\n\n\n
3	Yeah, I get you. I'm really well liked by almost everyone I meet, but I'm not close to more than 4 people. Those 4 guys accept that I don't talk if I don't have anything substantial to say. They also understand that I sometimes get excited about random thing others may not care about. Also, instead of admonishing me about my thrill seeking tendencies, they're always ready to back me up and make sure I don't do anything too stupid. I met all 4 of these guys in college. Although I've moved to another country, we still randomly text each other and our friendship hasn't eroded. I sure you'll make a few everlasting friendships with unexpected people while at university. Those friendships might form when you're both doing something incredibly stupid or bothersome, and as a result, form a tight knitted camaraderie because you find out that you could trust and rely on each other
3	You gotta be objective about it. What do you want friends for? Someone to go out with? Someone to vent to? Someone to share memes with? And what are you bringing to the table? What's in it for them? Are you doing your part? Relationships are like a plant, you gotta water them and nurture them. \n\nIf you're perfectly happy without having people in your life, that's fine, don't bother with any of that stuff. But if you desire more than solitude, well, you gotta put forth some effort for some reward.\n\nIt's all about opportunity cost. Yeah, responding to texts is annoying, but if you don't, you probably won't have much of a social life. So, for ultimate life satisfaction, you gotta find that balance.
8	ISTPs, please help this INTJ understand you.	Morning ISTP's, female INTJ here trying to break an attraction impasse I have with an ISTP.  For about six months now this chap has stared at me constantly.  Everytime I try and make conversation with him he is either so nervous he loses his words or the conversation is pleasant and he runs out of things to say.  As a classic INTJ, I suck at flirting but I am very confident so I have been trying to make him comfortable talking to me, showing I'm friendly and creating an opportunity for him to ask me out, but he seems to prefer to be around me without saying anything \- but yet still constantly stares at me.  Last weekend we went to the gym together and \- strongest sign yet \- told me I should just take my shirt off.\n\nHelp.  How do I move this forward?  I know most of this is my fault because I'm rubbish at flirting, but is there an ISTP hack that would help?
34	First thing to understand is that he is probably even more rubbish at flirting than you are.  ISTPs are really bad at flirting and really bad at even noticing that flirting is going on.  \n\nWe also aren't always scintillating conversationalists.  I'm not a talkative type, but under pressure, it is not that I don't want to speak, it is that I simply don't know what to say.  The words evaporate.  \n\nI'd say that you be fairly direct - tell him you like him, you'd like to get to know him and ask him out for a coffee or something.\n
19	> showing I'm friendly and creating an opportunity for him to ask me out\n\n\n\nWhy not ask HIM out instead? The hell.
14	You can lead an ISTP to beer but you can't make them drink.\n\nFind a nice coffee shop or a quiet bar or your place or whatever and ask him out. 
12	[deleted]
9	If he’s anything like me he’ll go for years without making a romantic move other than frequent hang-outs. I recommend making a move or tell him your feelings. \n\nEdit: a word. 
9	>As a classic INTJ, I suck at flirting\n\ntrying to flirt with an ISTP is like trying to flirt with a rock, it's 2018 bruh try asking him out instead of following gender standards 
6	Be direct and don’t use too many words. 
5	I’m a female ISTP married to an INTJ. We chatted for a few months after meeting before he decided to be straightforward and just tell me that he was interested in me  (which I already had figured but was definitely still holding back because I wanted to be completely sure before opening up more) but he asked me where my stance was and I definitely appreciated him being that direct because we both clearly knew how we felt about each other at that point and we were comfortable moving forward with the relationship from there
3	Invite him to an activity. Perhaps a hike or a picnic on the beach. Him engaging his Se will hopefully relax him and free up the flow of words.\n\n\nOr you know, go do shots. 
3	You could just go somewhere and take off your shirt for him ;)
2	Engage in an activity like boardgames... videogames... 
2	Just ask him out without making a big deal about it (so he won't feel pressured) e.g. "DUDE(or whatever you guys call each other), Let's watch Infinity War, that shit is LIT" - - keep things casual and take it one day at a time, the moment he'll notice that there's a little bit of commitment going on, he'll probably panic and overthink things
2	Update?
2	Ask him to help you fix something
1	He can listen to you for a long time. If you can keep the conversation going he will engage you more. Ask him and he will answere.
1	Lol, just get drunk and make out with him. If he's into you, he'll really enjoy the straight forward advance.
1	"Just take your shirt off"\n\nWtf is wrong with you that you can't see this for what it is.\n\nAt the very least he's in lust with you. Most probably more.\n\nTake the lead.
1	Just keep going gym with him and tell him to spot you whilst you're doing squats, hahahaha 🤣\n\nAsk him if he's free for a drink on the weekend. 
1	I'm laughing so hard at your first paragraph because you sound like you're trying to get a new cat to like you and you dk how to do it lol... \n\nBut yes to answer your question, I would agree with everyone else that it's very apparent that he likes you back but he is worse at flirting than you. So cut the chase and take the lead. Also, stares dont really mean anything, perhaps he just enjoys your company and the fact that you're beside him.
24	An ISTP and ESFP walk into a club	The ESFP relentlessly hits on girl after girl with no shame, gets rejected 8/9 times, is unfazed, and dances with any girl that is receptive. The ISTP gets way into the music, attracts female attention in the form of an invitation for some dirty dancing, entertains the idea for a couple minutes, the politely says goodbye because shes a shitty dancer and goes on raging by himself, as the ESFP continues to give him looks of bewilderment.\n\n\n\n\nTotally not drunkenly narrating my life as it happens.
44	/r/iamverybadass 
16	>istp\n\n> club\n\n\nGon’stop you right there 
7	Good times
5	This is my night life lmao. My ESFJ Friend goes around talking to every girl and get flaked all the time. While I’m enjoying the music and the booze.
4	Hmm. I never related to that.
2	This is exactly me and my best friend (ESFP). Wow.
4	Gets rejected 8/9 times. Successful once where as you are 0/0. \n\nTo each their own. 
1	Sounds like my nights out lol
149	.	
36	"Improve upon the silence, or shut up." - Me, just now.
18	“In order for me to like you, you have to be a better option than nothing.”\n\nRestated less poetically. 
5	Jesus Christ people it's just a preference, it's not a fucking competition.  
7	And that folks is why I’m single
3	This is very good.
1	This isn't really a ISTP thing. It's more of a introverted thing.
2	Long distance relationships?	ENF J/P 17 year old here, I met an ISTP girl 6 days ago and we have been talking and calling everyday since. On the first day we met, we spoke nonstop and it instantly clicked. We both admitted that we have never met anyone with so many similarities and clicked so well. All of her friends say she likes me and I have mutual feelings. We both even promised on going to France next summer for a weekend and she told me it was her dream. However, she is leaving to the UK in 1 month for upper school and will be there for 2 weeks whilst I'm stuck in China until I finish my upper school. I was wondering will long distance relationships work out?  I haven't asked her out yet, as I feel like she's also thinking the same as me if the long distance will work.
9	For me long distance has never worked. That's because I have no physical connection to them, or can communicate properly (body language, etc), and those things are important to me in a relationship. However thats not to say it won't work for you. I think the best thing to do is to talk to her about it.
6	I suck at long distance relationships. Terribly. Read from somewhere that istps are 'out of sight, out of mind' kinda people. That's very true for me. No matter how much I love you right now, no matter how long we've been together, if we're apart, I won't think much of you at all.\n\nNot that I'm proud of this :( I cheated on my ex-bfs, twice. The first one I dated for 3 years and I only went away for a couple of months. At the beginning of the third month, I already went out with another boy.\n\nSo to fix the problem, or to entirely prevent it from happening, I had a serious conversation with my current boyfriend not long after we started dating. I told him everything and let him know that it was very, very important for us not to have a long relationship at all. A few weeks is fine. A few months? I don't really trust myself.\n\n
4	IME istps don't go for ldrs. 
4	As an ISTP who has tried far too many times, this is not a thing that will be enjoyable. You should keep in touch, and live life, and if at a later time things are in a more manageable situation try it then. If you try this now and fuck it up (and it likely won't be you that fucks it up, just the circumstances of distance) it's unlikely you'll get another chance later. \n\nYou are very young, you have a long life to live, there will be more chances. Don't miss out on other opportunities for real relationships that will teach you more about yourself and what you want/need in a relationship that will improve your future relationships. 
3	18 year old ISTP girl here. Honestly, long distance relationships are hard because they require a lot of work. That's one reason why they rarely work out. You would have to talk to her daily and you might need to keep her from getting bored. I can't speak for all ISTPs, but I feel like we get bored easily. So yea, it's not ideal but...possible? \n\n\nBest of lucks to you.
3	> However, she is leaving to the UK in 1 month for upper school and will be there for 2 weeks whilst I'm stuck in China until I finish my upper school.\n\nDid I read this right? Are you only going to be apart for two weeks?
3	ISTP f. Have to agree with what everyone’s saying here. We need physical, in the moment experiences to feel connected with others. Our relationships thrive through new, exciting experiences with others. \n\nWhen the relationship is text/call/vid call only then I usually feel very limited and trapped.\n\nNot saying LD can’t work, but it would be very unhealthy for her growth as a person. It might be hard on you, too, because she’ll probably become distant emotionally due to lack of physical connection, and that usually leads to insecurity and lack of trust in the relationship.
2	It will work out if you keep initiating conversation. Don't expect her to start it. If she is always responding at a somewhat fast pace, that is good. Just don't go a month without talking.
2	Enjoy the next month and see what happens. 
2	17 year old F ISTP here, I just got out of a relationship where my bf lived about 45 mins away. We dated for 14 months, and towards the end it got really difficult because we were both really busy with school. He broke up with me, but afterwards I honestly wasn't that upset. I'd like to think I was in love with him (I def loved him platonically), but with how little time we got to spend together the last few months it was a relatively easy breakup. For me, it's out of sight out of mind. I've also had an actual LDR (1500 miles) for a few months but that didn't go far because it was really difficult not actually being him.
2	I am an ISTP girl myself, and I've been dating my ENFP long distance boyfriend for over a year. He lives four hours away, so it's much easier than cross countries. But, it's still long distance. It's a challenge, but it's definitely worth it.
2	ISTPs as (Phobic) 6s?	Are any of you a phobic 6 in enneagram? I am trying to type my dad who is without a doubt a phobic 6 and either an ISTP or ISFJ. \n\nIf you are a phobic 6 ISTP or know of one, how does that manifest? \n\nMy dad is a Ti user for sure, and the best explanation I have for him is that he is an ISFJ in a Si-Ti loop. He has a lot of preferences and behaviors that fit ISFJ and a lot that fit ISTP. He has difficulty dealing with people and lacks a strong Fe presence. I normally would attribute that to Fe inferior but he also suffers from anxiety and is uncomfortable around people. He prefers solitude and helping out in the background in subtle ways. He seems really Si too rather than Se but that could be the 6 influence. \n\nHe is really loyal and afraid that people won't need him or that they will leave. He shows affection by gentle teasing but can sometimes take it too far without realizing it. \n\nHe wants people to feel loved and happy and wants to take care of you the best he can. He likes domestic chores because he likes to contribute that way and take care of everyone's needs. He won't verbally express love in a direct way. But he will always be there for you and be the first person to offer you help. \n\nHe is afraid of trying new things and is extremely resistant to it. He thinks anything beyond what he is used to or deems necessary is silly or extravagent. Fantasy and things not in the real world will not hold his attention. \n\nHe is sensitive to embarassment, rejection, and wants to make sure people will approve of his choices or what he is doing. The only exception is if he needs alone time or is too overwhelmed in a situation - then he doesn't care if people call him reclusive or weird or whatever - he must have his alone time. He doesn't like big get togethers or events. He is the person playing with all the pets at parties when he is forced into going. Or he will do the dishes.\n\nHe prides himself on being down to earth, practical, thinking for himself, voice of reason, "MacGyver", frugal, dutiful, loyal, and cautious. \n\nHe has times where he idolizes stereotypical XSTPs and loves XSTP characters. He is too cautious to do anything actually reckless though IRL. He has a love/hate relationship with rules and laws. He likes most but will pick and choose what to follow to his liking. \n\nParents called him a "worry wart" throughout his life, yet he found himself in trouble a good amount of times. I guess he could get reckless in his younger years, the extent to which I have no idea. \n\nHe is really in tune with his own body and notices things that are wrong more easily than most. He is really good with small details. \n\nLoves trivia. When he is interested in a topic he likes to learn all about it and has a good memory for it. \n\nHe has had some (seemingly) Ni-Fe moments that have shocked me. He is good at seeing through BS and can read between the lines very well. He has made some startlingly accurate guesses as to what is going on with a person (i.e. me). He is the only person to see through me when I'm trying to hide something, much to my frustration! \n\nHe has the thing where if he gets stressed he will imagine a million possibilities that could go wrong. He will overplan for everything and freaks out. I always attributed this to inferior Ne, but at this point I do not know.\n\n\nAny insight or comments? ISTPs, does this sound like you or no? I wrote way too much so I wont be surprised if I get no feedback here. But if I do, thank you!!\n 
6	Okay so I'm a definite phobic 6w5 and very probably an ISTP and you basically just described me with the exception of this paragraph:\n"He is afraid of trying new things and is extremely resistant to it. He thinks anything beyond what he is used to or deems necessary is silly or extravagent. Fantasy and things not in the real world will not hold his attention."\nI'm the opposite for those two things.
8	Photography	What's you guys' take on photography?\n\nFor years, Ive kind of shrugged off photography because it seemed like the, "hip" thing to do, especially nowadays. Also, most of the photographers I know are the artsy type and they always seem to look for some deeper meaning behind their photos, so I figured it wasnt for me.\n\nWell, today I was looking into getting a new phone that happens to have a relatively good camera on it, which got me curious about my current phones camera. Turns out, its pretty good too. So tonight Ive just been messing around with it, playing with focus/etc. and this crap is pretty fun.\n\nIts amazing what kind of visuals you can create with a mix of lighting, objects and focus alone. I can't imagine what you could do with more advanced camera settings/environments. In a way, Im intrigued. I just want to go pick up a more advanced camera and play around with it, a bit. On the flip-side, I doubt Id get into this enough to drop any serious money on one. I could definitely see myself messing around with this stuff on occasion, though.\n\nHave you guys ever gotten into photography? What are your thoughts on it?\n\nImo, its pretty cool to be able to create the kind of pictures I would want to look at. 
7	I recently got pretty into photography, I really like it. \n\nI love exploring and finding incredible things, so photography gives me more of an excuse to do that. \n\nI post some pictures on my Instagram, but I'd say the pictures are more for myself than anyone else, but I have extremely high standards for myself and won't post anything unless I'm REALLY happy with the picture
4	I was actually the school photographer when I was in high school. I wanted to be really good at it so I payed for advanced courses in photograpy and editing outside of school. Spent about 6 months and a lot of money on those courses and it was great, I loved it. I bought a Nikon D7200 and about 4 lenses. Wide, macro, etc... but since I studied a lot and also had a food delivery job while in high school I could only really do in on the weekends. For me it was really relaxing, going to different places at different times to take pictures and then edit them for hours and posting them on sites such as 500px and Flickr. But I think it would't have been as fun if I didn't know what I was doing and if I didn't have the necessary tools. Unfortunately if you want to get into it so it's fun and useful you'll have to spend some money. But don't get ahead of yourself, I spent waaay too much money on it for a high school student. I'm in college now and have no time for it. So thousands of dollars of equipment are just sitting around, I only use all that equipment a couple of times a month. So that's something to think about too.
4	I'm very into photography, but I'll rarely ever photograph people. I'm much more of a landscape/cityscape/aviation/astro photographer, and I very much enjoy figuring out what settings/equipment I need to get what I desire from a photo. It's definitely one of my few creative outlets that I really enjoy. \n\nIf you're really interested in delving deeper into photography, you can definitely find cheap used (even new) DSLRs out there that will give you all the tools to figure out if it's for you. By cheap I mean around $400-700, which I know might be a lot still, but if you think it's something that might interest you, I highly recommend it.
3	I take a lot of pictures. Most I don't look at them again. \n\nSome I got printed on canvas.
3	I took a film class in college as an elective so I learned some of the more technical stuff like aperture and shutter speed and it definitely helped me out with my photos and getting into photography. Plus developing film in a dark room was really fun, but I dont believe people when they say film is better than digital. I bought a Nikon 1 which is more expensive and has exchangeable lens but not as fancy as a dslr. I also consider camera when buying phones. One advantage is that you can zoom in a lot closer on an actual camera than a phone. \n\nI understand how being the hip thing can be a turn off though.
3	I like taking pictures of neat stuff. I'm not always taking pictures of everything mildly interesting, just if I like something and feel like I know I can share it later or look at it again for myself.
2	Pull a Tarkovsky Svankmajer or Kubrick and bring your photography to life and you have my attention
2	I really like photography. but I notice the whole, "cute girl taking pictures of her feet" is just garbage. When I look at photos, less than 1% are what I'd call great. \n\nI used to do photography in high school, and I only took 1 picture that I thought was really good, even though I had won awards for a few of my pics. \n\nI also won awards for my ceramics work, and even cash for my machine tool work. Man, I really did peak in high school.
2	The thing I really like about the arts is there's no right or wrong, literally every part of it is subjective. Whether that's photography, painting, or how you play an instrument, the thing that makes it special is you.\n\nI know that sounds sappy but you're unlike anyone else. You will see and do things in you're unique way. Those minute differences are like gold to those discerning few.\n\nIn other words, there are loose base lines to every subject matter. It's how you choose to colour outside the lines that makes you're own work and the arts in general so special.\n\nI would encourage you to give it a shot with whatever gear you have. Have fun, and make sure to share your work, you're not allowed to horde all the gold for yourself.
2	Photography has been my major hobby for almost a decade.  I mainly focus on nature, especially birds and wildlife.  I'm already going out hiking so I bring the camera along to capture what I stumble across.  I have a bit of an obsession with identifying everything and having photos helps a lot.\n\nThe technical aspects of mastering my camera, lenses, flashes, etc keeps me interested.  There is always some new technique to learn or piece of gear to experiment with.  I shoot a little analog too, mostly for nostalgia, I started out on a film SLR and worked in a photo lab for years back in the day.\n\nAs someone else already said, I rarely take photos of people.  I know the basics of portraiture but I am not a people person and just not comfortable directing them.
2	I picked up photography as a hobby when I was studying architecture. Many students had a DSLR to photograph sites to use later for their posters and visual presentations. It also seemed interesting.\n\nSo I purchased a DSLR and very soon after, after much research purchased a 50mm 1.4 and external flash. I started photographing events at my college and soon was able to start making a bit of money from it as friends asked me to photograph their birthday events. However, I never saw myself pursuing event photography full-time. The social component was exhausting. It was fine if I had a few wines and was able to let loose, but being sober and having to emotionally invest in my clients was the worst! I most enjoyed editing the photos and seeing the likes come in on facebook once they were on my business page.\n\nMainly, I loved seeing photos online and wanting to recreate that effect, such as bokeh, depth of field, soft profile shots (much like the style wedding photographers use), faded sunlight in the background, long shutter highway/city night shots, long shutter at the beach, long shutter with some sparklers spelling your name in the air.\n\nI've been doing winter seasons working in the skiing industry. I love taking skiing and landscape photos, have created my own website and get much appreciation from new friends when they see my instagram.\n\nAs an ISTP, we like to do things with our hands. I also love the editing component and seeing a final product I have created. I also love how far I've come with learning how to both operate the camera, understand it's settings, and also edit through Photoshop and Lightroom. Wanting to achieve a certain look or style, or produce a particular photo has motivated me through all of this.\n\nI also use photography as a motivator to hike (which I'm not a fan of), and also get into ski touring. The photo opportunities are amazing!
1	I'm not exactly a pro photographer (understatement of the century, I think), but I got an entry level DSLR with some basic lenses (18-55 mm all purpose with IS, 70-300 mm basic telephoto, 10-18 mm wide angle, and a fixed 50 mm with 1/1.8 maximal aperture for low-light / portrait). I take the camera and the appropriate lenses to wherever and whenever I expect something shootworthy to happen. But the best camera is the one you have at the moment, and modern phones can shoot pretty good pictures.\n\n----\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a snob for claiming to be able to judge the merits of works in an art form that I only pursue as an occasional hobby, here are some of my general opinions. As a rule I dislike on-device post-processing beyond cropping and color correction, especially when it just reeks of feature envy towards specialized cameras (i.e. simulated large aperture, bokeh, etc...). There has never been a bad picture in the history of photography that became a good picture just because someone added some fake lens blur.\n\nComposition, exposure, and subject choice matter far more than the device you have. A picture shot with a disposable camera that gets these right will still be a good picture (assuming you can find a photo lab these days), and a picture that doesn't will still be bad even if shot by a $10k professional camera through $20k lens. Better equipment generally just gives you a wider range where you can get those three right.\n\nBut now comes the bad part. Sturgeon's law is still in effect in photography: probably 99% of photos ever taken (and 90% of photos ever taken that intentionally tried to be good) is crud. Luckily digital film is free, so experiment away!\n\n----\n\nNow as I said at the beginning, I usually take pictures to commemorate moments and share memories. I still try to observe the triad of photo goodness but sometimes I have to let composition and exposure slide. That said, a month ago I went out (and froze my ass off) to take a nice picture (or several, considering I tried to do a composited panorama) specifically for the sake of taking a nice picture and I think [it turned out only half-bad](https://i.imgur.com/ZGScRz5.jpg). So I [had it printed and hung it up.](https://i.imgur.com/zUcODXp.jpg)
8	For such a self-described analytical and objective type, you guys seem to have a hard time with personal criticism.	telling you guys off is a big nothingburger, you just disappear.  i think deep down you just want to be wuved.
45	I can handle criticism very well, and own it if I fucked up. That last one is so easy, and I cant believe I always tried to talk myself out of things before. \nBUT if someone starts criticising or have false memory of a situation because they just remember the feeling and not the fact, I will say something short and just go. \nAnd if someone starts yelling I just don't want to listen because that is not the way to solve anything. Especially if you know they don't want to solve it and just be mad, then it's no point of listening. It is ok, you can't be friends with everyone.
18	ISTPs are not self described as analytical.  They are objective by definition.  Thinking functions are objective judgement.  They are Introverted Thinking Doms, much like yourself.   \n   \nNot putting up with your bullshit doesn't make someone not objective.
13	no u
22	Is it wuved or wuvved? Wuved looks like it should be pronounced wooved
8	Well yeah
8	And with all that we are harder on ourselves 
5	I think we learn to deal with it but it’s still bothers us. BECAUSE it feels like we know ourselves so much having someone tell us something about ourselves is pretty annoying. Or at least that’s how I feel about it. I’ve learned to argue less about it. 
4	INTPs, in general, are no better at handling criticism.  Inferior Fe is Inferior Fe.  All types can be good or bad at handling criticism, depending on personal development.  Teenage Ti doms will be especially awful at it, and INTPs are right there next to us.  /shrug\n\nCan't tell if post is trying to troll, but to add, everyone 'just wants to be wuved.'  You claim to be genuinely unselfish, but you're likely just so conflict-averse that you let people trample on you.  Many of us are the same.
3	How could you say something like that?
6	You know what? You can just shove it.
3	Don't answer this post, people. \n\n"Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something." -Plato\n\n"A wise man my look ridiculous in the company of fools." -Thomas Fuller\n\nOP, being an INTP, I'm sure you know what I'm implying here. 
1	We definitely do get offended when people say we are wrong. You have to remember that our thinking attitude is **subjective** so we often make things fit into our internal logical worldviews rather than what is actually objectively logical. And the reason why we get offended is because we have inferior Fe. Deep down we want people to think we are smart - we care about what they think of us, whether they value us. So anyone who doesn't value us really throws us off and if we are emotionally engaged in our opinions then we tend to think the other person is stupid.  \nObviously this doesn't apply to all ISTPs. We all have different levels of [Development](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119940701537/mbti-development-istp).
1	Infp here, have had terrible experiences with istps being extremely rude lacking the most basic manners and using people when they want and then acting like they don’t exist. They are by far the most self absorbed personality type and they absolutely do not take any criticism well. I would describe them as a mix of apathetic and lacking empathy. Expect to be cut off before you finish your sente
1	Pwease wuv me Sparky!
19	Seasonal Depression	Anyone else suffer from some form of seasonal depression in the winter? \n\nI was thinking it may be type related since there isn't as much access to Se activities when its too cold/hot.\n\nFor example mine during the winter had gotten worse lately since I'm working a 9 to 5 now, so for the last few months when I left work it would be dark out. I thought I had actually depression since I was stressed and would cry constantly but as soon as daylight savings started it all went away.Being fine on the weekends when I had to work outside should have also been an indicator too but I'm short sighted when it comes to this stuff forgeting that my current situation isnt always how my life is.\n\nEDIT: A couple people mentioned that they are more depressed in the summer than in winter. I do think it is more based on activity levels than on weather and while I personally feel worse in the winter SAD can really occur in either. and I changed post to reflect that. Also what are some ways to boost Se use when stuck indoors? Videogames and exercise seem to be the obvious choices but can repetitive.
7	It's important to take vitamin D in wintertime, and that can really help with how you feel.  Ofc it's not the whole answer, but most people lack it in wintertime and it makes you feel really low. I don't really have winter depression, but more summer since I can't be out in the sun for long without getting fatigue (yay life). 
5	[deleted]
4	We don’t have winter here but I’m always pretty miserable during the summer (now). It’s just too fucking warm and I don’t want to go the beach because there’s too many people and I can literally just go to the beach anytime else since it’s pretty warm all year round.\n\nFuck summer. Feels like I stepped into a sauna everytime I step outside the house. I get acne because I sweat more. I’m stinky cause I sweat more. It’s 33deg Celsius right now which is super fucking ridiculous so I’m irate af.
2	Eh other way around for me being in southern California it feels like the same day everyday sunny and 75 degrees I love it when it rains and changes I like the sensation of making progress in seasons but I only lived through one full year with different seasons so i may not like it if I had to every year but the seasons change it up for me
1	That’s a very interesting observation. I have had season depression at times and not others. The activity level may be one of the issues to explore. Thanks. 
1	I never knew that was a thing. I've never suffered from it. I actually like leaving work when it's dark.
1	So much so that I made a whole ass album about seasonal affective disorder lmao
1	Absolutely. Wellbutrin is commonly prescribed for this condition; taken in tandem with vitamin D should help. 
1	I'm depressed in the summer, cause it's hot.  \nIn winter you can go skiing, so no need to be depressed :D
1	I do indeed suffer from seasonal (actually, it’s not seasonal but just irregular and inconstant) depression, so there might be something about that type-thing 😌 
1	Hell, yeah, but I grew up in SoCal, so I got spoiled early and for a lifetime with hating cold weather 
2	How do I become immersed in the experience of sensations in the extraverted world in the present?	I know mindfulness is an Se exercise, so I thought I'd ask here. When I try to do this, I still feel detached and in my head. I'm an INTP by the way\n\nThe reason I'm wanting to activate my Se (my 7th function) is so I can get myself to take action in the extraverted world, break from routine, stop "planning" for every possible stressor, every possible mistake, etc., and just "do". All the motivation in the world is no good if you can't access the tool to use it in the necessary way.
14	1. Do stuff until tired.\n2. Keep doing stuff until tired until you are dead.\n3. Profit.
4	Fear has kept me from trying new things typically. How do you get past fear? Try new new things anyway, consciously... Fears it turns out aren't so big on the other side. Start small if you can.
3	Drop some LSD. Seriously. Do your Research obviously to make sure you do it safely. But LSD has pushed my mind into more extroverted thinking. I actually find that alone time isn’t as enjoyable as it used to be. 
2	Walk a dog 
2	Ride a roller coaster,  go for a walk or run, visit a new city, eat a bunch of different foods.\n\nTry yoga instead of mindfulness if you really want to meditate, its more focused on your physical body and harder to zone out during. 
2	Get a puppy.
2	If you are thinking about it you are doing it wrong 
1	I'm wanting to know how to become immersed in the experience of sensations in the extraverted world in the present. When I try, I still feel detached. I'll taste ice cream and focus on how it tastes, but I won't be immersed in the experience, and I won't be in the present. I'll just be focusing on how it tastes.
1	I just went to a metal concert last night. Was totally immersed in the experience. Moshing in the 3rd row screaming my lungs out. Lost my voice yelling so much. Maybe you could try going to see a band you really like
1	Do it with a blanket? What are you talking about?
1	Is mindfulness an Se exercise?  \n    \nI'm not so sure the point of mindfulness is not to focus solely on the outside world.  I always thought it was to allow thoughts to come and go, observing them like an outsider and clinging to none of them.  \n   \nIt's like clearing out your head of the backlog.  \n   \nFocusing on the present is just the anchor that keeps you from getting swept away.  
1	INTP here as well.\n\nYou realize after a certain point that all the knowledge/wisdom in the world doesn't produce results, actions do. And a lot of times things rarley go as you plan, so it's best to focus on short term goals and adjust accordingly.\n\nI don't think this is something that you can aquire through activities or force it. But with enough life experience and setbacks,  you will naturally develop your Se (especially immediate life crisises that forces you to act, immediately). \n\nSo I guess my advice would be get our of your comfort zone and do things that scare you. This will force you into the present, and the moment.
35	You guys are amazing	I just left my ISTP husband alone in the garage for 3.5 hours. In that time he assembled a BBQ, a lawnmower, a pressure washer and a weed whacker. After dinner he says he's going to change the tires on both cars. My ENTP mind is blown. 
82	"I just left my istp husband alone..". You have made him very happy.
50	[deleted]
17	Many ISTPs enjoy hands-on work. I suppose your husband is no different. 
3	I talk about personal experience with WTF Years. Similar experiences?	
1	[deleted]
9	Does anyone else have a lack of fight or flight?	Not in a traditional sense. I noticed that although I do startle (not easily) my brain refuses to do either. I first assess the cause of said startle then decide what to do based on that. It is going to get me killed one day I swear.\n\n(Unless it's a wasp then I nope the fuck outta there)
17	Everyone have a fight/flight response, you might just have a higher "ohmygodwtf" treshold than others and just never crossed it. \n\n
12	I have never been in a situation serious enough to draw such a conclusion from.
6	Me (F) and my friend (F) was drinking out one night, and a stupid asshole followed us. When my friend ask him to walk on the other side of the rode because it was uncomfortable, he said no and stopped with us. We walked and he followed. She asked him again and he went in full attack mode and strangled her. I don't think I knew what was going on before I kicked him to the ground (got strong with adrenaline I guess). He continued (tried) to attack us again, but I got so mad and pushed him to the ground again. We got away ok, but my friend was in shock and was mad at herself for freezing, but that is just as normal I think. \nFight, flight or freeze. \nThat day I learned that I get mad and fight, and that's a good thing to know.
3	I definitely have a fight response, even if its stupid, like attacking a wasp with a tennis racket.\n
2	It's happened before where I've been doing something dangerous (i.e. driving during flash flood rains), where most people would stop, but the intensity of the situation makes me focus more. It's addicting; I should never use cocaine
2	Yup, I was driving down a dirt road with my friend once, we were looking for a fishing spot, and we came across a car that had crashed into a telephone pole. I'm ISTP and my friend is ENFJ. I stop my car about 100ft from the car as it was smoking a lot and there were power lines down. I could see the panic in my friend's eyes and he after a few minutes asked "What are we gonna do?". I decided to wait a few minutes and see if the car would explode. Keep in mind I'm calm during this whole situation, no panic in me. I was more curious than anything as exciting things like this never happen to me.  The smoke started to clear and I could see the guy in side moving. I pulled closer and called out to him if he needed me to call 911. He sayed he had already done so, and with that I turned the car around and left as there was no getting around the accident.
1	You need a friend to jump scare you with a helmet on
1	I'm the fastest person alive when a wasp or bee flys by me.
1	I do the opposite. Though I've also engaged in a lot of risky behavior which might explain it. 
1	You do realize that you’re describing fight or flight right? It just takes you longer to come to a conclusion. But it’s still fight or flight. \n\n\nRegardless, I’m more or less the same. If it’s a situation where there isn’t time for assessment, I generally gravitate to immediate fight. But if there’s time to assess, I always do so. 
1	I'm always in fight or flight mode... :(
71	Anytime someone asks me why I didn't participate in something	
10	was taking art history as an elective. they said "2-4 people groups ONLY", i said fuck it. when i handed in the project, assistant was like, o where's your group? im like, i worked alone, shit gets done the way i want it to this way
3	that was a good episode
0	Istps are boring and misanthropes , convince me otherwise 
0	Would you kill a closed one who backstabbed you	
44	I only kill over bad spelling.\n\nAnd punctuation.
4	A closed one? I don't get it. Anybody explain please?
9	Nope. I am very forgiving to begin with. And if it was really that hurtful, I'd just cut them off. I don't enjoy hurting people or getting revenge - I see no use in it.
9	Too much work 
6	That would require me to give a damn.
3	Not worth the effort. 
4	No not me
2	Nope.
3	Any way to test if an ESTP or ISTP? The test put me right in the middle	I really enjoy being in social situations but usually prefer to listen more than talk. Also in a group effort I usually like to sit back and listen what's the plan and guide the group when I feel like it. I have no tendencies to create or build something by hands, only music.\n\n"Virtuosos can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions." - This is also completely false for me. I never have outbursts of emotions, everything that I decide is a result of my thoughts and I consider myself to be a very loyal person to my few closest friends.\n\nSome other keywords: ambitious, think a lot about negative changes in my social circles, good public speaker, enjoy throwing useless shit away, no bullshit/straight to the point, one track mind\n\nEdit: I guess I feel like a low energy ESTP but the official ISTP description doesn't match me.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/KgWkh0f\n\nThoughts?\n
5	I'm borderline extroverted and yet I know I'm an introvert, I might be able to help. \n\nCan you go long periods of time without talking to anyone and be perfectly ok with it? (Online interactions included) I once went 3 days without saying a single word with anybody and I felt amazing. \n\nDo you need a moment every now and then of complete seclusion? (For example, I'm highly sociable, not shy at all and I work as a server. Sometimes when I get home I just put my headphones and don't talk to anybody for a couple hours)\n\nHow many people do you consider to be extremely intimate with you (not in a sexual way)? I can easily talk about almost anything with anyone but only a handful of people hear my deepest thoughts.\n\n\n
3	Yea I was kinda confused wether or not I was an ESTP or ISTP for a while until settling on ISTP 
2	hmmm,  seems about right
2	ISTP.  Maybe N or F masquerading around.\n\nIt’s not an exact science. You answer the questions as you perceive yourself, which isn’t unbiased.
2	I took the test for the first time in high school at 18 and I was around 70% Introvert. I took the test again as a 22 year old college student literally just now and it say's i'm 51% introvert 49% extrovert. Interesting how college changes people a little. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/XlDL0su
1	I find I waver between E and I depending on the season.  Body chemistry (through available nutrition sources and sunlight) and climate have a great impact on mood and weather can be a major obstacle to reaching out.
1	Female ISTP here. I don't think you necessarily have to like to create things by hands to be an ISTP. I never have any interests in mechanical stuff but I DO like to fix things. I spot problems, break them down to pieces to understand how everything works, and identify the cause.\n\nI'm a manager and I let everyone works in the way they are most comfortable with. I don't care if they take shortcuts or ignore general rules as long as we get the results we want. I think that's an ISTP thing too. We are very flexible and we don't follow a step-by-step guide.\n\nBut what makes me think that you are probably not an ISTP is because you said you wouldn't be comfortable being alone for a couple of days. Spending time with ourselves is how ISTPs recharge. 3 days without having to interact with anyone sounds very tempting to me. 
-3	Look at your inferior. Is it Fe or Ni. Are you a selfish narcissistic asshole who always asserts and imposes his personal logic and deductions onto others w.o. much regard for how they might feel about it? No? Then you're not ISTP.\n\nAlso it says here you have friends, so that also effectively rules out ISTP.\n\nIm an istp btw.
8	How do you know if an ISTP is no longer interested in you?	Hi guys,\n\nI was dating an ISTP who came on REALLY strong at first (wanting to see me all the time, texting all the time, asking me to leave stuff at his place, inviting me to brunch with his brother and his brother's wife, even cutely admitted that he liked me). Now all of a sudden, he said he wanted to slow things down. He said the faster we speed through to the 'relationship' phase, the more likely he is to back away. I agreed and decided to give him space. After 5 days of no contact, I reached out. There's definitely been a huge dynamic change since. He responds to texts significantly slower than he used to, and he has not initiated any dates to see me (though he usually did this in person, not through text).\n\nI've been wanting to be direct and basically ask if he's still interested, or if when he said slow down he meant to nothing at all, but I know questions like that can push an ISTP even further away. How can I initiate a chat without pushing him further away?\n\nTLDR: What are the signs ISTPs show they are no longer interested in dating you?
19	I’m an ISTP female. And if I respond to a guy slower and don’t schedule seeing them, it’s pretty intentional. I know exactly what I’m doing and how it’ll be perceived. \nHe’s leading you on because he still likes you as an option, or maybe just likes the ego boost of you being into him. But in his head you’ve already been written off. I’m guilty of doing this to a couple of guys. One of them managed to come back out of that for a bit before I broke it off with him, the other got the hint and stopped talking to me. Sorry. 
10	ISTPs don't generally enjoy emotional talks about their feelings or your feelings, but that doesn't mean you can't be upfront with them. I would honestly just stick to the facts ('I've noticed you haven't been communicating as much lately...'), and ask if maybe he's not as invested/interested as he was before. I think ISTPs can understand the idea of not wanting to 'waste time' on a fruitless endeavour.\n\nThe important part is accepting whatever answer you get in return.\n\nThe other point I think is that if you're generally a little insecure, and you need or want verbal reassurance... if you're often brooding on the nature of your relationships with others... It might be worth considering if you're a good fit with somebody you won't feel able to share those things with.
4	If you're too scared of confronting him, ask him out on a date.  If he declines and doesn't ask for a rain check or never hits you up later, that's a pretty firm no.\n\nWhen my istp SO and I were just dating he'd be profusely apologetic of his absence if he felt like his actions caused me to start losing interest.  We were long distance at the time and we scheduled a gaming session together.  I texted him to let him know I was online, no response.  I was annoyed, but people disrespecting my time is nothing new to me.  Two days later I get a flurry of texts from him falling over himself because it turned out he was bedridden with the flu (which he was still nursing).  I almost didn't believe him.
2	I have personally observed myself exerting this behavior towards my object of affection. As a matter of fact I'm doing it to someone rn.\n\nThere's definitely something to be said about our characteristic impulsiveness in general. We experience enthusiasms in rushes but that enthusiasm can just as easily eb once the adrenaline is over. That part of us is quite animalistic.\n\nHowever in the realms of romance I think that our inferior Fe, coupled with our laser focused/borderline ovsessive personality, tends to compound the problem. The latter means that when we have decided we want something we will go all in to get it, while the former means that we might be misappropriating our emotional roller coaster as legitimate and grounded desire. \n\nSince you didn't reciprocate his level of intensity in the courting process (because you are a emotionally responsible human being), or maybe just because time passed, it probably snapped him out of his zone, and he probably realized he was over idealizing the relationship.
2	The fact that you're looking at an ISTP for signs shows you don't know this type too well.\n\nI'd say be as simple and blunt as you can.\n\n"Hey, are you still interested in hanging out?".\n\nThat should suffice nicely.\n\n
1	derogatory, overly truthful personal comments are a good hint.  the rose-colored glasses are off!
1	Damn, I'm sorry to hear that, echoing some of the answers here, I usually just ghost people when I'm no longer interested in them (even the ones I dated)\nthere's also:\n- Slow response time (e.g. checks inbox notification - ignores)\n- Not talking to them for days (instead of being jokingly annoying)\n- being bored with them and telling them upfront (if they're persistent)

71	Xpost /r/intp, their sub hilarious :D	
35	Just had a chemistry exam and I read Fe as iron. Fml
19	I don't understand, why would you ever go to Fe on purpose?
16	I love intps, but that sub seems like it's 90% DAE, 9% meta-complaining about how depressing they all are, 1% gold.  Rip
1	LOL. accurate. 
14	Question about emotional maturity	So I'm kinda new to this MBTI stuff.  One thing that has been on my mind is as an ISTP I have inferior Fe.  This manifests as being relatively stoic and level-headed.  Because the Fe is inferior it's supposedly underdeveloped or immature.  Yet, when a feeling type has strongly emotional reactions even to things that are relatively inconsequential **they are doing something that a CHILD does**.  But somehow they are the more emotionally developed/mature ones?  So, either I've uncovered a big plot hole in MBTI (not very likely) or I'm in need of further explanation (pretty damn likely).
20	Fe=/=emotions. Same with Fi.\n\nThis is one of the bigger misconceptions floating around. \n\nFe/Fi are about values. Fe values external harmony, putting the needs of others over your own, making sure everyone's on the same page, resolving conflicts, finding compromise, sympathy etc. Fi values internal harmony, finding what matters to you, staying true to yourself, empathy etc.\n\nI guess you could argue that since these functions operate in the sphere of values, those who use them are more prone to being emotional. And Id even agree with that to an extent. Emotions get in the way of Ti/Te processing, so you could say we try to ignore them more, which can lead to a buildup and later outbursts. With Fe/Fi, emotions can help and/or amplify those functions, so users are more prone to allowing them, and less likely to try and control them(when unhealthy).\n\nAll in all, I don't think emotions are tied to functions, but our functions can affect the way we interact with them.
2	Illuminating
10	Any big plans for the weekend? 😁	
39	It's Wednesday, wtf? I'll figure that out this weekend. 
13	Finals coming up, so I'll probably sit around and binge some show I've seen before 
11	Lol
10	My ESFP girlfriend invited me to join her and her friends at the pub on Sunday for drinks so I have no plans this weekend.
13	Beyond getting *super* high on Friday?\n\nNot really. 
5	I see what you did there. Boiling crawfish on Sat. 
4	My birthday is Saturday! Starting tonight haha. Tons of weed through Friday. Then I gotta Work a little bit this weekend. Heading over to my dads house for a little birthday get together Saturday. \n\n\nOther than that, as much relaxation as I can manage. It’s been one *fucking* stressful year so far and I need a goddamn break. And my birthday is as good an excuse as any to relax. Lol. \n\n\nI’m only a couple years into my independent  adult life and I’m already sick of it 😂. There’s *always* something wrong that needs to be fixed. Shit can never just go smoothly.

15	Do you guys always feel that you’re a made up cell and just wondering, what am I doing in this world?	
21	Before the great vastness that is time, our actions will mean absolutely nothing, so fuck it.\n\nGo ahead and do that silly thing.

11	Having a Passion for the ISTP	ISTPs, what are you passionate (non-sexual) about? Do you have passions? Do you even believe in having a passion for something? Did you begin on this earth having passions in life? Or did you stumble into an activity that led you to the passion you are able to identify today? Last thought, do you think passions are innate or nurtured?
62	Eating food and not dying.
25	I don't know if I'd use the word "passion" as much as I'd either use "obsession" or "the thing that currently occupies my attention, which has been able to occupy my attention for a lengthy period of time".\n\nI have a tendency to always want to try something new, my list of hobbies over the years has been quite long. I usually go full bore into it at first, enjoy it, get good at it, then move onto something else.\n\nI have a few longstanding hobbies, however. Probably music (writing, recording, playing, guitar/bass/drums/piano/vocals) and geocaching. Geocaching led me to kayaking, which I quite enjoy and have been doing quite regularly for many years now. I'd like to think I'm an adventurous/curious person, so those activities help me explore my world. it's a lot of fun.\n
24	I don't have passions. I'm not 100% devoted to anything full time.
14	Knowledge. It's a wide enough field that ik constantly being surprised and learning new things. 
14	I like walking
10	i like to get high if that’s even a passion 
5	i love writing and drawing. i do have my periods where i don't do anything drawing or writing related for weeks or months because i'm not motivated, but when i do have a random burst of inspiration it's hard for me to stop until i burn out from mental exhaustion.\n\nit wasn't something i "discovered", i guess? i think my passion for drawing was always there, it just didn't manifest until i got my hands on supplies. as a kid, i enjoyed defacing my bedroom walls with crayon scribbles. i also spent a lot of time just messing around with my supplies from this giant crafts barrel my parents had gotten me for my birthday. sometime around second grade, i started watching tv and i always watched this painter, so my scribbles turned into drawings of my backyard and living room. eventually, my parents let me use the computer and i discovered cartoons; now i was drawing fancy stick figures in my crayon backyard. in either third and fourth grade, my uncle signed me up for a mixed media program at the local museum as a birthday present and the rest is history.\n\nas far as writing, it was also another thing i just liked to do. my aunt had given me this pretty diary for my birthday (i think i was in second grade). originally, i was going to use it for its intended purpose, but i could never write about my feelings in there. then i realized it was a good place to explain what was happening in my drawings. these brief explanations eventually turned into short stories when i started learning about creative writing in school. after that diary was filled, my mum showed me that i could use word documents instead of always buying journals. i also really liked to read (my mum is a librarian so i was always at the library) which helped in story writing. eventually, i discovered fanfiction communities and again the rest is history.\n\ni havent really thought about your last question before. if i were to answer based on my experience alone though, i guess it could be a combination of both? neither my parents are artistic or particularly interested in writing, but they supported my interests. if i wanted the crayon box with more than eight colors because the water and the sky were supposed to be different shades of blue, then they'd get me the 24-piece set... and so on. my teachers would also compliment me a lot like: "wow! this is really good!" and encourage me to join drawing and writing contents. their encouragement led me to believe that i really was talented and had something unique, so it motivated me to develop my skills.\n\nthe only time my parents didn't exactly want me to consider art or writing was when i was picking my major for college, but they didn't really have much to worry about since i had decided way back in elementary school that i was going to take biology anyway. science was something i performed decently in at school and i liked it enough so i thought, "eh. why not?" i'm picking up a minor in graphic design next semester though.
4	I'm passionate about my field of study, which is good and it's about the only thing I can recall that can be said to be my passions. I have *interests* which is pretty much anything, but passion never entered the bill. \n\nI didn't even know my field existed before 2 years ago, until I took a random elective too late and fell in love with the program, so in true ISTP fashion I wandered the earth not knowing what to do with myself and just went with the flow. Never failed me so far. \n\nI'd say also, workin out? Maybe not passionate about it, but certainly in my top 3 priorities in life that I enjoy. \n\n> Last thought, do you think passions are innate or nurtured?\n\nDoes it really matter?
4	I'm not passionate about anything. It just doesn't happen. 
3	>(non sexual) \n\n\nI feel like this goes without saying hahaha. Not that we don’t like sex here, but I feel like it’s not the main priority for most of us. The general vibe I’ve always got here is “love but don’t need it”. \n\n\nAnyways! Onto the question! I’d say my longest running passion is cars. I go through different stages of varying interest, but mostly because I’m a young adult who’s 1.5 years into independence. So my time and wallet arent always Car passion friendly. But when I don’t have money and time to work on my car, I do like to fill my needs elsewhere. I spend a lot of time researching new cars, scanning the local markets for killer deals to flip, planning builds for cars I’ll never own, playing racing games, etc. \n\n\nI also have a passion for people. And I know this sounds very strange and unorthodox for this sub but hear me out. When i say “people” I almost mean as an attraction or as a species. I love to just watch people and listen. I also love figuring out what makes people tick and what drives them. The human brain is extremely technical and complex. Trying to break down and organize someone else’s thoughts/actions to get to the root of someone’s personality is methodical and soothing to me. It allows me to approach social situations as a challenge/task/goal to complete. And that is a fantastic way for me to be social with people I have no long lasting ties to. Helps keep me from being mentally drained or putting stake into the impression *im* leaving. Because all I care about is *their* impression on me. \n\n\nEdit: I didn’t really address most of the question. Sorry for the even further elongated post, but here we go. \n\n\nI *did* sort of stumble into cars as a hobby. In middle school, I didn’t know shit. I knew the names of big manufacturers but that’s it. And all my friends new more names of cars. I started there trying to learn more so I would be less Car-stupid. And it developed from there. \n\n\nThe people thing started a couple years ago. I learned that as an adult, the world isn’t black and white. It’s hardly even gray. Perception and reality are two very different things and sometimes the gap can be large. But what I found was that when you truly understand a persons personality and what drives them, it’s ten times easier to understand why they do what they do. So when my roommate pisses me off, I break down his words/actions and try to trace them back to the trigger. I rarely ever confront him with my “mental math” on his actions. However, it does really help me decide what is a problem to be addressed and what is just a spur reaction to another stimulus. It helps me decide between “just let it go, he’s in a bad mood and didn’t mean it” and “this shit needs to stop now”. And it’s greatly improved how well we get along. And I’ve even shared my mental math with his girlfriend who essentially lives with us. She’s a lot younger and more naive and was starting to let him control her. But now that I’ve opened his inner mind to her, she’s been much more equipped to handle his bad moments. And I think it’s actually strengthened their relationship, which was a nice icing to the cake. 
3	I live, eat and breathe Pink Floyd.
2	Hard liquor.  If you see a new hard liquor product on the market that makes you think, "Why hasn't this been in stores before now?", it might have been me.
2	[deleted]
2	I like playing videogames and going bouldering sometimes
3	I don't think I'm really passionate about anything, but I do get frequent bursts of creativity or interest in a topic that slowly fades away. The most frequent bursts are usually related to chemistry or astrophysics so I guess I'm passionate about that? But not all the time? :/
1	Knowledge. It's a wide enough field that ik constantly being surprised and learning new things. 
1	I'm really passionate about birds and nature and the environment in general, just not to the extent of organizations like PETA and such. But it led me to study biology in college and guides my career path and hobbies. I just feel so much happier in the middle of the woods compared with anywhere else.\n\nAlso, I've had a weird obsession with vampires since I was a little kid, I have no idea why. I decided to write a novel just so I don't seem like a weirdo for knowing so much lore about them. Been working on that consistently for about 10 years now, I keep re-writing and re-editing it so I don't know if it will ever see a publisher.
1	Art. Drawing, learning some digital painting, 3D modeling, animation. Most of the time I'm too lazy, but, I despise my current job in retail, so, I'm working towards improving to the point where I can land a job where I don't have to deal with customers. 
1	I'm not passionate. If I apply myself I can do anything/ learn anything that's worth learning that doesn't encroach on my sense of freedom or involves dealing with selfish people or the general public or the need to be successful based on other peoples opinion or money... for the most part. 
1	Im not passionate about anything, no. 
1	1. Making art\n2. Looking high and low for topics honest/helpful/practical enough to cover
1	Flight and anything related to it. The first time I flew in a plane, I was younger than 6 years old I believe. When I was in 3rd grade my family was lucky enough to go to Hawaii. I remember sitting there looking out the window at O'hare airport, looking at the Boeing 747 I was going to be getting on, and *flying for 9 hours across the entire fucking ocean to land on a tiny island*. Also, the fact that such a massive piece of metal could possibly leave the ground was mind boggling. I was seated in the bottom section of the plane but was able to go see the upper level which was awesome. 
1	I'm not sure if it's a passion, but I do fantasize a lot about being completely alone.\n\nSo much that, when it finally happens, my mood increases dramatically.
1	Doing something efficiently. No matter what. If you are an ISTP, I would suggest you to choose something, no matter what (but preferrably something physical, or something where you can see improvement easy) and try to master it. \nFor example I have a ridiculous thing that I do every day - it cleans my mind, I am throwing clothespins to the basket, from 3-4 meters. I found it just by accident and felt that it really gives me a good physical stimulation and opportunity to improve. It can sound really ridiculous.\nAlso I would suggest shooting with firearm or fencing or riding or driving etc. Anything that allows you to improve your skills and gain new impressions.
1	I'm a jack of all trades and master of none when it comes to passion and life..my interests literally change if not every other week every month...because I only live for the moment I just get bored with shit and move on lol I've never been in a relationship at least that lasted much long but I really think I might just enjoy solitude or I just lost my soul for feeling loved..I'm bad at speaking up if there is a woman I'm interested in and I've never got past this..I think I'm just petrified of rejection though

63	I don't want to be around people that I have to work hard to please	The older I get, the less I care about conforming to social norms and pleasing people in ways which I consider superficial.  If people don't like who I am day to day, then chances are we are ultimately going to clash and any type of relationship I have with that person is just going to sap all my joy and leave me exhausted.  When I was younger, I used to want people to like me, respect and approve of me, but now I really could care less.  Now I just don't want to be around anyone that I have to work hard to impress, or fake a persona around.  As I result I spend a lot more time alone and a lot less time talking to people, and I feel much more secure with myself and I have a lot more mental energy.  I feel that my desire to act naturally trumps my desire to be around other humans on a regular basis.
22	 Honesty and character mean more to me than pleasing you. A few real friends are better than a ton of Fakebook friends.\n\nCharacter is what you do when no one is looking. I put more effort into making sure I can like myself than getting others to like me. I often fail, but failures strengthen my resolve.\n\nI don’t care what you think of me. All that matters to me is what I think of you.\n\nUnless, of course, I hold you in high regard. Then your opinion of me may matter a little. If it is a justifiable opinion it won’t affect my opinion of you.
7	I couldn't agree more. I always wasted so much time and energy just to feel phony. I have started saying exactly what I think and doing what I actually want to do when I'm around these type of people. Other than mortifying my wife, it's going pretty well. 
3	You can be yourself around other people you know, if they don't like it fuck em
1	I ignore unless they put in efort. Else fuck that sht
162	Takes like 2 seconds	
34	Typing on mobile takes 20x longer than it should. So 40 seconds.\n\nAlso you have to figure out what to say. Better finish what I was in the middle of before I start considering that... aaaaand it's 4 days later.
49	Can't text people back if nobody texts you. *taps temple*
15	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\nI responded in my head. Unfortunately technology hasn't caught up yet, and I don't have a cortical implant that sent that message out. \n\nDamn.
9	I make sure to wait at least six hours between replies. \n\nTo set realistic expectations. 
8	Fuck it. Let's to this. Hand me my phone.
8	What about texting them first? Is it also necessary? I mean, after the conversation died.
8	no thanks
6	A more accurate and inclusive pill would be: "You have to like people for them to like you back." \n\nIts all shit that us istps have heard before but it is so true. Really take an interest in people. Turn off your overdeveloped Ti and just appreciate the mural of individuals humanity has to offer, just for being special, even if it doesnt make sense logically.\n\nExcept for dom and aux Te users fuck those guys.
5	I’ll just eat my lunch alone thanks.
4	Most people are boring 
4	I'm an extravert and I still do not enjoy texting people back. I often put it off for later, but then I forget about it, and when I remember it's been a week and it'd just be awkward, so I put off that response too, and then it's 6 months later and wow this is why I only have IxTx friends.
3	If they had potential as a friend, they would never text.
2	I don't particularly want friends, though. And most people that text me want to communicate with me badly enough that they're willing to ignore my intensive hinting that I'd rather be left alone.
1	Yeah, for me I think it's a perfectionist mindset that leads to unsent texts and ultimately un-having friends.
6	ISTP women and casual sex	I found that when I was single I could very easily have sex with a man with no strings attached.  I could even see multiple men at the same time without feeling any sense of guilt/shame.  In the early stages of dating, when relationship status is not really established, if a man wasn't giving me as much time as I wanted, or had ghosted me, I would just go online and find another hook up.  I wouldn't give him a second thought after that.  I would continue seeing him if he contacted me again, if I still found him hot, but I wouldn't become emotionally attached until something more developed between us, and most of the time it didn't.  When I am in a committed relationship I am the complete opposite.  I become completely monogamous.  I don't cheat on my partner and I become devoted to them.  It's just that I see being single as open season to sleep with and do whatever I want.  I find that this attitude in general isn't common among other women, or is it?  Is it an ISTP thing?  Because it would make sense as it could be considered 'high risk behaviour'.  I calculated the risk and met up with mostly nerdy Asian guys, however.  I don't tend to go for bad boys/thugs.
26	I'm the opposite, I see sex as something really intimate and don't trust people enough to want to have sex with them.
8	Enjoy that wall at 30 lol
2	Same as you
2	Totally the same
2	I think it's great you're showing some shy guys some love. If you don't have any emotional qualms about what you're doing and neither does the other party does it really matter what we think?\n\nA friend of mine can sleep around as much as he wants but any feelings get involved and he's scared out of his mind. I don't find hookups fun at all since sex is about my feelings. There's a spectrum and I don't think there is any particular place you should be at, especially if you can process it in a healthy way. \n\n
1	lol i'm the same way. the second that we're something more than just friends with benefits, everyone else is out of the picture. \n\ni recently just got out of a relationship so act up szn is here legggoooooo
4	question to you istps?	so clint eastwood,buce lee and eminem are all typed istps,at first i thought eminem was isfp but after research hes definitly an istp.(you will see it too if you research) anyways iv noticed that istps have this ability to give great one liners.like clint eastwood movies he always has the best one liners.i think it comes down to the istps bottom two fucntions ni-fe which gives them the charisma like the nfjs,even eminem in rap battles he gives the best insults.so anyways,what can you istps say to this?are you good at insults ?
17	I think we can make it seem like we often lay down gold because, if we don't think what were saying is either valuable or clever, we don't say anything.
16	Can't speak for everyone, but ISTPs just quickly analyse the current situation, deduce what's wrong and quickly point out the problem.\n\nBe it a Leaking Faucet or a Leaking Face.\n\nThen again, it could just be the scriptwriters.
14	When I want to offend people I am very, very good at it.  I know exactly what makes each person tick and how to push their unique buttons.  
8	I think Eminem is far too emotional to be an ISTP.
6	> are you good at insults ?\n\nNo.\n\n> what can you istps say to this?\n\nFuck off.
3	I suck w coming up w creative ideas, wish i had some of that Ne.
3	Half the time I've had disgustingly good one liners is because I'm hovering in the back just listening in. Slowly thinking through the situation being discussed.\n\nI'll blurt something out that just bombshells the whole convo.
38	Explained MBTI to My ISTP Engineering Coworker Today	I told him that his type struggles with empathy.\n\nHe said, "What's that? I know what entropy is."\n\nFelt like one of those one-liner moments of that Ti-Fe preference.
51	An ENTP explaining empathy to an ISTP?\n\nThe blind leading the blind...
28	I hear this type of thing frequently, and I don’t buy it.\n\nWe can smell a rat. We can usually figure out when an emotional type is trying to manipulate us, and it doesn’t often work. That pisses the manipulators off and they start tossing out accusations of heartlessness.\n\nTake the f-ing drama somewhere else. Seeing through the BS does not equal emotional impairment.\n\nHaving said that, it is true that we often respond inappropriately to real situations. However, it’s when we see through the BS that the overly dramatic get all amped up. Speaking for myself, at that point it is quite enjoyable to turn the screws.
14	I don't see it as lacking empathy. I see it as an ability to make less - biased judgements. Emotions are also a weakness in this sense, and as such, I do not allow my decisions (aside from in unimportant social interactions) to be affected by emotion. 
4	As a chemE, all i can say is LOL.\n\nThat said, I understand empathy too.
5	How does your External Feeling affect ypur interaction with people? Especially you ger ISTP question as Fe develops with age.	I was wondering, from your own perception and from the perception of people around you: how do you think your Fe affects (more likely negatively) your interaction with people. What bugs you/makes others not understand you/what do you not understand about others, when it comes to Fe related matters?\nEspecially:\n- friends\n- partners in relationship\n- parents \n- closer relationships 
22	Inferior Fe leads me care a lot about what people think of me since I want to fit in and to always want to be polite to people.But since it is inferior I have trouble figuring out how to do so and will often come across as rude or blunt. There are times when I say things that I think are helpful but end up actually hurting someone because they were a lot meaner than I expected. When people come to me with emotional problems my first instinct is to fix the problem which isn't always the best, and I never understand how to deal with emotional outbursts or crying. Expressing my feelings or emotions is also a big struggle, I tend to bottle things up and then cry when I'm under a  lot of stress.
9	Fe is essential for life in small quantities, and the primary component of steel.\n\nCouldn’t live without it. Vegetarians in particular struggle with Fe, and often don’t realize it. I’m not sure how Fe needs change with age:
1	Thank you so much for the description, this was incredibly insightful!
16	Dating behaviors of an istp	Hi there,\n\nI just recently started dating an ISTP. Things were going really great at the start and moving really fast, so I asked to slow things down. It did for a minute, and then seemed to pick up again; he seemed to be propelling our texting and face-to-face interactions forward.\n\nNow come one month into this, we were supposed to meet up (his idea), and then sends me a text asking for a raincheck because now he thinks we're moving too fast. He said he doesn't want to jump into something serious this quickly and that he needs some time to adjust. He said the more we speed through the more likely he is to back away.\n\nMy response was, "Agreed. Enjoy the fam!" (he's seeing his family this weekend). I got no response from him after and it's been nearly 2 days. \n\nIs this typical ISTP dating behavior, hot and cold? Should I reach out or give him his space? What would you ISTPs want me to do if you were in this position? And more importantly, is there still hope here?\n\nThanks for your responses. x
35	yes.\n\nIf you want a response try asking a question. Terrible about texting back on our own.
32	Kind of relates to this post on /r/mbti about [why certain types ghost people](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/81cz95/reasons_the_types_ghost_people/)\n\nISTP: They didn't. They're just like that. Message them today and they'll show up at your house an hour later with a blanket and some weed.\n\nGenerally, I don't go out of my way to talk to people unless they make an effort to talk to me first. \n\nThat's ^probably ^^why ^^^I ^^^^have ^^^^^no ^^^^^^friends
12	Your last text had nothing that required an answer, so he didn't. It was the end of the conversation\n\nTo the rest, sort of odd. I'm really bad at slow, things just move at the pace they move, and I'm pretty physical. Sounds like he's got something on his mind and might not even be able to figure out what it is
6	ISTP here. I don't ghost people unless they've threatened my personal space somehow. I simply won't respond though if there's nothing to say, or because I think you were trying to "act" casual. Just be forward if you want my attention. (Ps I'm a girl so maybe it's different?)
6	Yes don't worry, sometimes we say something back and sometimes we don't, but the reason he didn't answer back is because we ISTPs expect you to be cool like us and just get the message and move along, if ISTPs want a breakup we say it, he is just probably over the honeymoon phase and while he may not be the most romantic person, he'll do his best to keep your relationship alive and well
5	I'm going to disagree with the other commenters and say no, this isn't normal ISTP behavior.  He was originally texting a lot and not respecting your desire to slow down, and then said *he* needs to slow down and doesn't text at all.\n\nTo me this behavior indicates (and I'm sorry to say this) that he has found someone else and he's backing away.\n\nI hope I'm wrong but I just don't see this as an ISTP thing.  I see it as a guy who is moving on and is ghosting you.  Now ghosting *is* an ISTP thing. Best wishes and I hope it all works out for you.
2	There is nothing to say atm, so why talk?
1	I’d recommend against reaching out too soon or too head-on. Regardless of whether he’s ghosting or not, doing so would risk projecting too much ‘Fi pressure’ on to him—something high Ti users aren’t too comfortable with. \n\nI’m putting quotes on b/c I’m not sure if it’s what it’s called. But it’s the vibe that I (xSTP) get from some NFPs that is hard to either take in or to respond and rather I’d just run away.

8	what do y'all do with your hands in pictures	when i was 19-20 I did the naruto ram jutsu hand sign. before that it was peace signs or i picked up random objects. now i just... awkwardly hide my hands behind my back or cup my mouth/chin in the thinking pose. idk man i've always been a confused grown child.

1	Pockets, thumb sticking out. If I'm feeling fancy, I'll cross my arms
1	I just cross my arms.
8	IxTP and confusion between Se and Ne	I've been doing some research on Myers-briggs and it seems pretty common that ISTP and INTP often get confused about which of the two types they are, especially when it comes to Se and Ne. I'm just wondering how many of you had a tough time deciding and why do you think it's so common? Is it the shared Ti, function loops, or another reason?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone who answered so far, your resonses are interesting but I don't really think you're getting the question. I'm not looking for the differences between the types. I want to know why they get confused a lot to begin with.
13	This is going to be totally informal, and people often don't like that method of differentiating between types, but I don't care what people like, I care about results. The following are patterns I've noticed over time, and this method has yet to fail me in narrowing down whether someone is an ISTP or INTP. \n\n* INTPs are generally clumsier. I have yet to meet a physically clumsy ISTP. Do you often bump into things while walking, look for something while holding it, spill things on yourself? Miss your mouth when eating? If so, you're more likely to be an INTP.\n\n* INTPs often entertain a lot of different possibilities as answers to a problem. They're more likely to speculate. ISTPs will tend to favor one specific answer, and if that doesn't work, they'll go on to the next thing, but they're not usually sitting there comparing a million things preemptively. \n\n* Naturally, INTPs are very similar to ENTPs. When you go to the ENTP subreddit and read the posts and comments, do you ever feel like you're reading things that could have been your own thoughts? \n\n* Are you the guy in your friend group who makes cringe puns that makes everyone shake their heads and groan? If so, you're more likely to be an INTP.\n\n* How do you feel about motorcycles? (I've met *a lot* of ISTPs, and have yet to meet one who dislikes motorcycles. Most either have one or are open to the idea of having one.)\n\nMaybe someone else will comment with something more by-the-book, but these are key factors that have helped me help others arrive at accurate conclusions regarding their types.
4	I don't know nearly enough about it to answer your question, but I'm one of these people. I've gotten both results but in each case neither the S or N was very strong.
5	I find INTPs are ideas people, where ISTPs are far more practical.  The INTPs I know are the ones who come up with the clever comments, the neat ideas and seem to have a natural creativity.  ISTPs like me are far more practical and factual.
6	I read a comment a while ago saying that you can tell the difference between istp and intp by asking them about cars.\n\nAssuming they know anything about cars, an istp will tell you about the inner workings of a car, while an intp will tell you about different makes and models, as well as the history of cars.\n\nOf course that's a very rough distinction, but I found that it really elucidates the difference if you think about it. It made me realize I'm istp, and it helped me understand Ne/Si vs Se/Ni a lot
2	First, you have to remember that Se and Ni come in a pair, and Ne and Si come in a pair.  \n   \nSensing:   \nSensing is an information gathering function. It gathers information consciously. It does not make choices on its own.   \nInternal Sensing. (Si)  \nYou see a tree. But instead of really seeing the tree you're looking at in the outside world, you are reminded of a tree from your past. It's just like the one in your front yard from your childhood home. This function tends to live in the past.   This is the function used to reminisce.  Fed into a judgement function, this tends to result in choices being made based on past experiences, tradition, and convention.  "What Worked best last time?"  \n   \nExternal Sensing. (Se)   \nYou really and truly are seeing the tree. It's right there in front of you. FUCK! Look at that! Of all the functions, this one is the most present in the current moment.  5 senses are used. It makes the outside world extraordinary concrete and tangible.  This is often the function being used to enjoy the simple pleasures in life.   Heavy Se users tend not to care much at all about tradition or convention when it comes to making decisions.  "What is the right choice for this situation happening right now?"   \n   \nIntuition:  \n    \nThis one is very difficult, so bear with me. Like sensing, intuition also gathers information. It's more about gathering information about ideas rather than 5 senses information gathering. Intuition is somewhat nebulous to verbalize even for someone who uses it as primary function.  It’s very hard to define in exact words. If I make a mistake, I hope others will come in and comment for clarification.   \n  \nExtraverted Intuition (Ne)  \n   \nSummarized first and foremost as, "What if?"  \nThis one really must be described first. Intuition that happens externally. An object of focus (whatever you're thinking about) in the outside world generates a ton of new ideas. They never seem to stop, really. New associations and new concepts spawn from a single thing. It is said that this form of intuition EXPANDS ideas as it works. It is amazing at detecting patterns and connections in the outside world.  As the flow never seems to end, Ne users can sometimes have a hard time being decisive about any of their ideas.   \n   \nIntroverted Intuition (Ni)  \n   \nSummarized first and foremost as, "Ah ha!"  \nThis is one of the most difficult to describe functions in all of MBTI, even for someone who uses it as their primary mode of thinking. It's quite nebulous. This is intuition that happens in the subconscious. Like any other information gathering function, how it's used is largely determined by what other information gathering function you pair it with (in an INFJ's case, Fe, or Ti.) The best way to describe it is how it feels subjectively as a user of it. I get, "Vibes." But they feel concrete. Fully formed thoughts tend to pop into my head about people, for instance, like, "He's insecure because of the upbringing with his parents, and picks romantic partners who do not challenge him intellectually so that he can feel in control." and have to work backwards from those thoughts with logic in order to figure out where they came from. It is also scary how often they turn out to be correct. It can be catastrophic when they're not, so an Ni user often learns to temper their Ni with their judgement functions to keep themselves out of trouble.   Ni NARROWS ideas subconsciously to find connections between things.  Ni users can be decisive to a fault, as the function singles in on a connection and then force feeds it to a judgement function for analysis.   \n
1	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.    \n\n[INTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LII_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42489) | [INTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/23058-Discussion-of-LII-INTj-subtypes?p=468892&viewfull=1#post468892)    \n\n[ISTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ISTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42483) | [ISTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4440-Discussion-of-LSI-ISTj-Subtypes?p=142621&viewfull=1#post142621)    \n
1	Se - risk taking, doing stuff, taking action, having tangible experiences \n\nNe - contemplating many possibilities, dreaming up ideas\n\nBefore learning the cognitive functions, I had trouble determining whether I was an INTP or ISTP. But I'm definitely a heavy Se user - I like "extreme" sports, risk taking, I'm very physically active, I live in the moment. \n\nPeople get confused a lot to begin with because most people don't understand the cognitive functions and just read the ISTP/INTP descriptions, and see that they can fit into both descriptions. Or they say "I can be intuitive" (we're tertiary Ni) but also resonate with ISTPs. People who understand the difference between Ne, Ni, Se, and Si would be unlikely to get confused.
25	Subreddit similarity analysis tool + "/r/mbti" = some interesting results	I'm probably super late to the party, but I saw a link to Five Eight Thirty in today's /r/announcements Transparency Report thread and one thing let to another and now I've found something quite cool.\n\nhttps://trevor.shinyapps.io/subalgebra/\n\n[Here is the full description of what it does,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/) but let me try to summarize.\n\nYou can choose two (or three) subreddits and it will compare the number of posts by the same user on each subreddit, adjusting for the size of the subreddit. The result will be a list of subreddits that either contain a surprisingly high number of shared users (if you add the subreddits) or a surprisingly low number of shared users (if you subtract the subreddits).\n\nFor example, what happens if you take the users of /r/istp and remove the users that also post on /r/mbti; where does that cross-section of users spend most of their time?\n\n/r/istp - /r/mbti = \n\n\n1	MBTImusic\n\n2	TalesFromAutoRepair	\n\n3	techsupportgore	\n\n4	pcgaming\n\n5	Justrolledintotheshop\n\nNot super unexpected, but kind of neat.\n\nBut now, for my next trick, a list of subreddits with a large degree of userbase overlap: /r/loseit + /r/mbti =\n\n1	Anxiety\n\n2	ADHD\n\n3	xxfitness\n\n4	AskWomen\n\n5	infj\n\nNote that in combining /r/loseit + /r/askwomen, /r/loseit + /r/xxfitness, and /r/loseit + /r/1200isplenty, *none* of those combinations were similar to /r/anxiety /or r/ADHD. \n\nAnd for the last example I'll throw out, a bit political (sorry). What does /r/the_donald identify as? /r/the_donald + /r/mbti =\n\n1	AskTrumpSupporters\n\n2	altright\n\n3	entp\n\n4	Mr_Trump\n\n5	AskThe_Donald\n\nThere you have it. *However*, /r/SandersForPresident + /r/MBTI also results in /r/entp as the #4 result, so perhaps they are simply more politically active.\n\nData's fun. Post some intersections or unions of subreddits that you find interesting.\n\nhttps://trevor.shinyapps.io/subalgebra/\n\n(ps I have no connection at all to the website, I literally just found it)

3	That's interesting, thanks for sharing
2	Remove pcgaming, mbti music and pretty accurate especially justrolledintoshop.\n\n Please do more of this research, it's quite interesting. The ones that are subbed to r/lose it + r/ADHD and r/anxiety either have bulimia and/or OCD, NOT ADHD, there's a big difference between ADHD and ocd. Obsessing about weight and body image usually leads to abuse of meds, which they were improperly prescribed, and hurts others that actually suffer from the disorder.
11	Tell me, what is your role in the family?	Technician, I always have to help my family members with tech stuff. 
25	It's great when they ask "can you do this thing for me?" that you've never even thought about doing, and have no clue about, but you're going to fix it by going to google and doing the really simple fix they could have done themselves
25	I make the house reek like weed.
7	I provide a cynical point of view on any topic and fix anything that is broken.
7	Tech support and beholder of useless information.
6	The aloof Brother/Uncle/Son that doesn't exist unless they decide to take a 1000k trip.
5	Constant provision of tech support 
3	I cook, which I'm ok with because then I can go hide in the kitchen and drink.
3	Attractive, mischief seeking older daughter?? My dad is also an ISTP so I don't really contribute anything except trouble lol.
2	The punching bag
2	My role is to fight with my older brother every time he starts talking about how Hitler actually did nothing wrong. \n\nI think I may share it with two or three others, I don’t know what he gets up to when he’s not talking to me about it. \n\nBeyond that I don’t have much contact with family day-to-day. 
2	I am 18 and am know as the mechanic, computer technician, and misc. repair stuff. I always loved taking stuff apart and putting it back together as a kid. Once legos got boring, I ended up taking all of my shit apart and building computers.
2	I'm the person they call on to get my dumbass brother out of whatever predicament that he's gotten himself into. I'm the person that they call for to help them with something or ask a favor. Or ask for money.
2	My ISTP plays that role in his family but his execution goes like this: get asked to fix something, and never get around to fixing it. \n\nI don't ask him to fix anything and he always fixes everything. 
2	Tech support, comedic relief, “get ‘er done” person 
1	Fixer, be it electrical, roof, trim/siding, mechanical, etc
1	Youngest weird funny ""geek"". Also I wouldn't say I'm the technician but I'm the guy to go in terms of Internet and computer problems lol
1	Replacement mom to my younger siblings when our actual mom isnt home.
1	My role is mother...giver of life, lunch and the charging of tablets
1	Leech
20	Anyone else find this very relatable?	
11	I want to watch this later but I know I won't
5	Definitely when I was younger for the woman part. But still to this day for the “don’t talk about things you enjoy” part. Sometimes though, I just do it anyways and continue even when I notice the eyes glaze over, because fuck it: I’ll hold you verbally hostage for a few minutes if i can get some enjoyment out of it. 
3	Saw the length of the video and gave up instantly whoops
1	I can relate I give enough info to a question to answer it but not enough to where you can tell how indulged I really I am into a certain hobby  
1	I relate to the "Don't talk about this or else you'll sound like an obsessed weirdo" but nothing else.
33	Some ISTP appreciation	More than a year and a half ago I received a great deal of encouragement here that helped me take the plunge in telling a certain ISTP my feelings. We've been dating ever since.\n\nI just wanted to say thank you.
8	Original thread for reference https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/50m269/how_to_be_sure_an_istp_is_interested_in_you/\n\nI'm glad things are working out for you
4	day one we there
4	ISTP (M) married to an ENFP (F), it can definitely work.
2	Can you explain how you broke the news to him and how he reacted?  :) \n\n-INFJ who loves an ISTP
-12	Sound like you should be thanking that man.\n\nOr reconsider your mental maturity if “encouragement”  not advice makes any substantial difference in your life’s happiness \n\nOr (my favorite of these options) save your passive humble bragging niceties for people that like that kind of nonsense 
28	The introvert paradox	Does anyone else prefer to hang out in groups just so the attention is not on you all the time? I get exhausted hanging out one on one because the attention is too much on me, whereas in groups you can kinda hang around but stay quiet and the attention can be on other people. 
27	I prefer one on one with friends and groups with people who aren't friends so that I can escape unwanted attention.\n
9	I prefer one on one.  I get exhausted with numerous people for more than an hour or two. 
5	Im the same way. I prefer groups usually because if i don't feel like talking or if i feel like observing it seems less weird in a group setting.
4	Definitely prefer one on one. Probably cause it gives me more interaction time cause any bigger, I generally shrink to the side lines
4	Groups are alright because I don't have to say anything, but at the same time it gets annoying listening to everyone.\n\nOne on one is fine unless I have to do most of the talking.\n\nNo socialising is way better than either situation, lol.
3	I don’t much hang out with people. 1 on 1 or groups. I get enough socialization at work.
2	Group of people that are also doing the same activity I'm doing so I don't have to be talking to somebody all the time.
2	I’m sorta the opposite. I prefer small groups of 3-5. I’m an introvert, but I try to not let it make social decisions for me. So if I’m in a bit group, I can barely get a word in. And then I get all the different conversations and noise at one time. It just becomes white noise and It actually can be overwhelming and trigger a migraine. \n\n\nBut in a small group of 3-5, its much less conflicting noise to decipher and I can force myself to interact. 
2	Yes. Even with my best friends I can't always make great conversation so I like to usually have another person there and then I throw in a comment once in a while.
2	I prefer either one on one or maybe 2 other close friends and myself.\n\nGroups are more exhausting for me, especially if I don't know many people in the group.
2	It depends on my mood and the people. I do feel the same way with hanging out in groups, and I don't mind hanging back and people watching or just listening to them chat. If I'm feeling chatty, I'll jump right in the group or with a 1on1.
2	Depends on who I'm with. Casual friends are better in groups and relationships one on one. 
18	Advice for young ISTPs	I'm 19, in my second year studying engineering (mining). So far I'm not enjoying my studies, or anything life has offered  (except video games).\n\nI don't have a job, since university takes 40+ hrs/week and I like time to sleep and unwind. I'm not interested in electrical or software systems, so any hobby such as rock climbing is nearly an hour away (not to mention expensive).\n\nI've read up on the WTF years and I believe I am currently going through it, but I'm unsure of what the best course of action is.\n\nMy only lists are of things I don't like, and it's expanding every day. I know that I should explore hobbies and find things to do, but I find myself wallowing in self-pity at the fact that I don't do anything.This runs into a positive feedback loop, and I end up more uninspired and unmotivated.\n\nI'm very indecisive, and all the more hesitant to make plans about my future because I'm still so young.\n\n\n* Have any of you been in a similar position?\n* What did you do to dig your way out of this hole?\n* Is there some sort of special serum I can take to circumvent this whole process?\n* (Bonus question): Do your WTF years ever truly end?\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n**What would you personally recommend someone my age do to lessen the turbulence of my WTF years?**\n\nThank you for your replies\n\nEDIT: I have no idea how reddit works so formatting is probably cooked
18	Travel. Do it while you’re young because it gets harder as you get older. 
12	I dropped out of college, joined the Army and got sent off to war.\n\nI wouldn't recommend doing *that*.\n\nIt gets easier as you get older, but don't rely on that now.\n\nVideo games can be a horrid quagmire if nothing else gives you any kind of enjoyment.  Getting out into the world is the best way to shake up your perspective and feel something different, in my experience.  Sometimes I just leave my house and walk somewhere for a couple hours if I can't think of anything else to do.
5	This honestly sounds a bit like depression too. Try going for a walk or a jog first, the fresh air always makes me feel better.\n\nI would seriously consider switching majors if you don't like your current one. You're only in your second year so it shouldn't be too difficult to catch up on credits, especially if you mostly just took your core classes so far.\n\nAlso see if your school has trips you can go on. Most schools have an organization that runs free or discounted day trips to local cities and stuff (like rockclimbing). You cou li dalso do study abroad or see if your school has an outdoors club that hosts hikes and camping trips.
4	I find that any kind of depression/aimlessness goes away when you activate Fe and Se. For Fe, talk to someone and make an attempt to express you emotions in the conversation. For Se, go explore or do something new. \n\nI don't know if WTF years actually end, you just learn how to stave off that WTF feeling. Don't take it that seriously, often times people make things a self-fulfilling prophecy because they think their personality type destines their fate.
2	Get out and explore your city on foot or bike. Check local news and message boards to find out things that are happening nearby and go to them. Go to a lot of the free or cheap things your university offers too. I went to art shows, movies, concerts, the gym, the pool etc.. all for free in college. \n\nAlternatively I should have learned a trade instead of college so consider that option too. And no the WTF years never really end but things get better. 
2	I don't know what the future looks like for mining engineering, but if it has excellent employment possibilities, stick with it.  You get a lot of respect from being an engineer of any type, and people think you can do anything so a lot of different kinds of jobs will be available.\n\nAlso, I would think mining engineering would result in a lot of adrenaline-surging activities - going on site and into mines.  \n\nBasically, I'm saying that choice sounds like a good option for an ISTP.  You're just in the malaise-days of college and that happens to everyone.  You could try working out, cycling or some other physical hobby to get you out into the social world and off video games.
2	Take a break with college if you can-- and get a job, find a place to be a for a little while, and use that job to fund some new hobbies and just fucking *be yourself* for a little bit, and then continue the college later. \n\ni was so fucking sick of school when i was 19, the last thing i wanted to do was go to college and do more of it. fucking nightmare. \nim ready to go back now but in order for that to happen i had to give myself a goddamn break and take some freedom for a little bit. i didnt want to work ten more years of my life away at an institution, i needed to relax and explore. im STILL doing that and im 25, because of some shitty turn of events. \n\nYour twenty are renowned for being terrible okay, for EVERYONE not just us. Youre figuring your shit out here. dont worsen this period by buying into societies bullshit expectation of thinking kids and young people are going to know exactly what they wanna do with their lives and how all before they go into college or even during. most people dont figure that out until thirty, and for good reason- its fucking hard. \n\nIf you need a break, take a goddamn break. be lazy. be yourself. take a month to sit on bed and not leave the house and play video games, and unwind and then let your mind chase whatever it wants to chase for a bit. explore. and then when you know what you wanna do, when youve unwound and explored a bit, make a new plan. try some new things. schedule some events to see if it helps you find the direction youre searching for. But dont rush it man. \n\nJust make sure you can fund that exploration with a job of some kind yo. 
2	The one thing that helped me was heading down to a tobacco shop on a (semi)regular basis since sitting on my ass smoking a pipe of tobacco is engaging my extroverted sensing, and being around other people who are also smoking is nice since they're not going to be spending lots of time talking because talking means they're not smoking.
2	Both if you can afford it.  For me, that two year break I took before going back to finish college really helped me put things in perspective.  I worked odd jobs 6-12 months at a time in Colorado and traveled abroad for short trips when I had saved up enough money.  When I went back to school it was easier for me to focus and block out all the noise that comes with being at a university.  
2	If I’m being completely honest, it sounds like you are developing depression. This is almost exactly what my early years looked like, but starting at 14 not 19. \n\n\nThis may be something you should go get an evaluation for. Because if you *do* have depression, you want to address it before it takes over your life. Trust me. I lost several years to my depression. During the the years that were supposed to be the best of my life, I was wallowing in my own pity at home alone. \n\n\nAlso, a lot of people hold the common misconception that something bad has to happen to you to develop depression. And while that can trigger it, it’s not necessary. Depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain and does not require a trigger. Sometimes it *just happens*. \n\n\nI could be way off base here as I’m not a psychologist. I’m just basing it off my very similar experience. I highly suggest doing some reading on the topic and make an educated decision as to wether you want to be evaluated. 
2	I’m 27 and you sound just like me except you’re more woke. For the first 3 years of college I had self expectations of going to law school even though I had shitty grades (not terrible but def not law school material). Up until my third year, I was undeclared for my major and the new university I transferred required everyone to take a personality test. Looking hindsight, it was a Myers-Briggs test and the results probably indicated I was an ISTP but the only thing I paid attention to was the various different majors that would best fit me. Business Management Information Systems is what I chose and now I work in IT for a Fortune 10 company. I am definitely not advising you to change majors but you may want to look into something that interests you. As far as career advice, you can literally get into any field of IT with that degree. I’ve had friends that chose that major just because that was what I was doing and they’re happy that they did. For hobbies, I love to do outdoorsy stuff but everything I like to do requires a fair bit of money to start (fly fishing, snowboarding, bmx, gun enthusiast). These hobbies are very technical and gives you the rush every ISTP is looking for. I will tell you fly fishing is my favorite thing to do in life but it’s one of those things that will take a long time to learn. So don’t expect to just grab a pole and learn right away. You should be able to find used fly fishing equipment on Craigslist or eBay for a bit cheaper. Of course you have to have water near you if that is something you’re thinking about getting into. Hope this long post helps!
2	Definitely know I'm experiencing a WTF moment. Can't really give much advice since I'm 19 and indecisive as well. So that makes two of us. \n\nIt's easy to distract yourself with games and books but overtime it gets tiring. I've certainly noticed that. I prefer experiencing new things or working on something that's challenging/interesting. I'd kill to do at least something but most things cost money. Which unfortunately I don't have.\n\nLike others have mentioned I'd recommend joining the gym. Friends would help a lot in this regard as well  (getting out more etc.) but unfortunately in my case I've drifted apart from mine. Use that as a liability if you're still in contact \nwith yours. 
1	I knew I wanted to go to college, but I needed a break from school out of high school. I joined the Army. (Poor decision. I wasn’t army material. Too regimented and routine. But I did travel all over Europe..... so that was good.)\n\nAfter the army I went to college, but only for a semester or two at a time. I eventually ended up with 2 degrees and 3/4 of another, none of which have anything to do with my current job.
1	You started it off by saying you aren’t liking your studies. I’d say how about switching major to something different like finance or something? If you take enough classes you should still be done with college in 4 years (plus that’s something that will keep you busy and less time spent bored). \n\nYou mentioned not liking the studies nor you are very interested in engineering-related stuff, if you continue with engineering major then you prolly will continue to hate the career path u ‘have’ to take. \n\nI switched a major from engineering to finance for similar reasons and didn’t regret it and since u seem to not really have nothing to lose from doing so college-wise, why not try it. 
0	Sounds like you need to figure out yourself more. Don't give in to self-pity, you do know this is a turbulent period of your life. Establish a consistent personality and that will lead into a consistent way of life.
6	ISTP - ISFP Relationship	hey ! isfp here ;) \n\nhave you guys met isfps? Do you get along, I mean do you find it easy to communicate? in your opinion what are the weaker aspects of a relationship between the two personalities? \n\nthanks :)
8	No
8	I think I haven't, they seem cool.
3	I just started a Relationship with an isfp(i am an istp).We get along very well, we are both very chill and laid back. It seems as of now at least that we are similar enough that we fit together well but still different enough to keep things interesting.
3	In my experience, we get along really well.\n\nOver time, I think the Fi/Ti difference becomes more apparent, but there always seems to be a mutual respect there for it. I worked with an ISFP for awhile and every time something happened/we got a new assignment etc, its like we knew what the other one was thinking. Our impressions of the situation were almost identical. The difference was in how we handled it. \n\nI think ultimately, we had enough in common that we could respect that we just had a different approach to things. \n\nAs far as negatives, the only thing that really came up, was that he seemed less focused than I was. There were times when I was ready to get down to business and he would just have a, "I dont care, this is stupid" attitude. Id be like, "yeah, its stupid...but I dont feel like getting fired." It never created too much tension, but there were times it was a bit irritating on my end.
2	One of my SO's (istp) best friends is isfp.  They've been friends since they were 12.  Some of the stories I've been told about them are crazy.  Usually it's his friend instigating my SO into some dangerous shenanigans.  You'd think they'd wind up hating each other because they went off in opposite directions.  My SO joined the military, and is a die hard libertarian.  His friend smokes pot every day and is an extreme leftist, but they both enjoy each other's company too much to allow their beliefs to get in the way of that.\n\nMy SO has mentioned that he used to hang out with that sort of people a lot because he enjoys just screwing around or playing guitar.  Unfortunately he gets judged a lot for being in the military.
1	My Dad is an ISTP and for the most part, we get along, but working with him was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life. He has his own local gardening service and I worked with him for a year and a bit mostly for the convenience of the job and lack of other income.\nBasically, we have a hard time seeing eye-to-eye on emotional things, which gets in the way of the practical stuff for me. Since he focuses on getting message across and not so much how it gets across, often I'll be put in a bad mood when he not-so-sensitively tells me to go faster even when I'm trying my best. This anger that I withhold from him clouds my mind and distracts me from the task, so I sub-consciously start getting slower. Of course, my dad just sees it as "I told him to go faster, but he went slower, therefore he must not be taking the job seriously and/or be intentionally disobeying me", so the next time he instructs me to do something, it's a little big more aggressive. As you can guess, this continues in a downward spiral until the end of the day, only for it to restart from the top the next day. Neither of us are very open to expressing our emotions to each other, so it's very hard for us to address this problem.
7	your parents and how you turned out	Hello, I just wanted kind of a brief/general survey. Basically I just wanted to know (a) what kind of mbti your parent(s)/caretaker were during your childhood and (b) how you think it might have effected you into your adulthood or the state you are currently in. It can be general or detailed, up to you.\n\nThanks!
7	My dad is really quite, and when I was at his house every other weekend, I usually just played with my stepsisters and my stepmom. My dad was funny but also a bit scary.\nMy mom was basically a single mom of 4, was very driven and gave us healthy foods, took us up the mountains every week, was very competitive in sports, and didn't let us play inside. If I asked her if she could stand on her hands against the wall, she would try and always stay longer than me, lol. I thought she was the coolest mom. She wasn't really a cuddly person or emotional really, but that was perfect. When I was around 12 she was diagnosed with bipolar and she became drowsy(?) and weird at times because of her meds. \n\nNow that I am an adult and a mom myself, I've bonded with my mom in a weird way. Never a emotional way, but in a practical way with a lot of sarcasm and being sick of the same familymembers.
5	Dad: ISTP\n\nMum: ESFJ\n\nMe: ISTP\n\nOlder sisters: ESFP+INFP\n\nMy Mum was never any good at helping me with problems, but she kept me in very good health, always making sure i ate well and got enough sleep. She's actually a nurse so it's safe to say I was in good hands health-wise. \n\nMy Dad was a full time electrician, I looked up to him in a lot of ways, he was the smartest person in the house and always used to get quiz questions correct on TV. I always told him he needed to go on who wants to be a millionaire because he just always knew the right answer. \n\nI was a sporty kid, played as many sports as I possibly could, and I always used to kick/throw balls inside the house and run around. It would annoy my Mum a lot of the time. I used to ask my Dad if he would play with me outside after school, but he would often be too tired from working all day. Sometimes he did play with me though.\n\nOver time I settled down a bit. I started playing computer games more often and was less energetic at home (I still played sports at school though). \n\nWhen it came to school work, I didn't receive much help from my family. I don't think they kept that much track of my grades, my Dad was a very hands off kind of person, he let me do anything I wanted to do. My Mum was the same, as long as I was being nice to people and keeping myself in good health. \n\nI was a pretty sensible kid once I got past the preschool stage. I found school work to be really easy and I could do it all by myself. Once I got to high school it got a little bit harder, there were choices I had to make and I had to do a bit of study. I never developed particularly good study habits, because I was so used to just being awesome at everything straight away. I'd ask my parents for help on my school work, but they weren't really good at helping with it. I quickly learnt that it was a waste of time getting them to help me with it, and the older I got the more I started to realise they weren't actually that smart in an intellectual sense, they just had a lot of life experience that helped them. \n\nSo, I was a bit of a perfectionist when it came to sports and school work. I hated reading and never read books, but I was a good writer. For some reason I thought that writing was a more valuable skill to have in the real world than maths and science. I neglected maths and science in favour of writing, which in hindsight was a mistake. When I got to college (which is grade 11/12 where I live), it got really hard. I didn't care about school or grades at all, because I was more focused on life. I had dreamed of becoming a professional adult since I was 8 years old. \n\nThe perfectionist in me would only hand in work if I knew it was A material. I never handed in work to get a C. If I had written something that I knew was going to get a C, I threw in the bin and took the F instead. My grades as a result were often a mixture of A's and F's. \n\nAnyway, all in all, I think I needed to learn to be more organised and prepared. It would have been nice if my parents taught me about how to study correctly and achieve goals and things like that. I never had anyone to teach me those things. I kind of had to do it all myself from an early age.\n\nMy parents were great at keeping me in good health and fixing things like my bike, computer (etc) though. So I'm definitely grateful for them in that sense. I could have had a much worse childhood that's for sure. At the end of the day, no parents are perfect. I'd say they did a pretty decent job of raising me.\n\nIf I didn't take it upon myself to get away from them though, they'd have kept me forever and I'd have become a man child. I didn't want that to happen, so I followed my sisters and now I live across state from my parents.
8	If I had to guess, my dad is probably an ISTP whose a little more on the feeler side than logic side. Our personalities are incredibly similar. But due to our wholly different world view and experiences, we are entirely different people with different sets of morals. \n\n\nReally the biggest thing is that if you put my dad and I next to eachother for a weekend, having no prior knowledge he was my father, you’d have no doubts he was my dad by the end of the weekend. \n\n\nOur logical approach towards solving an unconventional problem is pretty much the same. We’re both very good at thinking outside the box and using what we have to make something work. \n\n\nFor example, the owner of Circle T ranch in Tyler Texas is a family friend of ours. Every year my dad and I run a father teen weekend for dad’s to bond with kids. He’s the main hancho for putting the weekend together, and I’m in charge of tech/security (wild animals can be a problem hence security). When it comes to discussing operations, we have entirely different ideas about how things should run. But when it comes to tackling a specific problem, there is no better duo than my dad and I to fix it. And if you watched our process from start to finish, there’s just no doubt he raised me. 
5	My dad is a stone statue with very little (shown) emotion. I know he white washes everything because he is an Army vet that has PTSD. My Mom a is batty hippie/bohemian type. How those two ever got together and made me is .... ewww. But, here I am. Laid back, loyal, easy to please, with a wanderlust as big as the universe and a knack for tinkering. 
4	ISTJ mother, absent father, youngest child.\nI was very sensitive as a kid and wished my mother was more affectionate. I don't mind nowadays. The downside is that I'm very introverted and struggle with socializing, I'm also lazy because my mother usually takes charge of everything and her naggy tendencies put me off.
3	ISFJ dad and ENFJ mom. \n\nTo sum it up, I think Im more sensitive/observant of others' feelings. Ive never really been a jerk, but Im a lot more task focused than people focused, so Ive always had the tendency to focus on what I'm doing, rather than the people around me. \n\nMy parents were constantly teaching me to pull back a bit and take a look at those around me. That not everyone can handle how direct I am. That not everyone tells you exactly how they feel, and sometimes you have to ask instead of just assuming theyre okay or that theyll get over it. They tried to teach me that not everyone operates like I do, and sometimes I needed to be more considerate or gentle. \n\nAnd here I am. Sometimes I can still be inconsiderate, mainly when its either a constant issue with someone or I don't have the time to be considerate given the situation(or I think theyre being over-the-top), but at least in most settings Im more sensitive to other people than I would've been otherwise. Overall, I think they upped my Fe skillz.
3	Similarly to me, my dad seems to lack affection and emotion in general, but compensates in sense of humor. (Although his jokes are dreadful, tbh. He's a dad, after all.)\n\n**EDIT:** Unlike me however, my dad is the most talkative person I've ever met. He rarely spends more than 10 minutes without making small talk. Meanwhile, I'm straight-up against all kinds of small talk or pointless commentary. If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise don't.\n\nMom on the other hand... I'd describe her as a slightly naive caretaker. She likes to see the good in people even if it's not there at all. She's also very protective of the people that she holds dear.\n\n**EDIT:** I guess if I *did* inherit some quality from her, it would be the shyness. Unlike dad, she can still demonstrate some social awkwardness in some unfamiliar environments.\n\nI used to kind of hate them when I was a teenager, I guess everyone kinda does at that age, and now I have nothing but respect for them, although we still don't talk to each other a lot. (That last one is more my fault than anything. I just think our relationship will probably have less fights if we keep a safe distance.)
3	My Mom: INFP\n\nMy Dad: ENTJ? (not so sure)\n\nMy older sister: ESFJ\n\nMy Mom was probably the biggest influence. She's very idealistic, to the point where she can be rather judgmental. She taught me not to follow the crowd, but to follow my dreams and convictions instead. The positive outcome of this is that I grew up feeling confident in myself even if I didn't fit in and was basically immune to peer pressure. The negative is that I often found myself judging people or being too black and white in my thinking. This lessened as I got older and interacted with different kinds of people.\n\nMy Dad, even though he loves his family, was always a bit emotionally immature and had anger issues. He provided for us and did his best to give me and my sister a nice, normal childhood with summer road trips and all that. But he was always extremely irritable and would snap at us for little things, act petty, and generally ruin the mood. And sometimes he'd just get extremely angry. He didn't physically hurt us but the rage was palpable and it was scary. I'm not actually sure how this affected me in the long run. Possibly it made me more conflict-averse and passive-aggressive, because I didn't learn how to settle disagreements in a healthy way or even speak up when I didn't like something.\n\nAside from that, both my parents emphasized study and intellectual pursuits over things like sports or practical skills. They encouraged me to read, write, and do well in school. Except in the brief period in my very early childhood when we were well-off, they never signed me up for sports or otherwise encouraged me to be athletic except when I showed interest on occasion. I don't think I've ever seen either of my parents throw a ball. In a similar vein, when I showed interest in learning a technical skill, they wouldn't stop me but didn't encourage me either. The impression I usually got was, "any idiot can learn a trade, you should aim higher." So I think I always tried to act smart and pretend to be a genius destined to work for NASA or win the Nobel Prize or something. The positive is that I am now a well-educated adult. The negative is that I ignored and repressed certain aspects of my personality, like my artistic interests and daredevil tendencies. I always felt they were frivolous, even base. But again, over time I figured I didn't have to be so strict and learned to let loose and have fun.\n\nMy sister and I clashed a lot. I was unemotional and nearly robotic, she always had something she totally hated or totally loved, or both, or whatever. Drama llama. She couldn't understand my behavior and insisted I fix it. Being a little smartypants I would talk back and argue with self-serving logic, and she had no logic so she just felt attacked and insulted. She would constantly assign thoughts and feelings to me which I never had or expressed, which basically made me look like a psycho or a total asshole. I didn't respect her for a big chunk of my life, because she came across as a whiny loon. At the same time, she was the only person in my family who actually forced me to do household chores or gave helpful advice on how to interact with people. Because at the end of the day, neither of my parents were very good or interested in those things. And by constantly judging me and throwing hissy fits she effectively terrorized me into altering my behavior to fit more socially acceptable molds, which helped me not be a total outcast.
3	My mother is an ENFP and my father is an ISTJ.  My mother is very emotionally volatile and she has drank very heavily since I was young, I have no idea how she is still alive.  My dad is the most boring, rigid, grumpy man in existence until he gets drunk and smokes some weed, then he's a blast.  He does have the best sense of humour, though, whether he's drunk or not.  They'll be times when he manages to be incredibly funny, but it's quickly followed by him going back to being a boring old fart, whether he's drunk or not.  My mother was very volatile and neglectful growing up, but I chose to live with her over my father, who would impose stupid rules and then there would be hell to pay if I didn't follow them.  I remember one occasion when my dad forced my brother to search his whole room for every sock he owned and to match them up.  Another time my brother thought it was fun to do some graffiti around the neighborhood, my dad caught him and made him go around with a bucket and sponge cleaning it all off.  Overall I didn't have an ideal childhood, there was a lot of violence and neglect, but I don't really remember it very well and I can't say it effects me now or that I hold it against my parents.  When I think of my childhood I tend to think of all the fun I had and all the toys I used to play with, all the adventures I used to go on.  I tend to remember my brother fondly, and all the fun we used to have, although he now lives in America, and I haven't spoken to him in a very long time.
2	My mom is entj and my dad is estp \n\nMy mom always encouraged me to be more academic and intellectual, but as a person she is very cold and quite snobby/judgmental. Because of this, I think I probably pushed myself to learn more, but had some problems acting “like a woman” because it doesn’t come too naturally to me and she never taught me this/modelled this for me\n\nMy dad and I are quite similar and we get along well. He and I always bond over sports. I think because of him, maybe I have an easier time being outgoing when I want to
2	Emotionally absent ISTJ father and super-authoritarian ESTJ mother. I was the only child, and I routinely got a lot of shit for not doing chores, among other things. I think that's why I have a tendency to feel inherently flawed. 
1	Is there a questionnaire to do a mbti assessment/guestimation on someone else you know well?\n\nI can't guess types very well but I think I could guess my family members answers.

14	How are ISTPs like in a relationship?	I will keep this short.\nI tried to break up with an ISTP I was into because I thought he wasn't into me like that. He's slow in texting back (replies others though), openly going out on dates with other chicks, doesn't show affection for me.\n\nOddly, when I initiated the break up he rejected it. I always thought we were FWBs and I was just his plaything. But he told me I was more than that and wanted us to date. \n\nEventually I agreed to give it a shot, suddenly he's very sweet. He calls and texts often to check in on me, tells me he misses me and even plan dates. I used to ask him out but he's never free. He also hugs and kisses me when we're out and he's a lot more comfortable speaking out about his emotions and even feeling vulnerable. \n\nI'm just wondering if you guys are the same in relationships? Usually he's what I would describe best as a robot, I'm overwhelmed by the sudden inflow of affection. Not complaining though. 
31	[deleted]
24	Once you've been put into a different category, you're privy to affection and not just interaction. This is how we operate. Before it was undefined so he treated you as an aquaintence. Now that he has made his intentions clear and you have accepted them, he's ready for a full relationship. Be prepared though, when the honeymoon period wears off, there may be a significant drop in physical or emotional affection for a bit
14	I’m married to an ISTP. I think ISTPs tend to be not great at expressing or reading feelings. It’s possible he didn’t realize that was an option with you two. The also tend to be all or nothing in terms of relationships so it makes sense why he would suddenly be Mr. commitment.
6	We usually go all in at some point.
7	*God,* yes. \n\nOnce we are confident you care about us and we care about you and yeah okay we are OFFICIALLY mutual in the feefee's department, I'm pouring all my affection on you and getting doe-eyed and disgusting be prepared. \n\nSomeone else commented he might not have known that it was an option before? And uh, thats painfully accurate. You should just ask him what was up, because we do well with criticism and blunt questions. Its not going to be offensive. \n\nBe considerate, be blunt with each other. don't assume the worst, always always always communicate, always. Be honest, trust, ect. Never be afraid to ask questions but never be afraid to say what youre feeling either. Good luck to you both! 
4	Hahaha yes. 
4	Yeah, they're very affectionate when they decide on you. They'll also tell you things they won't tell anyone else, they'll share mundane parts of their day with you, they'll let you in on their random thoughts. It's like having a smart best friend who will talk about anything with you and who isn't afraid to be mushy with you. Inferior Fe loves the warm displays of affection, but needs to feel safe with you for that, so it's something you earn over time. Once you're in, though, you're in. You'll become their favorite person and their go-to. Makes for a deeply intimate connection. It's awesome. Enjoy :')
3	Yeah im like that too 👍👍
3	They love very profoundly or not at all (there is no grey area). It will take a lot of effort, on your part, to carry the relationship through its dark periods by not taking offense to their sudden bursts of shittyness. 
3	https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/153262329552/500-days-of-summer-summer-finn-istp\n\nHere's your answer.
3	My ISTP will be doing his own thing all day everyday and then out of nowhere he will paw at me, tug at my pants or shirt when I walk by, wave his arms around to get my attention...and those are the signals the grumpybutt wants attention/affection and I pounce on him. \n\nThey are quite cuddly :)
2	Sounds about right! I usually take a while to "catch up" to someone's feelings/intentions, but once we're both on the same page I'm all in. 
2	For me.. everything in life is a light switch. I'm either on or off. That in between part.. yeah.. just doesn't happen.
1	I'm married to one. He's very loving, lots of physical and verbal affection. He does sometimes bottle up his feelings, but that tends to be around work related stuff. \n\nHe can be a little blunt when he thinks that's I'm overreacting about something, but it's only because he wants me to stop stressing and overanalyzing. \n\nHe is very generous with his time and does lots of things for me that I hate doing (like going for an oil change). \n\nHe likes alone time to recharge his batteries, but so do I. 
82	Where is my ISTP?!	
5	Best description of our kind, it's only missing the rubber glove snap that a doctor does before they are about to examine you.
5	I don't get it, is he cheating the second girl or something?\n\n\n\nEdit: Got the joke already, thanks.
2	*insert those are rookie numbers meme here*
5	I scored 8 out of 60 on the The Empathy Quotient, is this typical for an ISTP?	I'm just learning about my personality type and I took the EQ test:\nhttps://psychology-tools.com/empathy-quotient/\n\nTo see where my emotional intelligence is and was shocked with the results. I expected as ISTP it would be low but it's significantly lower then people with autism/aspergers. \n\nHave any other ISTPs taken this questionnaire and would you mind posting your scores and experience with empathy?\n\nEdit: my dyslexia flipped the title around I got 6 out of 80. 
15	I got 15 \n\n>Scores of 30 or less indicate a lack of empathy common in people with Autism or Asperger’s Syndrome.\n\nWow that's great
11	Twenty six. I am far more autistic than that.
11	lol. Anyways the test is retarded and of no value. The questions are vague, and the options for answers don't really fit. There are quite a few that I would answer something more neutral. I wouldn't take any merit in anything this says, as evident by the fact that it's trying to tell us we are all Autistic with Asperger's. \n\nYour Empathy Quotient score was 28 out of a possible 80.\n\nScores of 30 or less indicate a lack of empathy common in people with Autism or Asperger’s Syndrome.
5	I got 37. \n\nThat seems really high in comparison to everyone else. Did I do a good job developing my Fe then? 
4	This test is probably bullshit.
4	11- not quite zero fucks.
3	I got a 14.  I'm feel really great about myself today. :/
2	27. And I thought I was too empathetic :/
2	21, and I thought I was empathetic. \n\nEdit: Did the autism test for sh*s & giggles, result was this:\n\n>Your score was 29 out of a possible 50.\nScores in the 26-32 range indicate some Autistic traits (Aspergers Syndrome).
2	 I got a 49 out of 80. Though I think I might be in an Fe rut at the moment. 
1	Without having seen the test I'd say yes. I can't really do empathy myself, so I guess I'd score quite low.\n
1	9 out of 80. Seeing a trend here. 
1	I got an 18, what does this mean??
1	Got 32.
1	I got 13, but that doesn't really surprise me
1	infj here, (wanted to check out this sub because we share all the same functions and i don't know any istp's) i got a 68, which was *slightly* lower than i expected, so maybe the test is flawed?
1	I took the test when it was previously mentioned in this sub, I got 15.
1	38
1	8 - also scored low on asperger's test
1	46/80
5	Istps and commitment	I have been reading ISTP descriptions and they all seem to talk about ISTPs not liking long term commitments. \n\nMy ISTP partner is very committed and long term.  He isn't impulsive with relationships and doesn't ever waver from this. He doesn't have flings and only likes long term relationships.  He even stayed with an ex after she cheated because of his very strong family values. \n\nDoes this seem ISTP to you? \n\n\n\n
31	Commitment isn’t the issue. Loss of freedoms is. If he feels like he hasn’t lost any freedom by committing to you, then there’s nothing stopping him. \n\n\nPlus we hate change. 
18	I feel like my whole life is spent deciding which one I hate less, commitment or change.  
13	He stayed with an ex.....\n\nAre we using the same dictionary?\n\nAnyhoooooo. Speaking for myself, once I make a commitment, I am committed. If the terms change, and it’s not of my doing, I will reevaluate. If at that point the nature of the commitment is unacceptable I am out with no regrets.\n\nI think I am more dependable than the people around me. But I suppose everyone thinks the same.\n
4	I’m extremely committed in committed relationships. \n\nTo the point of extreme personal detriment in the past. \n\nSo I really don’t do monogamy anymore. 
2	Yes! Same here...
2	I don’t follow the no commitment thing. Never had a problem with it if I felt understood by the other party. \n\nMeaning: Do they want ME for ME? If yes, that goes a long way. 
2	I'm like this too. I'll try to make a relationship work no matter what if I see value in it. Commitment isn't a problem at all.
23	Fluctuating Productivity & Motivation	Does anyone else struggle with large fluctuations in their motivation and productivity? One day I will be extremely motivated to get shit done, while other days I will be completely apathetic and careless.\n\nI've noticed that this makes it extremely hard to stick to routines. Once I hit those unproductive days, sticking to the routine takes incredible amounts of willpower, but that's also a finite resource. Usually my routines get wiped out once I reach a day where I'm feeling apathetic *and* my willpower is drained due to another obligation (big project at work, have to do chores today, etc).\n\nI'd like to work along with my personality, not against it, so I've started assessing how I actually feel that day and assigning work appropriately. It doesn't make sense to expect the same amount of work from days I'm feeling apathetic. This has been very effective compared to routines of rigorously scheduled output, and I feel less guilt.\n\nDo any other ISTPs experience this large fluctuation and how do you manage it?
17	Yup. Fifty years old and still struggling with this every day.   ISTPs are driven by what is interesting not by what should be done.  That’d be ISTJs. \n\nMotivation is the toughest one of all. \n\nFirst of all, you are completely normal.  This happens to everyone. It isn’t an ISTP thing.   The key is how you manage this, not that it happens.  My INTJ wife laughed at me when I tried to explain that motivation is easier for her. \n\nCouple of things:\nStart keeping a list of things to do.  Knowing all of what you have to do makes it less intimidating because you have a level of control. On under motivated days you can pick the stuff you might realistically get done.  Even if you can’t be stuffed making a new list, you have yesterdays list. \n\nOn a similar note, start doing something, anything. Make it something simple and enjoyable and you may just get into a rhythm and keep going.  \n\nMeditate. Look around for some meditation videos and put time aside every day.   Yoga Nidra is cool. \n\nAsk yourself why you aren’t motivated. Articulate it clearly. Are you stressed, overwhelmed, not enjoying the work, tired, hungry?  Be specific. I often have “oh shit” moments when it becomes clear. \n\nGet a job you love, where people appreciate your work. Yeah, I know, easier said than done but it works. \n\nThere is no simple answer, but you can learn to manage it 
3	Routines are istp kryptonite.\n\nMake as few appointments as possible. Say it with me: “I’ll swing by when I’m in the neighborhood.”
2	Oh yeah all the time. I often start things and never finish. Moving on to the next thing. Impulse. The cycle repeats itself. I've heard someone say that you could try making the task smaller? A little bit is better than nothing. Doesn't work for me though.\n\nI find that someone doing an activity with me helps. \nLike if someone ask me to do something I dont want to do, I won't do it. But if you ask me to help you, I'll get it done.\nI hate going to the store, so I bring someone with me to keep me distracted lol.
2	Key is breaking everything down into steps and choosing what steps to work on. \n\nI enjoy having 50x different things to do, make a Google calendar of important deadlines or commitments, and do a little bit of everything or a lot of something for the moment. \n\nA study I read said people are only productive about four hours out of an eight hour day. Less pressure to do stuff when I know everyone is lazy. Animals even behave this way.  Least effort for the most reward. 
2	Yes. I have to negotiate with myself so I can do things.\n\nConscientious me: You need to do your homework. How about we do homework for thirty minutes without getting distracted and then you can do what you want for the next hour.\n\nLazy me: Hmm... sounds pretty good, you've got yourself a deal.\n\nIf either one of you breaks, you have to punish yourself. You must maintain honesty and mutual respect in this arrangement, otherwise you cannot accomplish anything. That's a trick I've learned from the book *[12 Rules For Life](https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021)*, which I find to be very helpful in getting myself off my lazy/unmotivated ass.

9	I'm smitten by an INTJ but I think mostly because she's so private and "mysterious".\n\nI get the feeling if I were able to date her I'd get bored - through no fault of her own.
6	I dont know any intjs, and we'll probably get along as long as theyre not a Te asshole. I am intrigued by my infj friend, she is an enigma slipping in and out of and gracing my life with her company . Yet I feel like i can completely trust her. Such is the way of the infj.
3	I (INTJ) am dating an ISTP.  I annoy her all the time.  :)  
3	I adore INTJs head on “I can be whatever I want to be” personality but sometimes they will step on other people and not realize how shitty that is. They’re very ambitious and actually competent but they can be a bit dense. I’m still not sure if they truly don’t realize how they can affect other people or if they’ve just become masters of ignoring it. Either way they are great in short doses but can be exhausting to deal with on the daily. Especially once their schticks lose their charm.\n\nINFJs can be stuck in their fantasies. It seems like they can be so exhausted with the real world that they may delude themselves into thinking “this can’t be it I know there’s more for me.” I get that outlook but they can take it to the extreme. They can be hard to get to know because they just don’t want to share that much and if they decide to share it’s too late. It’s sad to see them take all their problems by themselves. I kinda relate a bit as ISTPs tend to do this too but when I really can’t handle something I will ask for help.
3	There are three people that I know are INFJs, three that are INTJs and one who says that he’s an INFJ but I don’t believe him. I actually think he’s an INFP. \n\nThe INFJs are lovely. They stress me out sometimes because we have the same functions but in a different order. But generally I tend to get along with him. I can never be nearly as punctual, focused or organized and “intuitive” as them but we still enjoy each other’s company because there’s some other things we have in common. But if you have religious, political differences, then god forbid you ever get into a debate because INFJs don’t budge, and well, neither do ISTPs.\n\nThe INTJ females I love. Both incredibly smart. I have great conversations with them. The INTJ male is I think a but unhealthy and I don’t quite like him. He is arrogant, opinionated, selfish. Then again, who knows, maybe that’s just him and it has nothing to do with MBTI.\n\nThe INFJ and INTJ girls have always been helpful and I value their opinions and perspective on shit. 
2	I know two infjs. \nOne is more of an aquaintance, I don't like her very much because to me she always came off as somewhat fake and judgemental. The other one is a college friend, I like her, her organized nature usually pulls me back into reality, she's good at reading people and I can ask her anything and her responses are very detailed and to the point. Other people seem to think I'm nosy when I ask them for details. She doesn't ever annoy me really. She has iniciated our friendship and told me she liked me, I appreciate that sort of thing. We both share heavy introvertedness but she's active on facebook whereas I'm not. We complement each other.\n\nI think I might have met an INTJ in the past, I didn't know how to respond to him, I think he was testing me or something. Very weird guy.
2	I have two really good INFJ friends. They are probably some of the nicest, chillest, most genuine guys I know. I love talking to them about feelings when I do get in the mood. They never annoy me but I'm pretty hard to annoy.  
2	My brother/best friend is an INFJ. We agree on 95% of stuff and get a long really well. We argue maybe once every 3 years or so? 
2	One of my best friends is an infj. 
2	Am usually attracted to intj's because adorkable. Alway unattracted to them because they tend to be chronically assholes, as i had to learn the hard after a nasty break up with one. \nskewed values on convenient over the practical pissed me off and disgusted me beyond belief. and intj that can be self critical is not one i have met yet, and until then, i dont want anyone like that anywhere near me. + the giant egos and stupid ideology that "ive thought so much about everything therefore no one can possibly know anything i dont, i know everything," is fucking stupid and so self deluded. Its the funniest thing when they proven wrong because of this, and they just cannot make sense of it, even if it was over something simple. My god. \n\nINFJ\ni havent met enough mature and IRL infj to give a good objective stance on them yet. the most i have met are extraordinarily immature and self centered with their emotions and view points, i do not like how many of them think they know how i feel and who i am, and act as if they do, its beyond invasive and egotistic and deluded. \nI have met two that do value REAL facts and values though, so theyre out there. and there are mature infj that will listen and consider people, i would like to meet more of them. \none thing ive consistently noticed is that theyve got trouble talking about something unless they start the topic and ???? man, please take a moment to think about something that isnt you for just one second please. \n\nI generally wont get along with anyone who values their feelings and opinions over real facts and objectives though, or people for that matter. \n\nTLDR: not too good experiences and times with them. 
5	Westworld and other shows in general	I'll try to be vague to protect spoilers.\n\nMy istp and I (intj) just finished watching Westworld and it sparked an interesting conversation about what it is we liked and didn't like about it.  At the start he was super excited about where the story was going because of the fun premise but by the end was put off by the shift to heavy philosophical themes and megalomania.  In this way he liked the show but finds it over rated.  (I don't disagree but as an intj I'm obviously going to be biased towards well executed grand plans of the world domination variety.)\n\nComparing this to Firefly, he thinks Firefly is a better show (actually hands down his favorite show so I secretly take pride in introducing it to him) with all of it's rough edges because the characters live normal lives where they must deal with the chaos that everyday life throws at them.  Each character has an endearing personality with random quirks, something that he feels was lacking in Westworld.\n\nSo my question is, do you guys generally agree with his line of thinking?  If you've seen Westworld, what did you like and dislike about it?  Any characters you liked/hated (and why)?  What kind of shows do you like, any favorites?
13	I'm istp\n\nI thought Westworld was one of the best shows I've seen, period.\n\nHaven't seen firefly though
3	I really liked Westworld(as did my INTJ GF). I think the only thing that bothered me about it was how unclear they were about the rules of the universe inside the park.\n\nLike, when Maeve dies and her "body" is taken to the lab to be cleaned and repaired. Does that mean her character just isn't a part of the next days events? Are we seeing repairs/cleaning happen when the park is not open? Wouldn't characters constantly being taken out of the park when killed really mess with some of the greater story lines within?\n\nWonder if anyone else had issues with this?\n\nThat's just one example of one of the things that my brain sorta had trouble with. just had to ignore the logical inconsistency and enjoy it anyway. \n\nBut to answer your question I did not personally find it pretentious but its understandable another ISTP might. Your explanation of why he liked Firefly is really good. Makes me wonder if I have enjoyed particular episodic shows for similar reasons. 
2	Yes Firefly is great, loved it and rewatch it regularly.  I also loved the way Westworld started but by the end of the season it was just alright. I have the same problem with many scifi series though. The first handful of episodes tends to be great then they have to stretch the story. 
1	Westworld was good, but overrated in my eyes. GoT is most definitely my favorite show
19	Acquaintanced	Junior in High school here and I feel like i’m an acquaintance with everyone around me. I tend to just live in my head and not interact with people outside of school/sports. I have a decent amount of people that I talk to on a regular basis, i just have zero interaction with anybody after school hours. Its not even that it bothers me, im perfectly fine with being left alone. But i also feel like i am being left out and not experiencing everything that i potentially could.\n\nI got off to a terrible start freshman year - surrounding myself with new people and kinda throwing away (more like distancing) all my childhood friends - Just for my new best friends to end up transferring to a different school. Now im left in the dark wondering if this is normal or not for an istp to just “hibernate” and leave everything rolling around them.\n\nThis school year was the first time that I kind of went on “damage control”. Interacting with a lot more people and trying harder to make myself present on snapchat. Ive reduced my hours spent playing video games significantly, but now i just replaced that time watching click bait on youtube and programming.\n\nIm looking for advice and maybe some tips from personal experience, or even just general discussion.
19	That pretty much sums up my high school experience. 
6	Try out of school clubs? I was part of an anime club at local library where I met some people from different high schools in the area. But honestly just roll with what makes you happy. Once you graduate highschool youll realize how many people you were only friends with just because you saw each other everyday. College is a lot better for making long lasting friends.
5	I experienced this in college. Spent about a year and a half in total isolation. And then I lucked into some new friends from my work. \n\n\nSo the only advice I can really give is.... get lucky. 
4	I had a lot of friends during my Freshman year, but ended up transferring to another High School for my Sophomore year. I rarely ever talked to my classmates, I just felt like an outsider the whole time. I wasn't part of any after school activities or anything and didn't go to any games or dances. I kind of regret not being more open to other people, but at the same time, I wouldn't change anything because I wouldn't be who I am.\n\nI luckily met a group of like minded classmates. Basically the weirdest mixed bunch of kids that you could think of. But we all had a similar hobby, video games. We used to hang out a few times a week and just play split-screen Halo, go to the park and play football/basketball, or literally anything that we could do together.\n\nThere's no need for 'damage control'. Don't force yourself to fit in with other people. You'll only feel worse. Social media wasn't as prevalent as when I was going to High School, so things can be much different now.\n\nIt's hard to get away from childhood friends, but it'll happen. I don't think I talk to any of my friends from growing up. People grow up differently and change.\n\nI think the best thing to do is to find people with similar hobbies and interests as you.
3	I lost all of my childhood friends right before high school and had a similar experience early on. I did wind up making a few close friends after awhile, though.\n\nMy advice, join a sports team or club, somewhere you're forced to interact with people and can't just bounce when you're disinterested. You'll match up with someone eventually.\n\n
2	Maybe you should join some clubs that you're interested in to find people with similar interests. But there's nothing wrong with just keeping to yourself. You only go to high school once though.
2	whatever you enjoy doing, like gaming, find other like minded people. More importantly, find people who have interesting perspectives on things you enjoy doing. It'll be more fun to "think" about in your free time. You'll be left a bit tired from interacting with people, but I've been super happy with the thought provoking perspectives from my peers. I cant emphasize enough, read a lot! I'm reading ready player one haha...
2	When I was in high school I rarely did things with people outside of school unless I had a girlfriend (off and on sophomore year, all of junior and senior years). The girl was usually the one responsible for that. Though Junior and Senior year I did have 2 friends (who happened to be a couple) that I spent a lot of time with even if I wasn't with my girlfriend.\n\nI can say I definitely felt like I knew everyone, and everyone knew me, and we where all friendly, but I wasn't someone people would think to ask to do things. I think my whole life has generally felt like that (I'm 32 now). I generally feel like people think they can't approach me, and I've never really understood why. They all think I'm the nicest guy ever and such a great person.\n\nIt doesn't really bother me, but I do notice it. \n\nThis was right before cell phones became such a mainstream thing, so that probably played into it too. \n\nI'm going to give slightly different advice. Find people that make you happy. Don't just look for people that have similar interests. Find people you can enjoy talking to, and be open to do different things. We (ISTP's) often tend to not want to do things, but if we do them we'll enjoy them (because we aren't judgemental, we just enjoy things for what they are). It's just getting out of your head enough to go do it. Some of the greatest people I've know that I've had the most enjoyable relationships with are people I have very little in common with. 
1	I experienced similar: feeling not important yet not insignificant, just not the first go-to person for 99.9% of everyone. Find what you like to do and the people along the same interest. Best thing is to find a drive. From experience, when I'm not doing, everything degrades.
13	Going out	I stumbled across [this](https://i.imgur.com/2VSbmDk.png) today. Do you guys "go to every single one"?  I often find it hard to motivate myself to go to social events. I normally have a great time if I end up going (my fiance, an ENFP, tends to drag me out of the house), but finding that initial nudge to do stuff with friends is often hard.\n\nJust curious how other ISTPs react to social events.
9	It depends what the event is, but I usually try to go if I think that it's something important to a friend that I show. If some acquaintance invited me to something, I wouldn't feel as obligated(Maybe if there's cake and booze involved I will be more enthused). The older I get, the more I'm learning to say no to people and take care of myself/time first, even if they haven't asked me anything at all(like making homemade chicken noodle soup and other kindly gestures).
6	I don’t socialize.\n\nWhen I was younger I told myself I’d go and have fun. It was more like work and very draining.\n\nNow I’m old enough to know better, and people know not to ask me to go.\n\nLife is good.
7	This is too simplistic, it feels like there needs to be more of this to explain the context of this article. Just by itself, I can't agree.
5	I’m pretty much the same way. I usually have fun, but I have to be dragged out to have it. 
3	If I'm friends with the person, yeah I'll try to make it to every event. I might not make it to all of them because I'm busy or sometimes I just don't really feel like leaving the house but I learned that I have fun when I do go out so sometimes I just need an extra push.\n\nIf it's a coworker or acquaintance then no, never.
2	Not really into socializing outside of my one friend I play online games with and my wife. As a couple we do things a lot, but as far as involving other people or having any sort of friend group that's a negative. I like not having hardly any friends. Gives me so much peace and quiet as well as a lot less bullshit to worry about in life.
2	I usually dont go to events.
1	I'll usually go if I'm able to, yeah. Reminding people you exist is important. I didn't used to, but I got tired of feeling left out of stories and whatnot. 
8	Insecure about my ISTP boyfriend	I just wanted to ask how are ISTPs in a longer relationship and do you (other partners) occasionally feel “not that cared for”, yet it would be the norm? \nSome facts:\nESTJ(f) dating ISTP(m)\n- We have just started dating recently (3 months), but have known each other for ages (reasonably good friends)\n- Neither of us very romantic, but I know I am much warmer with words and actions in general - I tend to be the one who suggests calls first, initiate conversation topics etc.\n- we are a long distance relationship, which I am aware can contribute to the fact he seems a tad colder (can’t give much physical affection through the webcam can he)\n- yet I feel like his excitement and effort has gone down\n- he doesn’t talk that much anymore - it’s not uncomfortable silence or anything, but possibly getting bored of me?
17	The only person that knows what an istp is thinking is the istp . Best thing is to talk things out with him. If you don't voice your concerns, he will never know. And then when you do, let him think for a while. We need time to think.\nThe same way you are reaching out to reddit is the same way you should reach out to him. It takes time for an istp. Just give him time. Relationships take time, 3 months is still the start. \nThere are so many possible paths that could happen so just be mature and go with the flow. 😎
11	Hi there ISTP 20m here, \nFeeling fairly confident that the main reason he’s appearing to talk less is the distance.\nI think closing that distance is the best course of action.\nAnyone else ?
9	Hiya. Firstly, I would say this doesn't seem to be something overtly related to ISTP; rather, I would suggest that a long distance relationship and the length of that relationship are the main factors here. Interest/attraction can definitely wax and wane, and 3 months is a while to go if that's really only over the internet. You don't get the physical part of a relationship and everything that goes with it.\n\nLong distance is difficult. Relationships need effort and maintenance to begin with; make that long distance and it gets exponentially more difficult. You've noted that neither of you are very romantic, so I would hazard a guess that you aren't expecting grand romantic gestures or anything like that. You sound frustrated that you have to initiate a lot of things; he may not realize your desire to call/talk. Do you happen to know what yours, and his, love languages are? If one of yours is talking/communicating, and he has others, it may not even occur to him that that's important to you. Conversely, if one of his love languages is spending time, he might just be happy to be there on a call with you, without talking. (I highly recommend reading up on love languages! It's helpful to understand how you and your partner express love and affection for each other, so you can know how they like to show- and get- affection.)\n\nOne of the ISTP things you may have picked up on is that, as you mentioned, the silence isn't an uncomfortable silence. I know that I and my SO are both very happy with comfortable silences; if your SO is such an ISTP, he may not realize that you're not comfortable with silence. Tell him! Which leads into my last comment...\n\nCommunication is so, *so* key. For any relationship- not just ISTPs! You may just want to start by bringing up that you'd like to talk to him more, or that you would love for him to call you more often. He will likely appreciate you being open about your wants and needs; especially considering it's so difficult to read things like that in a long distance relationship. As an ISTP though, talk to him, then back off and let him consider things and formulate his thoughts and figure out how he wants to do things or respond to you.\n\nReally, the main things are: communicate, try to understand how he shows his affection and how you want to be shown affection (and vice versa), and give him time and patience!\n\nSource: long, healthy, loving relationship with an ISTP ;)
21	Relationships are rarely worth much effort.\n\n-Every Honest ISTP Ever
5	istp here. rarely is silence related to boredom. try not to keep track about who does what more. enjoy the relationship and appreciate the time you spend together and journey that goes along with it. i do want to recognize your concerns and feelings and something that youll (likely) have to work through over time, hopefully with your ISTP SO. 
3	I hope someone comes in here with something positive or uplifting and also honest to say. \n\nI dated an ESTJ for several months, not that that really matters. When my apparent enthusiasm for the relationship had died down it was permanent. Especially when distance comes into play. \n\nMight be a normal ebb and flow for him. You say it’s only been three months. \n\nOr maybe this is how he acts when he’s comfortable. 
2	My ex of 3.5 years proposed a long distance relationship recently and I said I just couldn't do it. I really do love him, but I know that I wouldn't be content in an LDR. I need to physically see the person I'm dating, do fun stuff together, touch them, have sex. \n\nI don't think ISTPs are oriented for long distance relationships, because the primary ways we show we care (acts of service, physical touch) can't be done over the phone.\n 
3	That’s normal. I’m the exact same way right around the 2.5 to 3 month time frame. \n\n\nI wish I had more advice for you. My longest official relationship is 3 months... so I can’t really say how it Continues. But also a lot of my issue stems from depression as well. So I can’t really say if my issue is a personality thing or a depression thing. 
1	When my ESTJ bf feels neglected he tells me. Sometimes I get too caught up in my shit so\nI need to be reminded that someone gets worried about me.\n\nA lot of times I actually blurt out “Holy shit I forgot I have a bf” not because I did something nasty but because I always forget to reply and check up on him. That doesn’t really mean hes not a priority, I’m just an idiot.\n\nThe long distance thing is definitely taking its toll though. It’s really hard to bond just digitally.
1	Haha thanks :)
1	Thank you, this helped a lot.\nI hope you two work it out, distance really does suck.\n I did realise that, especially because he is not very much a “words of affirmation” person. I do not compliments necessarily, but just in general the fact that one would affirm their interest/ affection or any type of feeling through words.
2	Se	How do you activate your Se? I'm an INTP, and I'm having trouble doing that. I've done it a few times, but I'm having trouble figuring out how I did it. I kind of just thought "now" and tried to get myself to become present-oriented, but I can't remember how I did that. I tried not getting myself to focus on the past nor future and get out of my head, but that's where I'm getting stuck. I can't remember how I did that. I just remember entering a spontaneous, present-oriented mode where I could do whatever the heck I wanted with virtually no self-resistance.
5	Breaking your routine and having a new experience, exploring something new, and having an exciting hobby are all different ways of activating your Se. It's basically when you don't have any previous information to rely upon and you have to focus on the present moment to process input as it's coming in.
3	It's It's not something you can turn on or off, it's simply your thought process. 
2	INTP's don't have Se in their function stack, they have Si. \n\nAnyways I use my Se by doing stuff...working out, going outside, concerts/bars, skiing, etc. I experience new things that will keep me focused on the present moment. Going outside for a run is something I do when I'm stressed and it's a perfect example of one way I use Se.\n\nI don't plan long term, I don't have a schedule (other than work). \n\nSi is the opposite, it is more past-oriented and prefers to have a schedule. 
1	It's natural. Wish I could turn it off sometimes.
1	Play sports. Visit a theme park and get on thrill rides. Take dancing classes. Party. Ask your Se friends to help you pick up new clothes/hairstyles, etc., etc. 
1	As a fellow INTP (who ALSO checked out this sub for advice on extraverted sensing), getting into cooking and baking was helpful for me. I assume it's quite individual (what works, what doesn't), but it's kind of awesome to know how to prepare almost anything that one would like to eat. I'm a fat-ass in mind :3
1	Lol
21	ISTP trying to make friends	
7	Lol
5	I am a ISTP gang$ta who doesn't need friends or relationships. I'm so stoic & cool. I wear sunglasses in the winter while wearing my trench coat & carrying my Katana. Emotions are for the weak 😎 👉 
1	One time I made friends in hs by just saying "want to be friends?" they were like sure, and then we were friends
1	Be an INTP\n\n\nJoking just talk to people til someone sticks
6	Have I been mistyping as ISTP? Here's a giant wall of text.	I posted a very similar thread to /r/INFJ and got exactly one response. I would appreciate some people reading this from an ISTP perspective and see what, if any, of this you find relatable.  \n  \nIn short, I've been typing as ISTP for years, but I'm suspicious that may have been due to bad habits learned from years of depression.  \n  \nINFJs and ISTPs have remarkably similar patterns in cognitive functions.  In some ways I think that makes them more similar than INTJs and INFJs, even though they share the same primary cognitive function.  \n   \nISTPs and INFJs:  \n1. Share the first four cognitive functions, just using them with different priorities.  \n2. Both enjoy the hell that is the NI TI loop. (...hooray!)  \n3. Both have strong powers of Fe (whether the specific ISTPs actually choses to use this, on the other hand, is another matter.)  \n   \nDepending on the development of the ISTP or the INFJ in question (and how comfortable they are using their third and fourth functions) I believe they can interact on nearly identical wavelengths.  There's nothing quite like having a conversation with someone where very few words are actually spoken, yet there is deep comprehension between both people.  However, while I’ve typed myself as ISTP for a very long time, There’s always been a feeling that something’s not quite right.  Not from type stereotypes like, “All ISTPs are Clint Eastwood,” but more because there are so many areas I can't relate with most ISTPs I meet.\n    \nMy background, which I believe complicates matters:  \n1.  My parents were both Ni first function users.  My dad was an INTJ- my Mother, an INFJ.  I believe it is possible for extreme exposure to a cognitive function from both parents can cause early development of a third or fourth function.  I'm not sure this always results in healthy development of that function, though.  \n2.  I had a childhood in which I had to, "Walk on Eggshells."  While no one was physically abusive to me, I did HAVE to learn how to read one of my parent’s moods, who didn't wear his moods on his sleeve.  If I misjudged someone's current mood, it could result in hours of shouting while I stayed silent and tried to be stoic.  This started around age 8. If this isn't motivation to use Ni and Fe together, I don't know what is.  \n3. I was a very happy-go-lucky child. While I always lived a vivid, internal life (introversion), I also wanted to make all the friends- with strangers, With older kids, With kids that were different from me. I befriended the severely mentally handicapped kid in kindergarten and was the only one who could understand what he was saying. I thought he was lonely. This also made me a target for bullying. While no-one ever physically bullied me (more than once), I was pretty endlessly teased as a kid for being, “Too Innocent,” for my age. \nThis had a profound effect on me.  I remember the exact moment at the age of 10 when I decided to be more like my grandfather (an ISTP if ever there was one.)  Stoic, seemingly mechanical to the outside, "Cool," and emotionally detached?  This sent me into what I can only describe as the worst 12 or so years of my life.  I succeeded in bringing out these qualities to the extent that someone looking at me from the outside would see those qualities.  My friendships dropped like flies, until the only thing I was interested in was being alone and spending time on the internet.  This scared the shit out of both of my parents.  My dad would panic that I was no-longer interested in meeting new people and no-longer friendly.  This made things at home worse.  LET THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP BEGIN!  \n4.  Part of this depressive state, I think, was heavily dependent on Ti.  What else makes you seem traditionally, "Cool," and calculated to the outside world?  Logical detachment.  Abstract logic.  If ever there was a time to develop Ti in the extreme, my teenage years could have been it.  \n5.  Even in this depressive state, I would describe my personality as a constant duality.  What I always deemed my, "Childlike," personality, the one who wanted to risk vulnerability and connect to people, was always there.  This was also the side willing to take the risk of using intuition without proving what I believed.  It surfaced rarely, though, and most of outward personality became the stoic, "Strong willed," ISTP stereotype.  \n   \nI first typed myself in my teenage extreme depressive phase where emotional distance was a survival tactic of my home life. I've been calling myself an ISTP for years due to my reliance on Ti.  I still rely on Ti quite a lot.  However, I've been fighting my way out of depression tooth and nail since I was about 22.  I'm now 25.  In the past few months, I've done some deep self-analysis and started cutting out parts of my identity I no-longer relate to and which were learned as defensive habits.  I’m removing the sharp edges. I've been getting rid of all the physical belongings that tie me to past identities.  I've re-evaluated much, including how I see myself and what my priorities in life are.  The effect of this is that that long, "Dormant, Childlike," personality is surfacing again.  I'm having to re-learn how I interact with people, but it's been extraordinarily rewarding not trying to keep everyone as far away as possible.  \n   \nMy Current Traits:  \n1.  The Ni Ti loop is very strong. I still have it.  It's not always destructive, but it can be.  My interactions with people are kind of a cluster-fuck.  The more people there are around, the more Ti, Ni, and Fe all go into overdrive together.  It's not just the endless possibilities for how what I do will affect the people around me. It's also how they will affect each-other.  I feel responsible for everyone's emotional well-being in a group setting, which used to be extremely overwhelming.  \n2.  As a result of this feeling of responsibility, and probably spawning from my childhood where being sensitive to others' emotions was critical, I believe I've become very manipulative.  Not in a malicious way, though? I can steer a conversation with a single person, or a large group away from sensitive topics several steps before the conversation reaches the sensitive point. I don't believe others are aware of me doing this.  When I was depressed, I used this to keep people at a distance and to protect myself from my parent’s moods.  \n3.  I present myself as extremely logical, though; this seems to be changing slowly.  What I'm not sure of: if I'm actually logical first, or if I intuit first and work backwards from that intuition with logic as a proof of what I believe.  I'll be watching this more closely to see.  \n4.  Other people are a VERY strong part of my daily thoughts.  I tend to be able to see things and make leaps that no one else around me seems to make.  I can make 80% (made up percentage) or so accurate profiles of how someone thinks within seconds of meeting them.  They're usually accurate.   I accurately predicted that a new co-worker was a drug addict within a minute of meeting him.  It was a year before anyone else caught on.\nAgain, I suspect this is some combination of Fe, then the Ni Ti Loop.  I pick up on something indescribable, and my mind then runs with it, building explanations of what and WHY until, to an outsider’s point of view, I've made a wild jump that is also completely true.    When I don’t trust these, “instincts,” I usually get hurt.  \n5.  I am actually very good at abstract logic.  (Ti)  I DO still build Ti abstract logical structures and test them against reality to see if they work.  They are, however, extremely malleable, and change the instant real world evidence knocks them down.  \n6.  I spend most of my time alone drawing these days.  However, when I do go outside to be with other people I've been making an effort to connect with them in a way that adds value to their lives; and mine.  Quality over quantity.  No small talk-allowed.  These days, I do my best to draw people into areas of conversation that will actually impact them. I find myself drawn to connect the dots for people who can't see their own needs. This is the opposite of what I was like as a depressed teen.  I'm using my "powers" for good instead of a giant, "Fuck off," neon sign.  \n7.  I am extremely sensitive to the people AND things around me.  I am a different person depending on the friends I’m around, and so I have to be careful who I associate with to keep being the person I want to be.  I have to be very careful about the movies I watch and the music I listen to because both can impact my mood substantially if they have bad vibes.  \nI would appreciate any help.  Most importantly, I’m interested in how your Ti works together with Ni and Fe to interact with others.  Do my experiences match anyone else’s?  \n\nTl;Dr  I’m sure this will be most of you.  The important bit is current traits I think.\n
32	Too much information and unnecessary background. You don't seem to be an ISTP. We tend not to write copious amounts of text as you just did. \n\nYou're neatly organized and your formating is on point. I didn't even read all of your post and probably most of us will do the same. \n\nTL;DR my opinion and wild guess: you're NOT an ISTP.
12	Number 4 and Number 7 don't sound ISTP-like.  ISTPs really don't have a naturally strong sense of people and if you read some of the other posts, they don't generally change their ways to accommodate other people.\n\nAs others have said, the long wall of text is unusual.  An ISTP would have written three paragraphs and thought "Nobody cares about this", deleted the text and canceled the post.
11	I disagree that you can't be wordy or elaborate at length if you're an ISTP. If you're interested enough in a topic, you can talk about it forever.\n\nThat being said, I can say you're more likely an INFJ from reading your whole post. \n\nDead giveaway is your ability to intuitively get a gut feel for who people really are. This skill is very common in INFJs. It's uncanny.\n\nNot so common in ISTPs, except for gut feel about how the immediate situation will play out in front of them, and what they need to do right now. Commonly used in video games these days, I'd imagine. \n\nISTPs are very reactive, they stay in the moment. INFJs tend to be proactive, they try and learn everything so they're prepared.\n\nMy 2 cents.\n\nE: Also worth noting, PoLR Te in INFJs, and PoLR Ne in ISTPs. 5th functions are often heavily used for work, so for ISTPs this often means their thoughts are well organised so others can understand them at work. Whereas, INFJs tend to want to appear organised due to Fe, but their efforts often suck eggs and is much less organised than they'd like to think due to PoLR Te in 7th position.\n\nSimilar situation for Ne in both types, but 5th for INFJs.
4	I don't even have to read the post. No ISTP writes or agonizes this much. You're an INFJ.
3	Damn this post and comments got me thinking I'm an INFJ ...... RIP
2	[deleted]
2	Definitely an INFx or INxx. I don't know. I have a hard time reading this because it's so theoretical-like; a big clue that you're not ISTP. I didn't read through the entire post. However, it does seem like you're stressed which can seem to contribute to this confusion about your MBTI label.
2	> Other people are a VERY strong part of my daily thoughts. I tend to be able to see things and make leaps that no one else around me seems to make. I can make 95% (made up percentage) or so accurate profiles of how someone thinks within seconds of meeting them. Very rarely am I wrong. I accurately pointed out that one of my friends had a crush on a different friend when they first started dating. This was months, however, before they admitted to anyone they were dating, as they were doing this in secret. This scared the hell out of both of them. No one else in our friend group noticed this. I accurately predicted that a new co-worker was a drug addict within a minute of meeting him.\n\nThis paragraph, to me, really suggests INFJ > ISTP.\n\nThe Ni doms I know (INTJ/INFJ) tend to make these kinds of predictions a lot. From my perspective they aren't always accurate, especially if they are predictions about myself, but, regardless, they seem very adamant they are true. I don't mind either way as they tend to be thought provoking and interesting.\n\nAlso I barely ever think about other people unless they are presently annoying me lol. It looks like you're probably an INFJ. Your parents both being Ni dominant is another thing. I have an ISTP Dad and I think a lot of my personality has been taken from him.
1	holy shit i think im an infj maybe too mistyped as istp!! thank god for this post. maybe idk
5	How can I help my depressive/anxious ISTP girlfriend? (ESFP)	My girlfriend (ISTP) and I (ESFP) have been together for over two years, we're having a lot of problems lately.\n\nA few months after we started dating she went to live to another country, we knew very well we loved each other, so we decided to keep the relationship. The distance wasn't nice, but we got used to it.\n\nRight when we started dating she confessed to me that she's depressive, and after some time I realized she had social anxiety. She's consious about both of these things, but she never had the motivation to get better.\n\nDoing things like going out for a walk or simply getting out of her bedroom are exhausting for her because she wants to avoid human contact at all cost and she has a serious problem in her legs which makes it painful for her to walk or make physical effort in general (another thing she doesn't have the motivation to fix)\n\nShe hates psychologists, she's afraid of being medicated by psychiatrists, and she's doesn't want to go to university right now.\n\nFor me, as an ESFP, it's really hard to understand her. She claims that our INFP and ISTJ friends understand her problems a lot better than me. Most of the times I try to help her I end up screwing up the situation and making her feel worse, I know that's because I use the methods that would help me in that situation, she has told me that I don't ask the right questions, that I don't need to know what's the problem or what's happening with her in order to help her, and other stuff that is really hard for me to understand or to apply in the actual situation. Even when I try to apply it most of the time it seems like I do it wrong.\n\nWhat can I do to help her? How can I make the relationship less painful for her and for me?
12	Words will never be enough. I dont like being told what to do. I suggest you fly to her asap and hug her! I dont need words, i like being hugged and cuddling with my intj ex made me feel better.
9	Agree with u/istp_girl. Silence and an engulfing hug. Don't try to understand what she is going through because most likely, having to explain herself is going to be exhausting as well.
5	How often do you get to see each other? Long distance is especially hard on ISTP\n\nShe doesn't need you to fix her, she just needs you to understand. If you try to pressure her to do things because you think they'll help her, it will make it worse. Ideally you'd be in a place where you could just do things with her that would help her, without it being viewed for that purpose alone, but just because it'd be a nice thing to do together. 
1	If there is something I love about ESFPs, it's their ability to spread fun and joy and how they gently encourage others to join in.  Its as though they are infectious.  However, when I'm depressed, I become completely devoid of fun and joy, I just want to lay in bed.  I can't say whether or not it's the same for your girlfriend.  A relationship should never be about changing or saving someone.  If you manage to change or save in the process, then great, but it should never be your goal because that puts pressure on the other person.  If there is anything that ISTPs don't like it's pressure, but ESFPs don't tend to be too pressurising anyway.  In the right circumstances you could make a great match.
8	started implementing this video's advice and saw results immediately. Don't grow your thoughts in a vacuum. ask other people what they think.	
5	How sad. Dave used to be insightful. \n\nThat was like watching Phantom Menace and wondering how things could possibly go so wrong.

7	What are your experiences with ENFP’s?	Hey guys, ENFP here. I was doing some reading on Socionics, and I found that our relationship is one of “Duality”, and I’m struggling to understand exactly what that means. So if any of you know/date/are friends with any of us, what have you gotten out of those interactions? 
9	I’m an ENFP and I follow this group because my husband is an ISTP. I think he keeps me from going off the deep end and I keep him from hiding in his man cave playing video games for the rest of his life. It is a struggle sometimes. I want to go go go! He doesn’t like to go. :)
3	Socionics ISTp is roughly supposed to correlate to MBTI ISTJ, so it doesn’t quite work the same.\n\nBut for me as an ISTP with ENFPs, I think it’s mutual respect, even if we are rather alien towards each other. I think they can be goofy and I think they think I’m blasé. \n\nI also had a massive crush on a self-declared ENFP a long time ago, which apparently was mutual, so there is that.
5	I’m also a lurking ENFP.\n\nISTJs are actually our duals, not ISTPs. I like ISTPs way more though, lol.\n\nIt’s a relationship that takes a lot of patience and understanding, but if it can be made to work it’s totally worth it. My favorite ISTP and I are just friends at this particular point, we’ve been more but no matter what happens we always end up in each other’s lives again. He keeps me grounded and watches out for me. I help him figure out his feels and bring out his goofy side. Our favorite pastimes include bong rips and CoD marathons. He’s also pretty handy when it comes to household projects I can’t seem to finish, and I’m always around to bail him out after a drunken bar fight. \n\nAlso, our people pleasing nature mixed with their ability to read every physical cue makes for some bomb sex. 10/10 would recommend. 
4	I’m following this thread with interest. My SO is an ISTP and my kid is EN(F)P. I’d definitely be interested in how this plays out in a parent/child relationship, but I can see that the primary functions conflict. My ENP kid is very prone to ‘what ifs’ and flights of fancy while my ISTP is soooo much more practically grounded. \n\nENP: I want a treehouse!\nISTP: That’s a good idea! We’ll have to draw plans, get materials, pick a tree...\nENP: *has already lost interest and wandered away*\n\nI can see where the dreaming/practical application thing could work in tandem well, but at least from what I’m seeing in these two it requires a lot of patience and understanding on both sides.\n\nI’d be interested to hear from ISTPs on this. 
3	They're ok. Sometimes a little too much perkiness for me, but they're good people.
3	Exhausting
5	IT'S ONE OF CONFLICT NOT DUALITY

1	I'm an ISTP with a bunch of ENFP friends. I think ENFPs are awesome, the first few minutes... I need a lot of space, and I dislike small talk, which is quite the opposite of an ENFP. However, once I got over the feeling of "these people passionate about everything must be crazy" and "Jesus, do they never shut up?" I learned to simply be real with them when I need space, and mock them a little for their "bubbliness" when it gets too much. It's cool you guys are so passionate. I imagine that you are having a hard time understanding when your SO needs space, so you should probably give them more of it. The fact that the person is spending time with you at all pretty much means they like you :D
6	Talking about feeling	I feel like ISTP fits me like a glove. However, there is one difference. Maybe im not an ISTP? I talk about my feelings with my partners to work out problems. Also, people who I don't view as close or connected to me in a strong way I'll use as a counselor and throw ideas off of them. However, my family I will not tell them anything about my feelings. Like, at all. So idk. I was raised by my mom who is always seeking counseling and sent me a lot from an early age. So maybe that conditioned me to be used to that sort of thing. Any thoughs?
12	I learned a long time ago that I'm terrible at reacting to my own feelings so discussing them with others is the best way to get an accurate "sense" of what I should actually acknowledge.
4	Your guess is better than any of ours, but, there is obviously a lot of variation in the people in this group. Its basically a nature vs nurture arguemnt and its obviously a combination of both. Personally, I can talk to girl friends about my feelings even though it is still difficult.  But, I could never talk to any of my guy friends about anything like that and Im assuming it is because I never talked to my dad about anything and he never asks, whereas, my mom does. So, like you said, its probably a conditioning thing where you feel comfortable doing it because you have been doing it since a young age.
3	Sounds exactly like me and I’m definitely ISTP as well. I’m always an open book with my girlfriend but for anyone else, they’d have to pry the feelings out of me and even then I probably would share it. But strangers that I don’t care about? I wouldn’t care about telling them either.

1	I don't think being istp means being emotionally constipated. I think maybe just more rational most of the time. But people are fluid, ya know. Feelings are mostly unreliable, but still mostly unavoidable. 
1	Environment plays a significant role, not just personality. Abusive or neglectful environments foster shutting down presence and vulnerability to not suffer anymore. There will be healthier ISTPs, who have developed their feeling and intuition early in life, if the environment encouraged this. Most will have to balance themselves out with experience or intelligence.
1	Sometimes telling strangers your feelings is easier than telling close ones. Maybe its because of the lack of attachment? What i say to them will be forgotten soon and i most likely wouldn’t see them again
6	Big 5 Correlations (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ISTPs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ISTP) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance!\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile INFJ results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.

18	ISTP women, how are you doing?	Yep, this thread is dedicated to the rare ISTP-woman. As for the female ISTPs who happen to be present, how do you relate to the male-centric ISTP-descriptions, and where do you differ? I assume you must come across as tomboys and thrill-seeking bad-girls (and anything else that defies the stereotype on what women are expected to be and act like), but I may be generalizing. Feel free to share your experiences on being who you are. 
32	Definitely don't agree with some the more extreme thrill seeking stereotypes. I like trying new things and adventures but life risking behavior isn't really my thing. \n\nOther than that most of the descriptions are pretty accurate, especially how ISTPs act in a relationship, which unfortunately makes dating very difficult as women are supposed to be the more emotional one. 
12	I relate to most of the descriptions, though I find a lot of them seem completely devoid of Fe. I care a lot about other people's emotions. I hate disappointing people and I want to make others happy. I'm really bad at figuring out my own emotions though. \n\nI can be a thrill seeker, but usually it's somewhat calculated. I have a tendency to downplay things, though.\n\nI'm attractive and try to look good (in the most low maintenance way possible) - so I definitely don't look like a tomboy. This usually throws people off because I tend to be into a lot of stereotypical guy stuff. I've gotten used to surprising people because my appearance doesn't seem to match my personality or interests. In college, I was told I looked like a sorority girl.\n\nI have no trouble making situational friends, but meaningful friendships are harder to come by. I think most people find me contradictory. 
9	Depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm a badass, sometimes I'm covered in mud and grit, and sometimes I'm covered head to toe in frilly pink and floral clothes. It's boring doing the same thing every day.\n\nI think I fit the ISTP description pretty well. I have a male energy about me, but also a strong feminine side. I feel like both male and female in my relationships. It just depends on how I'm feeling.
8	Yo :)\nGrowing up people me considered a tomboy. I hung around boys instead of girls because girls were annoying. I didn't like to wear girly things. Played baseball on and off for 4 years. In my preteen and teen years I mostly played videogames and messed around on the internet. I hate school. People that tried to befriend I pushed away. I looked down on my peers back then but now I'm cool and try to be respectful. I kinda almost regret not using school as a chance to practice my Fe because I'm mostly at home now. I was never rebellious because my mother is awesome and doesn't make me do things so in exchange I bring her no trouble.\n\nNow I'm married with no kids(don't want any), can't stick with a job and just chillin at age 23. I also don't mind wearing girly things anymore. Dresses, nail polish, romantic things and all that lol\nAlso I'm not obsessed with cars, tools, or sports.\n\nMaybe I'll go to college or something to help with my boredom and practice my Fe Idk...\n
8	Its hard to answer I think, at least in a second language. \nI've had, and still have more male friends than female ones. As a child the boys didnt really care that I was a girl, as long as I ran fast and were strong and could fight, lol. For them I was one of the boys.\n\n When I was 12 I started to look more punk/metal. I was athletic, but I wasnt a thrill seaker in a outdorsy way, I was more a thrill seaker in a "lets party with the satanists" and "we should just trigger the firealarm and run and see if they catch us" when I was a teen. \nA had a feminin period in my life for about a year, but that was as a 13 year old because of puberty and therefore insecurities. \n\nIm a city girl and have never really cared for cars and motors ecs, but stuff like solving puzzles and rubiks cube is right up my alley. \nI dont like talking about feelings, but have no problem talking about stuff that has happened. Im just talking about it like a fact,  because it is. I dont feel emotional inside or feel stressed about that. The only thing I dislike is that men often get the wrong signal and thinks im interested when Im just trying to be nice, and a lot of my male friends have made a move at parties,  and that just makes me sad tbh because Ive always felt like one of the boys,  but in those situations I see that Im clearly not. \nIve been the easy going friend that always have a weird story to tell. \nI like to look good ofc, but only natural makeup, nosering and black/dark clothes with leatherboots, lol. Now Im a mom, and life is weird but good. Im single because I really dont like the emotional and snuggly part in a relationship. I have been seeing a guy for 1,5 year but we dont want to be in a relationship and is free to see other people, and we meet maybe every other month, lol. Its perfect.

5	I don't really see myself as the "thrill-seeking bad-girl" type but I do like the occasional adventures. Absolutely not into extreme sports just because I know the danger in that. I'm fine with dying I just don't like to lose or damage any of my body parts.\n\nI love to be alone so much and I believe that I am the best version of myself when I am alone.\n\nI currently work at an advertising agency, under the data and analytics team. I like the work but in general I think my motivation for work is so I can fund my different hobbies. I like trying out and learning new things. I think my hobbies or obsessions will always be different every year. \n\nCurrent hobbies: Playing the ukulele, Video editing, tinkering around with the Arduino (programming and basic electronics), guessing the MBTI of people. \n\nI almost always wear black clothing but I do have floral and colorful dresses which I also wear at random times. \n\nThis is getting too long. 
8	Definitely want to come back and check out the answers here. ISTP is definitely a “male” type as far as traditional gender roles go. I’m really curious as to how the type looks on a chick. 
3	I don't mind the "male-centric" stereotype. I do come across as tomboyish but I act whatever way I want without gender restrictions. I'm friendly but very introverted, unstructured, sporty, a lazy nerd. I wear unisex clothing (blue/grey/black mostly), short hair, no make-up. I'm kind of a minimalist/essencialist. The people I get along with the best are: INFP, INFJ, ISTJ, they are very mature/thoughtful. I'm shit at socializing, nevermind dating.
3	I don't come across to anyone as a tomboy; I look pretty feminine. I do come across as a "thrill-seeking bad-girl" as you put it.. or a quiet bad girl with an adventurous/thrill seeking side.\n\nMost of the male centric descriptions are something I **CAN** relate to, ironically. They fit just the same.
24	What was something stupid you did recently?	I agreed to hang out with a chatty untrustworthy person.\nI also bought overpriced bananas because I didn't feel like saying 'no thanks' and buying them across the street.
27	Told my manager that I didn't really care about making more money during my annual review. Even if it's true, it was stupid to say.
22	opened myself up to people who don't give value to my (quite rare) emotions
19	I told my aunt about my switch vegetarian. \n\n\nI was trying to keep it under wraps for several reason. For starters, it comes with a stigma down south. Sometimes quite a heavy one. Second, I’m still new at it so idk if I can commit long term. And I don’t want to go blabbing about it if I can’t commit long term. And finally, I didn’t want any special treatment. I have a large family that gathers often for meals and I didn’t want any special decisions made for me. I’m a big boy and I can find something to eat. \n\n\nWell my aunt is also a vegetarian and she lives a thousand miles away. So I confided in her a couple months ago hoping to get advice and recipes as she’s a nutritionist. I was thinking *surely* she’s safe to tell. \n\n\nWrong. \n\n\nShe came in town a long with a bunch of of other family this week for a wedding and some family birthdays. Last night they were supposed to do a full BBQ meal for 20ish people. Ribs and chicken and the whole 9. \n\n\nWell turns out my aunt told my grandmother. So what’s she decide to do? Cancel the BBQ for everyone and order pizza. So now I’m the asshole who ruined everyone’s BBQ. and of course, once my grandma found out, it started spreading. So now my whole fucking family knows and is giving me shit for it. \n\n\nThis is the reason I don’t trust my family with anything. My brother is the only person i can talk to. Otherwise the little gossiping girls spread shit like wild fire. 
11	I can't seem to stop myself from getting into Internet arguments.\n\nIt's a waste of time, and nobody wins.
4	I openly disregarded my boss' advice in a meeting full of her peers...Apologizing was a bitch even though she's widely considered The Worst.
4	Too numerous to mention.\n\nI have a couple likely stupid things to post here, but they are overly complex. Basically they all revolve around my inability to communicate with women. 
5	I ran out of sugar and didn’t want to buy some so I went to Starbucks to steal a handful of sugar packets. But I felt bad so I ended up buying overpriced coffee which gave me a stomachache because my body hates coffee.\n\nHave you ever woken up from sleep because you sharted? Cause I did the next day and had diarrhea until the day after.\n\nTLDR; stealing sugar causes diarrhea
4	LOL to ‘overpriced bananas’. Man that was a good one. 
3	I ignored a bad tooth until it abscessed a second time. Seeing a root canal specialist next week. 
3	Debated the a quarter past 3 was 3:25 not 3:15 I was missing the key concept that a clock only goes to 60 minutes not 100 
2	[deleted]
2	I flew to Brunei for booty call I have never met before last weekend
2	Maybe not totally stupid but cut down (stole?) a Christmas tree from a freeway embankment in Michigan because all of the lot trees sucked
1	Not so recent but I'd have to say being born. I made a funny.
1	Cut someone off in traffic. To be fair, he wouldn't let me over, so he deserved it. 
1	Getting out of the car while my dad was handling the Austrian border guard/Police... Nothing bad happened tho.

18	talking yourself out of fun things.	do you ever have a hard time doing the things that you want to do because they arent practical? For instance, i need to buy a car and i can only have **one** car. Practicality says i should get something cheap, fuel efficient, and reliable... like a honda civic. but part of me really wants to get something cool and fun. i keep flip flopping between what is most logical, and thinking "whats the point if its completely boring???" does anyone else sometimes put themselves into a cage in this way?
8	Yea, but the answer to this dilemma to me is always either to find a middle ground. (ie. What's a cool and fun car that is *also* cheap, fuel-efficient, and reliable? ) or to just go with your heart. 
7	I’m too impulsive to lean towards practicality. That’s probably why I have 5 cars now..
4	I am very practical. I am also very impulsive.\n\nDoesn’t seem like those two things are compatible. I’m probably just kidding myself.\n\nIt may be most correct to say I am a cheapskate, both with money and time.
4	Yeah, I flip flop on things as well, though, I try to be mindful and catch myself doing it these days.  More recently it was about going to a starbucks or the university library to maybe write a page or two of my book.  The point of it was to get out of the house, but I found myself arguing the practicality of sitting at a place to write rather than sitting at home to write, and then cycling between either going the starbucks or the library--which ended with me not going at all.
3	Get a civic si or type r. Practical and fun. Although more pricey 
2	I am in the same boat. I really need to get a new car. I love driving and it's something I do almost everyday so part of me says I might as well get something fun but the other part says I should get a corolla. I think the fun side is winning just a little bit. 
2	How many motorcycles can you have?
1	Yes, practicality ends up winning. I tend towards minimalism. Luckily most good quality things have minimalistic designs.
1	[deleted]
1	I just wanted to upgrade CPU on my PC recently... ended up blasting over $3000 on new rig
11	Have you guys ever wondered why you care about MBTI?	I just saw a thread over in the MBTI subreddit asking which type was least likely to buy into MBTI as a theory. I was about to say as an ISTP, I wonder about it sometimes, but then I realized something. I don't actually have any issues with MBTI theory in general(Ive seen it work), as much as I just wonder why I care, sometimes. \n\nI only really got into it because I was looking for answers to some personal issues. Before that I wouldn't have looked at it twice. And while it has been interesting to look into over the years, sometimes I just feel like moving on and focusing on other stuff. \n\nWhen Im being honest with myself, I just dont see why I should bother with it. Id rather focus on other areas of life and it wouldn't serve much of a purpose. Sometimes I even feel like it does more harm than good, because I wind up over-analyzing social interactions, which I never used to put a ton of thought into. Yet, despite feeling that way, Im still here and I'm not sure why.\n\nAnyone else here feel the same or have a similar experience?\n\n
31	I always wondered why I acted and thought differently than most people. It was always hard for me to make and keep friends. I always came across as nieve and quiet. My friends felt like It was easy to lie to me, but I saw through every lie. This would prompt me to ditch them without a word of warning. It seemed I could always see a clear solution to a problem, or I was willing to fail several times in order to succeed. My classmates were never willing to seek out a more efficient solution, mostly due to stubbornness, fear of failure, and laziness. One thing that always bothered me was when teachers gave out written directions to a lab, but then felt the need to spend an hour explaining those directions, Just let us start already! \n So I always wondered if there was something wrong with me. Sometimes when I was young, I would hear my parents discuss if I had aspergers or autism or something. I'm certain I don't. I think it would have come up on my cat scans or something. I always acted differently around my parents though. They are good parents, but they are also authority figures in my life, so I never feel comfortable around them. My mother is a feeler. So she would try to understand my emotions, she would ask if anything was wrong, and I would answer with no, because the answer was actually no. This only made her think I was depressed or autistic, it seemed like she had a new theory every year. This sorta messed with my mind. If you hear something enough times you start to maybe..kinda ..consider it..\n When I took first myers briggs test back in my junior year of high school it really helped me. I didn't feel like there was something wrong with me anymore, I didn't feel lost anymore. I finally knew who I was. I started making solid friendships and I even took a girl to prom that same year. This spring I'll be getting my associates, and this fall I'll start working towards my bachelor's degree. \n I owe alot towards that myers briggs test. Because of it I was able to find myself. For all of you ISTPs that are still in the WTF years, it  is true what they say, it does get better, but what they don't tell you is that YOU have to make it better.\n\nSo to answer your question, I care about the myers briggs test because it helped me to understand myself better. 
12	I think its simply the human need to be included into a group. Humans are social creatures and the more groups you are included in and how similar you feel to the others in the group the better you will feel. So, its just an artificial group that makes people feel included because its based on certain personality traits. 
8	Yes i do wonder that, or did. I don't care too much anymore but it's nice to talk with like-minded people sometimes.
3	I'm self-centered and like to understand how I think and find ways to improve my mindset, I also want to figure people out in order to gain a sense of control. Mbti is based on soft science so that means it's kinda bs imo, but fun to play with.
3	I do, for sure. I hear people say these personality tests are like horoscopes for people who think they're too smart for horoscopes. Fair enough. However, the reason I subscribe to this sub is because my partner is ISTP. I've had lots of situations (some recently) where I wanted to help but I knew my natural reaction wouldn't be the right one for them. So I come here or other articles about how to communicate with/support an ISTP personality type and it's really helped! I don't love labels because they're never 100% but when used responsibly they can some times be useful. 
2	It helped me learn more about myself.  I don't delve too deep into it.
29	From your friendly neighborhood INFJ (please don’t gag ;) about my ISTP friend	
8	Yeah....thats us 
9	I like my onions sautéed
5	Know what else has layers?  Parfaits!  
5	U know what doesn’t have layers, this analogy
0	What class do you usually play in tF2?	Since ISTPs are naturals at repairing/fixing, I was wondering if there was a correlation between TF2 class and personality type. Personally I played Spy the most.
6	You're thinking of the wrong repair and fixing thing.\n\nWe like to deconstruct and reconstruct.\n\nI hate fixing things, I am good at it though.\n
4	Pyro and Engineer mostly!
3	Played Engineer for the majority of the time, but I'd play around with the other classes too.
3	Soldier if I felt aggressive and Engineer if I wasn’t.
3	Do people still play tf2? I played it a lot back in the day, but haven’t touched it for years.\n\nI always played whatever class my team lacked, which usually meant playing anything besides sniper or engineer, since those are very popular choices.
3	I love shooter games but i'm not really good at aiming, im not a noob, i've been playing for many years now and I like the strategic parts of a game a bit more than the straight up fighting. I'm not so good as spy but tbh I use engineer, medic, and pyro the most. Spy comes in at 2nd
2	Sniper and soldier. I’ve barely played though. CSGO was more my thing
2	Sniper and demoknight
2	ISTP Medic Main. \n\nI figured that most people here would main either Sniper, Spy, or Soldier/Demo because those classes have playstyles that attract high Se users in general (Scout and Pyro are the other classes that definitely tend to attract high Se users).\n\nIronically, I would not be surprised if most Medic mains are SJs.
2	Spy, soldier, medic
2	I have around 200hs on it, didnt play much, just when i was tilting in cs, i have like 100 hs playing spy, then id play Engineer or demoman 
1	Mained Scout and won Gold UGC like 3-4 years ago with some friends I met.
7	ISTP and dating	I met an ISTP 3 years ago and he has been working jobs in other states for the majority of the time.  We are not in a committed relationship, but we have both expressed that we don't see other people in a romantic form nor do we sleep with anyone else. His level of contact seems to wax and wan.  I have my own business and am pretty engaged in my own life so I don't look to him for continual contact.  Is it normal for ISTPs to go through spurts of calling and texting a lot and then backing off.  This cycle is on repeat and I just let him do his thing.  He has made it very clear that he does not like talking about feelings and that he isn't using me for anything.  I don't ask for clarification regarding his feelings.  As I recognize that I have choice in the matter to either continue or walk away.  I guess my question is simply this:  Is it fairly normal for an ISTP to not need constant contact and still feel strongly for you?  He definitely always finds me no matter the time or distance.
6	Sounds totally normal for an ISTP
9	That sounds like an ideal relationship. \n\nYou both do your own thing and can turn to each other when you need the feeling and comfort of a relationship. If he keeps calling you like this then he does have feelings for you and is loyal to you. 
4	Swings between "I love this person" and "I want to be alone" are totally normal. Just let him know how you feel if you have a problem with your situation and give him time to think it over alone.
2	Yes we need our own time for random activities or nothing at all. 
2	I haven't spoken to this ISFP friend after falling out with them for four years now, but I do still care/love them, like if ever they need help, I won't hesitate to back them up even if they won't ask for it.\n\nSo I would say, from my experience, yes
1	perfectly normal... I would bet that your ISTP is treasuring you a lot, because you let him be himself and don't go on about it
1	yep
16	Trying to choose a response	http://imgur.com/Rofb8cY\n\nThis happens to me a lot. My wife will get mad because she just told me a bunch of stuff and expects some input yet I'm just sitting there mulling it over.  Anyone else get this?
22	Hehehe.  My wife used to get mad at me for not responding to things.  She would talk at me for minutes at a time and then pause.  I would nod and say things like, “mmhmm”.    She would get upset.  Then I would explain she never asked me anything.  They were all declarative statements.   If she wants me to engage then I need her to clue me in and ask a question.    Otherwise, I will just absorb what she said.    \n   \nOh and other times I answer her in my head but don’t actually vocalize it.   She has learned to prompt me, “use your voice, I can’t hear your thoughts”.  
8	100%! I like to think my shit through. All it takes is a poorly worded response to send massive piles of shit straight into the fan. 
6	Mhmm.
2	I think like this all the time. If I had any super power it would be to know the right thing to say in every situation. But really, it's just viewing interaction as manipulable. 
1	Haha that terminator scene is exactly how I think about my own decision making process when someone’s trying to get something out of me and I don’t really care at the moment. 
0	I'm iSFP Enneagram 5w4. Maybe I'm ISTP?	Don't get me wrong I love being ISFP and i resonate with it a lot. But since learning I'm also a type 5 that I also resonate with, I'm starting to question it. Some say that ISFP type 5 is very rare and others say it makes sense. I've been reading a lot on the differences between ISFP and ISTP and there's really not much from either that I don't align with. Some days I can be like ISFP and others like ISTP. \n\nArugments for ISFP\n\n* I **hate** arguments. I will do everything that I can to remove myself from a disagreement and if I can't, I get stressed to the point of dysfunction. \n* I love "aesthetic." If it looks pretty, I like it even if it has no practical use (strong argument against ISTP). \n* I'd rather "create" than "build." I appreciate fine arts like music or acting over something more robust as woodworking/ mechanics. Not that carpentry isn't creative or beautiful because it certainly is, just not in a way that I find obvious.\n\nArguments for ISTP\n\n* The fact that I'm a type 5. I 'm always learning and even though I'm F (or i think I'm F), my decisions always have an air of logic to them.\n* I love danger/action/excitement. Theme parks and extreme sports are right up my alley which doesn't line up with the whole relaxed/chill ISFP vibe.\n* I work well under pressure (sometimes). If there's a deadline quickly approaching i get a sudden burst of motivation. But I don't work well under "stress" if that makes any sense.\n* I can be unintentionally rude. \n* The on/off metaphor really resonates with me. I'm either 100% focused, or 100% not interested.\n\nI kind of want to be ISTP in a way but I know that I'm not as detached as most of you are. I consider the enneagram 5 type to show intelligence, rather than unfeeling analysis. Anyway, what do you guys think?  Do you think a type 5 ISFP doesn't make sense, or can they coexist in one person. I thought to post it here, as much as I love the ISFP sub, because I want to know an actual ISTP's opinion.
6	Look at the difference in functions to decide, not archetypical descriptions.\n\nISFP - Fi Se Ni Te\n\nISTP - Ti Se Ni Fe\n\nResearch those and make a decision, you can only be one of those function sets.
2	I'd say your arguments for both types could really go either way, and I suggest like others that you look into cognitive functions.\n\nEven if you are a type 5 ISFP it is more uncommon but not immpossible. In the link below they show percentages of a poll and while the sample sizes are small there's about 5% who are type 5. https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/01/mbti-and-the-enneagram-2/11/
4	I don’t think it really matters anyways. Your self worth as a human is in no way determined  by your MBTI type. \n\n\nYour life won’t be any different if you’re istp vs. isfp. \n\n\nWhatever resonates with you most, stick with it. Because it literally makes no practical difference either way. 
1	Maybe you are.
1	you might also be 4w5... how close were the percentages?
1	11MLL m
5	Without starting any arguments, where do you fall politically?	Far left, mid left, center, mid right, or far right? Or somewhere in between?
27	Mostly libertarian leaning slightly right (economically).\n\nMarry who you want.\n\nSmoke what you want.\n\nBuy all the guns you want.\n\nSay what you want.\n\nFuck who you want.\n\nNo one should be able to tell you otherwise.
6	Center left. 
7	Lolbertarian.  It's like a libertarian, but also likes doing things for lulz.
16	I don’t believe in political parties, I think everyone should just talk about their own beliefs in politics and not be lumped into groups. 
32	An istp who isn’t libertarian needs to take the test again.
14	I'm American and feel libertarian on a lot of things, but I have a strong socialist side(like universal healthcare and higher education). I think you need the populace to be taken care of and educated in order to be truly free.
8	I'm mid-left. I'm very left when it comes to education, though. I also live in a state that is bluer than the ocean, so that may have something to do with it.
4	Took that one test that tells you where you align, and I align most with the centrist group.
9	No idea. Tbh I don’t really give a fuck. I stay informed on current political events. And sometimes I’ll discuss/debate for the hell of it. But at the end of the day I truly don’t care. I have zero say in government. I’ll never be able to change anything. \n\n\nSo instead of bursting a blood vessel getting angry and fighting for my “team”, I just go with the flow. Whatever happens happens. I’m far too busy trying to start my own adult life to really invest my time in something that won’t yield any returns besides anger and frustration. 
6	Libertarian with with social in there.  I support universal healthcare and education.  I’m willing to pay more taxes so others can go to the doctor when needed.  
6	Pretty far left of anything that exists in America.
2	I believe in free markets, free minds, the free movement of peaceful people to pursue happiness in the vocation of their choice.  
4	left
2	The Right in norway is the same as liberal in US. Im far left in Norway. 
1	Hard center with leanings varrying by subject matter. Nothing more dangerous than blind dedication to one party or, even worse, one ideology.\n\n\nSide note: while I think a society of ISTP could live happily as libertarians, I think being libertarian shows ignorance for human diversity and complications of the real world. Just my two cents. Not looking for debate just wanted to throw that wrench out there. 
1	Centre-right. 
1	I have no idea. I couldn’t care less about political related stuff. I’m sure I could take a quiz or something and find out where I stand but eh 🤷🏻‍♂️
1	Opposite of my spouce....always
1	National Socialism
1	Mid right.
1	Socially libertarian. Capitalist with some common sense socialist positions.
1	Libertarian right\n
0	Non political.
6	What kind of vehicle would you own if you could?	I really want one of the old WW2 Willys Jeeps. Practical in rough terrain and sturdy, with a touch of fun.
11	A camper van. It'd be nice to have my own small space to stay in sometimes and I want to make it as cozy as possible. Everything could be easily accessible, like an all in one. Except maybe a toilet
14	The Millennium Falcon.
6	Stock fourth gen Supra. Love the look, the era, everything about it except the cost and percentage owned by ricers. Plus, if anyone asks why I don't want kids, I can just say "wouldn't fit".\n\nFor contrast, I have a 2004 Rav4 currently.
4	BFR. \n\nOr any spaceship, really. \n\nSerious answer?  I kinda want an [M1151](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1151), I miss those things. 
3	[Lamborghini Miura](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Lamborghini_Miura_P400SV.jpg) \n\n\nor a [Messerschmidt BF109](https://c.wallhere.com/photos/79/1d/2560x1600_px_artwork_Germany_Luftwaffe_Messerschmitt_Messerschmitt_Bf_109_Military_Aircraft_World_War_II-799248.jpg!d)
3	FJ40
3	A 1998 Subaru 22B but only 424 were made, none of them are selling and when one does it goes for like 150-250k so I should probably let that go. 
3	1970 Challenger with a subdued golden brown coat and black accents. I want to drive it down endless stretches of asphalt coast to coast. Pack light and enjoy the scenery.  
3	Lotus Exige
3	Basically any RWD sports car from japan... and I literally mean any... \n\n\nIf I had to pick a single car, I’d probably say a 1998 240sx. It’s a blank canvas I can do *anything* with. Stance? Easy. Drag? Easy. Drift? Easy. Track? Easy. The car is just a perfect project. You can mold it into anything. \n\n\nNow if I had to pick something currently unnatainable, it would have to be a JDM RHD FDRX7 with a 4 rotor 20b and an Air to water cooled compound turbo set up. 
3	4x4 truck i can drift on and a delorean\n\n...im not kidding
3	- dirt bike\n- excavator\n- bulldozer\n- spitfire plane\n- fishing boat\n\nThe WW2 jeep can come too. 
3	Tank
2	My first car was a 1986 Grand Marquis that was all black with a red leather interior.  It was wildly impractical in terms of size and gas mileage, but it looked great.  I'd love to find one of those and restore it to its original glory.  
2	the dream is a motorcycle and a campervan
2	I wish Saab still made vehicles.\n\nI'm into Volvo at the moment.  No particular model.  I just dig their priorities.
2	An old Chevy pickup. Single cab, plenty of room for dates and all that entails. I save my affection for romantic relationships and I just really want to show them a great time by going to drive-in theaters and various adventures.
2	Kawasaki H2 and a Ford Raptor. Although, lately I've been thinking Id enjoy a decked out SUV over a truck, but I haven't really looked around much.
2	I just want my MR2 to work :(
2	An M3.
2	a TARDIS. Does that count?
2	Oh man! This is my question! Let's see.... I currently daily drive a 71 F100 with a 390/4bbl and 4 speed manual about 60% of the time, and a 70 el Camino with a 383 stroker that puts 362 horsepower to the ground the other 40%.  Currently doing a full restoration on a 70 intermeccanica italia, while trying to slowly work a contact to sell me a 55 chevy post with a 427 and a 4 speed, which I would make a gasser. Working as an A/C contractor, I also have a hard on for big vintage work trucks with service bodies..... I dunno. At some point I'd really like a 40 ford coupe. I know a guy with a 40 ford pickup, a 48 chevy flatbed, 56 chevy truck, 69 chevy truck, and 72 chevy 4x4. Also may pick up a 72 k5 for my wife, which she likes. It's a sickness that takes all my free time and money. 
2	2014 Mustang Shelby. Used to own a 14 Mustang GT and absolutely loved the bodystyle. It's so mean and filthy. A Shelby with a ferocious muffler and blacked out would be a dream. 
2	One of those little helicopters that you can land on the lawn. That or Lotus elise 
2	Unattainable: An RX-7 FD3S Spirit R, 2 seat manual variation. Or Nissan Skyline R34 V-Spec II.\n\nAttainable: Subaru BRZ, Dodge Challenger Hellcat.\n\nUnattainable ones are the ones which got me to be interested in cars, attainable ones are just great cars on their own design selections.
2	Lamborghini Murcielago 
2	a penny farthing with the rear smaller wheel replaced with tank treads
2	I had this thought today...and I don't care what I own as long as the windows and engine work
2	A super star destroyer.\n\nBack in reality, I'd like a bell jetranger, a cessna citation X, and an audi S8+
14	How affectionate would you say you are?	Perhaps scale of 1-10? In a committed relationship.
86	Committed relationship 10. \n\nRest of the world: -2. \n\nDrunk me: 15 to everyone. 
19	In committed romantic relationships, I can go from 10 to instant robot defense mode if they piss me off. Hardly any affection for others, and it’s usually awkward when a friend gets emotional with me. Kind of annoying actually.
16	In a relationship, 10. I start to sicken myself with how gushy I get lol. 
23	Depends on my mood. I'm like a cat: Sometimes I need my belly rubbed, but not too long or else I will kill you.  Also, I need you to fill up my food dish, but I still hate you.
5	About a 5. I like cuddling up on the couch, and holding hands in public, but I'm not very affectionate or romantic.

0	Here’s What Kind Of Boyfriend You Are Based On Your Myers-Briggs Personality Type	
20	ISTP - “You are the jack-of-all-trades boyfriend. You may not be overly showy or romantic when it comes to intimate relationships, but you show your love by helping your partner solve just about any problem they’re up against. You have a knack for picking up new systems quickly and you use this skill to offer fixes for whichever issues your loved ones are facing. You’re a true Jack-of-all-trades and your SOs appreciate you enormously for it.”\n\nSaved y’all a click 
6	There are no “type facts”. Because MBTI doesn’t produce *facts*. It provides possible explanations and insight into a personality. \n\n\nI fucking hate it when people treat this shit like a horoscope. We’re a little more sophisticated than that. 
2	i’d say that describes me, not super romantic but will help out SO with any problems they encounter
1	My husband is an ISTP and this is super accurate. I feel like it was a good refresh on the fact that his need to solve my issues is actually him showing love. Sometimes I just want a hearing ear but he’s being loving by trying to fix it not just to dismiss me.   \n  \nThanks for this. 
0	Stay Single Until You Meet Someone Like This, Based On Your Myers-Briggs Personality Type	
13	That’s the most bullshit article I’ve ever seen. It’s very horoscopy. \n\n\nDon’t fucking make decisions about marriage based on MBTI. That’s just mental. Make decisions based on a *unique individual person*. 
6	Compatibility for ISTPs	So I googled what MBTI types ISTPs get along with the best, and it said that ISTPs don't get along well with ENTPs, but I get along great with them, more than any other personality type.
33	Ehhhhh. This is where MBTIs start to get into horoscope territory. Just judge people individually instead of boiling them down to 4 letters. 
9	Same, I get along with ENTPs extremely well. Just don't trust bs compatibility charts on the internet
6	My best friend is an ENTP, so....
3	Both my ex and best friend is INFP. We don't have a lot in common, but we have the same humour, dislikes the same type of people and have the same taste in music. Worked out great, and Im still good friends with my ex 8 years later. That's my type og people I've found out.
2	ENTP married to an ISTP so...that's clearly wrong.
3	ENTPs supervise the ISTP. My best friend is ENTP and a lot of my favourite comedians/entertainers are ENTP. I tend to be on extremely neutral but great terms with ISFJs. INFPs are incredible listeners and very generous.\n\nI have problems with ENFPs, INTPs, ISTJs, ESTJs, and ESFPs. (This is interesting because according to socionics these types blind spots [7th function] are all functions of the ISTP).\n\nI really want to meet and become friends with an ENTJ.
1	I get along with them, and sometimes mistype as one...
1	I'm an INTJ, me and my ISTP boyfriend are best friends. We literally do everything together. Met in high school and just clicked. Like, We could be looking at one another and just burst out laughing for no reason, which is something because he's very shy and insecure and I've never been one to do that kind of thing. He helps me get lost in sensations of the now when I start overthinking. I curb his unhealthy impulses. It's a pretty awesome relationship, the only problem we had was in the beginning. We were terrible at communicating, like just absolute shit at it. The strong emotions he brought out of me were pretty scary too. We came up with a good system and we've been together for 4 years now.
10	What jobs do you actually do?	And if you don't mind sharing your career path I'd love to hear it \n\nFor me:\n\n-gas station clerk in high school\n-assistant event planner throughout college \n-teacher assistant for a leadership class \n-summer job in Yellowstone \n-intern as a project manager of a summer camp \n-intern commercial real estate advisor \n-Air Force Drone Pilot \n\nTrying to figure out what's next, maybe start a business maybe go to grad school. Really don't want to go to school again but I'm sitting on free tuition so I feel bad wasting it. \n
9	Unemployed going on around 4 years yo!\n
6	I did a degree in Computer Science. It took six years to do a three year degree because of motivational issues. On the one hand the only job I’d ever be happy with required a degree, on the other hand I couldn’t actually be bother doing the work. Eventually I put my head down and my arse up and did what needed to be done for the first time in my life. \n\nI got a job doing technical support for a medium sized company.  The IT version of chief cook and bottle washer. This is pretty much an IT-minded ISTPs dream job because it is entirely fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants and educated guess work.  By the time anyone realised I didn’t actually have any previous experience, I’d picked up more than I needed to know and no one cared.   \n\nThat was my career for around twenty years.  I was firmly technical support - did no software development, no design, just support,  I loved it, I was good at it and people appreciated the work i did.  I switched companies a fair few times, as you do in the IT industry. \n\nThis is where I first did MBTI and realised where my natural strengths (and weaknesses) came from. \n\nAt some point, it became a bit same-same, so I moved into a team leader role.  Totally out of my comfort zone, by that stage, I’d matured enough to figure that you can do anything you out your mind to, so I started learning management skills, people skills and planning skills.  \n\nIn a sense, you can apply your natural strengths as an ISTP to leadership, you also need to work on your natural weaknesses.   I had to work on them a lot because people weren’t exactly my thing.   Did me a lot of good though and I don’t regret it. I’m a much more well rounded person for it. \n\nStill on that journey.  
4	- coaches assistant at a country club tennis facility for a bit \n\n\n- kids coach at same tennis facility for a bit. Together both probably 2 years. \n\n\n- manager at mooyah burgers and fries for about 8 months when I was 17 (worst company ever). \n\n\n- two weeks at a dollar store. (Just kidding this was the worst company ever.) \n\n\n- 3 months as a porter at a Nissan dealership over summer between senior year and college \n\n\n- two years as a manager at 8 different starbucks across Texas starting second semester of college \n\n\n- for my whole sophomore year in college I also taught an engine rebuilding class. We start by rebuilding small Briggs engines and work into anything from a Chevy 230 to a fully built nitrous 454 big block. \n\n\n- through out all of college I did tutoring for various math/engineering classes. \n\n\n- did a brief stint at a restaurant called whiskey cake. I learned very quickly that the restaurant industry is *fucking* stupid. And I’ll never ever do it again. \n\n\n- managed a vape shop for a year which was super fun. Had just moved home from college to zero friends. All my current friends can be traced back to that job. \n\n\n- for the last year I’ve been working a day job at a fleet van/truck rental place. Currently in training to take over as regional manager putting me directly in line for an executive position when all the old guys expire. \n\n\n- for the last year and a half I’ve also had my own company with a business partner. We don’t make any money with it yet but we’ve been putting in work trying to make it profitable. Don’t really care to dive into specifics of the company as that’s an entire other comment. \n\n\n- I also recently purchased a Miata that I’ve been getting ready for the track. I’m in the works with my racing license and am trying to kick start my dream career. Hope to have the car ready for the 2019 season to work myself back into racing (have done it previously as a hobby) with autocross. And then I hope to begin an actual series for the 2020 season. \n\n\nSo I currently have my eggs in three different baskets. Keeps me busy as hell. But one of them will eventually pay off and until that day I’ll keep at it. 
2	Couldn't even think about more school after high school ended. Got a summer job fixing computers in an office,  then another one making web pages. Web stuff turned into programming web stuff.  I didn't know what I was doing for quite a while. Eventually, and really not that long, maybe a few years, I became very knowledgeable about the entire category of programming and web dev, but I was underpaid, so I started going to user groups and blogging. In no time, my expertise was noticed. Now I work at one of the world's best companies, doing what I wanted to all along.\n\nI guess all I can say to fellow ISTPs is pick something you're good at, it doesn't matter what it is, and then don't give up on it. \n\nFor years I wondered if I was any good at programming. I mean, I had an idea, but 80% of programmers think they are above average. Eventually my wife just straight up told me that I was and that I should stop wondering. I decided to believe her and just go with that.  Nobody's ever told me otherwise. 
2	1) Worked at a saltwater fish store while in college for 2 years\n\n2) Went to a summer internship at a small aerospace company and ended up just staying. Got promoted from Intern to Lab Tech then Lab Tech to Engineer. 
2	1. Clerk at video rental store, part time.\n2. Various minimum wage jobs, dishwasher/retail/food service. Common issue with all of these was following schedule / punctuality.\n3. Learned basic programming skills through from textbooks and online resourced, went to a developer bootcamp.\n4. Software engineer. Company folded.\n5. Unemployed for a year and a half, trying to find a job with a decent amount of scheduling freedom, that didn't require a degree. Big mistake.\n6. Current job, sysadmin/devops/support IT engineer for a massive healthcare nonprofit. Work from home, good times.
1	I am a stubborn istp female who have tried and failed going to school for 4 years. I want a high education and I do well at school, but I get bored and my MS fuck me up with fatigue a lot. Im unimployed now, but Im once again starting school after summer. Now I know that im sick, and therefore can take less subjects at the time without feeling "lazy" about it.
1	I started working when I was 13 on a farm, terrible job and terrible pay but I was 13 and it probably taught me something... maybe. Anyways, when I was 14 I started at a local beach as a sailing assistant and have been working there ever since. Although, I didnt stay sailing assistant, I eventually became the sailing instructor and got certified as a lifegaurd and swimming teacher. I'm 20 now and will be going back for my 6th year this summer. \nSchool-wise, I live in Quebec so I did CEGEP (basically grade 12 and 1st year of college put together) in a science program and started university in Mathematics. Switched to bio after my first year after realizing I wanted to go into medicine. So, now I take 5 classes and volunteer 7 hours a week along with playing football once a week. \nJust like some of the people replying here, I also struggle with motivation issues but I was lucky enough to realize that I can pretty much do anything I want as long as I work towards it as hard as I can. That's how I'm hoping to get into med school. \n\nBest of luck with whatever you decide to do!

11	Questions: Marriage and Parenting as an ISTP	I'm going do a brain dump and none of you are going to read it but whatever.  I know I'm probably just waaay over thinking and Ti-Ni looping.  Relevant info: I'm 29F ISTP with 38M INFJ.  I am previously engaged twice, never married.  He is previously married and divorced.\n\nI've never been comfortable with the concept of marriage and promising to spend the rest of your life with someone.  How little girls grow up dreaming of their wedding day is beyond me. \n My biggest issue is how the hell do you make a promise like that with no realistic way of knowing whether you'll be able to keep it?  I don't make promises I can't foresee reasonably being able to keep.\n\nI was childfree until I met this person.  We are to the point in our relationship where we both would like to possibly have a child and I am not comfortable with that without being married due to the legal protections for me and the hypothetical child.  I figure at this point, as a woman, having a child with someone is basically giving away a big chunk of your life to them in a way anyways.  So I think I'm going to do the marriage thing.\n\nHe has been so cool and accommodating of my issues and wishes (because INFJ...) which makes me appreciate him even more.  He says we can say whatever for our vows and if I have an issue with *forever* I don't have to promise that.  No formal engagement, no big wedding because I hate them (we both hate attention on us too), just us with our friend officiating and a big reception party for family at a later date.  \n\nAny married ISTPs (or partners married to ISTPs) have input?  How has it gone for you relationship-wise?  How were your weddings?\n\nHow is it being a parent, if you are?  I'm kinda worried I'll be a horrible mother because of inferior Fe.
6	Female ISTP and mother here... can see a few posts on about ISTP fathers.... great.... though considering the gender divisions for parenthood and responsibilities I suspect being a male ISTP parent somehow puts them in a nicely placed position compared to the female ISTP parent. \n\nIf you are unsure about both long term commitment and children, more so than the marriage, you really need to revise if you are ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood with all that entails.... a CONSTANT impact and drain on your resources, every day, every second of the day, particularly as the MOTHER.... that said, obvs children bring amazing things too but that’s a whole other discussion.\n\nA marriage certificate doesn’t guarantee happily forever after and can be reversed, setting you “free”.... “Hello my best friends, “freedom, opportunity and independence”, here I come again to embrace all you got to give...”\n\nYou can’t just “release” yourself of a child though and regardless if you got the mind set to give it or not, a child will deserve full maternal dedication, so forget about “ISTP” and hurry up and replace those 4 letters with “MUM”. It’s doable but with our sometimes extreme need for independence and lesser felt maternal instinct you may find yourself being put to the test!\n\nDepending on how much of a free spirited ISTP you are, and particularly as the mother a child, unless you have a wonderful hands on partner or a great support network, motherhood will be trialing to say the least through better and worse.
4	I am in INFJ (30F) married to an ISTP (30M) and we have a 2 year old with a baby on the way. We have been very happily married for 10 years. We had a decent sized wedding but it wasn’t overly focused on us in that, we basically said our vows, ate first and danced in front of everyone for the first song and then just blended into the crowd. It was an amazing day. I find our personalities really complement each other. Of course there’s some give and take and miscommunication here and there but his direct-ness is really good for me and my intense emotions (haha) help bring it his softer side.   \n  \nMy husband has become an amazing father. We’ve both always loved kids and I knew he would do well, but it’s amazing how much our little person has a hold on him. Sure, he can be short some days but I wouldn’t say it’s anything worse than myself or any other parent! He takes time with our son to teach him and help him learn about my husbands hobbies and stuff. Our boy is a mama’s boy, but the bigger he gets the more and more he prefers his dad because he is exciting and cool! My husband is really protective, though everyone else may not perceive it, and he’s always focused on our son’s well-being and him having fun etc.   \n I think our personality combo has been great in raising kids so far, he tempers my worrying and I temper his desire to sneak our kid onto a rollercoaster already, haha. 
3	I am ISTP female married to an INFJ for 3 years. We went to the court but family members wanted a wedding lol\n He's cool. We both like similar stuff. I respect him, he respects me. No kids tho I don't want any. 
3	ISTP dude here. I wish I had never gotten married, for tax and purly fiscal purposes. \n\nIn the end, whether you're married or not doesn't matter, cause you can always divorce, and even if you are married doesn't mean he's going to take care of you (or vice versa). If you love your partner, some silly vow made to an all knowing god (or an imaginary god for that matter) isn't going to keep you together. It's a true commitment you make to yourself and your partner that will keep you together. \n\nAnd once his name is on that birth certificate, good luck trying to get rid of him. he's locked into your life for at least the next 18 years.\n\nReally you're just questioning the commitment, so nut up and make your mind!
2	Istp lady, mid 30's. I got married 13 years ago and it's been great for me. Kids are fun. We head out for adventures everyday. They are my favorite people.\nBeing a parent is a very selfless thing from day 1, but those little boogers seem to fit into your lifestyle perfectly.\nIf a child needs something, they will demand it, such as my son needing 100x the affection I can handle...but I handle it anyway. They are good at training parents.\n\nFollow your instinct & Good luck! \n
1	I (25F) have a kid and the dad lives in the house next door, and I have her here  50%. \nShe's funny, sarcastic, very emotional (and laugh about it after if she overreacted.) And is super confident in what she does and with who she speaks to. \nI didnt know I would be good at this mom thing, but I can see on her that both me and her dad are doing a great job. The only thing i actually find hard is the daily dinner cooking. Fuck that. Starting 1 grade this year, so i'll see if the homework is more annoying than the cooking, lol.\nOh, and birthday parties are awfull,  but hey she loves it.
1	I'm a married male 33 ISTP to a 26 ISTJ. We had our friend officiate and two other friends be witnesses at a park on a 3 day weekend. We didn't tell people at work and social media for over a month. Family was surprised but accepted it. No kids yet, but one day \n\nI committed because I had a list and found exactly what I was looking for. Also, she's a consistent +EV in my life, so there's that. I tell myself I can divorce anytime I want all the time and ask myself if I made a good decision... The answer always comes back to the math still being +EV for my situation. When it becomes a net negative, I'll be a better leader if it's salvageable. \n\n\n

12	Talking	Does anyone else find it exhausting to talk?
20	Normally, yes. Sometimes I get in a chatty mood with my good friends and family. I don't really have anything to say to strangers, especially if it's a topic I know they don't sincerely care about. If a stranger or an acquaintance asks me for advice on a topic I know a lot about, I will give them the run down.
16	I want to have interesting conversations.\n\nMost conversations are not interesting.
9	Depends. Sometimes I’ll be in a mood where I really don’t want to talk to anyone, especially while out in public or busy doing something. But sometimes I’ll think of something I can’t wait to tell my brother/girlfriend and I won’t shut up when I see them. 
8	I was assigned as a server at work yesterday aside from my usual barista role. My manager kept telling me to perform 11/10 customer service and it was really making me angry. By the end of my shift I brought water to a lady and she said “did it look like I needed water?” And I responded with “no it’s just my job”. And she looked so displeased. \n\nTalking is exhausting but what’s more exhausting is trying to come up with a good response quickly. Probably the thing I have the most trouble with. I usually just respond to a witty remark with a quick little fake laugh.\n\nEdit: spelling
4	Yep. Having been around extroverts a lot lately I've realized how inaccurate, repetitive and lenghty their speech usually is. I generally aim for the opposite when talking so I find it exhausting to go against my tendencies. When I do talk a lot I'm usually inquisitive and 'technical' and some people have told me that they feel like I'm interogating them :v\n\nWhen people bring up a topic in which they explain something and I can ask them a lot of "How's" and steps they took to achieve something I'm quite relieved. Otherwise they talk about people and I'm like "oh they want me to express an opinion or show sympathy, for how long?"
3	Only when I’m sober. \n\nAnd not presently lonely. 
3	I have verbal diarrhea 
3	If the conversation sucks yeah. Otherwise no it's not exhausting, but I won't excite myself too much. I like laughing while talking with people.
2	Yes, I do, but only with people I don't know well.  Friends and family are fine.  Conversations with people I don't know are the problem.  \n\nWe had a gigantic work get together, with 400-odd people.  "Fantastic chance to network within the company".  I find it genuinely exhausting to start so many conversations in one day.  I found that chatting to someone, getting something useful, then taking some alone time, then chatting again worked fairly well for me.  
2	I talk alot with family and friends about everything and can talk for hours. But I will not talk to a stranger, no. If I have to - ok.. but I do what I can to just blend in to the background. After a few drinks I find it easier to ask the strangers Kindly to shut up.
2	Only if I don't really know the person. Once Ive gotten to know someone, I usually don't mind, if I'm cool with them(and I don't need some cool down time). In fact, my closest friends/family have told me I can be pretty chatty, at times.\n\nHaving said that, Im not big on meeting new people, especially when I've already got a few good friends. I generally stick to the people Im close to and keep to myself, when I can. Everything else drains me.
2	yes
2	It takes the breath out of me quite literally. 
1	Mentally? Yes. \n\n\nHowever, there are plenty of times I deem the exhaustion worthy. Am I at work? Then it’s necessary for getting paid lol. Is it a stranger? Odds are we won’t get into a good conversation unless it’s a topic we both love. Otherwise it’ll fizzle as fast as it started and I’ll get out quick. \n\n\nSort of same with friends/family. It really depends on my mood, comfortability with who I’m talking to, the topic at hand, and my current state of sobriety. (Weed makes me talk more to friends but less to strangers while alcohol makes me talk more to everyone.) \n\n\nThere’s very very few individuals on this planet that I enjoy mundane “chit chat” with. 
5	ISTP fears by DaveSuperPower	
14	Can't relate. Maybe it's because I ran out of fucks to give about acceptance. 
12	or you know you can get better friends who dont care when you disappear for a few months.
11	"Demon Fe" :'D\n\nI will say my fear is lonliness and wanting to be loved and accepted by people. However I think the uh, the metaphor used here is kind of stupid for that.\n\nMan, you should be able to take a few months for yourself and still be alright with people. If we, as ISTP, are more comfortable spending our time in our garage, I don't see whats wrong with that. Whats wrong with ron is that he expects the tribe to love his book, but uh, other than being entitled as hell, I can't really see what he did wrong lol. \n\nYes you need to practice Fe. No you shouldn't feel like you've gotta Constantly Socialize to be accepted. \n\ntldr; I see the point hes making but it's only half right in the sense that our fear is acceptance but not right in that he thinks you've gotta dedicate time to the outside in order to be accepted. Acceptance is subjective, thats not how it works. IT's more like how you treat people and how you get along with them, and even then this might get you "Accepted" superficially but what we really want is to be understood and wanted for what we are, and not how we well we can get ok'd by the rest of the pack. 
7	What? 
3	That was an interesting video. Now back to my wood carving 
2	>"Ron writing a book on clock-repair"\n\n>a book on **clock-repair**\n\nThat got to be the most ISTP thing I've heard in this clip x)\n\nConclusion of this video, summed up: Indulge in team-work to become more familiar with your Fe-function, and to learn from your peers. Keep your hobbies and projects, but don't forget to spend time with your friends. Trust others, learn from others. Yada yada. Blie bluh blaah.
1	Pretty accurate in my opinion. But instead of giving in to a certain tribe I personally find a different "tribe" for each of my different interests. 
1	I need to work on my Fe
1	2:20 - 3:20\n\nYep.
3	Question about ISTJs	So, have any of you had any experiences with ISTJs? I recently started talking to someone and lo and behold, they're an ISTJ. I don't know how I feel about them. I've never met one before. The only thing I know about them what my INTP friend has told me but lord knows ISTJs and INTPs hate each other. Any input on how they are as friends or relationship partners in relation to ISTPs?
10	So people often say that since we’re all STs we should be able to get along just fine. \n\nPersonally, I find Ti vs Te to be frustratingly difficult a divide to overcome in any sort of deep conversation. \n\nFine to work with, not the best friends, and my worst dating experience. \n\nSample size of 3, your mileage may vary. 
7	ISTJs are one of the most common types, so they're all around you.  Know anyone in the military, police, church, government, technology, teaching, etc?  Odds are many of them are ISTJs.  ISTJs generally like rules and responsibilities, and they're very reliable.  \n\nISTPs and ISTJs usually get along well, particularly if they have interests in common.  If they don't have much in common, it's tougher to make a connection.
3	My experiences with ISTJs have ranged between neutral and negative. If an ISTJ loves rules you agree with, you can get along fine. If they love rules you don't care about (the usual case) you can have a fine relationship as long as you avoid the topic. If they love rules that you don't follow, you will not get along with them at all.
2	Well, I think my dad is an ISTP and I'm pretty sure my big bro is an ISTJ.\n\nIt's rather conflictual, lol. It's like they really don't speak the same languages ? They don't do stuff the same way + both are a bit unwilling to concede anything to make the situation better.\n\nAlso, while I physically fought with my brother in the past (a lot actually), I don't actually hate him. (What am I, a filthy Feeler ?) \n\nHe kinda rubs me the wrong way, tho. The SiTe combinaison takes its fucking time.
2	I'm an ISTJ and my partner is an ISTP. We've been together a little over a year and a half and are planning to move in together this summer. This has overwhelmingly been my best relationship. We have a lot in common and our lifestyles are very similar. We have similar communication styles and identical love languages. 
2	Ehhh I had one be my section leader (we were both seniors) in marching band but we clashed a lot because she would tell me to do something and she would think it was the best way, but I was stubborn and wanted to do things my way. So, if you're not stubborn and you agree that their way is best, you'll be good with them but...yeah I'm not like that.
4	I don’t understand posts like these. \n\nA. Odds are every one has met at least one of every type. Saying “I met my first one” doesn’t mean shit. Because it’s just the first that you *know* of. \n\n\nB. Stereotyping people based off their types is a dangerous game. Saying “I don’t like them” based on a type is just stupid. Types aren’t definitions. It’s a personality test created by *non-psychologists* as a method of explaining people’s behavior. MBTI is ***not*** a way to predict, stereotype, and judge people. It should only be used for analytical purposes. \n\n\nEvery single ISTJ is a unique individual. You may fall in love with one and hate the fucking guts of another. Someone’s MBTI doesn’t define the relationship you will have with an individual. It’s merely a tool that can help you navigate the relationship by better understanding each others words and actions. This goes for everything from coworkers to friends to SO’s. 
1	I think my mom and husband are istj.....so I must love them 😊
0	Don't use MBTI to over-generalise an entire population.  MBTI looks at how you make decisions, nothing else.\n\nTalk to the person, see if you share interests.  That sort of thing.
5	Here's a dumb question/Observation	Okay, so I'm really jumping the gun here, but I know a few xSTP and I have a funny question\n\nDo you guys hate/dislike cats ?\n\nI noticed my ESTP flatmate really disliked them, and so does my ISTP father. The reason seems to be the awareness of their sheer useless-ness and a dislike for the extrawork + cat hairs everywhere. Also, reasons like "Aaaww, it's so fluffy and cute !" are repressed (Fe 4th).\n\nDog may be more appreciated, but only the "useful"/functional one unlike chihuahua, corgis, etc ?\n\nI'm really speculating from thoses 2 examples, it's not a very serious question, but I think I found something here, lol.\n\n**Edit** ITT,me being absolutely wrong.
35	Love cats. I actually prefer them. They are easy to take care of and provide a moderate amount of companionship. I have two dogs and love them, but they are a lot of work (relative to the amount of work I want to put into owning a pet) and make it much harder to travel. That being said, would never get rid of them. 
27	I love cats. They're ISTP animals.
15	Its the opposite, I love cats. Less work, not as smelly, my old cat would catch flys and spiders so definitely not a useless pet.\n\nI love dogs too but I never had one, but they seem like a lot of work. 
15	I love all animals equally. I just happen to love dogs more equally, and cats less equally.
4	Useless? Love my cat. My cat is a top notch rodent catcher. 
8	I don't get this "uselessness" thing about pets. They're pets not tools, they don't need to be useful in any kind of way except keeping you company and not be complete twats like chihuahuas.\n\n\nI love dogs and cats.
4	I love all animals, especially Cats.\nOne exception: I HATE dogs, and they hate me. I have no Idea why tho.
5	Love cats. If any animal could be given a type, I’d say cats go hand in hand with ISTP. But, then again, I don’t believe in typing animals lol. \n\n\nI do love dogs for play time. But cats are so much less labor intensive to keep alive. And, generally, make less of a mess over time compared to dogs. \n\n\nSource: have owned both separately. Enjoyed both. Preferred cat. 
3	Cats are my spirit animal.
3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anbrC3x5r6Y
6	Yeah, I do. Cats are lazy and useless, they just want to eat and sleep. Doggos (the real ones, not these lil shits) are loyal and smart, also more useful.
2	I’m definitely a dog guy, particularly the working breeds. Don’t mind cats too much though, they’re just kinda boring 
2	I prefer cats. I'm okay with dogs, but mostly their body language is just weird to me and it's really difficult to figure out what's going on with them.  I've spent a lot of time with dogs through friends and hobbies but still it's difficult. From cats I get a sense quickly. 
2	I really dont like dogs, but I guess cats are alright. But yes, I dont like the cathairs and when they circle my feet
2	I love cats yo. They're super chill and laid back, easy to take care of. Dogs can be harder for me for that reason, they need more attention, but i like dogs too. \n\nThese people you're talking about just sound kind of mean and heartless tbh. You don't get pets for them to be "useful" unless you're training animals for work or something. You get them for companionship and love and stuff. 
2	I like cats.\nI don't own any pets though. I don't want to take care of them.
2	> The reason seems to be the awareness of their sheer useless-ness\n\nIf you think cats are useless you've never had a rodent problem...
3	I love cats. Low maintenance and very independent. People see them as disobedient or assholes but they're just living their truths lol. I think they are as less disruptive/destructive than dogs.\n\nPets are pets. I'm not the type of person to get pets to serve a work function so I don't really care that they are useless work wise. They still serve a function to me which is to be a floofy companion.\n\nI think most of these cats vs dogs debates are pointless because there's so many different breeds that have very different personalities and humans have so much varying personalities as well so its all about finding the right fit for you. I don't hate dogs, they are nice but I wouldn't want one as a pet because it's just not for me.
2	I don't dislike cats, I dislike having animals indoors. I think it's disgusting. I do dislike dogs though.
1	yes, i generally dislike them largely because im very allergic to them. plus im more of a dog person.
1	I also love cats
1	I love dogs and cats equally having had both. 
1	Love cats. Hate the hairs and the extra work, so I don't actually own one. But it's the only pet I'd consider having.
1	LOVE cats and would choose one 10 out of 10 times over a dog any day  
1	I was raised by cats, so I favor them slightly over other pets. \n\nBut I love all animals. 
1	I love cats, and despise dogs. I love having grown up with barn cats, but can't stand living with indoor cats. I could if I had to, but they can be such a pain. 
0	Fe & Fi	
11	Shitty crosspost.\n\n
10	What does “Mechanic” mean for an ISTP	I originally thought it meant taking apart actual objects but I seem to rather take apart social norms, government systems, rules, contradictions ect. I break these things down to they’re logical core. Is that what Mechanic means? 
27	We take things apart. We put them together. We know how things work, because we figure it out.\n\nA car, a process, method... anything.
10	....no mechanic literally means mechanic 
8	I said this somewhere once before and it seemed to really resonate with a couple folks; Personality hacker put it best; We are called mechanics not because we are all literally car mechanics, but because we understand everything as if it were a machine. And that machine can be anything, whether it be a tool, a weapon, a concept, an object, a whole person, or an actual car. We look at things as if we are trying to figure out how to Fix them, and whether or not they are useful, discerning whether it works or does not work, and whether something does or doesn't work tends to be what we care about most, or consider most important. 
1	I think this is the crux of the matter:\n\nFrom dictionary.com \n\nSlang.a person skilled in the dishonest handling of cards, dice, or other objects used in games of chance
1	ababa
1	Yes. Finding out how things work is what we do.
1	I'm a biology student in uni right now and one of my favourite things to do is take apart social constructs and find the evolutionary basis for why they exist. In other words, I like to break down the idea that humans are different than other animals and explain all of our behaviour from the 'logical' sex and food based reasoning. I think of humans as animals that are able to explain their behaviour but they don't control it. So, yes I do what exactly what you do except I use my background in biology to do it. 
1	You like figuring out systems, physical or not. 
1	I have no patience for putting things back together properly. I do like taking shit apart though but always lose a couple of bolts in the process or can't remember how it exactly fit together anymore :P
2	Music taste.	I am wondering if music taste is related to your personality type. That is why i am asking what music you like.
20	I will listen to anything, as long as it captures my attention within the first 2 or 3 seconds. If it doesn't it gets skipped.\n\nI typically hit a different spotifiy genera every day I'm on my computer and compile a playlist.\n\nIn short I find my musical taste changes from week to week, probably just in sync with my mood.
9	I mostly listen to alternative rock and melodic rap.
6	From previous threads of the same question, it seems like there's no real correlation. Progressive metal and glitch/trip hop are my go-tos. Haywyre, A Perfect Circle, Emancipator, Liquid Tension Experiment, TesseracT, Infected Mushroom.
3	Electronic music, modern jazz and psychodelic rock. \n\nAnd late 19th-early 20th French classical music e.g Satie, Faure, Debussy and Ravel. These guys paved the way for modern classical music we have today.\n\n
3	Power Metal, Melodic Death Metal, Heavy Metal, Metal, Hard Rock
3	i find my preferences a bit eclectic and highly dependant on my mood\n\ni have a stronger pref for old school 90s and lo-fi hip hop and early 2000s rock and it's various subgenres\n\ncan go from artists like A Tribe Called Quest, Nujabes to more modern Noname/Brockhampton before switching up with System of a Down, Sublime, Weezer, Jimmy Eat World, and Nirvana (honestly this list, in particular, could go on forever). i typically get a more "emotional" reaction from listening to rock too, probably the nostalgia\n\ni also dislike edm and all types of electronic/instrumental tech music for some reason. can't vibe with it
3	 I don't have a set taste. Whatever sounds pleasing to my ears I listen to. Although some genres just sounds terrible to me. Like heavy metal which is very irritating and that christian music that all sounds the same, so annoying...\n
5	Anything but country music. 
2	I love all the music. New wave punk, 60s country, ska, electronica, r&b, goth metal, pop music, trap, show tunes, death metal... It depends on my mood. I don't like to lock myself out of awesome music.
1	I like chill stoner music (but im not a stoner lol) ... Sublime has been my #1 for 20+ years now, Dirty Heads, Pepper, Bob Marley, Rebelution, etc.  I occasionally hit some old punk stuff, The Clash, Screeching Weasel, Rancid.  And sometimes I'm full on disney-princess singing A Whole New World and Under the Sea.
1	Love hip-hop, but I'm a fan of most stuff. I like punk & pop-punk a lot. Don't like country, electronic, or heavy metal
1	Anything good lul\nmostly metal but anything with nice guitar is added to my playlist\nalice in chains is all ive been listening to for the past 5 months
1	There's simply no band better than Pink Floyd.
1	House, underground, tech house mainly along with top tracks from almost every single other genre there is 
1	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxgRsaAe3oByCNUX0BlEqufR7XT9PVk6a
1	Heavy metal, metal core, alternative, 90s-2000 era gangsta rap, r n b
1	From what I can tell, us istps like dynamic rhythms and it's mood dependent. Mostly "weird" stuff. Nothing too classic or too traditionalist. It's as if we don't like any limitations, lol. 
1	I am a huge Eminem fan.  Relapse is his best album IMO. Horror core. I am an ISTP-T. 
1	Prog rock and prog metal
1	All genres of music. I got into experimental stuff lately. I listen to whatever fits my mood I guess.
1	jmetal, metaloid, 2000s music, eurobeat, orchestra/piano covers, vidya OSTs, movie OSTs
1	Here’s a thumbnail and it’s all over the place Zeppelin, Skynyrd (original) Sabbath, Santana, Beatles, Grateful Dead, Doors, Allman Bros, Chili Peppers, Sublime, Marley, Bruddah Iz, Jack Johnson, Old Blues like Howlin Wolf and Robert Johnson, Beach Boys, Dick Dale, Offspring, Pistols, Bad Religion, Everclear, Cake...
4	What little thing frustrates you the most?	
44	Slow walkers, inefficiency, people who spout their stupid opinions, when people flake on plans last minute, and when people try and use their emotions in arguments instead of logic.
29	If someone repeats something they’ve said to me when I’ve already responded or acknowledged that I heard them.
23	Inconsiderate drivers on the road. I very rarely get angry but holy shit I can’t stand slow/thoughtless driving. It’s totally irrational (usually, not always) 
15	People who feel the need to give vocal feedback at every phrase spoken in a conversation.\n\n"So what you want to do.."\n\nYep yep\n\n"is look at the plug"\n\nYep got it\n\n"and then you.."\n\nMhmm OK yep\n\n
12	People who take themselves too seriously, people who think they're wise even though they are my same age and have just as much to learns, people who treat you like you're stupid. I can't stand that last one, like they try to speak for you because they think they know everything about you and they are always completely wrong.
9	Inefficiency 
7	Can't stand listening to people eating with their mouths open or even just eating loudly in general. I always leave the room before I cringe to death.I also hate slow and bad drivers, there's this guy that usually drives his mother somewhere in the morning at the same time that I leave the gym. And every morning he stops directly in the middle of a turn, right after a green light so that his pig mother can get out. Instead of driving 10 feet more so other people don't have to cricle around him. Honestly the only reason I haven't strangled him is beacause it's not worth it. 
6	Useless noises. If a noise is made from a job, no problem. But if it's clicking a pen for no reason, I hate it. 
4	Having to wait on others before I can complete a job.
3	People who have a problem and the solution to it laid out in front of them and don't fucking fix the problem and let it eat away at their life.
2	Technological hiccups, such as lag, button inputs getting eaten, and devices not working as intended.
2	When people speak for me in a conversation.  
1	Heat when trying to fix/solve a probem such as fixing a computer component, that and people hovering over me and getting in my way while working on something.
1	People looking over my shoulder as if I don't understand how to do my job.
5	How do you handle plans falling through on a daily basis?	Make plans with another party and comes time to execute said plans then it falls through 
10	This happens so often that I expect it to happen every time so there’s not a huge disappointment (thanks Ni). One friend in particular did this so often that I literally had to “break up” with him and we had been friends since high school. When plans fall through I tend to just take it easy that night and maybe have a couple beers and throw on a movie. All in all if there are certain people continuously doing it then stop making an effort. And if it’s happening all the time with different people then anticipate it and make a plan b.
5	I rarely make plans more extensive than "do something" and figure out what that something is when necessary.\n\nAs a general rule things only bother me in the current day though, and the next day I've essentially moved on. I would probably stop making plans with said person if this was a continuing thing, because they either can't or don't want to follow through so no real point. I'd then resort to something along the lines of let me know when you want to something and put it in their hands. 
4	That’s one of the things that threw me on MBTI tests. I am punctual.\n\nAfter thinking about this discrepancy it dawned on me: I rarely make appointments.  My plans are spur of the moment. Appointments are rare. It’s easy to keep them, and they are always important appointments. \n\nGetting back to your question, is your question about work not getting done? I ain’t down with schedules, but neither am I down with work not getting done. That is not acceptable.
3	INTP here.  I would also like to know the answer.
2	My plans are usually made same day, I don't really plan things in advance
1	Invite everyone I know that would get along relatively well if put together in a room, and plan on everyone going (although this is rarely the case). I send the invite a week or two in advance, individually, and receive a yes, no, or maybe. Meanwhile, I make a plan for the max number of people that would be going. Two days before the event, I ask for a follow-up. This is usually when people begin to flake by either changing their “maybe” to a “no” (90% of the time) or changing their enthusiastic “Yes! So excited!” to a “heh sorry, something came up”.  This is when I narrow down my “max attendees” plan to better suit the group, this being so that I don’t make too much food or anything like that. \n\nBasically, plan on everyone to go, but do not expect everyone to go.\n\nIt is different and more personal when a friend who was supposed to make plans with you one-on-one cancels. I understand most of the time, but if it happens too much, I’m not gonna waste my time with their flakyness.\n\nI just wish everybody could be like me and stick to their word. A person’s word is very sacred to me, but doesn’t mean much to anyone else these days.
1	I don't make plans.
1	Celebrate with a sigh of relief 
1	People astound me	Sorry guys but I just need to vent. I just saw a video of this girl being burnt alive on the street because of some reason (It's a language I didn't understand). I mean there were grown men and women alike and fucking children watching this girl getting the shit beat out of her and they set her on fire. What the fuck is that man? Why are humans so evil sometimes for serious. It's really fucked up what we can do to each other sometimes. Fucking hell. 
25	Everyone has the capacity to do evil. Even you. Watch some lectures about Nazi prison guards and it will really open your eyes to how situations can affect people and cause this behaviour.
16	Welcome to being unsheltered.\n\nUnfortunately some cultures are toxic and most religions are toxic as well.\n\nPeople are stupid and are easily swayed by their emotions.\nDid I mention people are stupid? 
6	Idk man, there are some people who use a good burning. 
2	Not all culturals are equal 
1	If you got some free time and interest, I would recommend you to read *The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness* by Erich Fromm. It tries to explain what causes evil (both on an individual level and in groups). I enjoyed it; hopefully you'll do it too.
1	Mob mentality, outdated laws, cultist traditions.  Stupid people do stupid things.  My only solution is hiding from them all.
1	I've regretfully seen videos like these when a seemingly innocent person get "eliminated" by a crowd of people and I always find it so inhuman... But it's just human nature shown in lower cultures... Fear, traditions, mob mentality, mix all that and add violence and resentment and it gives you a pretty disgusting result where people don't know what freedom is and reject their anger on a single individual who broke a stupid "law".
1	maybe she deserved it 
1	It's called "Religion" and brings a lot of peace to the world. /s
0	People can do fucked up shit sometimes..\nCould you share the link?
12	Stereotypes	I've seen many posts like this: \n\n"I'm not good at/I don't like (insert here sports, mechanics or any activity related to the ISTP common descriptions), am I not an ISTP?"\n\nI suck at billiards.\nI suck at soccer.\nI know a shit about cars. \nIt took me time to learn how to ride a motorcycle.\nI take a glance at manuals.\nI have an average reaction time.\nI don't do crafts all day.\nI do plan some things in my life.\nI like some books and theories.\nI am spiritual.\nI had good grades.\nI have a professional career.\n\nActually, I would be one of the first people who would die in a zombie apocalypse, because I like food, beer and relaxing. I'm fucking fat.\n\nBut still, I use functions like this: TiSeNiFe. I am an ISTP.\n\n\n\n
17	I want to know why he deleted himself after this post.  But also, “meh”
9	people like to think in black and white
3	[deleted]
1	Do ISTPs not have good grades?
4	ISTP but don't like working with my hands? or different type?	I tested for istp most of the time and answer as honestly as I can to know for sure. The thing is I don't think the istp type fully represents me, although it may be the most accurate. \n\nI DO NOT like working with my hands and figuring out how things work with physical items or engineering. although i do like to figure out hobbies, something like the stock market, more real life problems or maybe call them solutions. more learning about something and mastering it(although sometimes i lose interest) although i can take a situation and dissect it pretty well and i do learn from experience and my mistakes.\n\ni also tend to get kind of into something like say maybe playing a sport (ie looking up equipment to buy) and get into it but loose interest after a while and sometimes maybe never follow through and play it.  \n\nI have also tested for intp, isfp, and intj. the weird thing is that they all kind of sound like me from what i remember but also there were some things that maybe didn't match up. \n\nalso i tested for estp in terms of job types that i may like. and tbh i myself kind of think i am an introverted estp in the way i think but am not sure.\n\nanyone have any insight on what is going on or why this might be? am i an istp?\n\nthanks
19	Dude. I am an ISTP but I am (almost) a speech therapist. I talk with people all day every day and highly prefer working with children. That don't make me not an ISTP. We aren't walking stereotypes
8	stereotypes.\n\n I have never developed an interest in sports. I’m more of a Sherlock Holmes istp than a mechanic istp. I don’t fit the stereotypes either. But I’m confident I am an istp.\n\nI can figure out mechanical problems better than most people, and can do mechanic-ing better than most people, but I’m smart enough to let professionals do my mechanic-ing.\n\nI love a good puzzle that I can sink my teeth into. I also am not keen on working with my hands, probably because I haven’t had much opportunity to do so. Although I have no doubt that if I was in the position of having to learn such a blue collar trade I could learn with ease.
3	[deleted]
5	>more learning something and mastering it (although sometimes i lose interest)\n\nYou’re probably an istp.
1	http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory\n\nI'd recommend you to narrow down at least two functions you're sure you use and then read about the types who share these functions in depth.
1	Dude don't worry about stereotypes. The test is 4 letters, it'd be ridiculous if everyone encompassed the description. I'm pretty similar to you, welcome to the club.
1	I'm an istp who got into sport quite late and can't do physical tinkering for shit. I feel like this ability to solve things is not as much as manual ability as it's an uncanny talent to find patterns and quickly connect dots. An intuitive ability to know how things work and spot a problem where others might not see any, for better or worse.\n\nWe're not walking stereotypes, I'm quote adept at social interaction despite the criteria and I do enjoy socializing and social events, even if I need my me time. I'm still definitely an istp
1	I like working with computers. I love programming, and I like upgrading my PC. Am I working with my hands non stop like a hobby? No. I play video games instead.
1	I'm certainly an ISTP and I don't like working with my hands either.  I am also dyspraxic and female so my spatial awareness is not as great as stereotypically thought, either.  I can however solve problems that are not always obvious to everyone else, and I am incredibly streetsmart.  
6	Kids these days and their "hunches"	I find it extremely annoying when people make judgements about other people who they don't even know. And it's not like I'm outraged and trying to defend the person... I just hate claims with no proof. For instance people saying things like "I feel like so and so judges me, she looks at me weird"... the lack of objective reasoning is painful. I guess this is just general discussion... 
26	Guess what, when you were their age, you were just as annoying as they are. Just in different ways. And the old people were bitching about you the way you are now. \n\n\nIt’s this bullshit cycle of “generations” that doesn’t even really exist. 
9	ISTPs tend to hate Fe users, mainly the unhealthy ENFJs that judge everyone.  \nhttp://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/135002965032/how-functions-work-inferior-fe-istpintp
5	Agreed. Some people do not have tangible proof of their assumptions.\n\nWhen that happens, its best to just let them be. I personally take the words of such people with a handful of salt. \n\nTrying to point it out to them will be met with ABSOLUTE resistance. They are just wired that way as even MBTI evidently supports. \n\nAlso egos and insecurity. A lot of the time it exacerbates these situations.
2	So... my ISTP bf uses Se to "see" traffic patterns. He is a proactive driver; he says I am reactive. I don't "see" the same patterns he does. You could make the same argument that he has a "hunch" about how the cars are behaving around him. It really isn't evidence-based even though there's a high likelihood of a specific outcome if x, y, and z happen in succession. It's projecting pattern-recognition onto what may or _may not_ actually happen, and it helps us avoid possible (not inevitable) collisions.\n\nBelieve it or not, Ne/Fe users (and probably other functions) are also recognizing patterns that _you_ may not "see". Humans pick up on micro-expressions, subtle behavioral cues, and more. Some people are described as "creepy", but it could be impossible to say _exactly_ why. A look in his eye? Her posture? His tone of voice? Those things aren't solid evidence and can't be brought to a court of law, but... if someone creeps me out, I will sure as hell stay away from them. \n\nThat may be an extreme example, but the point is... humans can be read. They are also incredibly well-equipped for social interaction. Body language (etc) isn't exclusive to our species, either. We have billions of years of evolution behind us that have honed certain intuitive traits that have allowed us to survive, create cohesive societies, and spot "invisible" danger... or recognize people we'd just rather avoid.
2	When people claim to know what another is thinking, it is often a symptom of mental illness.
5	Does any older (40+) ISTP's relate to this?	
2	No.
4	Musical instruments?	Do you play instruments?\n\nIf you do, what do you like about it?\n\nDo you also play your own original songs?
5	Bass, six-string, clarinet, piano, autoharp, harmonica, and there's a few I can't think of off the top of my head.\n\nI like to play around with the tones and rhythms, and it's a good practice of coordination. It's somewhat meditative for me.\n\nI tend to improvise or make my own songs, I'll learn something if I need to or really like it but otherwise I couldn't be bothered. I mostly record electronic music at the moment since I don't really have the means to record live instrumentation right now.
3	Yeah, bass guitar.. used to play saxophone in school but only because I was forced to.\n\nIt's fun to play along with songs you already know and enjoy. I've always liked songs with good drums and bass grooves. \n\nNope.
2	Played tuba and trumpet in school. I have an acoustic bass I pluck around on. I'm not good.\n\nI suck at guitar and uke.  My hands aren't meant for it.\n
2	Melodic Percussion (Marimba, Vibraphone, Glockenspiel, Chimes, Timpani, etc.) and Piano. 
2	I can play my armpit and whistle.\nWe got a drummer, bass, and tuba.\nCan anyone sing? Let’s put this show on the road.
2	Is mayonnaise an instrument?
1	Was gonna make a post on this soon because I was also curious haha. \n\nDrums, definitely drums. By the way I play, it is both skillfully and physically challenging, and I like that. You also get more power over the dynamics of the song, which is good if you can sense which areas need builds and the right hits.\n\nI usually play with a church band or do cover songs with my friends when we get the chance.
1	Guitar, I overall like the instrument and I find satisfying to get the songs right when I do, and usually my music is just messing around the neck of the guitar
1	Guitar and bass.
1	I'm a professional flautist. I like it because it's challenging. The sound you make is very enjoyable, motivating. I don't play my own original songs because I don't make any. I have no creativity (weak Ni). Although if I do write songs it's about my tormented consciousness.  \nHere's one of the few songs I've ever composed: https://a.tumblr.com/tumblr_p4e3buofp31x6xnwzo1.mp3
1	Yes. \nGuitar, singing, piano, bass guitar, synthesisers, samplers, etc\nIt’s the only thing that makes sense. \nYes I do. 
1	I've been playing the French Horn for over ten years now, currently with my uni harmonic orchestra. I don't usually make my own stuff, though. 
1	Alto saxophone, can't read music though :/
1	1. I'm still learning Piano\n2. I like the feel and the sound of the piano\n3. It is so difficult for me to play other songs "in fact I don't like to play something that is not mine", I like to make my own music. 
1	Guitar for 13 years, bass on off (quite easy after guitar). Planning to learn drums or piano. I can't play by ear so no original songs, just playing good other songs 
0	Wow. No skin flute jokes. Where am I?
7	Took the Personality test two years ago and got INFP. Took it again yesterday and got ISTP...	Answered all questions truthfully and undoubtedly. Turns out I was just a pussy and I manned the fuck up.
24	You've evolved! 
10	I can relate. I used to get INFP as well, just like my definitely-INFP friend whom I've used to almost exclusively hang out with during adolescence.\nI was insecure, definitely had inf-Fe issues which my friend didn't have at all, and I was never bookwormy like her, just very lazy and sometimes accidentally offensive. When I befriended the INFP I noticed how she got along with everyone and she was innocent and dreamy, so I took that as a reference and half-conciously started mimicking her behaviour.
9	I consistently scored as an INFP in my late adolescence but ever since early adulthood (like 21) I've been a distinct ISTP.\n\nI was definitely insecure and unsure of myself throughout high school which led me to be more dreamlike... especially in comparison to my now actualized and apparent confident, blunt, and practical self.
5	It's weird to me that so many ISTP's lacked confidence when young. I was extremely confident in myself, almost to the point of arrogance (except I was correct about the things I was confident in!).
3	Came put as INTP the first 2 times I did the test. Didn't really fit tbh. Took it a year later and got ISTP and it made a lot more sense to me.
4	Eh, I once scored as infp too. The description wasn't particularly helpful in navigating life, so I ignored it.
3	welcome to the shitbin
2	Hahahaha. I guess it can happen
2	You must be in the Fe grip:\nhttp://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/135002965032/how-functions-work-inferior-fe-istpintp
2	I'm kinda late to the party here, but whatever. I just retested and switched from INFP to ISTP too. I think I was always ISTP, but my first girlfriend whom I met at university told me she didn't think our relationship would work because I was too rational and didn't express any emotions, so I did a 180. After a year, she told me I was too emotionally expressive and sensitive. It's been about 3 months since I politely told her to screw off and completely cut off contact from her, and I'm feeling great again like before I met her.
13	Which subtype of ISTP are you? Logical or Sensing?	**ISTP-Ti** - The logical subtype is self-assured, calm, restrained, correct and impenetrable. At times he may seem arrogant. Sufficiently kind, imperturbable, and unemotional. Very polite and attentive to details in conversation, likes to specify and clarify everything, but sometimes becomes too focused on details that are nonessential to others. Unhurried, perhaps even slow. Likes receiving exhaustively comprehensive and thorough information to his inquiries. Dislikes ambiguity. Internally, he is quite collected. Never loses his spirit and sense of perseverance. Tries to encourage those who are in need of support. Has a direct, motionless gaze that seems to look right through and not at his conversation partner. - [**Full description**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_subtypes)\n\n**ISTP-Se** - The sensory subtype appears more restless in behavior and internally emotional than the logical subtype. May seem somewhat restrained yet also obstinate and stubborn in his views, willing to enter conflicts when his opinions are not honored. Self-controlled and impersonal in his demeanor. Dislikes objections and lengthy explanations. Often watches the actions of others in order to try to assist them or to point out their mistakes. Sometimes in indignation he makes reprimanding remarks, other times he simply completes the task himself or tries to help another person do it better. Flaring up, he can become unduly sharp and absolutist in his statements. Occasionally he tries to amend the situation and smiles with kindness and charm. - [**Full description**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_subtypes)
24	Subtype?\n\nYou see contradictions in those two definitions that can’t both be applicable?\n\nSorry dude.\n\nI choose both.
13	Yes
7	I prefer to use Enneagram type as a subtype system rather than socionics. ISTPs most commonly come in flavors of 5,9 and 8.
4	A little bit more logical than sensing most of the times, when I am absurdly happy I go full sensing, if I am sad or any mood besides happy, I go logical
2	Hmmm when around my family I am the sensing type ,but only with immediate family ( the people that stress me out the most and piss me off the most easily). When I'm outside of the house, like if I'm with my friends or at college I am most certainly the logical type.
2	So basically healthy vs unhealthy?\nI've always been pretty unhealthy but studying personality type has really helped my personal development.
2	This is for the "Ti-ISTj (Ti-LSI)" not the "Si-ISTp (Si-SLI)". This is the link for the SLI :\nhttp://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLI_subtypes
1	More logical than sensing unless I am in the zone in a video game or any other thing that requires my constant attention.
1	Oh so it's about socionics ? I'm more SLI. Socionics and MBTI are different systems.
